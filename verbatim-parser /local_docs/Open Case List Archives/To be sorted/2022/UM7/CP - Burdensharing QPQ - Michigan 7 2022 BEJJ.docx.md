# Burden Sharing QPQ and Entrapment DA

### Notes

This file contains 2 different strategies:

1\. A cp that conditions the plan on European Countries increasing their
defense spending. There are internal (burden sharing good for defense)
and external (entrapment, politics) reasons why that would be beneficial
to unconditionally offering security cooperation

2\. A DA that says that security cooperation overassures allies and
ensures that they will get the US entangled into conflict. This DA
probably is not very strategic with the status quo (because we do
security cooperation with NATO now), but could very easily be paired
with this cp or with a cp that ceases security cooperation with NATO.
Uniqueness for this DA is pretty minimal, but if there is a cp that
provides uniqueness, it could be viable

#### The United States federal government ought condition its defense cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over \[plan area\] on increased alliance contribution ratings from North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states.

#### Conditioning cooperation [increases]{.underline} burden sharing---empirics prove it convinces allies to increase defense spending

Great power patrons frequently reassure allies of their protection,
whether by stationing troops abroad, visiting allied countries, or
making public statements. In the case of the United States, observers
and practitioners alike have emphasized the need to instill confidence
in U.S. allies. However, **[allied reassurance is fundamentally puzzling
because it gives away a key source of bargaining leverage: the threat of
abandonment.]{.underline}** **[Patrons should ideally strive to limit
the extent to which they are perceived as committed to allies, lest they
encourage allies to free-ride on their protection and contribute little
to the common defense]{.underline}**. Existing literature tends to
either treat reassurance as a secondary effect of deterrence, or to
focus on understanding how patrons can reassure their allies rather than
why. Studies that do provide explanations for reassurance, for their
part, often regard **[reassurance as strategically
suboptimal]{.underline}**, and emphasize domestic political factors that
drive reassurance. The causes of reassurance are thus poorly understood.
I argue that although reassurance can have adverse consequences, patrons
have incentives to reassure to the extent that allies have the capacity
to exit the alliance. The more credible an ally's threat to pursue
outside options, and the more costs that doing so would impose on the
patron, the more reassurance it will receive. **[Patrons thus face a
dilemma, trading off between withholding reassurance to drive hard
bargains with allies and reassuring allies to dissuade them from exiting
the alliance]{.underline}**. This dilemma may be mitigated, however, if
a **[patron can make its assurances conditional on allied burden sharing
by combining its assurances with threats of abandonment. These threats
are more potent to the extent that a patron faces domestic pressure to
retrench from its foreign commitments]{.underline}**, and that **[allies
face severe threat environments]{.underline}**. I **[test the theory
using a mixed-method approach that combines statistical analysis of an
original dataset on American reassurance and allied
burden-sharing]{.underline}** between 1950 and 2010 with qualitative
historical case studies. In Chapters 1 and 2, I introduce the concepts
of alliance reassurance and burden-sharing and review the literature on
both concepts. I argue that reassurance is puzzling in light of existing
theories of alliance bargaining which stress the threat of abandonment
as a source of leverage. The "reassurance dilemma" that patrons face,
however, is that withholding reassurance may encourage allies to
distance themselves from the alliance and seek outside options. In
Chapter 3, I present a theory of bargaining leverage in asymmetric
alliances in order to identify the conditions under which this dilemma
is most severe---and thus to explain variation in patron reassurance and
allied burden-sharing. I posit that reassurance serves the purpose of
discouraging allies from leaving the alliance; the more credible allies'
threats of exit, the more reassurance they will receive. However,
**[patrons can make their assurances conditional on allies'
burden-sharing efforts if their own threat of exiting the alliance is
credible as well]{.underline}**. I present a simple formal model
illustrating both the tradeoffs between reassurance and burden-sharing,
as well as the conditions under which patrons are more likely to
reassure and allies are more likely to increase their contributions to
the alliance. I then introduce hypotheses for testing the theory's
observable implications. Chapter 4 presents the quantitative analysis on
the determinants of patron reassurance and allied burden-sharing. First,
using an original dataset of U.S. reassurance collected and analyzed
with automated text analysis, I use statistical models to identify
correlates of U.S. willingness to offer reassurances. Second, I study
allied burden-sharing using data on allies' military spending, support
for U.S. military bases, and participation in U.S. foreign military
interventions. In Chapters 5-8, I conduct case studies on U.S.
reassurance and burden-sharing pressure toward West Germany, Japan,
South Korea, and the United Kingdom during the 1960s and 1970s.
Process-tracing of these cases shows that the United States saw
reassurance as a way of discouraging its allies from pursuing outside
options---in particular nuclear weapons and rapprochement with the
Soviet Union. However, the **[United States was simultaneously able to
extract significant burden-sharing efforts, especially from West Germany
and South Korea owing to their geographic vulnerability, and during the
early 1970s due to doubts about U.S. reliability in the aftermath of the
Vietnam War.]{.underline}** Finally, Chapter 9 concludes with a summary
of the analysis, as well as a discussion of implications and avenues for
future research. My findings suggest that by withholding reassurance and
deliberately casting doubt on its protection, a patron makes its allies
prone to reconsidering their reliance on it and to instead pursue
outside options.

#### Say yes---alliance contribution rating is [politically palatable]{.underline} and encourages effective European defense

**Martin et al. 17**, \*Garret Martin is a Professorial Lecturer at the
School of International Service of American University. He specializes
in transatlantic security, NATO, the European Union and E.U. foreign
policy. \*Balazs Martonffy formerly served as a civilian defense
official in the Hungarian Ministry of Defense, working on NATO policy
and transatlantic security issues. He is currently pursuing his
doctorate in international relations at American University in
Washington, D.C. (May 19th, 2017, "Abandon the 2 Percent Obsession: A
New Rating for Pulling Your Weight in NATO",
https://warontherocks.com/2017/05/abandon-the-2-percent-obsession-a-new-rating-for-pulling-your-weight-in-nato/)

These alternative proposals and metrics are a start, but they present
their own set of problems. Where von der Leyen's idea lacks in
precision, Ischinger's suggestion would downplay the importance of
building adequate military capabilities. Intense political horse-trading
likely played as much as a role as pure military considerations when it
came to choosing the internal metrics, and those do not completely
address all of NATO's core tasks. The input/output metrics remain, in
any case, [essentially classified, aside from a few exceptions like
Denmark](https://nato.usmission.gov/ambassador-lute-on-a-panel-the-cost-of-european-security-at-the-carnegie-endowment-for-international-peace/).
In other words, **[the search for a better metric to replace the 2
percent guideline continues]{.underline}**. From our standpoint, **[any
credible]{.underline}** **[alternative should a) be simple and
intelligible]{.underline}**, **[b) provide a more nuanced assessment of
the contribution of states to NATO's three core tasks]{.underline}**,
**[and c) be politically]{.underline}** **[acceptable]{.underline}**.

Our proposal starts from the assumption that no single metric is
sufficient to capture allied member states' contributions to NATO, and
complex ones, such as
[Ischinger's](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21717391-under-pressure-donald-trump-herbivores-are-thinking-about-eating-meat-europe-starting),
have failed to gather political momentum. **[We suggest]{.underline}**
instead **[a composite metric as a solution]{.underline}**: **[the
Alliance Contribution Rating]{.underline}**. **[This
rating]{.underline}**, similar to the credit assessment used by Moody's
and others in the financial world, **[would provide a differentiated and
nuanced picture of each state's contributions to NATO.]{.underline}**

We argue that **[all three of NATO's core tasks]{.underline}** laid out
in the alliance's current [Strategic
Concept](http://www.nato.int/strategic-concept/pdf/Strat_Concept_web_en.pdf)
--- collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security ---
**[are]{.underline}** "**[mission critical]{.underline}**" **[at any
given moment]{.underline}**. **[Collective defense]{.underline}**,
enshrined in the Washington Treaty's Article 5, encapsulates the idea
that an attack on one member state is an attack on all allies, and
**[remains the cornerstone of NATO]{.underline}**. Another of NATO's
fundamental security tasks, **[crisis management]{.underline}**,
**[involves]{.underline}** political and military **[tools the alliance
employs in response]{.underline}** to a wide range of
**[crises]{.underline}** globally. Finally, the third core task,
**[cooperative security]{.underline}**, **[advocates for the alliance to
take a proactive stance toward]{.underline}** anticipating **[changes in
the international security environment]{.underline}**, working mainly
through partnership programs with other countries and organizations. For
the rating, **[states would receive a grade on]{.underline}** each of
**[NATO's core tasks]{.underline}**, **[ranging from A through
F]{.underline}**, **[with the final rating forming a three-letter
grade.]{.underline}**

This rating system is still a work in progress and one that would need
to be fine-tuned. But we believe that **[this system would be
politically palatable because member states prioritize the three core
tasks]{.underline}** for NATO **[very differently]{.underline}**. As
such, **[individual member states could showcase the part]{.underline}**
of the rating **[they care about]{.underline}**, and hopefully do well
on, **[while]{.underline}** still **[allowing for the broader metric to
be useful]{.underline}** for NATO as an organization. Furthermore,
**[this rating system allows NATO to]{.underline}** clearly **[identify
areas where member states can focus to improve]{.underline}** their
**[contributions]{.underline}** to the alliance. **[This
rating]{.underline}** also **[provides a snapshot in time of alliance
contribution by a specific member state]{.underline}**. If the
priorities of the alliance shift, the indicators used for the ratings
could change, while keeping the rating system consistent.

Each of the three parts of the rating would rely on a number of
independent indicators, some already in use, some novel, to measure
performance for allied member states. These indicators would be then
weighted and combined to form one part of the letter grade for the
rating. The indicators for each of the three core tasks could include
the following:

**[Collective Defense Grade Rating]{.underline}**

**[This]{.underline}** part of the rating **[centers on a member
state's]{.underline}** mainly **[passive contributions to NATO's
collective defense]{.underline}** tasks. **[It measures how much an ally
spends]{.underline}**, **[but also how well they do so]{.underline}**,
because not all defense spending is created equal. In our view,
**[collective defense]{.underline}** contributions **[must reflect an
allied military's robustness]{.underline}**,
**[readiness]{.underline}**, **[and preparedness for the
future]{.underline}**, **[along with]{.underline}** the **[political
will necessary for sustained defense spending]{.underline}**. Even so,
not all spending is captured in the defense budget. Participating in
programs that are central to NATO's defense and deterrence also are
important.

**[Possible indicators we suggest]{.underline}** for this part are:

- **[Percentage of a member state's GDP spent]{.underline}** on defense,

- **[Proportion of defense spending committed to major
  equipment]{.underline}**, including research and development (both of
  these are in line with [NATO's Wales
  Declaration](http://www.nato.int/cps/ic/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm)),
  and

- **[A qualitative assessment]{.underline}** of a member state's passive
  contributions to collective defense, **[including]{.underline}**,
  **[but not limited to]{.underline}**: **[hosting]{.underline}** NATO
  **[bases]{.underline}** or Force Integration Units; **[participating
  in]{.underline}** NATO's **[nuclear deterrence]{.underline}** through
  assets or the nuclear-sharing program; and **[taking part in
  NATO-the-organization's capabilities]{.underline}**, for example
  [NATO's Airborne Early Warning and Control
  Force](http://www.e3a.nato.int/) or the [Alliance Ground Surveillance
  System](http://www.nato.int/cps/sl/natohq/topics_48892.htm).

**[Crisis Management Grade Rating]{.underline}**

In the post-Cold War security environment, **[NATO is no longer only
interested in maintaining a defense deterrent]{.underline}**, as
missions and crisis management form a second and important role the
alliance has taken on. We are attempting to determine to what degree a
member state is capable of taking part in missions if the need arises
along with whether it actually does so, as capacity itself is not the
same as intent and implementation. Moreover,
**[sustaining]{.underline}** these **[alliance]{.underline}**
**[contributions to crisis management]{.underline}** functions **[is
vital as well]{.underline}**, thus our indicators include a control for
time commitment.

**[The indicators we propose]{.underline}** for this core task
**[are]{.underline}** the following:

- **[The ratio of mission-ready]{.underline}**, **[deployable
  assets]{.underline}** that a member state possesses,

- **[The ratio of these]{.underline}** deployable **[assets that are
  actually deployed in NATO missions]{.underline}** (these two metrics
  form part of NATO's internal [input/output
  metrics](http://www.fmn.dk/nyheder/Documents/Input-Output-Metrics-Fact-Sheet-Denmark-2013-14.PDF)
  as land forces/sea vessels/airframes),

- The **[proportion of NATO missions an allied state contributes
  to]{.underline}**, and

- The number of years in total a member state has spent participating in
  NATO missions, accounting for years of membership in the alliance.

**[Cooperative Security Grade Rating]{.underline}**

Finally, NATO does more than deter conflict through passive resource
commitments and manage crises through active mission participation.
**[The alliance is also committed to fostering cooperative security
through actively anticipating changes in the security
environment]{.underline}**. Our **[metrics]{.underline}** here
**[measure individual member states' involvement in inter-NATO
anticipation processes]{.underline}**, such as
**[exercises]{.underline}**, and **[peri-NATO activities]{.underline}**,
**[including confidence and security building]{.underline}** measures.

Our **[proposed metrics are]{.underline}** the following:

- **[Proportion of NATO exercises a member state has taken part
  in]{.underline}**,

- A **[qualitative assessment of]{.underline}** member state **[future
  planning activities]{.underline}**, such as hosting [NATO Centers of
  Excellence](http://www.act.nato.int/centres-of-excellence) and other
  [Allied Command Transformation](http://www.act.nato.int/)
  contributions, **[and]{.underline}**

- A **[qualitative assessment of]{.underline}** member state
  **[contributions to NATO's partnership initiatives]{.underline}**,
  such as the [Istanbul Cooperative
  Initiative](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_52956.htm) or
  the [Partnership for
  Peace](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_50349.htm), or to
  NATO's [defense capacity building
  efforts](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_132756.htm).

It took 18 years for NATO, once it committed to building a new
headquarters, to follow through and complete the project. Let us hope
that **[it will not take so long for NATO to find an alternative to the
2 percent guideline]{.underline}**, **[once it decides to shed that
flawed metric]{.underline}**.

#### That deters war with Russia and China---lack of burden sharing exploits US inability to respond to a two-front war

**Binnendijk et al 22** (Hans Binnendijk, Distinguished Fellow - The
Atlantic Council; Daniel S. Hamilton, Nonresident Senior Fellow -
Foreign Policy, Center on the United States and Europe; Alexander
Vershbow Distinguished Fellow - The Atlantic Council Former NATO Deputy
Secretary General (2012-16), Assistant Secretary of Defense (2009-12)
and US Ambassador to NATO, Russia and South Korea. "Strategic
responsibility: Rebalancing European and trans-Atlantic defense" 6/24/22
<https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strategic-responsibility-rebalancing-european-and-trans-atlantic-defense/>)

Taken together, these developments underscore the need for Europe and
the United States to find a new path forward. **[Europe's long-standing
aspiration to develop more effective ways to act militarily is now
intersecting with the long-standing U.S. aspiration that Europeans
shoulder more of the common burden]{.underline}**. Stated simply, Europe
has wanted autonomy without providing adequate defense resources, while
the United States has wanted greater European defense contributions
without diminishing NATO and U.S. political influence. Now it is time to
unite these two debates and find a new balance for both. As
**[Europe]{.underline}** grapples with new and complex strategic
realities, it **[can no longer afford its excessive reliance on the
United States]{.underline}**, either **[for collective defense
or]{.underline}** for **[crisis management]{.underline}** and
cooperative security missions beyond Europe's borders. **[The U.S. will
have to pay increasing attention to China and limit its involvement in
the wider Middle East]{.underline}**. The United States will therefore
increasingly look to European allies to shoulder more of the common
burden and encourage greater contributions to security by the European
Union.\[8\] Of course, European allies have already shouldered
considerable burdens in the context of the war in Ukraine. They have
been coping with the quickest and largest flow of displaced people in
Europe since World War II. They have ramped up economic assistance to
Ukraine, and are likely to take on the lion's share of the eventual task
of recovery and reconstruction. They are managing an historic effort to
wean themselves off their dependence on Russian energy. Many European
allies have also stepped up their defense investments considerably in
the wake of Russia's renewed aggression, with Germany the most dramatic
example in establishing a special 100 billion euro fund to upgrade its
armed forces and finally committing to meet the 2%-of-GDP goal that
allies set after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. In the
short term, much of these funds are needed to address immediate issues
related to Ukraine or to simply replenish depleted European militaries.
Longer-term, however, these pledges of enhanced spending must be tied to
clear and ambitious goals. Over the next decade, **[the trans-Atlantic
partners must rebalance their relationship so that Europe assumes
greater strategic responsibility]{.underline}**, even as both parties
work to reinforce the trans-Atlantic link. **[Setting the goal of a
rebalanced partnership would move the United States and its European
allies and partners beyond contentious arguments over burden-sharing and
embrace Europe's longstanding ambition to play a larger role in its own
defense]{.underline}**, while **[sidestepping semantic sideshows over
the meaning of "strategic autonomy." Advancing greater European
strategic responsibility starts by defining the concept in a way
designed to strengthen the Atlantic alliance]{.underline}**. **[It
should focus on two military goals: The first should be to enhance the
European allies' conventional military capabilities]{.underline}** to a
level that would provide half of the forces and capabilities, including
the strategic enablers, required for deterrence and collective defense
against major-power aggression. **[Should a conflict simultaneously
break out with China in Asia and Russia in Europe, the United States may
not be able to deploy adequate reinforcements to Europe]{.underline}**.
European allies need to be able to pick up the slack. **[The second goal
should be to develop European capabilities to conduct crisis management
operations]{.underline}** in Europe's neighborhood without today's heavy
reliance on U.S. enablers such as strategic lift, refueling, and C4ISR.
The EU's goal in its Strategic Compass released in March of this year of
developing the capacity to generate an "intervention force" of 5,000
individuals who could deploy beyond EU boundaries is a small yet useful
start. **[Meeting these two goals would allow Europe to become the first
responder to most crises in its neighborhood]{.underline}**, acting
through NATO, through the EU, or through ad hoc coalitions of the
willing. **[It would permit the United States to shift some of its
forces and strategic focus to the Indo-Pacific region without any
significant reduction in the capabilities needed to deter
Russia.]{.underline}** Given Russia's poor initial showing during its
2022 assault on Ukraine, some may believe that Russia is weaker than
expected, that its strength will be sapped by the war, and that stronger
European defense is therefore not needed. This would be a dangerous
conclusion. **[Despite Moscow's missteps, the Russian military will be
able to reconstitute its losses quickly]{.underline}** and learn from
its mistakes. Russian military capabilities remain formidable, and
Moscow has demonstrated repeatedly its intent not only to intervene
militarily in other countries but to weaponize food, energy, digital,
and other flows connecting it to various countries. **[Russia's ongoing
revanchist threat]{.underline}**, and the more robust forward presence
of allied forces being prepared for approval at NATO's June 29-30 Madrid
summit, **[will place increasing demands on all allies for
high-readiness forces]{.underline}**. **[This will add to the urgency of
European allies assuming a greater share of the burden across the
board]{.underline}** --- greater numbers of forces, higher readiness,
and enhanced mobility, all with critical enablers. Finally, one critical
lesson emerging from the war is the importance of sustainability. A
drawn-out conflict will drain and ultimately deplete Ukraine's resources
--- unless it receives ongoing assistance. **[The United States is
carrying the largest sustainability load when it comes to resupplying
Ukraine.]{.underline}** Strategic responsibility must include the
ability not just to be ready and have the mobility to get to the fight,
but to sustain it. Europe is weak here. **[Should the United States be
caught in an Asian war, sustainability would be a critical issue for
European forces, and is thus key to European strategic
responsibility.]{.underline}**

#### NATO countries want AI -- econ and military benefits

pg. 4-5 EZAY

**[3. Military AI and its strategic implications for NATO .
AI]{.underline}** is a **[general purpose technology]{.underline}**,
that is, "**[a single generic technology, recognizable as such over its
whole lifetime, that initially has much scope for improvement and
eventually comes to be widely used, to have many uses, and to have many
\[positive economic\] spillover effects]{.underline}**", see Lipsey,
Carlaw, and Bekar (2005, p.98). **[Like previous general purpose
technologies (such as the steam engine or aviation or computers), AI
holds great promise for enhancing both economic productivity and
military capabilitie]{.underline}**s. As with computing and information
and telecommunications technology (ICT) more broadly, the current
development of AI is dominated by the civilian corporate sector. This
inverts the traditional relationship between state institutions and the
civilian corporate sector: **[technologies that have comparatively
narrow uses or that are quite immature are typically dependent on
extended periods of state support before they may be spun off into
commercial applications.]{.underline}** GPS is a typical example of a
successful traditional transfer from the military to the civilian sector
(Schroeer, 2018). With ICT, and with the current wave of AI, the
**[technology is of general purpose and at a high level of
maturity.]{.underline}** This allows **[for mass production and
diffusion to the civilian sector, indeed internationally, leading to a
strong dominance of civilian private revenues over state and military
revenues in the total sales volumes of leading producers of these
technologies, and ultimately to a dominance of the latter in R&D and
innovation]{.underline}**. As a result, the state sector, including
defence institutions, are dependent on and have to follow the technology
frontier that emerges from the civilian corporate sector to a far
greater degree than is the case with narrower purpose or less mature
technologies (Christie, Buts & Du Bois, 2021). In many respects, **[the
drive to adopt AI can be seen as an opportunity to improve and enhance
capabilities in ways that mirror developments in the civilian
economy]{.underline}** (Fischer, 2021; Sayler, 2019). **[AI-enhanced
software applications already enrich people's lives in direct ways, from
auto-completion of emails to helpful recommendations on social media
platforms.]{.underline}** In the corporate world, a large range of
back-office applications and business function support applications are
already quite well developed. Predictive analytics for business
functions such as maintenance, inventory management, and logistics are
common -- as is the ability to sift through and analyse vast volumes of
data of all kinds, including audio, image, and video data. For defence
institutions, failing to "adapt to adopt" such obviously
efficiency-enhancing opportunities would be difficult to justify in any
international security landscape. In addition, **[the rise of AI is
occurring in a context of revived great power competition. From a global
perspective, China has already overtaken the United States on certain
metrics of economic and industrial power]{.underline}** (O'Rourke,
2021), **[and it is rational to expect that power to translate
increasingly into potential military power and foreign policy
influence]{.underline}** (Kania, 2017). **[From the perspective of
European security, Russia is back on the world stage, with large,
modernised and capable armed forces. Both powers have clearly signaled
that they understand the potential of AI and both are taking active
steps to adopt AI for multiple uses, including defence and
security]{.underline}** (Schmidt et al., 2021; Soare, 2021). Due to its
digital nature, **[AI diffuses extremely rapidly across sectors of
activity as well as across borders]{.underline}**. In practice, it is
difficult to see how any great power in the international system could
prevent other nations, or indeed non-state actors, from adopting AI for
a wide range of purposes, including potentially hostile purposes. This
poses serious challenges for traditional security policy efforts in
areas such as non-proliferation and export controls. From a strategic
perspective, it is also clear that **[every major power faces a strong
incentive to adopt AI rapidly for all purposes, including for defence
and security purposes. This general dynamic is a race of a particular
kind -- not an arms race, since AI is not a type of armament -- but
rather a technology race, or a "technological adoption race", as
expressed by NATO's Head of Innovation]{.underline}** (Murray, 2020).

#### European Countries are pushing for increased AI cooperation

**Arcuri '22** (Gregory Arcuri, Research Assistant at the Renewing
American Innovation Project, "How Is the U.S. Cooperating with Its
European Allies on Issues of Technology?",
<https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/how-us-cooperating-its-european-allies-issues-technology>)
//sethlee

**[Optimism for meaningful cooperation, though, is still
warranted]{.underline}**. The TTC is the most promising forum for
technology and innovation collaboration in recent memory. Launched in
June 2021, the TTC's [explicit
goal](https://www.state.gov/u-s-eu-trade-and-technology-council-ttc/) is
"to lead global, like-minded \[democratic\] partners in promoting an
open, interoperable, secure, and reliable digital space, and to remain
leaders in developing and protecting tomorrow's technology."
**[Importantly, the Council's agenda intentionally avoids topics of
long-standing disagreement and tension between the U.S. and Europe
(so-called "[iron rice
bowls](https://www.csis.org/analysis/meeting-ttc)") which have doomed
previous forums for negotiation, such as agricultural subsidies, the
Boeing-Airbus dispute, and Trump-era steel and aluminum
tariffs.]{.underline}** The Council established ten working groups to
promote high-level dialogue on a variety of issues where collaboration
appears possible, including: Technology standards Climate and green
technology Secure supply chains Information and communications
technology and services security and competitiveness Data governance and
tech platform regulation Misuse of technology threatening security and
human rights Export controls Investment screening Promoting access to
and use of digital technologies among small and medium enterprises
Global trade challenges The Council's first meeting in September 2021
led to a series of notable outcomes on issues where significant
agreement already exists. **[For example, on the issue of the [global
semiconductor
shortage](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/09/29/u-s-eu-trade-and-technology-council-inaugural-joint-statement/),
both sides are committed to "identify\[ing\] gaps in the semiconductor
value chain" and enhancing their respective semiconductor ecosystems.
The U.S. and Europe have already begun taking important steps towards
this shared goal.]{.underline}** Of note, the European Commission has
[drafted legislation](https://optics.org/news/13/2/14) to mobilize over
€43 billion in public and private funds to double its share of the
global semiconductor manufacturing market by 2030. Meanwhile, in the
United States, lawmakers continue to debate the [CHIPS for America
Act](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/chips-america-act-why-it-necessary-and-what-it-does)
and the [FABS
Act](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/fabs-act-essential-component-incentivizing-semiconductor-manufacturing),
which provide lump-sum and tax-based incentives for chip manufacturers
to "onshore" their operations. While these appear to be self-serving
initiatives, the two sides view them as critical to ensuring mutual
resiliency in a critical strategic industry. **[In artificial
intelligence (AI), the U.S. and E.U. affirmed their commitment to
responsibly developing AI which is used in a way that respects
democratic values and universal human rights. The European Union has
already proposed sweeping legislation, known as [the AI
Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/), which would serve as the
first comprehensive law on artificial intelligence use and development
worldwide. While the U.S. has no similar legislation making its way
through Congress, the White House has established [several bilateral
initiatives](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/12/08/white-house-announces-launch-of-the-international-grand-challenges-on-democracy-affirming-technologies-for-the-summit-for-democracy/)

promote "democracy-affirming technologies" and responsible artificial
intelligence]{.underline}** and machine learning. The next TTC meeting
is scheduled for May 15-16, 2022, and this event will be the first
dialogue since the Russian invasion, providing the TTC with a sense of
urgency and seriousness that some analysts suggest might instill a
spirit of compromise. Already on March 25, the President of the European
Commission Ursula von der Leyen released [a joint
statement](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_22_2043)
with President Biden announcing "an agreement in principle on a new
framework for transatlantic data flows," an agreement that the TTC will
likely be tasked with fleshing out. Kenneth Propp with the Atlantic
Council argues that this could mean a [softening of Europe's
position](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/europe-should-take-aim-at-its-true-data-threat-russia/)
on the issue of data privacy, acknowledging that the biggest threat to
European data security is Russia, not U.S. tech companies. This could
represent a significant breakthrough in cooperation on an issue where
the two sides have struggled to find common ground, possibly heralding a
wave of collaborative activity across a variety of other domains as
well. Putin's wanton aggression in Ukraine has united a previously
fractured Western world in a way that appeared impossible just months
ago. The May meeting of the TTC provides a chance to build upon previous
points of compromise. **[The United States and its European allies have
a remarkable opportunity to harness the current political momentum to
forge cooperation in securing their shared leadership in the
technologies of the future.]{.underline}**

### 2NC Say Yes---Carrot---Want SC Over Cyber

#### European Leaders want SC over cyber BUT burden sharing is key

//sethlee

**["We are committed to cooperating closely with NATO," EU leaders
stated]{.underline}** in a joint summit declaration, **[reiterating
their intention to strengthen the EU's partnership with NATO and work
closely with the new US President Joe Biden.]{.underline}** According to
a senior EU official, EU and NATO leaders in the meeting reiterated that
"EU-NATO cooperation is of strategic importance" **[on areas such as
reinforcing capabilities, military mobility, cybersecurity and hybrid
threats as well as challenges in the immediate
neighbourhood.]{.underline}** NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg
joined the video summit to lay emphasis on cooperation in the face of
worries from some member states that the EU's push could undermine the
US-backed alliance as President Biden is looking to rebuild it. **["I'm
totally convinced that the new Biden administration offers a unique
opportunity to renew the strong alliance between Europe and the United
States,"]{.underline}** European Council President Charles Michel said
ahead of the talks. **["A strong partnership requires strong partners --
that's why I'm convinced that a stronger EU is a stronger NATO," he
added.]{.underline}** "We share very much the same population, the same
members and the same neighbourhood and the same challenges," said
Stoltenberg, speaking alongside Michell. He added that this
**[cooperation]{.underline}** had already reached "an unprecedented
level" in the past few years an**[d could be expanded further in areas
such as cyber threats, climate change and migration
issues.]{.underline}** However, the conflict over Cyprus remains one of
the main stumbling blocks towards closer cooperation between the two
institutions. **[EU leaders stressed that their aim is to reaffirm the
goal of "increasing the EU's capacity to act autonomously" in
defence]{.underline}** and that "in the face of increased global
instability**[, the EU must take on more responsibility for its
security."]{.underline}** Debate has raged for decades over what role EU
institutions should play on defence, while confusion remains what the
word "strategic autonomy" actually means in practice. Security and
defence policies remain largely in the hands of member states, which
have often been reluctant to agree on moves to integrate military
capabilities at European level and transfer competencies in the policy
field. "Security and defence will be kept under regular review by the
European Council," EU leaders pointed out, what can be seen as a
reaffirmation of their intention to keep capitals' grip on the policy
area. France, in particular, has been the most vocal proponent of the
bloc's push for "strategic autonomy", arguing that a resurgent Russia
and China and former US President Donald Trump's threats to withdraw
security guarantees from Europe over defence spending show Europe has to
be able to stand alone. However, initial signals from Washington have
already indicated that Biden's government is also likely to make demands
on the Europeans to make a greater contribution to their own security.
Senior EU officials admit the push for European autonomy has worried
some in the bloc -- especially Eastern European and Baltic states -- who
look towards NATO as a bulwark against a more aggressive Moscow. "The
capacity for the EU to act in a more autonomous way unnerves member
states on the front line against Russia because they fear a
disengagement from NATO," one official said. R&D and new threats **["We
need to continue reinforcing European military
capabilities,]{.underline}** under the European Defence Union. Because
the global technological race is on and I want Europe to lead," European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters. **[EU leaders
said they want to focus on a 'drive-by' Europe to better protect itself
from cyberattacks, and ask Brussels to come up with a roadmap on the
development of strategic technologies.]{.underline}**

and a [raging fight to control the online
narrative](https://www.politico.eu/article/ukraine-russia-disinformation-propaganda/)
have shaped the war since its start in February. Now, **[NATO leaders
want to set out a plan to win the war for tech supremacy and cyber
defenses in the long run]{.underline}**. The defense alliance meets
Wednesday to Thursday for a summit in Madrid and will present a
"Strategic Concept" for how it plans to protect the bloc from threats
and attacks for the next few years, including in cyberspace. According
to several officials who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity
because talks are ongoing, that strategy would include: --- Ways to
directly involve the private-sector cybersecurity industry in NATO's
responses to Russian hacking groups and security services, including by
setting up a platform to share cyberattack information and intelligence;
--- Funding of over a \$1 billion to go into emerging technologies like
quantum computing, artificial intelligence and space tech, including
through a "transatlantic DARPA" called the [Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North
Atlantic](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_194587.htm), or DIANA,
and through a new investment fund that will go toward "deep tech and
startups" on defense technology; --- And setting up virtual joint
cybersecurity teams to deploy in the event of a large-scale cyberattack
and to go into member countries to help protect networks. **["The
Strategic Concept quite clearly puts cyber also into the context of
Russia as a threat to allies' security, and that cyber is one of the
means it uses to threaten our partners," a NATO official said, adding
that the text of the strategy is still to be finalized.]{.underline}**
Ukraine has been under "a nonstop attack, on government services, on
military command-and-control, on regular internet and internet
communication," the official said. "The fact that they weren\'t
successful in knocking it all out doesn\'t mean they didn\'t try." The
[last iteration of the Strategic
Concept](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_publications/20120214_strategic-concept-2010-eng.pdf)
was agreed upon in 2010, and only touched on cyber, stressing the need
for NATO countries to increase cooperation and coordination to face
evolving cyber threats. Since then, the new version of the document,
which lays out threats to NATO and strategies to address these concerns,
is certain to include language on cyber deterrence. Following a summit
in Brussels last year, NATO [endorsed a new cyber defense
policy](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185000.htm) that
recognized that a major cyberattack against a member state would be
considered an attack against all on a "case-by-case basis."
Cybersecurity coordinators for NATO nations met in Brussels last month
for a special cyber session of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Anne
Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber
and emerging technology, **[at the time
[reiterated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/05/21/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-adrienne-watson-on-deputy-national-security-advisor-anne-neubergers-travel-to-brussels/)
the need for better coordination among NATO countries to confront cyber
threats.]{.underline}** In the days leading up to the summit, NATO
member Lithuania [faced a
barrage](https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-hackers-killnet-attack-lithuania-over-kaliningrad-sanction/)
of distributed denial-of-service attacks from pro-Kremlin hacktivist
group Killnet, which brought down some government websites by sending an
excess of internet traffic to their servers. **[To counter the online
threat coming from Russia, the alliance wants to set up a "more
structured relationship between the civilian and the military world,"
the official said.]{.underline}** Ahead of and in the wake of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, U.S. and Western government services and
cybersecurity giants like Microsoft were heavily involved in the
response to Russian cyberattacks, with Microsoft engineers in Washington
state detecting the first cyberattack launched against Ukraine well
before any Russian tanks crossed the border. "How they can bring \[the\]
industry together to do threat-monitoring and awareness and possibly
even advise on responses for cyber defense will definitely be a
multiplier effect," said Fabrice Pothier, chief executive officer of
consultancy Rasmussen Global, which was founded by former NATO
Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen. "Cyber is so privatized now,
you need to bring the big players together," Pothier said. Kenneth
Lasoen, a specialist on security and intelligence at Clingendael
Institute, said NATO members could form a consortium to negotiate
support with private companies on offensive strategies --- something the
alliance has suggested [in the
past](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2019/02/12/natos-role-in-cyberspace/index.html).
**["More countries are looking into bolstering their cyber
capabilities]{.underline}**, and a lot of the companies helping them are
based in the U.S.," said Lasoen. **["Of course, it would be advisable
for the EU to have its own know-how, but for now it is in the
U.S."]{.underline}**

**[Vulnerabilities and threats considering multidimensional challenges
such as cyber-security require NATO to be truly, strategically and
operationally agile]{.underline}**. It **[requires NATO to be
adaptable]{.underline}** to conditions unforeseen. Considering
**[tech]{.underline}**nological **[advancements]{.underline}**, **[we
are yet to acquaint]{.underline}** ourselves, our **[institutions,
governments, and international organizations]{.underline}** with true
phenomena of a new, yet networked global society. In this borderless
society, where electric grids, information, or installations failures
may have in the past solely affect a country, now affect a region and
possibly a larger area. Our abilities are limitless to point out
challenges and face them. We also have the ability to **[innovate
through methodological approaches and security cooperation utilizing the
constant upgrade of technology]{.underline}**. However, when decisions
come to being, this may not be easy. Lack of sound and constant decision
making may affect global financial systems and social structures.
Current financial situations in regions and areas, such as in the
Balkans or South of Europe, like Greece, Italy, and Portugal among
others, affect the larger European Union as a community of union states.
Conflict areas, such as Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan, do surely provide
the impetus for NATO's direct involvement and or cooperation with
external allies, yet does not seem to positively affect leadership in
taking decisions that are so much needed for the benefit of security
resilience and business continuity. Humanitarian issues, such as the
refugee issue and the fear of mass illegal migration, deriving from
current wars in Syria, Iraq, and other areas such as Afghanistan, affect
countries, giving rise to suspicion on cooperative effectiveness,
participation in defense against threats and challenges. Even more so,
when a global society is e-wired, in which education, training, health
but also security are part of this "grid," the threats and challenges
are greater. In this new virtual world of things, where the internet has
managed to innovate, eliminate, distances and borders but also time,
**[NATO should be set to comply with the new "global rules and standards
of operational business-minded and political efficiency."
It]{.underline}** should **[create agile and limitless policies,
security basic and specialized military and civilian
installation]{.underline}** if NATO is to continue to be a crisis
management institution.

/alundy\]

Throughout NATO's history, **[defense innovation has been critical to
its technological edge and]{.underline}** its **[deterrence and defense
posture against]{.underline}** multiple **[threats]{.underline}**. The
unprecedented progress in **[emerging]{.underline}** and disruptive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (EDTs) **[offers the prospect and
challenge of transformative defense innovation]{.underline}** for allied
armed forces and societies at large. Technological **[progress
in]{.underline}** artificial intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) and
machine learning, advanced robotics, **[biotechnologies
and]{.underline}** human enhancement, quantum technologies, big-data
analytics, and fifth-generation telecommunication systems, as well as
**[growing autonomy in]{.underline}** the **[critical
functions]{.underline}** of military systems, promise to change how wars
are fought, how fast, where, and by whom. These technologies enable new
forms of military presence, coercive action, and power projection in and
across old and new domains (for example, cyberspace and outer space) and
below and above the conventional threshold of armed conflict.

However, **[NATO and]{.underline}** the transatlantic **[allies are
neither the only nor the most agile actors investing in
emerging]{.underline}** and disruptive **[tech]{.underline}**nologies.
**[China and Russia]{.underline}** already **[invest
substantially]{.underline}** in **[and have accelerated their adoption
of these technologies]{.underline}** in military applications. **[To
maintain its strategic advantage]{.underline}** against China and
Russia, **[NATO needs to become an agent of innovation and be more agile
and strategic in supporting allies to jointly exploit new technologies
for deterrence, defense, and resilience purposes]{.underline}**. NATO
has prioritized EDTs and signaled it has joined "the technological
adoption race" against China and Russia.^1^ **[Much work remains to be
done]{.underline}**. Allies remain divided on the ethical and legal
specifics of the military use of EDTs and by their national-industrial
preferences. Technological capacity across the alliance also varies
significantly and, as always, funding is in short supply. Concrete
decisions on how to consolidate innovation in EDTs, a critical task for
NATO's mission and future adaptation, are expected at this month's
Brussels summit. Specifically, allies will respond to calls for a
"strategic surge" in EDTs^2^ innovation by establishing a Defense
Innovation Accelerator, an opt-in instrument funded through dedicated
national contributions, which NATO hopes will incentivize innovation and
transatlantic cooperation on emerging technologies.^3^

As **[NATO]{.underline}** prepares to embark on the adoption of emerging
and disruptive technologies, this brief takes stock of its ongoing
efforts in this field. It **[examines]{.underline}** **[what drives the
alliance's efforts to exploit EDTs for defense innovation and what it
would take for NATO to become an innovator]{.underline}** in an
environment of unprecedented technological progress and great-power
competition. NATO's ongoing efforts in innovation and EDTs are a step in
the right direction. However, **[to survive in a world of multipolar
great-power competition and deliver security to its members, it needs to
innovate, not just to adapt incrementally.]{.underline}**

### 2NC Say Yes---Carrot---AT: Not Big Enough

#### Security Cooperation provides [sufficient]{.underline} leverage

**Tecott 21**, PhD in Political Science @ MIT (Rachel, "The Cult of the
Persuasive: The U.S. Military's Aversion to Coercion in Security
Assistance," Proquest Dissertations)

\*SFA = "Security Force Assistance"

**[Recipients are more likely to follow U.S. direction when the United
States combines teaching]{.underline}** and persuasion
**[with]{.underline}** **[bargaining]{.underline}** and/or direct
command. **[Bargaining is well suited to the context of]{.underline}**
**[SFA]{.underline}**. Bargaining is in a sense a much simpler, less
ambitious influence strategy than persuasion. This study argues that
**[the United States has ample bargaining power in most cases of
security assistance, and is therefore well-positioned to wield carrots
and sticks to shape recipient decision-making]{.underline}**. Bargaining
power, in Glenn Snyder's framework, varies as a function of the 54 two
sides' relative dependence, commitment, and interest in the object of
bargaining.59 Lumpy (each variable could be further subdivided into many
constituent pieces), subjective, and consequently hard to measure as
those variables are, the argument that recipients of United States SFA,
particularly in the context of severe internal threats, have more
bargaining power than the United States, does not hold up to scrutiny.
**[Recipients of SFA]{.underline}** may not always depend for their
survival on the United States, but they **[are]{.underline}** almost
**[always far more dependent on the United States than the United States
is on them]{.underline}**. With respect to relative commitment, SFA
recipients often view the U.S. commitment to an SFA partnership, or to
the leaders themselves, as fickle. In such cases, **[the United States'
relative lack of commitment should be a bargaining asset, because it
should help increase the credibility of its threats to withdraw
support]{.underline}** or to replace the leadership. Moreover,
**[is]{.underline}** as **[conducive to]{.underline}** the establishment
of **[credibility with respect to promises of carrots and threats of
sticks]{.underline}** as any international partnership can be. Providers
need not rely on the nuclear threats of complete support or total
abandonment. Rather, **[SFA]{.underline}** **[relationships create
myriad opportunities for the application of calibrated carrots ranging
from]{.underline}** the provision of additional ammunition to a
particular unit, to **[a dramatic increase in the scale of U.S.
assistance]{.underline}** to the recipient military as a whole, **[and
calibrated sticks ranging from]{.underline}** the disbanding of a
particular unit, to **[a dramatic decrease in assistance]{.underline}**,
to the ouster of the civilian leader. **[SFA]{.underline}**
**[relationships are also typically long-term,]{.underline}** and
involve iterated interactions between provider and recipient. **[There
is, therefore, an extended shadow of the future]{.underline}**,60 and
opportunities for the United States to demonstrate the credibility of
its promises and threats through consistent follow-through. These two
features of **[SFA]{.underline}** **[relationships]{.underline}**---the
opportunities for calibrated carrots and sticks, and the shadow of the
future---**[should]{.underline}** **[help to resolve the credibility
problem that plagues, for instance, the challenge of extended nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}**. In the context of SFA, **[threats to decrease
support]{.underline}** to a unit **[or increase support]{.underline}**
to a unit, or even to support or oust a civilian leader, **[are far less
difficult than the challenge the United States faced in its efforts to
convince the Soviet Union that it would trade New York for
Paris]{.underline}**. SFA is the United States trying to convince
brigade commanders that their interests are better served following U.S.
direction to remove a corrupt battalion commander than ignoring that
direction. It may not be an easy task, but **[the United States
certainly has the carrots]{.underline}** and sticks **[to do
it]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** the context of
**[SFA]{.underline}** **[is more conducive than most]{.underline}**

#### Making support [conditional]{.underline} is [more likely]{.underline} to induce states to join US-led efforts

\*\*PhD in Political Science @ Ohio State ("Keeping Your Friends Close,
but Acquaintances Closer: Why Weakly Allied States Make Committed
Coalition Partners," *Journal of Conflict Resolution*, 65.5)//BB

**[Because alliance membership is a club good, not a pure public good,
worries about being excluded from the security benefits of an alliance
can incentivize a state to try to shore up the alliance by sending
a]{.underline}** costly **[signal of their commitment to their alliance
partners]{.underline}**. "**[Today, we should expect the European allies
to]{.underline}** find that the best way to **[strengthen]{.underline}**
(or avoid weakening) **[their bonds with the United
States]{.underline}** is to contribute to out-of-area operations like
ISAF. According to this line of reasoning, the allies who put the
highest premium on NATO's traditional products should be the
ones---together with the United States---shouldering the heaviest
burdens in Afghanistan" (Ringsmose 2010, 331). Yet the Afghanistan case
demonstrates **[this is not just a story about club goods in formal
alliances, but security cooperation more generally]{.underline}**.
**[States may]{.underline}** use war efforts as a **[signal of their
willingness to accept large costs in the hopes that this will improve
their relationship with the coalition leader in the
future]{.underline}**. States use conflicts that are not of immediate
strategic importance to--- hopefully---gain the attention and respect of
important international players. **[Closer alignments may be valued
inherently, for unspecified reasons, or to help the state acquire side
payments or policy concessions on unrelated issues]{.underline}**. Henke
(2019a) argues that **[states]{.underline}**
**[contribute]{.underline}** to coalition conflicts **[when the "pivotal
state"]{.underline}**--- **[what we call the coalition
leader]{.underline}**---**[provides]{.underline}** side **[payments as
incentives to contribute]{.underline}**. This highlights our broader
logic about variation in club goods and public goods in alliances and
coalitions. States contribute to coalition warfare when there are
benefits to contributing troops that fall outside the traditionally
understood alliance mandates or security concerns. In US-led conflicts
since the Korean War, Henke (2019a) find that future benefits offered by
pivotal states can induce coalition participation. We extend upon this
finding by arguing that **[states]{.underline}** with unrealized
alliance potential are most likely to be moved by that logic.
Furthermore, they **[will go above and beyond]{.underline}** in their
coalition participation **[to try to secure future
benefits]{.underline}**--- **[whether side payments or unrelated
payments]{.underline}**---**[that extend from a closer relationship with
the coalition leader]{.underline}**.

The **[Trump administration has threatened NATO allies to the point that
they fear the United States may withdraw from the organization or not
fulfill its obligations to Article V unless the allies meet the
objective of spending two percent of their GDP on defense. [Past
administrations](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/04/politics/trump-us-presidents-nato-defense-spending/index.html) have
called for NATO allies to contribute more to the alliance for
decades]{.underline}**. However, they have never called into question
the US commitment to Europe. **[Yet, this pressure has forced the
European allies to start taking greater ownership of their
security]{.underline}** at the cost of warm relations with the United
States as seen through [allied leader's
statements](https://www.rferl.org/a/france-says-eu-should-not-rely-us-military-defense-reach-out-russia/29456958.html).

**[In order to pressure allies, the United States has to send costly
signals, such as withdrawing troops from Europe, to demonstrate that
their security interests have diverged. This political pressure acts as
a forceful method to motivate NATO allies to do more because it provides
a credible threat of exclusion from the benefits of US
protection.]{.underline}** Within NATO, **[only the United States
maintains and controls the conventional and nuclear capacity to deter
and defend against existential threats to the alliance.]{.underline}**
No other ally has the expeditionary military capacity to do so. For
example, Estonia is not worried about being abandoned by Romania,
Portugal, or
even [Germany](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/08/09/why-germanys-army-is-in-a-bad-state),
knowing none of them could bring a sizable military force to bear in
response to a Russian invasion or fait accompli. In this case, Estonia's
chief concern revolves around the United States' guarantee of their
sovereignty through NATO. Suppose the United States can make credible
claims that it is willing to abandon an ally and not fulfill its treaty
obligations. In that case, the ally will experience a drastic incentive
to increase its military capabilities to defend itself.

outcomes, but some disunity within an alliance can yield positive
results. [Several

paradoxical conclusion that **[a decline in the amity, unity, and
community of interest among allies need not necessarily reduce the
effectiveness of an alliance]{.underline}**..." and "The United States,
at least, should perhaps not hope for too much unity in common ventures
with other nations. It might prove extremely expensive."

allows the smaller allies to free-ride to some extent."

#### NATO has shown willingness to increase burden sharing but [continued US pressure]{.underline} is key to actualize spending increases

The **[Russian invasion of Ukraine has finally motivated European
leaders to say they'll spend more on defense, but promises are the easy
part]{.underline}**. One task for President Biden at this week's NATO
summit will be pushing the Europeans to be specific about how much
they'll spend and what they'll buy. **[European Union heads of state or
government]{.underline}** said in a March 11 declaration that "**[we
must resolutely invest more and better in defence
capabilities."]{.underline}** After a two-day meeting, the leaders vowed
to **["increase substantially defence expenditures" and "invest further
in the capabilities necessary to conduct the full range of
missions."]{.underline}** European **[NATO allies and Canada increased
defense spending overall]{.underline}** for six years through 2020,
**[but many still don't hit NATO's commitment to contribute 2% of gross
domestic product to defense. This target should be a floor, not a
ceiling, given the Russian threat.]{.underline}** Germany, **[Europe's
biggest economy and its most notorious defense free rider, has led the
charge to change.]{.underline}** Berlin hadn't spent more than 2% of GDP
on defense since the end of the Cold War, but Chancellor Olaf Scholz
said last month his country will meet its commitment from now on. And
it's starting with a €100 billion down payment. **[Smaller countries are
stepping up too. Poland, which already meets the NATO target, recently
passed a law increasing defense spending to at least 3% of GDP in
2023.]{.underline}** Frontline nations Romania, Latvia and Lithuania
have publicly set clear goals or passed legislation to boost military
budgets. **[Yet too much of Europe has only vaguely promised to do
more.]{.underline}** French President Emmanuel Macron said this month
that Paris would increase spending because of Vladimir Putin's invasion,
but without precise numbers. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said
the war is "an incentive to invest more in defense than we have ever
done before" but it's unclear how far Rome will go. Spain, which barely
spends above 1% of GDP on its military, has vowed to hit 2% but hasn't
said when. Countries have different political pressures and processes,
and some may be quietly studying what's feasible. **[But Mr. Biden can
encourage his European counterparts to step up like Mr. Scholz and set
the terms of debate in their own countries. Germany showed it's possible
to hit NATO's modest spending goals immediately, and there's no reason
for others to phase in spending over long stretches.]{.underline}** It's
also important to ensure inflation doesn't wipe out the gains. The U.K.
approved spending increases in 2020 and 2021, but with rising prices the
budget in real terms could decline in 2023 and 2024. It's also easy to
spend money on items labeled "defense" that don't really enhance a
country's security. **[As a defensive alliance, NATO is primarily
concerned with defending Europe and perhaps some counterterrorism
missions. Ukraine has offered a useful template of how to defend from a
Russian attack. Every NATO country should be competent with the basic
tools to resist an invasion.]{.underline}** That means a ready arsenal
of tanks, helicopters, fighter jets and other heavy equipment. As the
Ukrainians have shown, antitank and short-range air-defense systems are
highly effective. Drones and loitering munitions, even relatively
low-tech, are critical to success on the modern battlefield. Europeans
can also invest more in the sophisticated coastal- and air-defense
systems and long-range precision fires that Ukraine wishes it had now.
The danger is that two of Mr. Macron's fixations---industrial policy and
"strategic autonomy"---could collide to make Europe less safe. There
should be an emphasis on divesting from Soviet-era equipment, such as
MiG jets and air defense systems, and replacing them with European and
American systems. As Ukraine is showing, a mix of U.S., European and
Turkish platforms can work well together to make life difficult for
Russians. But Europeans will have to avoid the temptation to invest in
lesser products out of solidarity. **[Europe doing more for its own
defense is good news, but the U.S. has more to do as well. On top of
nudging the Europeans in the right direction]{.underline}**, major
increases to American defense spending are essential and would set the
right example.

### 2NC Say Yes---Stick---Reputation

#### Conditioning solves and states say yes---reputational costs and threat perceptions

Joel R. **Hillison 14**, professor of National Security Studies at the
U.S. Army War College and an Adjunct Professor at Gettysburg College,
November 2014, "Stepping Up: Burden Sharing by NATO\'s Newest Members,"
<https://publications.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/2306.pdf>, RH

**[The collective action literature suggests that freeriding behavior is
likely to increase as organizations increase their
membership.]{.underline}** Article 10 of the NATO treaty provides
modalities for new members to join the Alliance.11 During the Cold War,
NATO expanded from 12 original members to 16 members over a 40 plus-year
period. After the fall of the Soviet Union, **[NATO expanded from 16
members in 1998 to 28 members by 2009. While all members face incentives
to free-ride, these incentives increase as the size of the organization
increases.]{.underline}** In the absence of a commonly identified
threat, **[the rational incentives to free-ride are even more
pronounced.]{.underline}**

A salient characteristic of NATO enlargement is that all of the new
members are smaller than either the United States or the Big Four
European members, (Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), France, and Italy).
The logic of collective action suggests that larger, more powerful
states bear a greater proportion of the costs in producing a public
good.12 Therefore, **[the new members would be expected to free-ride in
relative contributions to the Alliance. However, free-riding by smaller
states has not been the case. Something other than collective action
theory is required to explain this phenomenon]{.underline}**. As
expected, **[the capability and willingness to share burdens varies from
the largest European NATO members]{.underline}** (in terms of population
and geography) **[to the smallest.]{.underline}** Likewise, **[burden
sharing]{.underline}**, as a percentage of the gross domestic product
(GDP), **[varies based on the level of national economic
output.]{.underline}** However, the sharing of risks, as measured by
military commitments to NATO operations, less closely follows the
collective action model. When national interests more closely aligned
with Alliance-wide goals, **[NATO members were more willing to increase
their contributions.]{.underline}**

This analysis of burden sharing behavior also revealed that **[new NATO
members demonstrate a greater willingness to bear the burdens of the
Alliance than older members,]{.underline}** all things being equal.
Consequently, free-riding behavior increased with the length of
membership in NATO. **[When states' reputations were on the line, they
were more willing to share the burdens of the Alliance.]{.underline}**13
In addition, **[though many of these new members still view Russia as a
potential threat and thus favor a greater focus on territorial
defense]{.underline}**, their level of military spending was not
correlated to Russian military spending. These same nations also
contributed their best equipped and most combat ready units to NATO
missions in such places as Afghanistan.

These phenomena can be attributed to two explanations. First, **[new
members are concerned with establishing a good reputation, not only
within the Alliance, but also with the leader of the Alliance, the
United States.]{.underline}** By providing troops to NATO missions, new
members demonstrate their ability to make credible commitments. **[By
demonstrating their loyalty to the United States and the NATO Alliance,
they hope to compensate for their historic fear of
abandonment]{.underline}**. The other explanation is that **[NATO has
invested a great deal of effort into socializing new members and
partners on Alliance norms of burden sharing.]{.underline}** Thus, it is
not surprising that new members explain troop contributions in terms of
appropriate behavior for Alliance members, rather than in terms of
rational, self-interest.

Finally, this book examines burden sharing behavior in the aftermath of
NATO enlargement. The logic of collective action suggests that
free-riding behavior should have increased due to the increase in the
number of members. However, the actual record is mixed. **[Even though
NATO expanded its scope and membership significantly, all NATO members
are contributing, to some extent, to the various on-going Alliance
missions]{.underline}**. In explaining this result, this work provides a
contribution to the extensive literature on burden sharing.

**[Another plausible rational explanation of burden sharing behavior by
new member states is that their calculations are conditioned by their
history]{.underline}**. Most of the new member states of NATO were
previously occupied by Soviet troops following World War II. These
former Warsaw Pact countries consequently fear that Russia might try to
reassert itself in their affairs. **[These states also have an historic
and deep seated fear of abandonment by the West.]{.underline}**
Certainly, there is a historic legacy in states such as the Czech
Republic, whose sovereignty was sacrificed to appeasement policies prior
to World War II; and Poland, which was left alone to face the onslaught
of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, despite existing security
assurances from France and the United Kingdom (UK). States such as
Hungary and the Czech Republic also suffered military interventions by
the Soviet Union in 1956 and 1968, respectively. With their unique
history, this explanation is less applicable to Albania and Croatia,
since these states were outside of the Warsaw Pact. **[Given this
history, new member states would feel threatened by a weakened NATO or a
reduced U.S. presence in NATO.]{.underline}** Thus, there is some merit
to the rationalist argument that **[these states retain a fear of
abandonment and act accordingly]{.underline}**.28 Glenn Snyder's work on
security dilemmas in alliances demonstrated that states' interests might
converge over a fear of abandonment.29 Therefore, new NATO members might
support out of area Alliance operations, even in the absence of
intrinsic national interests. In any case, **[the fear of abandonment,
combined with a pursuit of credibility and side payments, all represent
plausible explanations for norm complying behavior]{.underline}**.
However, as Alastair Johnston points out, "the presence of strategic
behavior does not undermine the possibility of persuasion," nor does it
rule out the impact of socialization.30

### 2NC Say Yes---Stick---Populist Fears

#### The cp leverages burden sharing against populist fears---ensures say yes

<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-12-03/fear-trumps-populism-might-save-american-alliances>)

The United States that President-elect Joe Biden will inherit on January
20 faces a crisis of credibility. After four years of erratic behavior
by President Donald Trump's administration, the **[international
community]{.underline}** widely **[views the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as an unreliable
power]{.underline}**. Even many of Washington's closest and
longest-standing allies no longer believe they can count on U.S.
diplomatic or military support. **[Biden cannot]{.underline}** easily
**[undo]{.underline}** **[this damage]{.underline}** to U.S.
credibility. **[But he can make]{.underline}** U.S.
**[alliances]{.underline}** and security relationships **[more
resilient]{.underline}**. Paradoxically, **[Trump has made this task
easier]{.underline}** for the incoming president. **[His
rise]{.underline}** **[to power]{.underline}**
**[revealed]{.underline}** that issues such as collective defense
spending and **[burden sharing]{.underline}**---long sticking points in
transatlantic relations---**[can inflame populist
sentiments]{.underline}** **[and thereby threaten long-standing
alliances]{.underline}**. The **[Biden administration should use that
threat]{.underline}**, **[and the prospect of another Trump-like
populist, to build more equitable security relationships]{.underline}**.
After all, countries such as France, Germany, Australia, and South Korea
face a dangerous and uncertain future if U.S. security arrangements
continue to deteriorate. More than 73 million Americans voted to reelect
Trump. That number should serve as a powerful reminder to U.S. partners
around the globe that the American system of alliances and security
relationships is always just one election away from collapse. **[Biden
must persuade]{.underline}** these **[partners to contribute
more]{.underline}** to their alliance with the United States---**[or
else risk a resurgence of American populism that would leave them
vulnerable and exposed in the long run]{.underline}**. LEMONS OUT OF
LEMONADE One lesson of the Trump years is that friction over burden
sharing, especially defense spending, presents a genuine threat to
transatlantic relations. In 2006 and again in 2014, NATO members
committed to spending two percent of their GDP on military capabilities,
but less than half of them have hit that target. On the campaign trail
in 2016, Trump railed against the failure of NATO allies to meet their
spending obligations, even going so far as to question whether the
United States would defend them in the event of a Russian attack. Once
in office, he continued to harp on NATO allies' spending shortfalls in
order to pressure them to increase their military budgets and to help
defray U.S. expenditures. He made similar demands of long-standing
allies in Asia, supposedly in exchange for the presence of U.S. forces.
This heavy-handed approach not only strained core U.S. alliances but
underscored the fact that without real change on the part of U.S.
allies, these relationships could become embroiled in U.S. electoral
politics. According to a poll released by the Pew Research Center, by
2017 almost half of Americans thought NATO wasn't doing enough to solve
global problems. **[This issue]{.underline}** **[is unlikely to go away
anytime soon]{.underline}**. **[Biden will need to
convince]{.underline}** major democratic **[allies such as France and
Germany to]{.underline}** **[make significant progress]{.underline}**
**[toward]{.underline}** bringing their defense
**[budgets]{.underline}** in line with established commitments.
**[Although some U.S. allies will doubtless protest or continue to drag
their feet, the Biden administration has considerable
leverage]{.underline}**. Unlike, say, Pakistan, liberal democratic
**[partners don't want to turn to Russia or China]{.underline}** for
security guarantees. **[Nor are they close to being able to go it alone.
Biden can make U.S. alliances and security relationships more
resilient.]{.underline}** This precarious position means that European
allies should be willing to take the lead in buoying the Biden
administration from day one. The long-standing pattern of **[partners
shirking]{.underline}** their defense-spending
**[responsibilities]{.underline}**---one week telling U.S. officials it
would be most effective to pressure them publicly, the next week
insisting that private persuasion is preferable---**[needs to come to an
end]{.underline}**. Berlin's recent offer of a "new deal" on burden
sharing, in which Germany would markedly increase its spending, enabling
it to lead overseas military operations without the United States, along
with its recent decision to crack down on Chinese telecommunications
firm Huawei amounts to a strong start. But Biden needs to persuade
Germany to go further: canceling the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline linking
Russia and Europe and fully harmonizing Berlin's positions on Russia and
China with those in Washington would be productive next steps. Biden
should also press France to increase its defense spending to meet or
exceed NATO's two percent threshold and to sharpen its condemnation of
Russian aggression in Ukraine, support for reactionary populists, and
efforts to subvert Western democracies. In exchange, Biden can offer
European allies full support for closer U.S.-EU ties, much greater
transatlantic cooperation, and U.S. backing for an independent EU
military headquarters that would closely coordinate with NATO. Given
that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already called for
significant increases in military spending since the U.S. election,
Biden's approach to the United Kingdom should be slightly different and
calibrated to temper that country's populist surge. Brexit has damaged
the country's economy and international standing, and its fallout
presents a threat to U.S. and European interests. Biden should make
clear there will be no "special relationship"---and certainly no
preferential trade agreement---unless London agrees to a Brexit
arrangement that preserves the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern
Ireland and keeps the United Kingdom closely tied to the rest of Europe.
Although democratic treaty allies in Asia generally don't shirk their
military burdens in the way European states often do, the Biden
administration should still look for some early wins in the Pacific.
Agreements on subsidies for U.S military bases in Japan and South Korea
would be a good place to start. The Biden administration should also
stress that deteriorating relations between both countries are not
helpful when it comes to justifying the U.S. presence in Northeast Asia.
TRUMP-PROOF These initiatives in Europe and Asia should be part of a
broader Biden administration effort to "Trump-proof" its entire alliance
network. That this system survived the past four years at all is a
testament to the importance of institutionalized ties between ministries
and departments worldwide. Even as Trump threatened to abandon U.S.
allies, U.S. military and civilian officials continued to cooperate with
their counterparts overseas. These professional networks made it
difficult for Trump to quickly end U.S. security commitments and likely
saved many other agreements as well. As part of this broader plan, the
United States needs to strengthen and enhance intergovernmental
relationships, especially with European allies. NATO should further
develop its civilian capabilities so that the alliance can effectively
hand off postconflict reconstruction and stabilization missions to the
EU. In turn, the latter should finally establish its own modest yet
fully deployable military force to deal with security crises closer to
home. Germany and France, in particular, could spearhead this process as
part of their offer to overhaul and reinvigorate the transatlantic
relationship. **[Without rapid progress, the U.S. alliance network will
remain vulnerable to another populist wave.]{.underline}** The United
States and its European allies should also make a point of holding
increasingly frequent joint military exercises and air-policing patrols
that involve more equipment and personnel. At the same time, they should
expand the number of U.S. and allied troop rotations in central Europe
and dramatically increase the number of U.S. officials seconded to NATO
and EU political and military headquarters. Doing so would strengthen
connections between allied policymakers and refocus U.S. attention on
Europe. In the Indo-Pacific, the Biden administration should push for
more multilateral joint military exercises with regional allies, with an
eye toward building stronger military and diplomatic relationships, akin
to those that exist in Europe. On this front, Trump largely left
Australia to fend for itself when it came to China. Now, Biden should
push for Canberra to play an important role in Trump-proofing Asian
alliances and for the governing Liberal-National Coalition to tackle its
own right-populist streak. Australia, along with U.S. allies such as
Japan and South Korea, will likely support greater cooperation
immediately, and these efforts can provide a basis for expanding
strategic engagement with India and other players currently outside the
U.S. alliance system. Finally, Biden's first overseas trip should be to
Brussels for an unprecedented joint EU-NATO summit in the spring. He
should follow that with a trip to Tokyo in the fall for a meeting with
democratic Asian allies and a subsequent final joint summit that would
include both European and Pacific partners in early 2022. In the past,
the United States has preferred to maintain distance between its two
sets of allies. Now, though, economic integration, global security
challenges, and common membership in the U.S. security system make such
an approach increasingly anachronistic. **[THE NEXT SHOCK Without
measurable, public, and rapid progress over the next four years, the
U.S. alliance network, especially in western Europe, will remain
vulnerable to another populist wave]{.underline}**. Trump-proofing these
alliances and partnerships will require even more of U.S. partners than
they likely realize. In an ironic twist, the fate of the U.S. security
system will turn as much on how U.S. allies respond to the Biden
administration as on how the Biden administration itself behaves. Early
overtures to the Biden administration suggest that **[U.S. democratic
allies]{.underline}**, especially **[in Europe, understand that
returning to the status quo will mean risking another populist
shock]{.underline}**---**[one that could finally break the
system]{.underline}**. **[This means that Biden will have significant
leverage in negotiations to overhaul long-standing
relationships.]{.underline}** Although **[Trump's "America
first]{.underline}**" approach left the world a more dangerous place,
its repercussions fell disproportionately on U.S. partners, not on the
United States itself. This **[gives the leadership of countries such as
France and Germany an incentive to demonstrate that a more cooperative
approach can succeed where Trump's combative one failed.]{.underline}**
Old habits die hard, however. If democratic allies drift into
complacency, the Biden administration will need to remind them that
nothing less than the survival of U.S. security guarantees is at
stake---not because Biden fails to see their value but because the next
U.S. president might not.

Hans Binnendijk explored the problem of free riding within NATO from an
historical standpoint. Binnendijk reviewed the pros and cons of spending
within the alliance since its inception, and he discussed how **[the

in the past.]{.underline}** He concluded that recent **[Russian

**[increased pressure could]{.underline}**, in turn, **[coerce European
allies to commit more to defense spending and effectively lessen the
burden being placed on the U.S.]{.underline}** Binnendijk also went
through multiple policy proposals that would help initiate this
pressure, and he also delved into how each facet would help to equalize
burden sharing. Part of Binnendijk's broader argument is that European
NATO is changing because new geo-political considerations have become
more important since the fall of the Soviet Union (Binnendijk 2016).

### 2NC Say Yes---Stick---Hedging

#### Allies are more likely to hedge than realign\-\--Europe [needs America]{.underline}. 

**Shapiro 18**, Director of Research at the European Council on Foreign
Relations, (Jeremy, May 15th, 2018, "Why Trump Can Safely Ignore
Europe",
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2018-05-15/why-trump-can-safely-ignore-europe)

THEY NEED IT MORE

The simple answer is that **[Europeans need the alliance more than the
Americans do]{.underline}**. For Europe, **[the]{.underline}**
transatlantic **[alliance is its rock of stability in an]{.underline}**
otherwise **[ever-changing world]{.underline}** and the foundation on
which it has constructed [European security and European
integration](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-11-30/europes-readiness-problem).
Shared values and interests, much more so than with authoritarian powers
such as Russia and China, also drive the bond.

The United States does value the transatlantic alliance. It wants help
on international security issues such as Afghanistan or Syria, and U.S.
officials certainly enjoy proclaiming that the United States leads the
world. But the reality is that the United States doesn't need the
European alliance for its own security. As Trump has implied many times,
the United States can simply walk away from the relationship.

In theory, Europeans could simply band together and provide for their
own security.  Combined, they have as much economic weight and military
power as the United States and far more than any of their potential
rivals, including Russia. **[In practice]{.underline}**,
**[they]{.underline}** still **[prefer relying on the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[for their security
rather than relying on one another.]{.underline}**

The United States, after all, is a distant power with only a passing
interest in the internal affairs of Europe. EU countries, by contrast,
are deeply involved in one another's affairs---they have multiple
internal disputes that range from how to deal with their common currency
to how to manage immigration. **[They look to their relationship with
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[not simply for
security from external threats]{.underline}** such as Russia or
terrorism **[but also for a potential ally in]{.underline}** their
**[internal disputes with other EU states]{.underline}**. Surveys by the
European Council on Foreign Relations show that at least 11 European
governments believe they have a "special relationship" with the United
States that gives them advantages they can't get from their European
partners.

In Greece, for example, policymakers look to Washington for protection
not from Russia or terrorism but from [Germany's stringent economic
policies](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/greece/2015-01-25/so-long-austerity).
In Poland, the government's distrust of the EU and other European
nations, especially Germany, is palpable even as Warsaw relies on them
for economic support. The Polish government does not want to increase
its dependence by relying on its EU partners for protection from Russia
as well. Its relationship with the United States is, in part, a
diversification strategy.

In short, **[Europeans]{.underline}**, **[working
together]{.underline}**, **[could provide for their own
security]{.underline}** from external threats. **[The problem is that
they also want political protection from one another.]{.underline}**
**[And only the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[can
provide that]{.underline}**.

This **[asymmetric dependence]{.underline}** lies at the [heart of the
alliance](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-03-05/world-after-trump)
and **[means that so far Europeans have had to make]{.underline}** their
**[peace with]{.underline}** the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration.
Yes, European leaders frequently resort to rhetorical broadsides aimed
at Trump's numerous sins. Merkel told a campaign audience nearly a year
ago that the United States could no longer be relied upon and that "it
was time for Europe to take its fate in its own hands." French President
Emmanuel Macron recently took Trump to task on climate change in front
of the U.S. Congress. But beyond these principled stands, **[they have
done precious little to counter Trump]{.underline}**.

**[When it comes to NATO defense spending]{.underline}**, as with any

### 2NC Say Yes---Stick---Empirics 

#### [threats are good]{.underline}\-\--trust history\-\--[best]{.underline} European defense spending efforts have [empirically tailed]{.underline} threats of abandonment. 

**Glaser 17**, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute.
His research interests include grand strategy, U.S. foreign policy in
the Middle East, the rise of China, and the role of status and prestige
motivations in international politics, (John, February 8th, 2017,
"Encouraging NATO Burden Sharing: What Works?",
https://www.cato.org/blog/nato-burden-sharing?queryID=97dfb598d2a4e01f4ad80dde059b0c82)

President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** has repeatedly
**[complained]{.underline}** that **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[carries too much of the]{.underline}**
economic and military **[burden in NATO]{.underline}**. **[He
has]{.underline}** even **[gone so far as to]{.underline}** call the
European alliance
"[obsolete](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/16/politics/donald-trump-times-bild-interview-takeaways/)"
and to **[suggest]{.underline}** that **[his administration might not
fulfill]{.underline}** the treaty's **[Article
5]{.underline}** obligation that commits NATO countries to come to the
defense of any member that is attacked (Note: administration officials
have repeatedly sought to reassure NATO allies that we remain committed
to the collective defense of Europe, and Trump has contradicted himself
on this score).

**[Many think this provocative rhetoric is]{.underline}** just **[a ploy
to get our NATO allies]{.underline}**, **[who habitually underspend on
defense and free‐​ride on America's security guarantees]{.underline}**,
**[to pay more of their fair share of the burden]{.underline}**. At the
Washington Post's Monkey Cage blog, **[Andrea Gilli argues
this]{.underline}** approach **[is unlikely to jolt NATO allies into
spending more on defense]{.underline}**, though. Among other reasons,
most **[NATO allies]{.underline}** "**[face]{.underline}** financial and
political **[constraints to increasing military
expenditure]{.underline}**" in part **[because]{.underline}** U.S.
security **[assurances]{.underline}** "**[have freed up]{.underline}**
state **[funds]{.underline}** in Europe **[for other
priorities]{.underline}**, including a robust system of social
services." And since cutting welfare benefits is typically a political
non‐​starter, we shouldn't necessarily expect NATO countries to boost
defense spending due to Trump's abrasive rhetoric.

But **[the historical record seems to contradict Gilli's
argument]{.underline}**. According to the [RAND
Corporation](http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1200/RR1210/RAND_RR1210.pdf),
**[Europe has]{.underline}** historically **[spent between 43 percent
and 78 percent of U.S. spending on defense]{.underline}**. **[The ratio
reached its peak in 1980]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** then
**[again in 2000]{.underline}** --- **[years that were at the tail end
of periods of defense budget cuts.]{.underline}** And according to the
RAND report, **[one of the the most successful techniques in getting
NATO allies to share more of the burden was]{.underline}**
"**[threats]{.underline}** by Congress **[to withdraw its
troops]{.underline}** from Europe."

The only period of signficant real growth in European defense spending
was during the 1970s; otherwise European defense expenditure has been
remarkably flat in real terms...

Historically, **[efforts to create incentives or to manage the
burden‐​sharing problem have taken four different
approaches]{.underline}**. The first approach (1966 to the mid‐​1980s)
was based on the threat of U.S. troop withdrawals. With a series of
resolutions and amendments from 1966 to 1975, Senator Mike Mansfield
sought to use the threat of U.S. troop withdrawals to force Europe to
contribute more and to lessen U.S. costs. As noted, that effort---plus
other factors relating to economic growth and the Soviet threat---may
have had a positive effect: European defense spending grew by 44 percent
between 1970 and 1984.

Certainly other factors contributed to this period of growth in NATO
burden sharing --- higher rates of economic growth, increased
perceptions of the Soviet threat, defense budget cuts as we withdrew
from Vietnam, etc. But **[U.S. threats to pare back its commitment to
the region seem to have had a significant impact]{.underline}**.

President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** has **[criticized NATO members

new," he said pointing to the Washington Treaty --- the organization's

### 2NC S---Interoperability

#### Conditioning on interoperability solves

Ross and **Dalton 20**, Tommy Ross, non-resident senior associate at the

Strategic and International Studies, ("A ROADMAP FOR BETTER CHOICES FROM
SECURITY PARTNERS," *War on the Rocks*,
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/01/a-roadmap-for-better-choices-from-security-partners/>)

**[Some will object that]{.underline}** this approach and the
obligations it implies for both U.S. planners and foreign counterparts
are unrealistic, and that such **[obligations attached to U.S.
assistance could drive partners to alternative security providers. In
our experience, many U.S. partners not only want to work with the United
States as their security partner of choice but are also motivated by a
desire to improve]{.underline}** the **[effectiveness]{.underline}** and
governability of their own security sectors. Yet, it is also important
to acknowledge that this approach will unquestionably require more
diplomatic engagement by senior policymakers to achieve and sustain
partner buy-in. That is both necessary and appropriate.
**[Security]{.underline}** sector **[assistance]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}** a **[fundamentally]{.underline}**
**[political]{.underline}** activity. **[It should be buttressed by
engagement between political stakeholders on both sides to
identify]{.underline}** political objectives,
**[requirements]{.underline}**, and obstacles **[in relation to an
assistance program]{.underline}**. Indeed, the lack of this type of
persistent political dialogue is a prominent cause of many security
sector assistance failures. Looking Ahead **[Incentivizing security
partners' progress toward common outcomes and objectives will enable the
United States to get more out of its security]{.underline}** sector
**[assistance investments]{.underline}**. **[Such an approach will be
vital to building strong, accountable, and interoperable partnerships
globally]{.underline}**. It may be particularly important in fragile
states, where security sector assistance may otherwise inadvertently
fuel predatory behavior by security actors. While political realities
will inevitably disrupt routine plans, and policymakers will demand
instant or tangible "deliverables," such as lethal assistance, **[the
only remedy to mitigate against unintended consequences is to
institutionalize a]{.underline}** smart, **[incentives-based planning
framework with]{.underline}** continuous **[opportunities
for]{.underline}** adaptation and **[adjustment]{.underline}**. The
United States will need to pilot this approach to experiment and
fine-tune a viable framework. This in turn will require bipartisan
support in the U.S. Congress for the security sector assistance
enterprise to "fail forward" on a pathway to success. Several indicators
suggest that **[Congress is ready to move in this
direction]{.underline}**. In recent years, it has passed **[several
bills]{.underline}** --- most notably the Fiscal Year 2017 National
Defense Authorization Act and the Foreign Aid Transparency and
Accountability Act of 2016 --- that **[have established]{.underline}**
important **[foundations for positive conditionality]{.underline}**,
**[including]{.underline}** mandates for assessment, monitoring, and
**[evaluation of foreign military assistance]{.underline}**, more
flexible planning horizons for Defense Department assistance, and
tighter collaboration between the Defense and State Departments in
planning and implementing military aid. **[A new legislative
initiative]{.underline}**, the pending Department of State Authorization
Act of 2019, would take several additional steps forward. Recently
passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee with strong bipartisan
support, the bill **[would create several new tools supporting positive
conditionality]{.underline}**, including strengthening assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation of military assistance, authorizing "Security
Assistance Compacts" similar to the bilateral compacts discussed above,
and bolstering planning processes to achieve greater strategic focus and
prioritization in U.S. assistance. Passage of this legislation would
represent a watershed moment for U.S. security sector assistance,
particularly aid provided by the Department of State. **[The urgency of
adopting a new, more strategic approach to security assistance is
growing by the day. American partnerships are under increasing pressure
from declining resources]{.underline}**, **[domestic isolationist
trends, and]{.underline}** strategic **[competition]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, the range of global security challenges for which the United
States turns to partners to contribute grows in diversity and
complexity. **[Positive conditionality offers policymakers, diplomats,
and operators a tool to shape partners' behaviors in a manner that
offers an opportunity to produce greater return on American
investments]{.underline}**, simultaneously **[strengthening
partnerships]{.underline}** **[and growing global capacity to deter,
prevent, and respond to crises and conflict]{.underline}**.

**[Australia has a long-established relationship in intelligence
cooperation through the five-eyes UKUSA relationship, where
interoperability is effectively seamless and information exchange is
deep and routine.]{.underline}** **[The result of that cooperation is a
very effective burden sharing arrangement]{.underline}**, with various
of the partners taking primary responsibility for their part of the
world, **[resulting in a global capability in which the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts.]{.underline}** Such a cooperative arrangement
**[also means that there is a collective surge capability in the case of
major events]{.underline}**--- the response to the terrorist attacks of
September 2001 being a good example. To make this happen, the
intelligence relationship has a variety of mechanisms that facilitate
cooperation, including regular personnel exchange, the sharing of
technologies and techniques and common data and encryption standards for
moving information around. This is a useful example for thinking about
the benefits of interoperability in the 'traditional' military
domains---the same basic ideas apply. For example, if partner nations
have platform systems that can communicate securely to share situational
awareness data, then the overall surveillance and reconnaissance
capability of all of them is improved. Effectiveness is improved. In
today's resource constrained world, efficiency is also important. There
are at least two aspects to that. First, having the confidence that a
partner has the capability to look after a designated task (or area)
while providing accurate data across a shared net allows for a division
of labour, the same way that the intelligence world is 'carved up'.
Second, **[with the increasing cost of military platforms and their
support arrangements, economies of scale become ever more
important.]{.underline}** For the larger partner, sales of equipment to
allies and friends amortises costs over larger production runs. For the
smaller partners, the can avoid the increasingly prohibitive R&D costs
and still acquire highend equipment. **[The notion of burden
sharing]{.underline}** also translates across. At least since the
articulation of the Nixon/Guam doctrine in 1969, the United States
**[has made it clear that, while the United States will honour its
alliance commitments, its partners and allies also have a responsibility
for providing for their own defence.]{.underline}** That means in
practice that they will field defence forces that are at least locally
capable, even if they lack the long range power projection capabilities
the United States operates. In many cases, this gives them the ability
to take responsibility for security activities in their local region.

### 2NC S---Cohesion/Alliances 

#### If we win say yes, it proves: 1. The cp solves the aff's internal links to alliance cohesion- that's sufficient to solve their impacts 2. The cp doesn't collapse the alliance because Allies are willing to increase burden sharing

#### Effective burden-sharing creates a durable US political commitment to alliances

The critics have a point. The reality is, **[the U.S. government has few
mechanisms to reliably track how its security assistance dollars are
performing in terms of]{.underline}** return on investment for meeting
strategic and **[policy goals]{.underline}**. There have been a number
of steps taken in the last three years to start to change that, through
executive and legislative branch action. However, **[even the most
ardent supporters of alliances and partnerships must acknowledge that
the return on security assistance is often lower than it could
be]{.underline}**. **[More than merely wasting taxpayers' dollars, this
damages U.S. credibility and reinforces the belief that maintaining
alliances and partnerships is simply not worth the costs
involved]{.underline}**. We firmly believe **[security assistance should
remain a critical pillar of U.S. statecraft]{.underline}**. We also
believe **[the United States could get a better rate of return on some
of these programs by changing the way it conditions
assistance]{.underline}**. **[Changing the way the United States
conditions assistance could change that for the better.]{.underline}**
This will not solve the problem of how to optimize our relationships
with other countries---there is no silver bullet for that---but **[it
would help the United States get more bang for its buck. This is a
sentiment that should appeal]{.underline}** to the dealmaker-in-chief.

#### Burden sharing [sustains]{.underline} the alliance---equity is key

**Keating 22** (Dave, American-European journalist writing for the World
Politics Review, "NATO Finds a New Sense of Purpose in an Old Mission"
6/30/22
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/trend-lines/30648/to-counter-russia-nato-gets-back-to-basics>)

NATO leaders gathered this week at a summit in Madrid to adopt a New
Strategic Concept, a framework that sets out the alliance's core
priorities for the next decade. But the Madrid gathering was in other
ways historic, ushering in further expansion of the alliance after
Turkey lifted its veto of Sweden's and Finland's membership bids. The
U.S. also pledged to deploy more troops, warplanes and naval vessels as
part of the alliance's largest military buildup since the Cold War, in
response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The ramifications of the
summit will be most obvious on NATO's eastern flank, with the
announcement of a new, permanent headquarters in Poland and the
bolstering of rotational deployments to the Baltic states. **[The
dizzying details of NATO's buildup in Europe mark a remarkable
turnaround for an alliance that looked listless and even near collapse
just a few years ago, when]{.underline}** former U.S. President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** **[raised doubts about Washington's commitment
to NATO and French President Emmanuel Macron declared it
"braindead.]{.underline}**" Over the past few years, many expected the
new strategic concept to pivot away from NATO's original focus on
defending Europe against Russia and instead turn the alliance's sights
on China and international terrorism. There was also considerable talk
of building a European Defense Union that would give Washington's
European allies the autonomous capability to defend themselves without
U.S. assistance. **[Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}** on Feb.
24 **[changed all that, making it clear that in practical terms,
Washington's security umbrella is the only real defense option Europe
has at this time]{.underline}**. **[In the span of a few months, NATO
went from being considered a Cold War relic badly in need of a reboot to
being an essential collective defense alliance that must double down on
its original intent]{.underline}**. The New Strategic Concept adopted
yesterday by NATO leaders mentions Russia 17 times. By comparison, it
mentions China 10 times and terrorism seven times, while Afghanistan is
mentioned only once. The last strategic concept, signed in 2010 in the
presence of then-Russian President Dimitry Medvedev, referred to Russia
as a "strategic partner." Fast forward 12 years, and the new strategic
concept has reclassified Russia as a major threat to world peace. As for
China, it is deemed a source of "systemic challenges" with which the
alliance "remain\[s\] open to constructive engagement," as some alliance
members objected to labeling it a "threat." **[Nevertheless, the
newfound enthusiasm for NATO will not paper over difficult
realities]{.underline}** that the war in Ukraine has done nothing to
ameliorate. **[European leaders appear to know that Biden's Atlanticism
is more likely a blip for Washington than a "return to normal," as Trump
or someone just as skeptical of U.S. security commitments like NATO
could win the presidency in 2024]{.underline}**. Former Trump aides have
said he planned to withdraw the U.S. from NATO had he won reelection to
a second term in office. For their part, Western European leaders were
keen to stress at the Madrid summit that proposals for an autonomous
European defense are not being abandoned, nor are they meant to compete
with NATO. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen noted that
NATO will become "more European" with the accession of Finland and
Sweden into the alliance. If their bids are successful, only four EU
member states will not also be members of the alliance: Ireland, Austria
and Malta, all of which have longstanding positions of neutrality, and
Cyprus, because of Turkey's veto. **[The EU's eastern
members]{.underline}**, however, **[remain wary of an autonomous
European defense mechanism for fear that it will undermine
NATO]{.underline}**. **[They were likely reassured by this week's
summit]{.underline}**, **[which gave new impetus to getting NATO back to
its core mission of countering Russian aggression]{.underline}**. **[For
those who harbor the]{.underline}** long-term **[ambition of creating an
equitable alliance]{.underline}**, **[rather than one that effectively
functions as a U.S. protectorate, more work on European defense will be
needed]{.underline}**.

#### Without comprehensive burden sharing, politics within the alliance [fails.]{.underline}

**Kivimaki, 19** \[Timo Kivimaki, 2-13-2019, professor of International
Relations and Director of Research at University of Bath, European
Security, Volume 28, 'Power, Contribution, and Dependence in NATO Burden
Sharing',

/alundy\]

One of **[the key theme]{.underline}**s **[of NATO
Summits]{.underline}** in recent years **[has been the question of
burden sharing]{.underline}** in Western
defence.[^1^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750) Are
**[US allies paying their fair share towards common
security]{.underline}**? Some scholars feel that **[clarity on the
fairness of contributions is necessary for the efficiency of any
cooperation]{.underline}**
(Tyler [2003](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)),
while others claim that too much emphasis on distributional issues can
hamper efficiency in the production of Western security (Cooper and
Zycher [1989](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750),
p. 7,
Kreps [2010](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)).
These two positions are not necessarily contradictory, as **[clear
principles on burden sharing could be a condition for effective defence
and focus on common security rather than on divisive internal
discussions on distribution]{.underline}**. The focus on distribution
issues may well lead to internal divisions
(Techau [2015](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)),
but **[it is the lack of clarity that causes both the focus and the
friction]{.underline}**, and thus, **[without clarity]{.underline}** in
the alliance, **[politics cannot be efficient]{.underline}**.

#### Sharing the burden is a critical feature of successful cohesion and interoperability.

**Dufour, 18** \[Martin Dufour, Colonel in the Canadian Army, currently
working with NATO, 12-10-2018, NATO Defense College,
<https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1239>/alundy\]

**[Cohesion]{.underline}**, often mentioned as the Alliance's center of
gravity, **[lies at the heart of NATO's success]{.underline}**.
**[Underwriting this cohesion is the ability of member states to share
the burden of producing military capabilities]{.underline}** to service
the whole, **[and the burden of conducting operational
missions.]{.underline}** To do this successfully, **[members have to be
able to undertake military actions in concert with each other in a fully
coordinated, and as much as possible integrated manner]{.underline}**.
**[This is]{.underline}** referred to as
**[interoperability]{.underline}**, defined as "the ability of systems,
units or forces to provide services to, and accept services from other
systems, units or forces and to the use the services so exchanged to
enable them to operate effectively together".1 This definition implies
that there are several layers to interoperability which need to be
addressed to ensure forces are able to operate together effectively in a
military context. These include technical features permitting systems to
physically connect to one another and exchange information; and the
alignment of procedures and processes to allow military personnel to
function within the same space and achieve common goals without
fratricide. It also implies that this takes place at various levels of
operation, from tactical to strategic. **[A high level of
interoperability allows allies to effectively exchange intelligence and
information, cooperatively plan complex military operations, and conduct
integrated missions with fully exchangeable force
packages]{.underline}**.

### 2NC S---AT: Domestic Politics

#### Public opinion is [malleable]{.underline} and shaped by threat perception, domestic preferences for social spending is [overstated]{.underline}, and overriding national elites is the [key variable]{.underline}. 

**Schilde et al. 19**, \*Kaija E. Schilde is an Associate Professor at

Public opinion, permissive consensus, and EU defence policy, European
Security,28:2, 153-172, DOI: 10.1080/09662839.2019.1617275)

Indeed, **[there may be an intuitive logic to]{.underline}** EU
**[defence]{.underline}**--**[particularly with regard to]{.underline}**
pooling and **[sharing defence burdens]{.underline}**--**[that resonates
amongst the public with little persuasion]{.underline}**. In recent
history, Europe might well have been turning inward, losing its foreign
policy influence, and diminishing its role in security and defence.
However, these developments cannot be understood as driven by popular
opinion. **[A better explanation for stagnation]{.underline}** in
defence integration **[might be that national elites]{.underline}**,
**[such as defence bureaucrats]{.underline}** and or protected national
industries, **[benefit from the status quo.]{.underline}**

An additional implication emerges: it is possible that **[Europeans may
be more supportive of the use of force]{.underline}** at the European
than the national level. Negative preferences on the use of force and
interventions may be capturing low levels of support for national
military interventions. Conventional wisdom assumes that individuals
support national defence over collective defence, stretching negative
opinion results on intervention to the logic of defence cooperation.
**[While their states spend less on defence than the US]{.underline}**,
it appears that **[most Europeans are not content with the status
quo]{.underline}**, nor have they become used to spending less on the
military as a matter of principle. **[Europeans are not so exceptional
when it comes to defence]{.underline}** preferences. Also, **[the idea
that Europeans]{.underline}** inherently **[prefer butter to
guns]{.underline}**--**[allowing the US to subsidise their
security]{.underline}** with no concerns--**[appears shaky at
best]{.underline}**.

This study has clarified the nature of individual support for EU
defence, but it has not yet identified the conditions under which
individuals support integration. In order to identify more granular
determinants of individual support for EU defence, we propose
sub-sequent experimental surveys on the topic. We suggest two additional
mechanisms at work for future research that are mutually constitutive.
The first is that there may be a latent European identification amongst
the European public supportive of EU defence. It may not be
well-captured by extant public opinion polls, because those questions
have historically framed European identity as either layered with
national identity or contrasted with it (i.e. are you European,
national, or both?).

The second is that this **[proto-European identity may be activated and
driven by threats]{.underline}** from outside of Europe. There are
**[certain kinds of threats]{.underline}**--of many origins but from
outside of Europe--that may **[provoke a default support]{.underline}**
**[for a common European security]{.underline}** and defence policy.
**[Perceived threats may take different forms]{.underline}**, **[from
competition with the US]{.underline}**, reactions to immigrants,
instability outside Europe, or Russian geopolitical developments. If
true, **[this could help explain why support for]{.underline}** EU

driven by a succession of threats]{.underline}**--from different sources
at different points in time--**[that create logical preferences
prioritising European security]{.underline}** responses and solutions.
We propose testing these additional hypotheses of identity and external
threats in future research designs.

**[In a May 2017 visit to]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**) headquarters, U.S. President
Donald **[Trump declined to affirm his support of NATO's Article
5]{.underline}**, **[which obligates its members to come to each others'
defense.4 Indeed, this was no accident]{.underline}**; in his speech,
Trump deliberately removed a passage expressing his support for Article
5.5 U.S. allies -- as well as members of Trump's own administration --
were taken aback, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel arguing that it
was time for Europeans to "really take our fate into our own hands."6 In
the wake of the uproar surrounding Trump's speech -- and his treatment
of allies more generally -- **[one question that has largely been
neglected is why one should even expect the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to reassure its
allies in the first place. Indeed, reassurance is fundamentally
puzzling]{.underline}** **[because it surrenders a key source of
bargaining power]{.underline}**: **[the threat of
abandonment]{.underline}**. **[Bargaining leverage within an alliance
depends on the credibility of states' threats to abandon their partners,
and thus great power patrons should limit the extent to which they are
perceived as committed to their allies]{.underline}** (Snyder, 1997;
Jervis, 1997: ch. 5; Crawford, 2003).7 **[Reassurance
measures]{.underline}**, however, **[are intended to have exactly the
opposite effect.]{.underline}** Why, then, would a patron deliberately
weaken its bargaining position? Other stands of literature similarly
suggest that **[reassurance can have undesirable
consequences]{.underline}**. **[Theories on defense burden-sharing in
asymmetric alliances stress that as long as a great power's protection
is relatively assured]{.underline}**, **[allies have little incentive to
increase their military contributions]{.underline}** (Olson and
Zeckhauser, 1966; Oneal, 1990; Palmer, 1990a,b; Sandler, 1993). **[By
reassuring]{.underline}** them, **[the patron effectively encourages its
allies to free-ride]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[reassuring allies
can run the risk of moral hazard]{.underline}**. **[Allies confident in
their patron's support may be prone to take risks such as confronting
their adversaries because they expect that the patron will bail them
out, thus increasing the probability that the patron will be entrapped
or entangled in allies' conflicts]{.underline}** (Christensen and
Snyder, 1990; Fearon, 1997; Posen, 2014). In the years leading up to
World War I, for example, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov
cautioned against reassuring Serbia of Russia's support too strongly,
lest the Serbian government be encouraged to take a more intransigent
stance vis-à-vis its territorial disputes with Austria-Hungary. He
lamented that this was rendered more challenging by the attitudes of
other senior Russian officials -- including the ambassador to Serbia --
whose support for Serbia's pan-Slavic ambitions in the Balkans ran the
risk of encouraging Serbian adventurism (Jelavich, 1991: 244-245, 250).
**[The puzzle of reassurance is only magnified in asymmetric
alliances]{.underline}**. In his seminal book, Waltz (1979) argues that
**[unlike in symmetric alliances between great powers]{.underline}**,
where each ally is a crucial component of the overall balance of power,
in asymmetric alliances **[weak states are comparatively much less
important, as their allegiance is less likely to influence the course of
a war]{.underline}**. Recent scholarship suggests that **[great powers
can shape their alliance treaties and withhold support from their allies
as a means of reducing the risks of moral hazard]{.underline}** (Kim,
2011a; Benson, 2012; Mattes, 2012). Beckley (2015: 19), for one, claims
that the United States "is unlikely to incur major costs to display
loyalty to allies that depend on U.S. protection and patronage for their
survival," as none of its allies are inherently important for its own
security. This **[asymmetry]{.underline}** **[becomes even more
pronounced in bipolar and unipolar systems]{.underline}**, **[where the
gap between the capabilities of the superpowers and other states is even
wider and small states have even fewer patrons to choose
from]{.underline}** (Snyder, 1997; Kim, 2016). It may be understandable,
then, that Walt (2005: 242) would conclude: "the credibility of U.S.
commitments is not \[the United States'\] problem"; rather, it is "a
problem for those who are dependent on U.S. help." Yet Trump's treatment
of allies has come as such a surprise because reassuring allies has, in
fact, been historically common in U.S. foreign policy. Former U.S.
Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, for one, argued that "both the
size and the specific elements of \[American\] forces are driven more by
the need to reassure those that we protect under the nuclear umbrella
than by U.S. requirements alone" (Murdock et al., 2009: 9). Since 1945,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has stationed hundreds of thousands of troops on allied
soil,]{.underline}** **[and U.S. officials make countless foreign visits
and public statements to demonstrate interest in and support for
American partners]{.underline}** (Lebovic and Saunders, 2016). Secretary
of Defense Ashton Carter, for example, made such an effort to
communicate U.S. commitment through numerous overseas trips that the New
York Times dubbed him the "secretary of reassurance" in the summer of
2015.8Indeed, **[the historical record is replete with examples of
weaker allies extracting support despite their patron's
reluctance]{.underline}**. U.S. policymakers during the early years of
the Cold War, for example, did not envision the U.S. troop presence in
Europe as permanent, with Dwight Eisenhower arguing that "If in ten
years, all American troops stationed in Europe for national defense
purposes have not been returned to the United States, then this whole
project will have failed" (Sheetz, 1999: 32). Nevertheless, allies
resisted American withdrawal, leading to what Zimmermann (2009) calls
the "improbable permanence" of the U.S. troop presence. Similarly, East
Germany was able to pressure a reluctant Soviet Union into building the
Berlin Wall by threatening to align itself more closely with China
(Harrison, 2005; Crump, 2015). However, **[reassurance remains
understudied in the scholarly literature]{.underline}**. **[Academic
studies often treat great power patrons' use of reassurance
as]{.underline}** a byproduct of **[deterrence]{.underline}**, where the
primary intended audiences are adversaries (Schelling, 1966; Morgan,
1983; Benson, Meirowitz, and Ramsay, 2014; McManus, 2017). **[To the
extent that the academic literature has considered
reassurance]{.underline}**, **[it has largely been in the context of how
states reassure their allies rather than why.]{.underline}** **[Policy
prescriptions]{.underline}**, for their part, **[tend to either deny the
importance of reassurance]{.underline}** (e.g., Posen, 2014) or assume
its importance and focus on how to reassure allies (e.g., Flournoy and
Davidson, 2012).9 **[As a result, existing literature has not offered a
theory of reassurance.]{.underline}** 1.2 ArgumentIn this dissertation,
I address the following questions: What explains variation in great
powers' use of reassurance measures toward allies? And under what
conditions can patrons make their protection conditional on allied
burden-sharing? Here, I define reassurance as acts made by a patron that
are intended to convince an ally that its assistance will be forthcoming
in the event of an attack from another state. In other words, assurances
are intended to reduce allies' fears of patron abandonment.10 The theory
I present here is intended to be generalizeable; however, for reasons
discussed below I focus on American alliances. Thus I use the terms
"patron" and "United States" interchangeably. Although reassurance can
have adverse consequences, **[patrons have incentives to reassure to the
extent that allies can credibly threaten to exit the
alliance]{.underline}**. By exit, I refer to **[attempts by states in an
alliance to loosen themselves from the partnership by pursuing outside
options]{.underline}**. In its most extreme form, **[alliance exit can
take the form of]{.underline}** treaty abrogation, allying with a
hostile third party, or **[a refusal to provide support in
wartime]{.underline}**. More commonly, patrons fear that their allies
will take more incremental steps that allow them to distance themselves
from the alliance by exploiting outside options. The more credible an
ally's threat to pursue outside options, and the more costs that doing
so would impose on the patron, the more incentive patrons have to
reassure allies. **[Patrons face a dilemma]{.underline}**, **[trading
off between withholding reassurance to drive hard bargains and reduce
free-riding]{.underline}**, on the one hand, **[and reassuring allies to
discourage them from pursuing outside options]{.underline}**, on the
other. **[This dilemma can be mitigated]{.underline}**, however, **[if a
patron can make its assurances conditional on allied burden-sharing by
combining its assurances with threats of abandonment]{.underline}**.
Like those of its allies**[, the patron's threats are more potent to the
extent that they are both credible and salient to its
allies.]{.underline}** Thus, **[reassurance and burden-sharing are the
product of bargaining]{.underline}**, **[where each side's leverage is
shaped by its threat of exit]{.underline}**. Studying the effects of
exit, however, is difficult owing to the issue of endogeneity. An ally's
desire for outside options may be a function of its patron's behavior --
including its use of reassurance (or lack thereof) -- and states are
also likely to anticipate the risk of exit and tailor their actions
accordingly. As such, I look at factors affecting the propensity of
patrons and allies to exit.

#### The credibility of the threat matters---the perm's diminished credibility means there won't be burden-sharing

Price of Protection: Understanding Coercive Alliance Burden-Sharing
http://www.bblankenship.com/uploads/6/6/2/1/66215933/blankenship_priceofprotection.pdf)

**[How]{.underline}**, then, **[do]{.underline}** **[we explain
variation in the success or failure of coercive alliance
burdensharing]{.underline}**? Since the pioneering work of scholars like
Olson and Zeckhauser in the 1960s**[, the dominant research program on
burden-sharing has treated security in alliances as a public
good]{.underline}**.8 The primary claim advanced by this literature is
**[that]{.underline}** the **[larger members of an alliance will tend to
over-contribute]{.underline}** to the costs of the alliance, since its
success by-and-large depends on their efforts. Smaller members, by
contrast, will under-contribute, or "free-ride." 9 This argument has
generated considerable insights into the distribution of burdens in U.S.
alliances -- particularly in NATO -- both during and after the Cold
War.10 However, **[there is much variation that it has difficulty
accounting for.]{.underline}** **[It cannot explain why France withdrew
from NATO's military command]{.underline}** in 1966, despite being among
NATO's largest members; **[why Germany]{.underline}** since the end of
the Cold War **[has been among NATO's lowest spenders on defense as a
percentage of its GDP; o]{.underline}**r **[why]{.underline}**, by
contrast, **[smaller NATO]{.underline}** **[members]{.underline}** in
the 2010s -- namely Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania -- **[have punched
above their weight]{.underline}**. Likewise, **[the economic theory of
alliances cannot account for the rise in allied
burden-sharing]{.underline}** in 1970s and its subsequent fall in much
of 1980s.11

In this article, I present a theory which focuses explicitly on a great
power's (or "patron's") ability to influence burden-sharing
contributions of its junior allies ("allies," or "protégés"). In
particular, the theory explains the conditions under which a patron's
burden-sharing pressure is more or less likely to be effective. I argue
that **[a patron's burden-sharing leverage is greatest when its threat
to abandon the alliance is both *credible* and *salient* to its
partners]{.underline}**. Specifically, **[a patron can most credibly
threaten to abandon allies when it faces constraints on the resources it
can devote to its foreign commitments, and when allies are of limited
strategic value. The consequences of abandonment, in turn, are most
severe for allies that are highly vulnerable to attack.]{.underline}**

In order to test the theory, I conduct statistical tests on U.S.
alliances from 1950-2012, using data on allied military spending. Three
key findings emerge from the results. First, I find that **[allies are
more likely to increase their military spending when the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[faces resource
constraints and pressure to retrench]{.underline}** in the aftermath of
costly foreign wars. Second, allies which are geographically vulnerable
spend more on defense than allies with a large margin of security.
Third, allies in geostrategically valuable locations near maritime
chokepoints spend less on defense. I further illustrate the theory's
causal mechanisms using short case studies on U.S. burden-sharing
pressure toward South Korea and the United Kigndom during the 1960s and
1970s.

This article makes a number of contributions. For one, I directly draw
attention to the bargaining process that shapes alliance burden-sharing.
With few exceptions, **[the literature on freeriding and burden-sharing
in asymmetric alliances has not emphasized the conditions under which
great power patrons pressure their allies to pick up the
burden]{.underline}**. Instead, the literature has almost exclusively
focused on three questions: first, whether smaller allies free-ride more
than larger allies12; second, whether alliance benefits such as
deterrence and defense are truly "public" goods13; and third, how
factors outside the context of the alliance itself may influence allies'
defense efforts.14 Studies generally adopt at most a tacit bargaining
framework in which allies' military expenditures are assumed to be
responsive to changes in the military expenditures of the largest
member.15 This article, by contrast, explicitly focuses on why and when
patrons have bargaining leverage for extracting burden-sharing.

Second and more generally, **[the theory has implications for
understanding how great powers]{.underline}** -- and especially
hegemonic powers -- **[manage their partnerships, deter adversaries, and
maintain influence in the international system]{.underline}**. Classic
works in the international relations literature argue that
**[free-riding is inherent in great powers' alliances with weaker
partners]{.underline}**, and that **[the costs of maintaining these
asymmetric partnerships can even contribute to overextension and
long-term economic decline]{.underline}**.16 Moreover, **[a lack of
allied burden-sharing may make it more difficult for hegemonic states to
compete with rising powers]{.underline}**, **[and for great powers to
deter their rivals more generally]{.underline}**.17 **[Understanding how
great powers encourage burden-sharing in their alliances thus has
implications for understanding their ability to avoid "imperial
overstretch" and navigate power transitions.]{.underline}**18

Trump is Scaring Allies into Spending

But **[if the costs of abandoning allies are prohibitive]{.underline}**,
**[why is Trump threatening to do so?]{.underline}** Nobel Prize
laureate Thomas **[Schelling's work on game theory
suggests]{.underline}** an answer. Schelling demonstrated in his seminal
[Strategy of
Conflict](https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-Conflict-Thomas-C-Schelling/dp/0674840313)
(1960) that **[it may be advantageous to appear mad]{.underline}** or
unpredictable, **[because it may induce]{.underline}** your
**[negotiating partners]{.underline}** or opponents **[to give greater
concessions]{.underline}** that they otherwise would. In this
perspective, **[Trump's statements]{.underline}** and seemingly erratic
behavior **[make a lot of sense as a negotiation tactic]{.underline}**
**[aimed at pressuring U.S. allies to increase their defense
spending]{.underline}**. Trump's predecessors in the White House have
tried to do this for years without success; previous administrations
have repeatedly warned its European allies that [NATO was in danger of
becoming
irrelevant](http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=4839)
if the Europeans continued to cut their defense spending. Yet **[most
European allies paid scant attention to demands from]{.underline}** the
**[Obama]{.underline}** administration [to stop
freeriding](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/04/the-obama-doctrine/471525/)
and honor their own commitments to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense.
**[Few]{.underline}** European **[governments saw a pressing need to
increase defense spending because]{.underline}** the
**[Obama]{.underline}** administration **[reacted to the Russian
annexation of]{.underline}** the **[Crimea by enhancing its military
presence in Europe]{.underline}**.

**[Trump]{.underline}** has changed the game completely. In line with
Schelling's expectations, his **[perceived unpredictability is adding
credibility to the threat that he might]{.underline}** actually
**[withdraw U.S. forces]{.underline}** even if it is not in the United
States best interest to do so. **[There is genuine concern among U.S.
allies about what Trump might do]{.underline}** if they do not take
immediate steps to increase their defense spending. **[Many
have]{.underline}** already **[taken steps in this
direction]{.underline}**, **[or signaled]{.underline}** their
**[intention to do so]{.underline}**. In December 2016, Japan adopted a
[record high defense
budget](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-12-22/japan-approves-record-defense-spending-amid-china-tensions),
which allocated considerable funds to the procurement of American
equipment, notably F-35s and missiles. The South Korean government
reacted to Trump's election by vowing to [increase defense spending
significantly](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-korea-trump-idUSKBN13G1XY)
if he insists on it. Likewise, the Danish Prime Minister Lars Loekke
Rasmussen promised to [increase defense
spending](http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-trump-denmark-security-idUKKBN13B2MI)
after his first phone conversation with Trump. In Germany Trump's

**[the weight of authority appears to favor interpreting "should" in an
imperative, obligatory sense]{.underline}**. A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word "should" in jury
instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment protections
governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld instructions using
the word. In the courts of other states in which a defendant has argued
that the word "should" in the reasonable doubt instruction does not
sufficiently inform the jury that it is bound to find the defendant not
guilty if insufficient proof is submitted at trial, the courts have
squarely rejected the argument. They reasoned that **[the
word]{.underline}** "**[conveys a sense of duty and
obligation]{.underline}** and could not be misunderstood by a jury." See
State v. McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan.1995); see also

rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, the Missouri
Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court erred by
not using the word "should" in an instruction on witness credibility
which used the word "must" because the two words have the same meaning.

1.1 The Puzzle of Reassurance

**[In a May 2017 visit to]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**) headquarters, U.S. President
Donald **[Trump declined to affirm]{.underline}** his **[support of
NATO's Article 5]{.underline}**, which obligates its members to come to
each others' defense.4 Indeed, **[this was no accident]{.underline}**;
in his speech, **[Trump deliberately removed a passage expressing his
support for Article 5]{.underline}**. 5 **[U.S. allies]{.underline}** --
as well as members of Trump's own administration -- **[were taken
aback]{.underline}**, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel arguing that
it was time for Europeans to "really take our fate into our own hands."6

**[In the wake of the uproar]{.underline}** surrounding Trump's speech
-- and his treatment of allies more generally -- **[one question that
has]{.underline}** largely **[been neglected is why one should even
expect the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to
reassure]{.underline}** its **[allies in the first place]{.underline}**.
Indeed, **[reassurance is]{.underline}** fundamentally **[puzzling
because it surrenders a key source of bargaining power]{.underline}**:
**[the threat of abandonment]{.underline}**. Bargaining leverage within
an alliance depends on the credibility of states' threats to abandon
their partners, and thus **[great power patrons should limit the extent
to which they are perceived as committed to]{.underline}** their
**[allies]{.underline}** (Snyder, 1997; Jervis, 1997: ch. 5; Crawford,
2003).7Reassurance measures, however, are intended to have exactly the
opposite effect. Why, then, would a patron deliberately weaken its
bargaining position?

Other stands of literature similarly suggest that reassurance can have
undesirable consequences. **[Theories on]{.underline}** defense
**[burden-sharing in asymmetric alliances stress that as long as a great
power's protection is]{.underline}** relatively
**[assured]{.underline}**, **[allies have little
incentive]{.underline}** **[to increase]{.underline}** their **[military
contributions]{.underline}** (Olson and Zeckhauser, 1966; Oneal, 1990;
Palmer, 1990a,b; Sandler, 1993). **[By reassuring]{.underline}** them,
**[the patron]{.underline}** effectively **[encourages]{.underline}**
its **[allies to free-ride]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[reassuring
allies can run the risk of moral hazard]{.underline}**. Allies confident
in their patron's support may be prone to take risks such as confronting
their adversaries because they expect that the patron will bail them
out, thus increasing the probability that the patron will be entrapped
or entangled in allies' conflicts (Christensen and Snyder, 1990; Fearon,
1997; Posen, 2014). In the years leading up to World War I, for example,
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov cautioned against reassuring
Serbia of Russia's support too strongly, lest the Serbian government be
encouraged to take a more intransigent stance vis-à-vis its territorial
disputes with Austria-Hungary. He lamented that this was rendered more
challenging by the attitudes of other senior Russian officials --
including the ambassador to Serbia -- whose support for Serbia's
pan-Slavic ambitions in the Balkans ran the risk of encouraging Serbian
adventurism (Jelavich, 1991: 244-245, 250).

The puzzle of reassurance is only magnified in asymmetric alliances. In
his seminal book, Waltz (1979) argues that unlike in symmetric alliances
between great powers, where each ally is a crucial component of the
overall balance of power, in asymmetric alliances weak states are
comparatively much less important, as their allegiance is less likely to
influence the course of a war. **[Recent scholarship
suggests]{.underline}** that **[great powers can shape]{.underline}**
their **[alliance treaties and withhold support from their allies as a
means of reducing the risks of moral hazard]{.underline}** (Kim, 2011a;
Benson, 2012; Mattes, 2012). Beckley (2015: 19), for one, claims that
the United States "is unlikely to incur major costs to display loyalty
to allies that depend on U.S. protection and patronage for their
survival," as none of its allies are inherently important for its own
security. This **[asymmetry becomes]{.underline}** even **[more
pronounced]{.underline}** **[in bipolar]{.underline}** and unipolar
**[systems]{.underline}**, **[where the gap between the capabilities of
the superpowers and other states is]{.underline}** even
**[wider]{.underline}** **[and small states have even fewer
patrons]{.underline}** to choose from (Snyder, 1997; Kim, 2016). It may
be understandable, then, that Walt (2005: 242) would conclude: "the
credibility of U.S. commitments is not \[the United States'\] problem";
rather, it is" a problem for those who are dependent on U.S. help."

Yet **[Trump's treatment of allies has]{.underline}** come as such a
surprise because reassuring allies has, in fact, **[been]{.underline}**
historically **[common]{.underline}** **[in U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}**. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger, for one, argued that "both the size and the specific
elements of \[American\] forces are driven more by the need to reassure
those that we protect under the nuclear umbrella than by U.S.
requirements alone" (Murdock et al., 2009: 9). Since 1945, the United
States has stationed hundreds of thousands of troops on allied soil, and
U.S. officials make countless foreign visits and public statements to
demonstrate interest in and support for American partners (Lebovic and
Saunders, 2016). Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, for example, made
such an effort to communicate U.S. commitment through numerous overseas
trips that the New York Times dubbed him the "secretary of reassurance"
in the summer of 2015.8

Indeed, **[the historical record is replete with examples]{.underline}**
**[of weaker allies extracting support despite]{.underline}** their
patron's **[reluctance]{.underline}**. U.S.
**[policymakers]{.underline}** during the early years of the Cold War,
for example, **[did not envision]{.underline}** the U.S. **[troop
presence in Europe as permanent]{.underline}**, with Dwight Eisenhower
arguing that "If in ten years, all American troops stationed in Europe
for national defense purposes have not been returned to the United
States, then this whole project will have failed" (Sheetz, 1999:32).
Nevertheless, allies resisted American withdrawal, leading to what
Zimmermann (2009) calls the "improbable permanence" of the U.S. troop
presence. Similarly, East Germany was able to pressure a reluctant
Soviet Union into building the Berlin Wall by threatening to align
itself more closely with China (Harrison, 2005; Crump, 2015).

However, reassurance remains understudied in the scholarly literature.
Academic studies of-ten treat great power patrons' use of reassurance as
a byproduct of deterrence, where the primary intended audiences are
adversaries (Schelling, 1966; Morgan, 1983; Benson, Meirowitz, and
Ram-say, 2014; McManus, 2017). To the extent that the academic
literature has considered reassurance, it has largely been in the
context of how states reassure their allies rather than why. Policy
pre-scriptions, for their part, tend to either deny the importance of
reassurance (e.g., Posen, 2014) or assume its importance and focus on
how to reassure allies (e.g., Flournoy and Davidson, 2012).9As a result,
existing literature has not offered a theory of reassurance.

1.2 Argument

In this dissertation, I address the following questions: What explains
variation in great powers' use of reassurance measures toward allies?
And under what conditions can patrons make their protection conditional
on allied burden-sharing? Here, I define reassurance as acts made by a
patron that are intended to convince an ally that its assistance will be
forthcoming in the event of an attack from another state. In other
words, assurances are intended to reduce allies' fears of patron
abandonment.10The theory I present here is intended to be
generalizeable; however, for reasons discussed below I focus on American
alliances. Thus I use the terms "patron" and "United States"
interchangeably.

Although reassurance can have adverse consequences, patrons have
incentives to reassure to the extent that allies can credibly threaten
to exit the alliance. By exit, I refer to attempts by states in an
alliance to loosen themselves from the partnership by pursuing outside
options. In its most extreme form, alliance exit can take the form of
treaty abrogation, allying with a hostile third party, or a refusal to
provide support in wartime. More commonly, patrons fear that their
allies will take more incremental steps that allow them to distance
themselves from the alliance by exploiting outside options. The more
credible an ally's threat to pursue outside options, and the more costs
that doing so would impose on the patron, the more incentive patrons
have to reassure allies.

**[Patrons face a dilemma]{.underline}**, **[trading off between
withholding reassurance to drive hard bargains]{.underline}** and reduce
free-riding, on the one hand, **[and reassuring allies to discourage
them from pursuing outside options]{.underline}**, on the other. **[This
dilemma can be mitigated]{.underline}**, however, **[if a patron can
make its assurances conditional]{.underline}** **[on allied
burden-sharing by combining its assurances with threats]{.underline}**
of abandonment. Like those of its allies, the patron's threats are more
potent to the extent that they are both credible and salient to its
allies.

#### The cp exerts [alliance discipline]{.underline} by establishing a reputation of [conditional reliability]{.underline}.

University of Birmingham. He is also Senior Associate Fellow at the
Royal United Services Institute, London and a Fellow of the Quincy
Institute for Responsible Statecraft. (Patrick Porter (2019) "Advice for
a Dark Age: Managing Great Power Competition", The Washington Quarterly,
42:1, 7-25, <https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2019.1590079>)

To make alliances work for its interests, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[should restore what used to be part of its
repertoire as a great power]{.underline}** ---**[the imposition of
conditions on its protection]{.underline}**, **[and the credible threat
of abandonment]{.underline}**. In other words, contrary to the standard
orthodoxy often invoked by Trump's critics, **[a critical ingredient in
an effective patron-client relationship is the cultivation of a
reputation for limited reliability]{.underline}**, if not unreliability.
Thus, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should
make clear that it is willing to walk away and that its alliance
commitments are conditional on its ally's prudent
behavior]{.underline}**. In a world of worsening rivalries, **[the U.S.
ability to control escalation and limit inadvertent spirals
depends]{.underline}** partly **[on its capacity to restrain third
parties and keep its initiative]{.underline}**. To make this threat
credible, it may require the United States occasionally to terminate an
alliance relationship.

There are fine lines to be walked here. The United States has alliances
for the most basic purpose of augmenting its power, its reach and the
totality of its presence. From this perspective, it is in Washington's
interests to have militarily proficient friends. But its alliances have
other rationales that cut against that simple desire.
**[Another]{.underline}** central **[historical purpose of American
alliances]{.underline}** in the postwar period **[is to contain its
allies]{.underline}**. By providing security, Washington in theory
removes incentives for its allies to rearm and reassert themselves as
challengers. This imperative, to depress allies' defense expenditure,
requires in turn that Washington must establish a reputation for being a
reliable security provider. Failure to maintain that baseline of
confidence could lead the client to pursue belligerent self-help, or
even other allies in lieu of the United States. Yet, **[establishing a
reputation for reliable security provision can and does have a perverse
result]{.underline}**---**[it creates a moral hazard]{.underline}**.
**[Allies' confidence in American backing can embolden them to behave
recklessly]{.underline}** **[in ways]{.underline}** that **[Washington
dislikes]{.underline}**. Conversely, **[the dependency Washington
forms]{.underline}** on the alliance, as an indispensable platform for
its power projection, **[creates reverse leverage]{.underline}**,
**[making Washington reluctant to]{.underline}** attempt to **[impose
itself with threats of abandonment]{.underline}** or even public
criticism.33

Some **[allied states have tested]{.underline}** the **[possibilities of
this relationship with a spirit of adventure]{.underline}**, tolerating
or encouraging militant Islamist activity, suppressing peaceful
protests, committing human rights violations, locking up citizens of
allied countries in humiliating and brazen fashion, and threatening or
carrying out military campaigns against Washington's wishes with
strategically corrosive results, **[such as the present onslaught in
Yemen]{.underline}**. Even the most outspoken supporters of the
U.S.-Israel alliance will admit that U.S. guarantees have not restrained
Tel Aviv from settlement expansion. As Asia becomes more competitive, a
rearming Japan could also start to test alliance boundaries, either
because of lost faith in American security guarantees or because it
takes them for granted. In Eastern Europe, **[the cast-iron guarantee
built into NATO could lead states to miscalculate]{.underline}** **[and
behave recklessly against Russian minorities]{.underline}** in their own
territory, quickly **[fomenting a cross-border crisis.]{.underline}**

There is a difficult balancing act to be struck here, if the United
States chooses to maintain allies to increase its material strength
while containing those same allies. **[The threat of
abandonment]{.underline}**, or withdrawal of patronage, **[was once a
greater part of U.S. diplomatic repertoire behind the
scenes]{.underline}**.34 The United States explicitly threatened West
Germany, South Korea and Taiwan in order to prevent nuclear
proliferation, for instance. It seems to have receded to an extent,
after the Cold War, when the sense weakened of the need to keep allies
in line coercively. Trump's public humiliation of and threats to allies,
usually followed swiftly by increased U.S. commitment, are probably too
hollow and less effective in the long run than the quiet threats made by
past administrations.

Certainly, the United States has an interest in preventing allies being
complacent about American guarantees, or worse, of the United States
being so anxious about losing access and influence that it dare not
exercise it. **[One of the superpower's greatest advantages is its
ability to leave]{.underline}**. This is a possibility it should deftly
exploit. Against traditional orthodoxies about "global leadership,"
**[the overall U.S. position would benefit from the possibility that
Washington might not have an ally's]{.underline}**
"**[back]{.underline}**" **[if it behaves recklessly against the
superpower's stated preferences]{.underline}**, **[or if it hedges too
much in favor of rivals]{.underline}**. In other words, U.S. alliances
are likely to serve U.S. interests better if it ceases fetishizing them.

#### Lack of burden sharing causes entrapment---encourages allies to act aggressively because they don't bear the cost

**[Discussions of free riding within NATO on the American side argue
that the United States is]{.underline}** simply **[being fooled into
providing defense]{.underline}**. They believe **[the U.S. should be
wary of supporting wealthy European nations that don't want to spend as
much on their militaries.]{.underline}** Alan Tonelson's early 2000s
article highlighted this mood as he **[explored how changes in
international geo-politics appear to be putting the U.S. at greater
risk]{.underline}**. Tonelson conveyed the risk associated with NATO
through both material and non-material causes. He argued that **[U.S.
actions leave the country exposed to more precarious
situations]{.underline}**. Tonelson mentioned **[that there is a greater
risk that the U.S. can be dragged into "non-article 5" conflicts even
though America's original objective was to keep the power of Russia in
check through its military presence]{.underline}**. Tonelson pointed to
the example that **[U.S. troops stationed in European countries are at
risk of]{.underline}** injury in **[an attack]{.underline}**
(particularly **[from terrorists or irregular forces]{.underline}**)
**[and could be stuck in the middle of an unnecessary
conflict]{.underline}**. Tonelson also pointed to Kosovo as an example:
**[the U.S. was influenced to become involved simply to strengthen
NATO's credibility even though its European member nations were
contributing far less to the alliance operations in comparison to those
of the U.S.]{.underline}** (Tonelson 2000). From a financial
perspective, an earlier article written by Jyonni Khana and others
indicates that alliance members in NATO, and in the U.N., are in fact
free riding on larger nations such as the United States. The authors
concluded that **[there is a wide gap in the equity of burden
sharing.]{.underline}** Their analysis focused heavily on peace keeping
expenditures between 1976 and 1996. Jointproduct models and collective
action theory were employed to study the financial contributions of the
various countries. **[The level of fiscal support from the larger
countries far outweighed those of the smaller nations and indicated a
great level of free riding]{.underline}** (Jyonni Khanna et al 1998).
More recent studies have tried to take a more mixed methods approach;
this is apparent in Jo Jakobson's article. Jakobson attempted to draw on
the collective action approach and the risk-responsibility sharing
school. Jakobsen ultimately factored in the different variables both
schools use, but he comes to differing conclusions. He started the study
with the standard input measure, (where one looks at what countries put
into the alliance alone) and it became obvious that European NATO free
rides from this analytical perspective. Furthermore, Jakobsen found that
**[non-material free riding can occur when a U.S. presence in the
country of operations is significant as compared to its
allies.]{.underline}** A further observation **[demonstrated that other
allied countries showed a low willingness to fight]{.underline}**. He
also mentioned that the importance of United States military spending
has to do with other variables. The United States was engaged in various
operations throughout the world, especially in Europe. The United
States' projection of power could essentially outweigh the lessened
spending of European NATO allies. Jakobsen's conclusion is to remain
cautious when attempting to decipher whether European NATO in fact free
rides (Jakobsen 2018).

#### Conditional assistance [avoids entrapment]{.underline}---[empirics]{.underline}, [flexibility]{.underline} proves it avoids fears of [abandonment]{.underline}.

Entrapment risks may be a function of the commitment that the defender
supplies to its ally. As Snyder (1997, p. 44) argues**[, if the defender
offers too strong of a commitment, then the benefiting ally might become
so confident of its support as to pursue a much more
aggressive]{.underline}** than it otherwise would. **[Strong alliance
commitments entail a moral hazard problem insofar as they might shield
the ally from the true costs of its actions]{.underline}**, thus making
it more reckless (Benson, 2012, pp. 43--70; see also Benson, Bentley, &
Ray, 2013). One **[exemplary case is arguably Germany's blank check to
Austria in July 1914 during the latter's crisis with Serbia. By failing
to condition its military support, Berlin might have encouraged Vienna
to behave more aggressively towards Serbia]{.underline}** than it would
have otherwise. Some argue that **[German leaders subsequently found
themselves entrapped by Austria]{.underline}** since they did not wish
to fight a major power war at that time (North, 1967, p. 107; for an
alternative view, see Fischer, 1974). **[Institutionalist explanations
of entrapment, therefore, imply that entrapment fears should not exist
if the arrangements undergirding the military alliance are loose and
flexible]{.underline}**. Entrapment is far less likely with informal,
unwritten alliances because the defender can always disclaim
responsibility for its ally. The **[solutions]{.underline}** for
mitigating entrapment risks thus **[tend to be
institutional]{.underline}**. Snyder (1997, p. 185) **[posits that one
option]{.underline}** involves **[weakening the commitment itself,
though this remedy might engender fears of abandonment]{.underline}** on
the part of the ally instead. Another solution is to demand
consultations with the ally or access to exchanges between it and the
adversary. **[Defenders can use greater conditionality in outlining the
obligations that characterize the alliance commitment]{.underline}**
(Kim, 2011, pp. 358--359). **[Conditionality can also mitigate
entrapment risks]{.underline}** (Benson, 2012, pp. 90--127). The
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[added a secret
clause in its 1955 defense treaty with Taiwan]{.underline}**, asserting
that it would aid Taiwan only if it was attacked (Christensen, 2011, p.
239). Common in these proposed solutions is that the **[defender can
adjust its commitments to signal varying levels of support and to
minimize risk]{.underline}**.

#### Conditional alliance management avoids entrapment

**[By falsely equating alliances with friendships]{.underline}**,
**[Biden and his team run serious risks]{.underline}**. The rhetoric of
friendship obscures the reality of U.S. foreign policy to the American
people. For a campaign that prides itself on restoring the public's
trust in government, this is a serious problem, risking public backlash
if Biden is elected while forgoing an opportunity to improve the quality
of policy discussions.

Equally important, **[the approach risks undermining international
stability by giving U.S. partners ill-placed faith in U.S.
commitments]{.underline}**. After four years of the Trump
administration's bullying, **[allies from Canada to
Germany]{.underline}** to South Korea **[worry about American
reliability and seek a course correction]{.underline}**. **[In pledging
fidelity to its]{.underline}** "**[friends]{.underline}**," however,
**[the Biden approach risks going too far in the opposite
direction]{.underline}**. **[It could create a false expectation among
allies of a restored friendship with Washington without
conditions]{.underline}**. **[It could even tempt allies to take U.S.
support for granted and behave recklessly.]{.underline}**

At a time of geopolitical change, a sounder approach instead would
acknowledge the reality that alliances hinge on common interests and, as
such, are neither permanent nor inviolate. One does not need to support
Trump's foreign policy to accept this point. Ultimately, America's
allies would be foolish to expect that under a Biden presidency, America
would replace self-interest with friendship.

Likewise, Americans should not expect their allies to align their
interests with Washington consistently. **[The underlying goal should be
to embrace a prudent alliance-management strategy]{.underline}**, **[one
that avoids bullying allies at the drop of a hat yet recognizes
that]{.underline}**---unlike friendships---**[coercion]{.underline}**,
**[pressure]{.underline}**, **[and threats of abandonment are often the
coin of the realm]{.underline}**. Only if policymakers act upon this
messy reality can we hope for a more peaceful world and sounder American
policy.

purposeful leadership beyond its shores. The demands of renewal at home
require that Biden be forthright with the American people about the
powerful domestic and international constraints he faces on foreign
policy. After Trump's trashing of U.S. credibility and his willful
divorce of rhetoric from reality, truth in advertising will be vital to
restoring trust in the U.S. presidency, both in the United States and
around the world. Washington should still lead, but with a lighter touch
that reflects the profound changes that have transpired at home and
abroad since the United States arrived on the global stage during the
1940s. In the years after World War II, the U.S. economy was singularly
dominant and its international engagement rested on bipartisan
agreement. Today, the United States contributes less than 25 percent of
global GDP, and Democrats and Republicans share almost no common ground
on either domestic or foreign policy. **[As Biden embarks on an urgent

approved by Congress in December, **[represents]{.underline}**,
according to former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, "**[the
boldest act of macroeconomic stabilization policy in U.S. history." It
is a drop in the bucket]{.underline}**, however, **[compared to what
Biden envisages for the next four years.]{.underline}** The nonpartisan,
nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that
**[the administration is poised to pour over \$11 trillion into
infrastructure, green]{.underline}** technology, childcare and
education, health and long-term care, social security and social
welfare, **[and other domestic investments.]{.underline}** Even with the
added revenue from planned tax reform (and not including any further
pandemic relief packages), these programs will add up to \$8 trillion to
U.S. debt over the coming ten years---potentially harming long-term
growth. For now, deficit spending makes sense to get the economy back on
its feet. But **[domestic expenditures on the scale envisaged will cut
into the resources available for tasks abroad]{.underline}**. It is a
tall order to justify further stabilization efforts in Afghanistan amid
an economic crisis at home and over 500,000 Americans dead from
COVID-19---a death toll well beyond that from any of the nation's
foreign wars. Even if the roughly \$750 billion defense budget stays
more or less intact, the days of spending some \$6 trillion on "forever
wars" in the Middle East are long gone. **[Biden's priority should
therefore be to lighten the nation's military burdens abroad and
convince allies to pick up the geopolitical slack]{.underline}**.
Although his administration may adjust the timeline, Biden should
continue Trump's effort to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, Iraq,
and Syria and downsize the United States' military footprint in the
Middle East. Avoiding unnecessary interventions and scaling back
military commitments in peripheral conflicts will help Biden sustain a
robust military presence where it matters most: namely, in Europe and
the Asia-Pacific, where checking Russian and Chinese ambition remains a
vital U.S. interest. **[Assuming Biden can convince allies to shoulder
heavier defense burdens]{.underline}**, **[he should be able to
reconcile these core obligations with the need for more domestic
investment]{.underline}**.

defense expenditure, but this response has been slow and sometimes very
difficult to realize given public pressure and electorate sensitivities
on the issue not to mention economic pressures. Yet an increasingly
affluent Europe that has repeatedly been unable to provide for its own
defense has been a constant source of resentment on the other side of
the Atlantic. The Defence Investment Pledge agreed at the 2014 NATO
Summit in Wales, has led to real increases in defense spending but many
European allies are still beneath the 2 percent of GDP as promised.\[7\]
Turkey is one of the NATO members close to achieving this target, with a
defense expenditure of 1.89 percent of GDP.

approach.]{.underline}** There is no will among the member states for
the union to become a defense alliance. This role is reserved to NATO,
but the EU can play a supportive role here.

**[The bloc should expand its focus from enabling European defense
industry integration to encompass also support for NATO's collective
defense efforts. This could be done by increasing the EU's financial and
administrative engagement in enhancing military mobility, developing
military infrastructure,]{.underline}** prepositioning of military
equipment, and purchasing needed capabilities, among other actions.

**[We are maybe seeing the start of it, however there is still a long
way to go. The European Commission recently presented a gloomy but frank
assessment of the lack of European defense capabilities and
investments.]{.underline}** Hence, Europe must focus on more
collaborative actions in defense and joint procurement to overcome the
problems of the past. Russia's war in Ukraine implies, as stated by the
leaders in the European Council, a "[tectonic shift in European
history](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/54773/20220311-versailles-declaration-en.pdf)"
and Europe now needs to take a quantum leap (for real this time) in
defense. To invest and procure together is the way forward for European
countries.

#### NATO summit shows issues with current burden-sharing

**Graham '22** (Thomas Graham, Distinguished fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations, "NATO Countries Signal Resolve at Summit: What Does
It Mean for Russia?",

//sethlee

NATO's new force posture and strategic concept are not likely to prompt
Putin to rethink his Ukraine strategy. He is making slow but steady
progress on the battlefield in the east and south. Nothing suggests that
he believes that the West's provision of more sophisticated weaponry is
going to shift fortunes on the ground. Bu**[t the new circumstances in
Europe do pose a long-term strategic challenge to Russia]{.underline}**.
Increasingly isolated in Europe, Putin was surely pleased to attend the
recent summits of the BRICS grouping (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and
South Africa) and of the Caspian states to underscore that **[Russia has
friends and allies elsewhere.]{.underline}** Whether they can compensate
for the loss of European ties is another matter.   

**[The summit was an impressive show of resolve to counter Russia's
aggression]{.underline}**, including **[through continued diplomatic,
economic]{.underline}**, and military **[support for Ukraine. NATO
pledged to further expand its military support]{.underline}** for its
vulnerable allies along the Russian frontier. In particular, the [United
States
announced](https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/permanent-hq-for-us-armys-v-corps-to-be-set-up-in-poland-says-biden-31386) that
it will establish a permanent headquarters for its V Corps in Poland.
Most important was the eleventh-hour agreement that Turkey reached with
Finland and Sweden, by which Ankara lifted its objections to their
joining the alliance and allowed NATO to begin the accession process.

**[However, challenges remain. Burden-sharing is a perennial
issue:]{.underline}** Even after Russia's assault on Ukraine, **[the
majority of members fall short of their commitment]{.underline}** to
spend at least 2 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on
defense. The laggards include, most importantly, Germany, although it
has taken steps recently to meet that target as a multiyear average.
**[Moreover, in the weeks ahead, the alliance's resolve will be tested,
as strains over rising inflation and concerns over energy and food
supply mount across the Euro-Atlantic region.]{.underline}** In recent
weeks, France, Germany, and Italy have expressed interest in finding a
negotiated settlement to the conflict, which would likely leave some
seized Ukrainian territory in Russian hands. That position is vehemently
opposed by Poland and the Baltic states, among others. Though those
differences were pushed into the background during this summit, they
have not gone away.

### 2NC INB---UQ---European Defense Low---AT: Ukraine 

#### Current Burden-Sharing is uncertain given Ukraine

**Eyal '22** (Jonathan Eyal, Associate director at the Royal United
Services Institute in London, "Yes, Nato has a new vitality. But its
united front could collapse when it has to deal with Russia",
<https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-eyal>)

Nato calculates that its members have promised to spend £172.6bn
in [additional defence
expenditure](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2022/06/29/remarks-by-president-charles-michel-before-the-nato-summit-in-madrid/) on
top of existing defence budgets, with Germany accounting for perhaps
half this amount. But the question is how this will be spent and over
what period. The easiest way to improve European capabilities would be
to use this cash to buy US equipment off the shelf: this offers
substantial economies of scale and time. **[Yet such an approach will go
against European aspirations to boost their defence industries; French
diplomats are warning that the Ukraine war must not end up as a bonanza
for US arms manufacturers. Chances are high that Nato's eternal
"burden-sharing" debate will continue, even if more cash is
available.]{.underline}** Across the Atlantic, Donald Trump and his
disciples are poised to argue -- as "The Donald" did when he was in the
White House -- that Nato is a scam to fleece American taxpayers. Even if
he does not stage a comeback, the idea that the US is spending far more
than it should to defend fat, wealthy Europeans is likely to feature
prominently when a new Congress is elected this November.

The sheer audacity of the Russian aggression has allowed the Biden
administration to get the cash it needed from Congress. **[Still, it is
taken for granted in Washington that the [\$40bn
package](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/may/16/us-ukraine-aid-bill-vote-joe-biden-baby-formula-inflation-latest-news) recently
approved by Congress for security assistance to Ukraine is unlikely to
be repeated. And a future Nato burden-sharing debate is bound to get
more acrimonious when it is joined with a parallel discussion about
paying for Ukraine's postwar economic reconstruction, a project
estimated at an eye-watering \$500bn.]{.underline}**

Nato has also set itself a huge objective by pledging to increase the
number of high-readiness forces to more than 300,000. For this still
does not answer the fundamental question of whether, to deter further
Russian aggression, the alliance must position significant forces in the
countries near Russia permanently. Not doing so could expose existing
Nato members to the danger of a Russian occupation for at least a period
until help arrives to liberate them, a risk that, given the [horrors of
Bucha](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/ukraine-crisis-bucha-killings-soldiers/),
no alliance nation is ready to contemplate. **[But keeping multinational
troops deployed permanently in central and eastern Europe will be hugely
expensive, well beyond current raised spending plans.]{.underline}**

Introduction The **[Trump Administration has adopted a more
confrontational and transactional approach to burden-sharing in
NATO.]{.underline}** It has **[threatened to "moderate" its commitment
to the Alliance unless the European members increase their defence
spending]{.underline}** (US Mission to NATO 2017), and contribute more
to out-of-area operations. Since President Trump entered the office,
**[European defence spending has risen at a quicker pace, and the nature
of the defence debate in Europe has changed]{.underline}**. The
Europeans are **[no longer debating whether they need to increase their
spending; the questions discussed are how fast and how much. Is this
evidence of a "Trump effect", and will it last? This is the question
addressed in this policy brief.]{.underline}** Because it is hard to
predict the future, we adopt an historical perspective. Two
**[structural factors have conditioned the burden-sharing
games]{.underline}** since the creation of the Alliance in 1949: (1)
External threats giving the Americans and the Europeans a shared
interest in establishing and maintaining the Alliance. (2) The
asymmetric power relations between the United States and the Europeans,
giving all European allies except France and Great Britain, who needed
their own military capabilities to underpin their great power ambitions,
a strong incentive to free-ride and spend less on defence. These factors
**[set the stage for a transatlantic burden-sharing game, which had the
Americans constantly pressuring its European allies to do more, and the
Europeans responding by doing what they deemed necessary to keep the
Americans in Europe]{.underline}** -- but little more. The European
willingness to contribute to the Alliance was primarily driven by
American pressure and the Soviet threat. It was about keeping the
Russians out and the Americans in as NATO's first Secretary-General Lord
Ismay once put it. A combination of shared interests and the liberal
values mentioned in the Washington Treaty has prevented this
burden-sharing game from tearing the Alliance apart until now, and it is
our conclusion that they will continue to do so in the foreseeable
future. The Trump effect is therefore limited -- if it exists at all. In
the analysis below, we show how **[different levels of external threats
have affected NATO's mission sets, the burdensharing indicators adopted
by the Alliance to ensure that all did their fair share, and the
credibility of the American threats to reduce their commitment unless
the Europeans did more]{.underline}**. The analysis reveals a continuity
corroborating our claim that the Trump Administration will be unable to
make a major difference to European defence spending. The Cold War:
Burden-sharing as input NATO was a response to the Cold War. Concern
that the Western European countries would be unable to deter and, if
need be, defeat a Soviet attack induced American decision-makers to
deploy a large number of troops to Europe on a permanent basis. But
already in 1949, **[Washington realized that its commitment to defend
Europe would give the European NATO members an incentive to spend less
on defence]{.underline}**. They therefore inserted Article 3 in the
Washington Treaty to prevent this. The emphasis of Article 3 on
individual capacity and self-help, Secretary of State Dean Acheson told
Congress during the NATO ratification hearings in 1949, was to "ensure
that nobody is getting a meal ticket from anybody else so far as their
capacity to resist is concerned" (cited in Ringsmose 2010, 321).
**[Defence spending in proportion to GDP was the principal indicator
employed to ensure that "nobody got a free meal ticket". Yet the choice
of this indicator set the stage for continuous transatlantic conflict,
because the United States spent far more on defence in proportion to GDP
than the Europeans. Asymmetric defence spending led to increased
frustration in the United States]{.underline}** as the Europeans
recovered economically from the destruction of World War II. In the
1960s and 1970s, U.S. Senator Mansfield introduced a series of
amendments in Congress proposing that the United States should reduce
the number of troops permanently stationed in Europe, in order to induce
the Europeans to do more themselves. These **[threats to withdraw a
substantial number of U.S. forces had little credibility, because the
resolutions failed to pass. However, the congressional pressure did help
U.S. Administrations from the 1960s onwards achieve some success with a
quid-pro-quo approach promising to maintain their military commitment in
Europe in return for increased European defence spending]{.underline}**.
Yet, the **[Europeans never met the U.S. demands fully, realizing that
the U.S. had no interest in leaving.]{.underline}** The Post-Cold War
era: Output trumps input The disappearance of the Soviet threat
transformed NATO's strategic environment and the nature of the
transatlantic burden-sharing game. NATO's principal mission shifted from
deterrence and defence to out-of-area operations. While the Cold War
input burden-sharing indicator remained in use, the United States
introduced a set of additional measures to pressure the Europeans to
transform forces to more deployable ones. The Defence Capabilities
Initiative from 1999, the Prague Capabilities Commitment agreed at
NATO's summit in Prague in November 2002, and the NATO Response Force
launched that same year, all served this purpose (Rynning 2005:
102--140). **[American threats to reduce their commitment to NATO also
played an important role in the new burden-sharing game.]{.underline}**
"Out of area or out of business", the slogan popularized by U.S. Senator
Lugar (1993), captured the new dynamics. These **[threats induced the
Europeans to accept greater use of force and make larger force
contributions than they would have done otherwise (Jakobsen 2014). The
credibility of U.S. threats to withdraw was higher than it had been
during the Cold War because Russia no longer posed an existential threat
to NATO]{.underline}**. The introduction of new output indicators
culminated at the Istanbul Summit in June 2004 with the endorsement of
the so-called usability targets. The agreed aim for national land forces
was that 40% had to be structured, prepared and equipped for deployed
operations, and 8% had to be undertaking or planned for sustained
operations. The 40/8 target was adopted at the Riga Summit in 2006, and
it was subsequently revised upwards to 50/10 (Ringsmose and Rynning
2009: 23--24). The Riga Summit also dusted off the traditional GDP input
measure, as the members committed themselves to work towards spending 2%
of GDP on defence. The United States pressured its European partners to
make this commitment to stem the fall in European defence spending that
had occurred since the end of the Cold War (Ek 2007). In addition to
these formal measures, an informal one -- the willingness to put one's
troops into harm's way (risk-sharing) -- emerged as a key burden-sharing
measure as NATO became involved in combat missions. To give an example,
Denmark's willingness to do high-risk combat missions in Southern
Afghanistan, resulting in 43 fatalities, and its contribution in Libya
earned it a lot of praise from the United States (Jakobsen 2016: 201).
By contrast, Germany, the third largest force contributor to NATO's
Afghanistan mission (5.000 personnel), was heavily criticised for its
unwillingness to do combat in the South, and for its unwillingness to
contribute to NATO's Libya mission. The Danish example illustrates how
the Europeans exploited the new set of formal and informal
burden-sharing measures to "keep the Americans in" without meeting all
the U.S. burden-sharing demands. On the one hand, the Europeans made
their forces more deployable and increased their contributions to
out-of-area operations. On the other, they refrained from spending more
on defence. The Post-Crimea era (2014--2016): Input trumps Output This
changed when Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014 turned the
strategic environment in Europe upside down. Suddenly, the military
threat to NATO's European territory had reappeared, and this put NATO
Cold War missions -- territorial defence and deterrence -- back in the
driver's seat. Although out-of-areas missions did not vanish from NATO's
radar completely, they now played second fiddle. The United States
played a key role in shaping the Alliance's response to the rising
Russian threat. The Obama Administration sent aircrafts and soldiers to
Eastern Europe, increased U.S. participation in NATO exercises and took
steps to enable the swift deployment of major U.S. reinforcements in
Eastern Europe. The U.S. was also the key architect behind the Readiness
Action Plan adopted at the 2014 Wales Summit. The **[rise of the Russian
threat facilitated the American efforts to pressure its European allies
to spend more on defence. Frustrated with European free-riding during
the Libya campaign, the Obama Administration had pushed hard since 2011.
These efforts made little progress prior to the Russian annexation of
the Crimea]{.underline}**. After Crimea, the Europeans promised at the
Wales Summit to "halt any decline in defence expenditure" and to "aim to
move towards the 2% (GDP) guideline within a decade". The European
members also committed to meet another existing NATO target to devote
20% of defence expenditures to military procurement and research and
development (NATO 2014). Input measures had reappeared as trumps in the
transatlantic burden-sharing game. Yet, **[the Obama Administration's
attempts to pressure its allies to spend more had limited
success.]{.underline}** While the collective decline in European defence
expenditure was halted, there was little positive movement towards the
2% target as the Europeans' collective defence spending remained
constant at 1.45% of GDP between 2014 and 2016 (NATO 2017: 8). Two
factors accounted for this: diverging threat perceptions of Russia, and
the strong American response to Crimea. **[While the Russian behaviour
in the Ukraine scared the European NATO members bordering Russia into
spending more on defence, the majority of the European members did not
view Russia as a direct military threat to the their national security
(Jakobsen and Ringsmose 2018). Paradoxically, the Obama Administration's
strong reaction to Crimea reinforced this perception, as the American
show of force removed the need for the Europeans to do more
themselves.]{.underline}** The Trump era (2017--): Spend 2% and
contribute more out-of-area or NATO dies. While the threat environment
and NATO's mission set remained unaltered, the election of Mr Trump
changed the dynamics of the burden-sharing game. Before his election,
Trump called the Alliance "obsolete" and said that he only would defend
allies spending 2% of GDP on defence. These threats did not go away
after his election. His Secretary of Defense Mattis made clear in
February 2017 that the United States would "moderate" its commitment to
the Alliance unless the allies spending too little made clear progress
towards honouring the commitments made at the Wales Summit. Secretary of
State Tillerson added another output measure the following month
demanding greater European assistance in the fight against terrorism
(U.S. Department of State 2017). Thus, the Trump Administration not only
demanded more input, it also wanted more output, and it used harsher
rhetoric and threatened more drastic measures if the Europeans did not
comply. While previous administrations had made NATO's longer-term
survival conditional upon greater European burden-sharing, a U.S.
Administration had never before made the defence of an ally facing an
immediate threat contingent upon its defence spending. European
diplomats have criticised the Trump Administration severely for its
unfair and inaccurate portrayal of their NATO contributions. Yet defence
spending is on the rise in most the European member states. 23 of
America's 27 European allies (+ Canada) will increase their spending in
2017, and their combined spending is projected to increase by 4.3% (NATO
2017:2).

This article presented a theory of burden sharing in asymmetric
alliances. I argued that **[allies are more likely to burden share when
their patron can more credibly threaten to abandon them and when the
consequences of abandonment would be more acute for the]{.underline}**m.
Specifically, allies are less likely to burden share when they are more
strategically valuable to their patron and **[more likely when they have
a higher perception of threat, which renders them in greater need of
protection. I tested these expectations using data on US allies'
military expenditures between 1950 and 2010 and found that US allies
vulnerable to attack spend more on defense]{.underline}**, whereas
strategically valuable allies near key maritime chokepoints spend less.
My findings suggest numerous avenues for future research. For one,
although this study focuses primarily on **[the effects of fears of
abandonment as a source of variation in burden sharing, further research
could investigate the effectiveness of other instruments. These include
but are not limited to economic coercion, inducements, and "naming and
shaming" undercontributing states]{.underline}**. A related line of
research could focus on allies' willingness to contribute to collective
goods for reasons unrelated to bargaining or the contributions of other
allies, such as normative considerations and values.118 Additionally,
more research could be done on when patrons actually want their allies
to assume more responsibility for their own defense, as well as on
explaining change over time since my independent variables are
relatively static year to year. Finally, my findings have
**[implications for debates over US grand strategy. Alliances are
central in the debate between those favoring a grand strategy of
"restraint," who advocate reducing US alliance commitments to encourage
burden sharing, and those favoring "deep engagement]{.underline}**," who
argue that reducing support for allies is likely to lead them to become
less cooperative with US preferences and inflame regional security
dilemmas.119 This article suggests **[that US officials may need to lean
into allies' fears of abandonment if they hope to encourage allied
burden sharing. However, the United States is not helpless in shaping
allies' burden sharing]{.underline}** even when it goes to some length
to reassure them by, for example, stationing troops in their territory.
Many of the same conditions that make **[assurances of protection more
necessary---doubts about US credibility, concerns about external
threat---are also favorable for burden sharing]{.underline}**. In these
conditions, **[US policymakers may be able to effectively combine
assurances of protection with threats of abandonment, whether tacit or
explicit.]{.underline}** Thus, the trade-off between reassuring allies
and encouraging burden sharing is not absolute.

My **[hypotheses' predictions fare better than those of alternative
explanations]{.underline}**. First, whereas a **[pure internal balancing
explanation would have predicted all indicators of shared threat to be
positively associated with allied military spending, my theory suggests
that shared external threat has cross-cutting effects]{.underline}**:
**[higher allied perception of threat increases the chances of
successful burden-sharing pressure by making allies more vulnerable to
threats of abandonment]{.underline}**, whereas higher patron perception
of threat has the opposite effect by making allies more valuable and
thus undercutting the credibility of the patron's abandonment threats.
**[Shared threat is only likely to produce greater burden
sharing]{.underline}** to the extent that the former effect outweighs
the latter. Thus, I predicted that land contiguity should have a
positive effect on allied military spending, but that the effects of
other indicators of shared threat are theoretically indeterminate and
likely null (see Table 4). The evidence provides some support for the
internal balancing proposition but on balance more strongly supports my
expectations. Consistent with both explanations, land contiguity with
shared adversaries predicts higher allied military spending. However,
whereas shared adversary capabilities are positively associated with
allied military spending, which is consistent with internal balancing,
the rest of the indicators of shared threat have no clear effect, which
is more consistent with my theory. The effect of shared adversary
hostile behavior is negative and does not reach statistical significance
at conventional levels, whereas allies contiguous to shared adversaries
by sea spend no more than allies not contiguous to a shared adversary.
Allied proximity to shared adversaries in general has no significant
effect; only contiguity to land does (per H1b). This is consistent with
my expectation that allies' proximity to shared adversaries can actually
undercut the United States' ability to pressure them to spend more on
defense by making them more strategically valuable to it, but is not
consistent with a purely threat-based, internal balancing explanation.
Moreover, it is consistent with arguments about the "stopping power of
water"; separation from shared adversaries by water insulates allies
from attack and thus from the patron's threats of abandonment.94
Additionally, there is no evidence that democracies spend substantially
less on defense than nondemocracies, while GDP does not have the
positive effect on defense burdens that Olson and Zeckhauser's economic
theory of asymmetric alliances would predict. Finally, there is no
evidence that the size of US troop presence reduces allied military
spending. Taken together, these results suggest that the ex ante
**[possibility of US abandonment is a better predictor of allied burden
sharing than alternative explanations.]{.underline}** Robustness Checks
Next, in Table A4 in the online appendix, I test the findings'
robustness by using both broader and narrower codings of my main
independent variables---proximity to maritime chokepoints and shared US
adversaries. First, I use alternative proxies for allies' vulnerability
to threat and their geostrategic value that include fewer allies in the
coding. For chokepoints, in some models, I exclude those near China and
Russia in the post--Cold War years, as neither had the power-projection
capabilities of a peer competitor such as the Soviet Union, and China's
capability for power projection by sea significantly grew only in the
later years of the sample. In another model, I expand the coding to
include as a key maritime chokepoint the Strait of Hormuz, as Iran may
have had the ability to at least disrupt access through the
Strait---though its ability to substantially project conventional power
outside the region was quite limited.95 For shared adversaries, in some
models I shrink the coding to include as shared Cold War adversaries
only those countries that had a defense pact with the Soviet Union; this
excludes countries such as China after the 1970s, and Albania after the
late 1960s. In other models, I expand the coding to include during the
post--Cold War period Libya, Serbia, and Syria, as the United States
periodically considered them "rogue states."96 The results are
consistent with the original findings: allies contiguous by land to
shared adversaries spend more on defense, whereas those contiguous to
maritime chokepoints spend less. Exploring Causal Mechanisms: Fear of
Abandonment versus Internal Balancing One challenge in evaluating my
theory is that the predictions of H1a and H1b (the presence of and land
contiguity with shared adversaries) are identical to those one might
make purely on the basis of allies' perceptions of external threat. To
distinguish my findings from this alternative explanation, my approach
is twofold. First, I use an alternative dependent variable: allies'
host-nation support (HNS) for US military presence in their countries.
Because HNS is compensation to the United States, it is both likely to
be the result of American pressure and unlikely to be an internal
balancing response. I use US Department of Defense data on allies' HNS
between 1995 and 2002.97 The findings (shown in Tables A5--A6 in the
online appendix) suggest that countries that share a US adversary and
border it by land provide more HNS. Second, I present **[qualitative
evidence from West Germany and Japan during the 1960s and early
1970s]{.underline}**. I selected these cases to concentrate on variation
in the threat environment by holding other factors as constant as
possible; both countries were large, democratic, close to strategic
chokepoints, hosted the most US troops of any allies, and had
post--World War II legacies that contributed to US fears about a return
to militarism. However, West Germany bordered the Communist bloc by
land, whereas Japan was separated by water. I chose **[the period
because it was one of intense burden-sharing interest: the economies of
US allies had recovered, and meanwhile US dominance was eroding, its
resources constrained by the Vietnam War, and US officials faced
congressional pressure for greater burden sharing.]{.underline}**98 In
these cases, I look for evidence that **[West Germany feared abandonment
more than Japan, that this fear motivated its defense efforts, and that
it responded more to US burden-sharing pressure]{.underline}**. West
Germany Like their predecessors, President John F. Kennedy and his
successor Lyndon Johnson favored a strong West German contribution to
NATO, and throughout the 1960s the FRG spent upward of 1 percent more of
GDP on defense than the rest of European NATO, on average (see Figure
4). Kennedy and Johnson put particular emphasis on the FRG's purchase of
US arms and military equipment, which was dual-purpose: (1) bolstering
West German military capability while also making it more dependent on
US arms; and (2) reducing the US balance of payments deficit, which
produced a large supply of foreign-held US dollars and put pressure on
American gold stocks due to the dollar's convertibility to gold at
\$35/ounce.99 US and West German policymakers negotiated a series of
biannual "offset" agreements wherein the FRG would purchase around \$1
billion in US military equipment. Figure 4. West German military
spending, 1961--75. Display full size **[Kennedy and Johnson frequently
threatened to withdraw US forces from West Germany to pressure it into
greater cost sharing. West German officials repeatedly indicated that
they faced budgetary pressure that would constrain the FRG's military
budget and its offset purchases. However, US officials made it clear to
them that the continued presence of US forces would be contingent on the
size of the FRG defense budget and its offset
purchases]{.underline}**.100 In late 1962, for example, Kennedy warned
Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of "disastrous consequences" if the FRG did
not upwardly revise its budget and follow through on its purchases.101
Likewise, the following year **[Kennedy and his advisers pursued a
sustained pressure campaign that included threats of
withdrawal]{.underline}** in response to lower-than-expected FRG defense
spending plans.102 Johnson continued wielding the threat of withdrawal
when he took office following Kennedy's assassination, culminating in
1966 when his insistence on a larger FRG defense budget with the
agreed-upon offset purchases, combined with recession and budget
deficits in the FRG, contributed to the collapse of West German
chancellor Ludwig Erhard's government and his removal as chancellor.103
Johnson's successor **[Richard Nixon was, if anything, even more
committed to seeking greater West German burden-sharing
contributions]{.underline}**. During **[Nixon's presidency, FRG military
spending rose sharply, from 3% of GDP in 1970 to 4.6% of
GDP]{.underline}** in 1975. Like his predecessors, **[Nixon leaned on
the threat of troop withdrawals.]{.underline}** He **[instructed NATO
officials in 1970 that US contributions to NATO would be partly
dependent on their own contributions]{.underline}**, and he and other US
officials made similar warnings to FRG chancellor Willy Brandt directly.
The following year, all **[NATO capitals were informed that their
burden-sharing contributions would influence US force levels in Europe.
This pressure yielded commitments from the FRG and other NATO members to
increase their defense spending]{.underline}** and improve their
forces.104 The evidence suggests that FRG **[policymakers took the US
threat of abandonment seriously and tailored their defense contributions
to assuage American pressure]{.underline}**. One US official noted in
1969 that the Europeans saw "their defense requirements primarily in
terms of what they need to provide to keep the Americans committed," and
in 1970 the West Germans requested "an indication ... of the minimum
European defense contribution" necessary "to constrain \[US\] budgetary
and congressional pressures."105 Indeed, dating to the 1950s,
**[Chancellor Adenauer and his successors pursued burden sharing not
only to hedge against the possibility of abandonment but also to
explicitly curry favor with the United States]{.underline}**.**[106
Because of their country's vulnerability, FRG officials found it
difficult to turn down US burden-sharing requests, and US policymakers
exploited this]{.underline}**.107 Secretary of State Dean Rusk, for
example, cautioned the German ambassador in January 1963 that geography
made it very dangerous for the FRG to risk defying the United States,
while in 1968 National Security Adviser Walt Rostow stressed the "simple
fact" of German vulnerability to coerce the FRG into signing the Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty.108 A State Department report similarly pointed
to the FRG's position as "an exposed country, with a contiguous border
with the Soviet bloc."109

Given the length of the U.S. commitment to NATO and NATO's central role
in U.S. grand strategy since World War II, **[a U.S. exit might, at
times, have seemed remote.99 However, several factors could make some
allies see it as a possibility. First, because of overwhelming U.S.
power advantages, its alliances are asymmetric]{.underline}**: **[U.S.
allies are more dependent on the United States for security than vice
versa]{.underline}**. This means that the United States could see
changing the status of its alliance commitments as less costly than a
weaker ally might. Second, as noted in Chapter One, **[changing domestic
politics in the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates have led to **[calls from U.S. senior
leadership for making U.S. alliance commitments more contingent on
allied burden-sharing]{.underline}**.100 **[Allies might therefore be
concerned that failure to contribute to a mission that directly
threatened the territory of a NATO member---a core function of
NATO---would lead the United States to further question the value of the
alliance.]{.underline}**

### 2NC INB---L---SC = Freeriding

#### Aff causes free riding but the cp solves it

**Reveron 15**, PhD, Professor @ Naval War College (Derek,
"**[Examining]{.underline}** Department of Defense **[Security
Cooperation]{.underline}**," Committee on Armed Services Hearing, Lexis)

The rationale for security cooperation has been based on the as-
sumption that instability breeds chaos, which would make it more likely
that the U.S. or the international community would face pressure in the
future to intervene. Given America\'s global foreign policy, many
countries have large expectations for assistance from the United States.
But the U.S. also derives benefits from security cooperation. Among
these are obtaining base access as a quid pro quo; augmenting U.S. force
structure by providing logistics and in- telligence support to coalition
partners in the Middle East; pro- moting a favorable balance of power by
selling weapons systems and training programs to Gulf Cooperation
Council countries to balance Iran; harmonizing areas of cooperation by
working with Japan and Israel on missile defense; promoting self-defense
through the Georgia Train and Equip Program; reinforcing sov- ereignty,
like programs such as the Merida Initiative with Mexico; and supporting
the U.S. industrial base and creating interoperable air forces through
the F---35 program. **[At times, security cooperation can
be]{.underline}** limitless, **[dissatisfying]{.underline}**, and
futile. Further, risks abound. First, the non-exclusive nature of these
activities will produce more failures than successes, which negatively
impacts confidence in security cooperation as a tool. Second, the
personnel system is not producing sufficient talent to support these
missions. **[American forces no longer operate in
isolation]{.underline}** and need an appreciation of the historical,
cultural, and polit- ical context of where they operate. Third, **[there
is a tendency to over-rely on partners, thinking they can accomplish
U.S. objectives when they either lack the political motivation or the
skills to do so]{.underline}**. **[Without indigenous political
legitimacy, programs can only have a marginal impact on a country\'s
security and stability]{.underline}**. Finally, **[other countries will
rely on the U.S. to subsidize their own defense budgets, creating a free
rider problem]{.underline}**. Given the disappointments in Syria, Iraq,
and Afghanistan, there is the potential for the value of security
cooperation to be ignored. But these programs are not confined to combat
zones alone. **[When thinking about security cooperation, we should look
at how international partners contribute to coalition
operations]{.underline}**, peacekeeping, and global security. U.S.
budgetary declines will likely reinforce the importance of security
cooperation, as **[the U.S. will need]{.underline}** more **[partners
and allies to augment]{.underline}** its own **[defense
capacities]{.underline}**.

5.1 What Did I Do? This dissertation addressed the question of
**[alliance participation and military spending]{.underline}**. First, I
reassessed an alternative to my bargaining-focused argument--- the
public goods model of alliances. After noting that existing empirical
tests of the public goods logic suffer from model specification and
generalizability problems, I offered an improved empirical test. My
examination of the association between economic weight in alliances and
percentage changes in military spending found little evidence that small
states decrease military spending and large states increase military
spending due to alliance participation. In the second chapter, I showed
that **[deep alliance treaties often decrease non-major power military
spending, but participation in shallow alliances is more likely to
increase non-major power military spending]{.underline}**. Last, I
explored the **[sources of alliance treaty depth.]{.underline}** I
argued that states use **[treaty depth to assuage allied concerns about
treaty reliability in a way that minimizes the domestic audience costs
of international commitment.]{.underline}** **[Because democracies have
higher audience costs from military support, they use treaty depth to
increase alliance credibility]{.underline}**. I then showed that
**[democracies are more likely to form deep alliances using a
statistical analysis and illustrative case study of NATO. 5.2 What Did
We Learn?]{.underline}** We learned four things from this dissertation
project. First, we learned that alliance participation can increase or
decrease military spending. Second, we learned that a **[crucial
prediction of free-riding in alliances based on economic size has
limited empirical support]{.underline}**. Third, we learned that the
**[impact of alliance participation on military spending depends on the
relative bargaining leverage of alliance members difference alliance
members state capability and alliance treaty design.]{.underline}**
Therefore, claims that alliance participation only increases or only
decreases military spending are incomplete, because each applies in a
specific set of circumstances. Last, we learned that **[deep treaties
follow from attempts to establish a credible commitment of military
support]{.underline}** **[between alliance partners while managing the
risk of entrapment]{.underline}**. All told, my findings suggest that
bargaining between alliance members and the credibility of commitment
shape the connection between alliance participation and military
spending. States' leverage over allied military spending depends on how
they design alliances in response to abandonment and entrapment
concerns. Put differently, efforts to ensure credible commitment through
alliance treaty design affect alliance members' military spending.
**[5.3 Why Does it Matter?]{.underline}** My argument and findings
contribute to scholarship on alliance politics and international
relations. I first address two implications for alliance politics
scholarship. After that, I turn to two implications for research on
international institutions and international relations more generally.
**[In alliance politics,]{.underline}** the conventional wisdom about
non-major powers, alliances, and military spending should be revised.
While conventional wisdom expects regular non-major power free-riding, I
find that alliance participation often increases or has little effect on
non-major power military spending. Some alliances do reduce non-major
power military spending, but these alliances are unusually deep and
capable. The findings about when **[non-major powers can reduce military
spending in alliances should also inform debates about US alliances. If
the United States wants allies to spend more on defense, it may need to
change the nature of its alliance commitments]{.underline}**. By
**[increasing the credibility of US commitments, deep US alliances may
undermine attempts to encourage higher allied defense
spending]{.underline}**. The United States formed **[deep alliances to
reassure allied states, but reassurance may be incompatible with
demanding more investment in military capability.]{.underline}**
Therefore, reconciling competing views of alliances in US grand strategy
will be difficult. **[If the United States wants allies to spend more on
defense, less emphasis on credible commitments may be
necessary.]{.underline}** **[If allies have low defense spending, deep
alliances like NATO rarely encourage increases.]{.underline}** This
means that **[deep engagement to reassure partners may lead allies to
maintain low defense spending, which is a common criticism of US
alliances in the restraint school.]{.underline}** In addition to
alliance politics, this dissertation makes two contributions to
international relations scholarship. First, the results provide new
evidence about how states use different policy tools as complements and
substitutes. Arms and alliances are a classic example of substitutes,
but I find that they are complements for non-major powers in shallow
alliances and substitutes in deep alliances. **[Therefore, even if
policies provide the same good, substitution is unusual. It may be hard
to find empirical evidence of substitution in foreign
policy]{.underline}** (Starr, 2000) **[because substitution is rare and
highly conditional.]{.underline}** Second, the argument and findings in
Chapter 3 reinforce the importance of accounting for differences in
institutional design. Studies of trade e.g. (Allee and Scalera, 2012;
Tomz, Goldstein and Rivers, 2007), bilateral investment treaties (Blake,
2013; Simmons, 2014) and the rational design of institutions literature
(Koremenos, Lipson and Snidal, 2001) all acknowledge this point.
Translating theories of institutional heterogeneity into research design
is challenging, however. Many studies of international institutions rely
on state-level aggregate measures. When scholars are interested in
inferring how institutional characteristics modify the consequences of
participation, they could employ variants of the multilevel model in
Chapter 3. If scholars are only interested in estimating the specific
effects of individual institutions, and states are not neatly nested
within institutions, the model in Chapter 2 could facilitate inferences.

#### CP solves free riding by increasing European defense spending

**HUSERAȘ 21** \[Alin HUSERAȘ\*; 2021; "STUDY ON THE EVOLUTION OF

<https://sciendo.com/it/article/10.2478/kbo-2021-0043>\]

Regarding **[the variable share of defense expenditure in
GDP,]{.underline}** it is observed that when the defense expenditure of
states is related to the variable GDP, a new set of data is obtained.
This new series practically reflects the specific weight of defense
spending in the GDP of each state, **[in order to maintain the
functioning of the armies and implicitly to benefit from
defense.]{.underline}** From the econometric study of the influence of
the independent variable the share of defense expenditure in GDP on the
dependent variable defense expenditure, estimated by the PLS method,
**[it was observed that between the two variables there is a linear and
positive dependence. The variable share of defense spending in GDP
reflects the concept and approach (policy / strategy / doctrine) to the
public good of defense, the alliance partners,]{.underline}** found by
the two sides of the Atlantic. This aspect can be easily appreciated by
analyzing the evolution of the data series of the analyzed expenses, as
well as by following the policies of international military
intervention**[. The way in which countries determine the share of
defense spending in GDP may reflect \"free-rider\" behavior, in which
each country tries to rely on the defense spending of the other members
of the Alliance. Consequently, there is an effect of replacing the
country\'s defense spending with that of the entire
Alliance]{.underline}**. This is especially **[evident in the case of
military spending by European countries]{.underline}** compared to the
military spending of North American countries, and especially the United
States.

War and Hot Peace to the Long War and Beyond: What Are Our Armed Forces

Prompted by the crisis, we often talk about spending on new capabilities
such as cyber, but this cannot become a substitute for investing in real
capabilities (cyber would have been of little use in Libya or against
the Taliban) and doing it in a collective, coordinated manner. New
approaches are needed to obtain those capabilities, especially doing
away with many duplicate programmes in Europe. In the United States,
despite the inherent waste of a large defence organisation, the military
manage to derive a greater value from their investments than the
Europeans. **[If Europeans continue in their current approach of just
shrinking their "total war" force instead of reconfiguring it properly
for the age of "limited wars"]{.underline}**, **[the Americans will
simply turn away and leave]{.underline}**. Their executive branch and
the military realise very well that even the **[United
States]{.underline}** **[cannot achieve everything alone and must
cooperate with its allies and partners in Europe]{.underline}**, **[but
this may not arrest the growing sentiment of giving up on Europe felt in
the legislative branch]{.underline}**. On the other hand, some of the
fault for the capability gaps and the steep decline in conventional
heavy capabilities in Europe rests with the United States: many
Europeans wanted to shine in the "coalitions of the willing" led by the
Americans and therefore developed capabilities which bought influence
instead of producing military effectiveness.

#### Effective burden sharing turns case---key to [all aspects]{.underline} of the topic

Global Affairs, Johns Hopkins University, 2021 ISBN: 978-0-9997406-0-6)

Beyond these more traditional issues, **[NATO members must also consider
how to jointly address challenges in disruptive new
domains]{.underline}**. Advances in big data,
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence,
**[hypersonic systems, and quantum technologies]{.underline}** **[are
reshaping how NATO Allies think about deterrence and
conflict]{.underline}**, while simultaneously increasing the scope and
speed of threats. Concerns around issues like
**[disinformation]{.underline}**, **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
vulnerabilities, and espionage are being heightened. Specifically, the
use of **[cyber]{.underline}** technologies can **[adversely impact
critical infrastructure]{.underline}** vital for collective defense (see
Blessing's chapter in this volume). In response, leaders endorsed a
Cyber Defense Policy at the 2021 Brussels Summit which affirmed the
domain's impact on NATO's core tasks and its implications for Article 5
commitments.7 **[Advancement in these new technologies, alongside
growing challenges emanating from]{.underline}** traditionally
non-kinetic or non-military domains like **[space]{.underline}**,
**[will]{.underline}** complicate and potentially **[undermine NATO's
territorial defense commitments.]{.underline}** The increased
militarization of space could create uncertainties around strategic
deterrence, while also threatening various communication technologies
vital to territorial defense (see Johnson's chapter in this volume).
NATO's new military strategy highlights significant risks around many of
these technologies and domains, characterizing a "strategic competition
for advantage."8 Assertive developments in Russian foreign policy (e.g.,
Ukraine and Georgia), alongside its military modernization efforts, will
require NATO to assess how its competitive edge maintains deterrence and
bolsters collective defense (see the chapter by Simakovsky and Williams
in this volume). Russia's investment in more expensive technologies like
hypersonic systems and efforts to infuse conventional capabilities with
hybrid tactics is one facet of this assertive behavior. China's military
modernization efforts and increased engagement in Europe's neighborhood
could also create significant challenges for NATO's core tasks of crisis
management and cooperative security (see the chapter by
Bērziņa-Čerenkova). The new security environment poses difficult
questions for NATO resilience across core tasks and domains.
Consequently, **[resilience will increasingly be featured as a priority
in Alliance thinking]{.underline}**.9 As such, an unclassified
read-ahead document for a conference on NATO's Warfighting Capstone
Concept (NWCC) argued that to project power, NATO must integrate a
multi-domain defense. This means "the Alliance Military Instrument of
Power will need to possess a spectrum of non-lethal, non-kinetic to
lethal kinetic all-domain options to shape the battlespace to NATO's
strengths."10 The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated key resiliency gaps
disrupting NATO's training mission in Iraq, while wreaking havoc on
military exercises and readiness. **[Looking toward the future, other
environmental issues like climate change]{.underline}**---**[alongside
disruptive technological developments]{.underline}**---**[will transform
the security environment]{.underline}**. **[Efforts to increase
resilience across all domains will be critical]{.underline}**. This
should include a focus on layered resilience as outlined by the NWCC
that spans military, military-civilian, and civilian spheres.11
Consequently, NATO member efforts that increase national and broader
institutional resilience should be considered important contributions to
the Alliance's security. Burden Sharing for a New Strategic Environment
Shifts in the strategic environment and emerging challenges put pressure
on NATO's capacity to service its core tasks and mission. **[How Allies
share the burden in the face of these challenges will be central to
NATO's ability to adapt]{.underline}**. The toxicity of defense spending
debates over the past few years have demonstrated certain deficiencies
in the current debate, often putting Alliance disunity on full display
and undermining political will within the alliance. Central to these
tensions is the frequently discussed spending metric of 2 percent of GDP
on defense, which also includes a 20 percent allocation of these funds
on major equipment and research and development. Given its pivotal role
in Alliance burden sharing discussions its worth unpacking how
successful this target has been and whether it needs to be reassessed as
the NATO 2030 process and Strategic Review moves forward.

Historically **[NATO has had the tendency to focus on procedural and
technical interoperability between systems.]{.underline}** To do so,
**[it has employed a standards-based approach and developed hundreds of
Standardization Agreements]{.underline}** (STANAGs) which provide member
states agreed-upon processes, procedures and platform compliance
specifications rather than stipulating what to build and how. While this
approach has allowed member states to equip themselves but still
successfully train and operate together for decades, **[the last 25
years has witnessed a growing rift in the military capabilities of
different nations. Rapid technological evolution and the increasing cost
and complexity of contemporary military systems have made it
progressively more difficult for several countries to keep pace with the
systems of the bigger allies.]{.underline}** For instance, some
countries have invested heavily in advanced systems allowing them to
collect and process intelligence, designate targets and strike them at
will with standoff, precision-guided weapons, day and night in any
weather conditions. **[The level of investment necessary]{.underline}**
to acquire such capabilities, as well as various politico-strategic
concerns such as the protection of a country's military-industrial base
and resultant unwillingness to sell or transfer advanced technologies,
**[have prevented other allies from remaining current with some of these
innovations]{.underline}**. These **[allies therefore lack the ability
to gainfully partake in certain military operations and equally share
the burden with other members of the Alliance]{.underline}**.

**[NATO]{.underline}** has arguably been the most successful alliance of
its kind, and much of this **[success can be attributed to its

notions: **[burden sharing]{.underline}** between members; **[and
interoperability]{.underline}**. The **[Alliance]{.underline}**'s
**[cohesion]{.underline}** however **[has increasingly come under
pressure]{.underline}** over the last two decades, **[and there are
growing challenges with the level of interoperability]{.underline}**
between member countries. While numerous technical and political factors
influence interoperability, **[the emergence of disruptive technologies
such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, additive manufacturing and
robotics, are likely to make this challenge more acute]{.underline}** in
the next two decades. Of the many technologies rapidly emerging, **[none
is likely to have as significant an impact as that of artificial
intelligence]{.underline}**, which combines with other technologies and
multiply their effect by allowing the development of advanced autonomous
systems. And while the latter holds the promise of developing new
classes of weapons with great military potential, its asymmetrical
adoption among the various NATO allies could also lead to significant
interoperability problems.

#### Burden sharing [solves]{.underline} security cooperation over cybersecurity, tech, and hybrid war

Melissa **Dalton 20**, directs the Cooperative Defense Project and is
deputy director and a senior fellow with the International Security
Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in
Washington, D.C; Hijab Shah, associate fellow with the International
Security Program at CSIS, May 2020, "Partners, not Proxies: Capacity
Building in Hybrid Warfare

**[Partners will be vital to the allies' ability to compete effectively
in hybrid warfare environments.]{.underline}** Pursuing partnerships
through a principled approach provides the allies with an asymmetric
advantage in contrast to rivals that resort to autocratic, deceptive,
and extra-legal tactics. **[Allies' laws, principles, and values are
strategic advantages in hybrid warfare]{.underline}**. Investing in
partners rather than casting them as proxies will increase allied
strategic action and operational effectiveness. **[The allies should
select, design, and pursue security partnerships based on the following
guidelines]{.underline}**:

Be the Partner of Choice: **[The allies should be the partners of
choice]{.underline}**. **[They should be reliable, committing up front
to common outcomes and objectives defined with the partner, with clear
communication as to expectations, red lines, duration of the
partnership, and steps that will be taken if the partner makes choices
that depart from a principled approach (e.g., undermining legitimate
civilian authorities, human rights violations, or extra-legal
actions)]{.underline}**. **[They should provide quality training,
advising, and equipment to enable interoperability with the allies and
other partners and sustainment to provide actual military
capability.]{.underline}** They should be transparent with the partner,
civilian authorities, and public about the purpose of and expectations
for the partnership. • Select Partners to Increase "Portfolio Strength":
The allies are fortunate to have a strong network of partners. **[In
seeking new or strengthened partnerships in hybrid warfare environments,
the allies should be more selective of partners, seeking fewer,
higher-quality partners to fortify collective strengths important for
competition in hybrid warfare environments, such as good governance and
transparency.]{.underline}** Partners should be selected for these
attributes and incentivized to make choices that reinforce them.
Recognizing that some partnerships will be transactional, the allies
should calculate risk thresholds and diminishing returns at the outset
and be upfront with the partner to avoid unmet expectations that may do
more damage to allied and partner interests than the value of the
transactional relationship. If a high-quality partner cannot be found,
then allies should determine whether to intervene militarily at all.

Identify Sources of Partner Legitimacy: **[Partner capacity to perform
security missions and political will to complete them are essential
ingredients for successful security partnerships]{.underline}**. Partner
legitimacy is paramount in hybrid warfare environments in terms of how
the civilian authorities and population view local security forces and,
relatedly, the partner's relative control of territory. As competitors
seek to discredit, corrupt, and alienate security actors that do not
accord with their interests, partner legitimacy will be an important
source of resiliency. Defining thresholds and criteria for determining
legitimacy in particular country contexts will be important for the
allies to decide where best to place their engagement and investment.
Working with the partner in parallel to identify ways to regulate
corrupt actors within the partner's governance system will also be
important to strengthening legitimacy.

Plan and Execute Capacity Building Jointly: **[Allies should work
directly with partners to identify outcomes, objectives, milestones, and
conditions for capacity building.]{.underline}** This serves to
strengthen the basis of the partnership, distinguishes it from a proxy
relationship, clarifies intent and expectations, and gives the partner
ownership of the consequences of working with the allies---and vice
versa. Ideally, **[the security partnership can be codified in a
bilateral compact spelling out these terms.]{.underline}** It also
serves as the basis for the allies to address partner transgressions and
to offramp the relationship if the partner deviates from the joint plan.
Capacity-building plans should be made as transparent as possible to
sustain political support through transitions in government in allied
and partner countries and to hold them accountable to strategic, fiscal,
and principle-based goals.

Engage the Partner at the Right Level When Political Choice is Involved:
**[Even in transactional relationships, the allies may have to ask the
partner to operate in new territorial areas, build relationships with
new or difficult local actors, or refrain from taking actions in order
to achieve common goals.]{.underline}** These decisions may transcend
the operational authority of the partner, particularly in contested
environments where the partner's sources of legitimacy are threatened.
**[The allies should seek to engage the partner at the right level where
political decisions can be made, such as when the partner may have to
assume short-term risk to accomplish shared objectives]{.underline}**.
Such engagement will necessarily involve not only allies' military
commanders but, more importantly, its diplomats. **[It will require
close coordination among allied civilian-military leadership,
identification of incentives to persuade the partner, and a credible
explanation of what withdrawing allied support will mean if the partner
says no or deviates from agreed upon next steps.]{.underline}**

Integrate Security Partnerships into a Campaign Approach: **[Security
partnerships should be nested within an adaptable campaign approach to
compete with rivals in support of civilian capabilities]{.underline}**.
Partnerships should not be planned or executed in siloed security or
operational communities but rather fully integrated to achieve political
outcomes and objectives and tailored for specific hybrid warfare
environments. This includes designing and implementing military and
intelligence information operations in support of civilian public
diplomacy and strategic communications to counter disinformation and
misinformation from rivals. Information should be elevated as a "good"
to subvert rivals' agenda by encouraging open and transparent societies
and strengthening the role of and communication with civil society.
Necessarily, a campaign approach will need to adapt over time to changes
in the environment, allies' priorities, and rivals' tactics and
behavior. Allies accordingly should take a long-term view to the return
on political investment in security partners.

In addition, the **[allies should take several concrete steps to be more
strategic and effective in working together while capacity building in
hybrid warfare environments:]{.underline}**

Clarify Definitions, Interests, and Comparative Advantages: The allies
are not on the same page in defining what constitutes hybrid warfare or
capacity building, complicating efforts to work together, deconflict,
and avoid duplication or the undermining of each other's activities. At
a minimum, the allies must decide where hybrid warfare poses risks to
individual state interests and where they can work most usefully
together to reduce their vulnerabilities. This should also include a
shared calculation of where each ally can bring its relative comparative
advantage in planning, resourcing, partner engagement, and deployment of
specific capacity-building tools in support of a civilianled integrated
approach to countering rivals. The allies will have to exercise humility
to be transparent with each other about where they have shortcomings and
where other allies may be better suited for a mission, capability, or
task.

Identify How **[Burden-sharing Creates Opportunities]{.underline}**:
**[Burden sharing enables allies to optimize for their comparative
advantages based on political, economic, cultural, operational, and
informational capabilities]{.underline}**. **[It not only makes fiscal
and strategic sense, but it also can open opportunities for future
combined approaches to planning, resourcing, and
execution.]{.underline}** For example, pooled donor funds used for
northeast Syria stabilization enabled coalition civil-military
operations to proceed even as direct U.S. political and fiscal support
waned. **[This model could be replicated in terms of its bureaucratic
and financial structures for other contexts.]{.underline}**

Create Dynamic Campaign Approaches: **[Hybrid warfare environments will
move swiftly past static coalition plans]{.underline}**, as competitors
routinely test the boundaries and thresholds of what the allies will
abide, **[including coercion of partner institutions, disinformation and
misinformation operations, and cyber intrusions.]{.underline}** The
allies must create dynamic campaigns with an adaptable mandate for
partners that can flex to the evolving threats from competitors while
bound by the guidelines discussed above. Combined allied planning for
campaign design and monitoring and evaluation of its implementation will
be important to calibrate priorities and investments over time.

Invest in "Frontline" Allies to Build Their Capacitybuilding
Competencies: **[Allies with first-hand experience countering hybrid
warfare threats domestically may be well suited to lead capacity
building with security partners in other hybrid warfare
environments.]{.underline}** Investing in those allies and giving them a
leading role with partners thus can leverage proven strategies and
tools. For example, Canada's cooperation with Latvia and Lithuania has
strengthened the Baltic allies' ability to provide capacity building in
Ukraine, thereby also reinforcing NATO's collective strength and
competencies, which can be applied in other theaters.

### 2NC INB---Turns Peace Ops

#### Good burden-sharing alleviates excessive duties from the US, strengthens alliances, and promotes peace\-\-- empirically proven by successful UN burden-sharing.

/alundy\]

**[Peacekeeping by the United Nations offers an important example of
what burden-sharing means and what elicits it]{.underline}**. During the
Cold War, UN peace operations were confined to interposing a deployment
between formerly warring parties. The clash of the Cold War superpowers
as veto-wielding United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members meant
that was all the traffic would bear. In settings like Cyprus and
Lebanon, **[long-standing deployments kept additional military duties
off the U.S. plate through decades of the Cold War]{.underline}**. The
Cold War's end ushered in more numerous and ambitious UNSC mandates---as
**[the United States and Russia were more often willing to align on
authorizing peace operations]{.underline}**. In the 1990s, along with a
couple of dramatic failures marred by murky mandates (in Bosnia and
Rwanda, where excessive impartiality left atrocities to occur on
peacekeepers' watch), an array of peace operations took hold with a
variety of governance and post-conflict goals beyond the traditional
interpositional model.

Before even addressing questions of who pays what and who contributes
how many troops, **[peace operations are]{.underline}** by nature **[an
exercise in burden-sharing benefiting the United States]{.underline}**.
**[With collective defense]{.underline}**, expeditionary and
stabilization deployments globally, **[the U.S. military footprint is
immense]{.underline}**. Whether midwifing a new nation in East Timor or
containing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, UN peace
operations **[provide for other functions to be outsourced with quite
limited U.S. roles]{.underline}.** A February 2018 Government
Accountability Office study found that a hypothetical U.S. peacekeeping
operation in the Central African Republic of the same size and duration
as the UN's Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the
Central African Republic (MINUSCA) operation would cost the United
States some eight times more than its share for MINUSCA. And this good
bargain affords the United States a major voice as a member of UNSC's
permanent five (P-5) on what missions will and will not be approved to
boot.

### 2NC INB---China---Asia Pivot Now

#### Asia pivot under Biden now

**Sun 6/23** (Yun Sun, Senior Fellow of the East Asia Program at the
Stimson Center on U.S-China relations, 7/4/22, "After Biden\'s pivot to
Asia, China feels the chill",
<https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-china-watcher/2022/06/23/after-biden-pivots-to-asia-china-feels-the-chill-00041590>)
//sethlee

**[The Biden administration, hoping to counter China's growing influence
in Asia, has initiated several high-level engagements with Asia in
recent months,]{.underline}** ranging from summits to a presidential
visit to the region. Despite lukewarm reception at home, it's now clear
that Washington's Asia pivot caused much anxiety in China.

**[The administration\'s outreach started with Southeast
Asia]{.underline}** --- the U.S.-ASEAN Special Summit in Washington in
mid-May followed by President JOE BIDEN's high-profile visit to South
Korea and Japan on May 19-24. In Japan, **[Biden attended a summit with
leaders of Japan, Australia and India (the Quad) and launched the
long-expected[ Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/23/asian-nations-biden-indo-pacific-economic-framework-00034247).]{.underline}**

**[Despite the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the administration has tried
to keep its focus on China as the most consequential strategic challenge
of the U.S.; Russia by comparison is considered the "acute" yet
short-term threat.]{.underline}** Washington is confident that it can
walk and chew gum at the same time, namely countering both Russia and
China simultaneously in two theaters.

China was not directly included in last month's Asian activities but its
presence loomed large over them. The focus on the Asia campaign came at
a time of China's "strategic low tide," as it dealt with myriad domestic
issues, including the Covid-19 pandemic.

**[The anxiety that the outreach generated in Beijing was not limited to
Biden's comment in Tokyo that the U.S. will intervene militarily if
China attacks Taiwan]{.underline}**. More unsettling for Beijing was the
public commitment by U.S. allies --- South Korea and Japan --- to the
peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait, which implied potential roles
for them in a future Taiwan contingency.

China has gradually grown to the prospect of Japanese involvement, given
U.S. military bases there. However, Beijing is much less prepared for a
similar South Korean role.

### 2NC INB---China---Burden Sharing Solves 

#### An independent EU successfully manages and de-escalates Sino-U.S. hegemonic competition. 

**Besch et al. 20**, \*Sophia Besch is a senior research fellow at the

focus on EU Common Defence and Security Policy, European defence

policy in April 2013. Prior to that, he was a member of the British
diplomatic service for 28 years. (September 21st, 2020, "Europe, the US
and China: A love-hate triangle?",
https://www.cer.eu/publications/archive/policy-brief/2020/europe-us-and-china-love-hate-triangle#section-summary)

Conclusion

**[The US and China]{.underline}** both **[have a tendency to treat the
EU as an object]{.underline}** of international relations **[rather than
a subject]{.underline}** -- **[competing to enlist it on their
side]{.underline}**, **[or to prevent it aligning with the other
side]{.underline}**, **[but not treating it as having
agency]{.underline}**. **[The EU often plays to]{.underline}** this
image of **[passivity]{.underline}**, **[seeming always to follow others
in reacting to crises]{.underline}** -- its initial response to the
COVID-19 pandemic being an example of that. But **[in
reality]{.underline}**, **[the EU has power]{.underline}**, **[if it can
agree internally on how to use it.]{.underline}** As Charles Michel,
President of the European Council, said after the EU-China leaders'
videoconference on September 14th, **[Europe needs to be a
player]{.underline}**, **[not a playing field.]{.underline}**

**[Europe should not get sucked into a contest between China and the US
for global hegemony]{.underline}**. Instead, **[the EU should use
whatever influence it can to ensure that both sides exercise their power
with restraint and in a framework of rules]{.underline}**, **[not simply
on the basis]{.underline}** (as Thucydides wrote) that "**[the strong do
what they can]{.underline}**, **[while the weak suffer what they
must]{.underline}**".

**[Europe should also accept that China is not converging with the
West]{.underline}** politically or in terms of its values:
**[the]{.underline}** '**[responsible stakeholder']{.underline}** **[era
is over almost before it began.]{.underline}** Chinese and Western
interests will sometimes align, but Xi has shown less willingness than
his predecessors to slot China into the existing international system.

At the same time, it is impossible to know where Xi's policies will lead
China in the long term. Some scholars argue that the Chinese Communist
Party's rule has been made dysfunctional and brittle by Xi's
centralisation of
power.[51](https://www.cer.eu/publications/archive/policy-brief/2020/europe-us-and-china-love-hate-triangle#FN-51)
Other analysts believe that China's rise is world-transforming and its
growing influence
irresistible.[52](https://www.cer.eu/publications/archive/policy-brief/2020/europe-us-and-china-love-hate-triangle#FN-52)
Europe should remember the (possibly apocryphal) story of Chinese Prime
Minister Zhou Enlai's 1972 verdict on the results of the French
revolution: "Too early to tell". It will be a long time before Xi's
policies can be judged successful or otherwise. Meanwhile, **[the EU
should]{.underline}** remain open to economic and other forms of
co-operation with China where they are to Europe's benefit; **[resist
Chinese activity that harms European states and institutions or their
allies]{.underline}**; **[and invest resources and diplomatic effort in
enabling]{.underline}** international **[organisations to adapt to the
rise of China without breaking]{.underline}**.

The Trump era has made the EU's job harder: Trump has deprived Europe of
its most important partner in defending the rules-based international
order and universal values. But **[the EU cannot afford to leave the
future of the world to be settled in a series of trials of strength
between Beijing and Washington]{.underline}**. When relations between
the US and China looked rosier, there was talk of a 'G2' to deal with
the problems of the world. That was never a realistic construct. **[For
the foreseeable future]{.underline}**, **[the three big economic and
political powers in the world will be China]{.underline}**, **[the EU
and the US]{.underline}**, **[and the triangular relations between them
will contain elements of attraction and elements of
hostility]{.underline}**. Western firms will still want to tap the
Chinese market, while governments worry about threats to national
security; Chinese families will still want their children to study in
the West, while the Communist Party worries about the ideological
contamination they might bring back; and Europe and the US will still be
each other's most important security and economic partners, while
bickering about defence budgets and food safety. **[In the absence of a
friction-free utopia]{.underline}**, **[the EU's best option is to work
with Beijing and Washington to pursue pragmatic policies that maintain
stable relations between the three.]{.underline}**

#### Burden sharing is key 

**Mohan '21** (Raja Mohan, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Public
Institute, "A New Pivot to Asia",
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/01/15/biden-china-asia-allies-strategy-pivot/>)
//sethlee

On globalization, **[the United States cannot continue to let China play
fast and loose with the ideas of economic internationalism and national
sovereignty. Beijing clothes its ambition for regional economic
dominance in the rhetoric of globalization but at the same time
champions state sovereignty when it's convenient.]{.underline}** Rather
than frame its policies as a choice between the ideologies of "America
First" and "globalism," Washington needs to articulate the case for a
new mix of sovereignty and internationalism. That is the only basis for
designing a new set of rules for international economic cooperation that
can win lasting domestic political support. After all, the difficult
decisions on the equitable domestic distribution of economic
globalization's costs and benefits are intensely political---and must
necessarily be made and owned by national governments.

**[Although burden sharing has long been part of U.S. foreign-policy
rhetoric, it has always ceded ground to the presumed imperatives of U.S.
leadership]{.underline}**. Trump's clumsy efforts to force the issue of
burden sharing on U.S. allies has only made matters worse. **[But
looking from the outside in, it is unrealistic for allies to expect that
the American taxpayer and U.S. military will forever bear the burden of
securing Europe and Asia. The last few years have seen both regions
recognize this problem, but there will be a strong temptation to
backslide, with allies betting that Biden will take them back to the
happy, free-riding days of old]{.underline}**. For the United States,
too, it is important to recognize that its leadership is creating a
moral hazard among its allies who refuse to take responsibility for
their own security, expect the United States to do the heavy lifting,
get complacent about threats, and criticize Washington for confronting
these threats. Regional responsibility and burden sharing are critical
for making the alliances survive the new challenges.

#### NATO burden-sharing allows the U.S to focus on Asia

**Larsen '21** (Henrik Larsen, Ph.D and senior researcher at the Center
for Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
Zurich, "NATO Shouldn't Try to Do Too Much on China"
<https://thediplomat.com/2021/07/nato-shouldnt-try-to-do-too-much-on-china/>)
//sethlee

Second, NATO should clarify the meaning of "resilience" by linking it as
closely as possible to collective defense and national security.
**[China]{.underline}** is not a territorial threat to NATO, but its
**[acquisition of transportation hubs in Europe and future capacity to
neutralize space-based navigation systems (like GPS) present
vulnerabilities to NATO force mobility in a crisis situation. Moreover,
it should not be forgotten that Chinese 5G networks threaten continued
NATO intelligence sharing.]{.underline}**

Conversely, NATO is not always the right actor to prevent the intrusion
of illiberal powers into the domestic politics of its allies**[.
Increased levels of espionage from [both China and
Russia](https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-china-pay-spies-price-europe-us-2021-3?r=US&IR=T) call
for increased cooperation across the NATO intelligence
services.]{.underline}** But NATO does not seem to have a natural role
in, for example, bolstering police cooperation to fight other types of
criminal activity, such as weaponized corruption, illicit party
financing, and outsourcing of influence operations, as
earlier [proposed](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2017-12-05/how-stand-kremlin) by
President Joseph Biden to face both Russia and China.

**[Third, NATO should contemplate how it can strengthen internal
cohesion in the face of a China that seeks to co-opt elites in illiberal
states like Hungary and Turkey.]{.underline}** Democratic setbacks are a
problem, but it is questionable whether [enhanced NATO monitoring and
criticism](https://www.nato.int/nato2030/young-leaders/) of allies would
make any difference**[. Rather, NATO should focus on military burden
sharing as a formula for alliance cohesion. China's rise highlights why
the Europeans must contribute more to the [defense of their own
continent](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2020.1851080) to
allow the United States to focus its military resources on
Asia.]{.underline}**

In adapting to the China challenge, the United States stands at one
extreme: It may have dropped the idea of a global NATO, but wants the
alliance to expand into non-military security to contain its growing
influence in Europe. The Eastern and many of the Central European
countries stand at the other extreme, wanting NATO to remain focused on
collective defense with Russia as the main threat. **[Reconciling the
aspirations toward a "democratic bulwark" with the traditional role a
defense alliance may strike an appropriate balance for NATO to agree on
a realistic China policy by the summit next year.]{.underline}**

#### Burden sharing allows the US to focus on China

**Felde '22** (Rainer Meyer zum Felde, Institute for Security Policy at
Kiel University, 6/12/22, "Russia-China Relations", 261-262,
<https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-97012-3.pdf>)
//sethlee

**[Europeans need to accept transatlantic burden shifting]{.underline}**
in order to "keep the Americans in". **[While significantly fewer US
forces and capabilities will be available for fighting and winning a
regional war in Europe, some European NATO allies,]{.underline}**
including Germany as a key member, **[have long hesitated to fully
implement their current commitments and were not even considering
further upgrades in response to the deteriorating geopolitical
situation]{.underline}** (Meyer zum Felde, 2020b). **[US representatives
have been clear in recent years that the US military is no longer able
to fight and win two major wars simultaneously in Europe and the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}**, and that **[the primary US focus is
shifting toward China (Russia is perceived as the near-term, but China
as the long-term and more difficult, bigger challenge;]{.underline}**
see Colby, 2021b). **[It follows that Europeans need to take on much
more of the burden of deterring and defending NATO member states in
Europe against Russia]{.underline}**. Against this background, the NATO
capstone documents for NATO defense planning agreed at Wales, Warsaw and
Brussels have all been designed toward a fairer transatlantic
burden-sharing and more European forces, capabilities and contributions.
However**[, in terms of implementation, European member
states]{.underline}**---first and foremost Germany**[---have taken a
steady but rather slow approach in their turnarounds and implementation
efforts. What remains required in Europe vis-à-vis Russia is significant
US military presence and power, particularly in critical capability
areas---extended nuclear deterrence, critical enablers and force
multipliers, air power, naval power, cyber. In return, Europeans need to
accept the US request for burden shifting and take more responsibility
for filling the gaps in NATO's deterrence and defense
posture.]{.underline}** This applies particularly to Germany, despite
its obvious unwillingness to keep its pledges and again play its role as
the conventional backbone for collective defense in Europe. Whether or
not Europe will be able to maintain its security depends first and
foremost on the USA, and next on Germany. **[Both need to take their
responsibilities seriously, and consequently accept that in military
burden sharing and shifting, they have to take their fair share
according to their political and economic weight]{.underline}**. Above
all, it is essential for Europe's security that both give the Russian
leadership no reason to change its risk calculus.

#### Equal burden sharing is key to US interests\-\-- including presence in Asia.

**Monie, 21** \[Connor Monie, PhD student in political science at the
Schar School of Policy and Government, 4-14-2021, Schar School of Policy
and Government, George Mason University, 'Perennial Friction: NATO and
Burden Sharing Concerns',
<https://csps.gmu.edu/2021/04/14/perennial-friction-nato-and-burden-sharing-concerns/>
/alundy\]

President Biden comes into office with a similar gripe against wealthy
European allies. **[Defense spending has increased in recent years, yet
many European governments remain unwilling to allocate the amount of
resource sought by their American counterpart. Geopolitical trends will
only serve to intensify US entreaties for greater equality in defense
burdens]{.underline}**: the focus on Beijing as Washington's primary
adversary will continue to put budgetary pressures on US military
commitments in Europe. President Biden will be forced to walk a
tightrope between his stated goal of revitalizing the transatlantic
community and the tradeoffs associated with a focus on the Indo-Pacific.

President Biden and his team face the same perennial problem vis-à-vis
NATO that their predecessors faced: **[stronger allies tend to absorb
disproportionate costs in providing security for all members and chafe
at that imbalance]{.underline}**. [Some
scholars](https://www-tandfonline-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00396338.2015.1046229) argue
that free-riding is less harmful than it is often described to be and
that the rhetoric often distorts
reality. [Others](https://www.csis.org/analysis/counting-dollars-or-measuring-value) contend
that standard metrics of burden sharing measure the wrong things,
resulting in biased estimates of national defense contributions. Still
others posit that smaller allies rationally pay a smaller share of
alliance costs, whether because [they offer different
concessions](https://www-jstor-org.mutex.gmu.edu/stable/pdf/2111499.pdf?casa_token=VcMBq0JNp2oAAAAA:qHZ4m0-aT5eK5ehnQtwolNOOicZKmMf5wqLNIt3lw9V4h7mPny4ajDXYRfqlzWVdBrXaQeMO6TrNxHelFAbOCjtMoolSy5Gq3Nv6BMSkUOmI_FL7ppl2RQ) or
because they are [incentivized by group dynamics to shirk
costs](https://www-jstor-org.mutex.gmu.edu/stable/257966?sid=primo&origin=crossref&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents).
Whatever the case may be, **[the US interest in inducing Europeans to
spend more on defense]{.underline}** --- and their disinclination to do
so --- **[will persevere]{.underline}** throughout President Biden's
time in office.

Pleasing rhetoric notwithstanding, President Biden is likely to continue
in the tradition of post-Second World War presidents **[by prodding the
Europeans to expand their contributions to NATO]{.underline}**. **[This
tradition traces its roots through decades of American foreign policy
all the way back to NATO's inception.]{.underline}** Moreover, current
trends in US interests are likely to exacerbate the Biden team's
preference for greater European self-sufficiency in the defense sphere.
Though the style of the new administration will certainly be a departure
from President Trump's antagonistic approach, this feature of US
relations toward the NATO alliance will endure. The task of President
Biden **[is to simultaneously placate European fears of US disengagement
in light of its emphasis on the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}** while
appearing credible enough in its demands for European contributions that
the Europeans take notice. **[This will be a difficult endeavor, but
also a necessary one if the US is to synchronize its disparate
commitments, interests, and regional force postures.]{.underline}**

### 2NC INB---China---China War !

#### U.S.-China war goes [nuclear]{.underline}\-\--there's no brakes on escalation. 

**Kulacki 16**, the China Project Manager in the UCS Global Security

Troubling Lack of Urgency",
https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2016/05/Nuclear-War-with-China.pdf)

No Technical Exit **[As long as both sides remain committed
to]{.underline}** pursuing **[technical solutions]{.underline}** to
their unique strategic problems, **[they are condemned to continue
competing indefinitely]{.underline}**. But **[stalemate]{.underline}**
is not a stable outcome; rather, it **[is a perpetual high-wire
act]{.underline}**. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, **[the
governments of the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
China are a few poor decisions]{.underline}** **[away from starting a
war that could escalate rapidly and end in a nuclear
exchange]{.underline}**. Lack of mutual trust and **[a growing
sense]{.underline}** that their **[differences may be
irreconcilable]{.underline}** **[incline both governments
to]{.underline}** continue **[looking for military
solutions]{.underline}**---for new means of coercion that help them feel
more secure. **[Establishing]{.underline}** the **[trust]{.underline}**
needed to have confidence in diplomatic resolutions to the
dis-agreements, animosities, and suspicions that have troubled leaders
of the United States and the PRC for almost 70 years **[is extremely
difficult when]{.underline}** both **[governments take every new effort
to up the technological ante as an act of bad faith]{.underline}**. The
bilateral dialogues on strategic stability aim to manage the military
competition, but they do not seek to end it. Although the two
governments work very hard at avoiding conflict, **[they have yet to
find a way out of what]{.underline}** Graham Allison called their
"**[Thucydides trap]{.underline}**"---**[the risk of conflict between a
rising power and an established power]{.underline}** invested in the
status quo (Allison 2015). Allison's warning not to minimize the risks
of war is sage advice, even if he does not say how the United States and
China can escape the trap he describes. **[PRC leaders believe it is
possible to prosecute a major war without risking a U.S. nuclear
attack.]{.underline}** The **[leaders of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[believe stopping the PRC from prosecuting
such a war may depend]{.underline}**, in certain contingencies, **[on a
credible threat to use nu-clear weapons]{.underline}**---**[a
threat]{.underline}** U.S. leaders state **[they are prepared to
execute]{.underline}**. These **[mismatched perceptions]{.underline}**
**[increase]{.underline}** both **[the possibility of war and the
likelihood it will result in]{.underline}** the use of **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. Well-informed U.S. officials tend to dismiss the
possibility that the United States and the PRC could wander into a
nuclear war. For example, Admiral Dennis Blair, a former Director of
National Intelligence whose final military post was Commander in Chief
of the U.S. Pacific Command, assured a large gathering of U.S.
arms-control experts that "the chances of a nuclear exchange between the
United States and China are somewhere between nil and zero." J.
Stapleton Roy, a former U.S. ambassador to the PRC, wholeheartedly
agreed (Swaine, Blair, and Roy 2015). Similarly, PRC military
strategists and arms control experts believe that the risk of nuclear
war with the United States is not an urgent concern even if that risk
may not be zero (Cunningham and Fravel 2015). **[This lack of urgency is
troubling]{.underline}**. For example, the United States reportedly told
the PRC it would risk military escalation to prevent or stop a proposed
PRC island reclamation project in the Scarborough Shoal (Cooper and
Douglas 2016). The PRC reportedly responded by committing to move ahead
with the project later in 2016 (Chan 2016). **[This]{.underline}**
particular **[contest of wills is part of a steadily increasing number
of unresolved diplomatic spats that have escalated to the level of overt
military posturing reminiscent of U.S.-Soviet jousting]{.underline}**
during the Cold War. The United States and the PRC are decades-old
enemies, preparing for war and armed with nuclear weapons. **[Good faith
efforts]{.underline}** by the leaders of both nations **[have
failed]{.underline}** to stop accelerating preparations for war,
including new investments in their nuclear forces. Miscommunication,
misunderstanding, or **[poor judgment could spark a conflict that both
governments may find difficult to stop]{.underline}**. War between the
United States and the People's Republic of China is not inevitable, but
failing to acknowledge the risks is certain to make it more likely. Both
governments should confront these risks with a greater sense of purpose.
Only then will they devote the same measure of creativity, effort, and
resources to the diplomacy of reducing those risks as they now spend
preparing for war.

Any European contribution, whether in deterring or fighting China in the
Indo-Pacific, is not likely to offset the effort the United States
expends on defending Europe. **[The reason for the dominant U.S. role in
European security institutions has been to prevent a hostile power from
overrunning enough of the continent to pose a threat to the United
States.]{.underline}** In contrast to their relative insignificance in
the Indo-Pacific, **[the three main European powers jointly have the
economic potential and political clout in key European institutions to
lead the effort of building collective defense capable of deterring
Russia.]{.underline}** The United Kingdom, France, and Germany assuming
the responsibility for the conventional aspect of European defense would
serve the United States, **[as the U.S. military shifts focus to Asia. A
better division of labor within NATO would also ensure the security
architecture in Europe reflects the threats Europeans perceive, not
those the United States decides for them.]{.underline}**

Russia is the only plausible threat to the territorial integrity of
Europe. The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the war in eastern
Ukraine resulted in a sustained increase in military spending in
Europe's major powers. The United Kingdom has increased its annual
military spending by 13 percent in real terms since 2014, France by 16
percent, and Germany by 37 percent. **[Major European powers can spend
even more if they perceive Russia to be threatening
enough]{.underline}**, but their combined military spending already
exceeds Russia's.

Even with spending increases**[, however, European militaries face
readiness challenges that will require political attention and
coordination.]{.underline}** Germany still must address chronic
equipment and staffing shortages. Twenty percent of its military
personnel positions above the junior level remain vacant. Only a little
more than half of France's military aircraft are combat-ready---the
"Achilles' heel" of the French armed forces, according to the French
defense minister, Florence Parly. Combat readiness is a problem that
affects other branches of the French military, too, owing in part to
France's extended global posture from the Sahel to the Pacific. The
pursuit of global power projection capabilities in the Indo-Pacific,
especially if it increases, will distract from creating a conventional
force calibrated to the task of deterring Russia in coalition with other
European partners.

Another critical missing piece of collective European defense is
interoperability between national militaries that would allow for rapid
deployment of coalition forces to areas of conflict, such as
northeastern Europe. Rather than devoting more attention to achieving
interoperability in naval operations with partners such as Japan, India,
and Australia, **[European powers should integrate their militaries with
the overarching goal of defeating Russia in a high-intensity
conflict.]{.underline}**

#### Absent adequate burden sharing, NATO [fails]{.underline}, and Russia is [emboldened.]{.underline}

**[At the NATO summit]{.underline}** in July in Brussels, **[heads of
state and government]{.underline}** will **[convene to evaluate our
current defense capabilities.]{.underline}**  One topic that will be
**[high on the agenda is]{.underline}** a discussion of **[burden
sharing]{.underline}**.  It is an undeniable fact that **[many  NATO
allies are struggling to overcome years of declining defense
budgets]{.underline}**.   As a result of this prolonged underinvestment,
several countries who boast cutting edge technolgies in other fields are
risking their security and short-changing their soldiers, sailors, and
airmen by leaving them to work  with aging and worn out military
hardware.

In our dangerous world, **[we need all NATO members to invest so that
our defense provides a robust and meaningful deterrent]{.underline}**. 
As every Danish taxpayer knows, **[the system only works if everyone is
willing to pay their fair share of the bill]{.underline}** -- "man skal
yde før man kan nyde." (**[you have to make an effort because you can
enjoy the benefits]{.underline}**)

**[NATO is the bedrock of our collective defense]{.underline}** and an
unbreakable bond that unites us together.  At the NATO meeting in Wales
in 2014, we all made a solemn pledge to reinforce our commitment to
deterrence, defense and capabilities.  Four years later, however,
**[less than one third of NATO's members have achieved the mutually
agreed upon goal]{.underline}** to spend 2 percent of their GDP on
defense.

In the meantime, **[while NATO has been waiting for Alliance
members]{.underline}** to meet their full and fair financial
obligations, **[we have seen some startling developments on the
international scene]{.underline}**:  Syria's Bashar Al-Assad has
continued to slaughter his own people on an unprecedented scale, a
resurgent Iran has increased its malign influence and destabilizing
activities in the Middle East, and **[Russia has persisted in flouting
international law]{.underline}**, institutions and norms -- not least on
the Alliance's eastern border.

Let's make no bones about it, **[Russia's aggressive behavior is a
threat to stability and security, especially for European
nations]{.underline}**.  Its annexation of Crimea, its support for the
separatists fighting Ukrainian forces in the country's east, its
military build-up, **[its threats to NATO members]{.underline}**, its
carpet bombing of Syrian opposition forces and civilians and its
exploitation of Western vulnerabilities **[are all issues of grave
concern that threaten our collective security.  We have to take this
reality seriously]{.underline}**.  America has to take it seriously. 
And Europe has to take it seriously.  We are open to engagement, but we
also must continue to raise the costs of aggression.

There can be no doubt that Denmark is one of the Alliance's most crucial
partner nations and one of America's most enduring partners and allies. 
For decades the United States and Demark have fostered deep bonds based
on our mutual respect for international law, the principles of democracy
and human rights.  Moreover, with bold and brave conributions, Denmark's
forces on missions abroad are vital to NATO.  In order for Denmark to
continue to be able to provide its outstanding contributions, however,
**[new investment is desperately required]{.underline}**.  The United
States welcomes Denmark's decision to cease its defense cuts, as
outlined in the new Danish defense agreement.  The agreement is a good
start, putting the country on the right trajectory to increase needed
investments, but much more remains to be done.  To make possible Danish
contributions in the future and to ensure that "mand skal yde før mand
kan nyde," additional investment is needed.

**[The United States is a disproportionate NATO
supporter]{.underline}**.  Last year **[the American people spent a
staggering 3.5 percent of their GDP on defense]{.underline}** -- nearly
double the target of 2 percent that all NATO members agreed to in 2014. 
**[In]{.underline}** Denmark, Germany, Italy and **[many other member
countries, the number barely crossed the one percent
threshold]{.underline}**.  Looking at these figures, it is difficult not
to be reminded of the words, earlier this year, of Secretary of Defense
Jim Mattis, when he noted it is unreasonable for our allies to ask
Americans to care more for their children's future security than they do
themselves.

The United States has always stood by its NATO commitment and will
continue to do so in the future.  Regardless of size, **[all NATO
nations can be equally secure in US support for Article
5]{.underline}**.  That said, as we approach the Brussels summit, it
would be befitting for Denmark and other countries to develop a firm,
credible and sustainable plan for how they intend to meet the pledge
they gave in Wales just four years ago.

For the last 70 years, NATO has embodied the transatlantic bond of which
we are all justly proud and, I for one, am ultimately confident that
NATO will build a consensus around this difficult issue as it has
succeeded in doing so many times before.  **[It is]{.underline}**
precisely **[this shared willingness to make sacrifices for the good of
all that defines the Alliance]{.underline}.**

By making the right choices now we can ensure the safety and prosperity
of all our peoples in the years to come.  **[It is imperative that we
commit clearly and emphatically to fair burden sharing -- the futures of
our children depend on it.]{.underline}**

### 2NC INB---Russia---Europe Key

#### Interest asymmetry means only a [resolved Europe]{.underline} signals NATO has a stake in Baltic defense.

**[The provision with bite is article 5]{.underline}** --- that is,
members agree "that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all,"
and in response, NATO will assist by taking "such action as it deems
necessary, including the use of armed force." Yet, **[even this
provision is not that strong]{.underline}**. **[It doesn't commit
members to take military action in all cases]{.underline}** of armed
attack against a member. For example, **[Germany is not obligated to
attack Russia if the latter invades Estonia]{.underline}**.
**[Collective self-defense is subject to pragmatic considerations of
expediency and self-interest.]{.underline}**

In other words, **[while NATO might provide limited deterrence against
Russian adventurism]{.underline}**, **[this is largely predicated
on]{.underline}** adversely **[impacting U.S.
self-interest]{.underline}**. Put differently, **[Russia is not so naïve
as to be deterred by the prospect of a military response from Europeans
when U.S. interests are not affected]{.underline}**. **[Russia knows
that the Germans and French are unlikely to sacrifice their
troops]{.underline}** or commercial interests and go to war **[if Russia
acts aggressively]{.underline}** against, say, Poland. Therefore, if
deterrence is the goal, **[America must decide what price it is willing
to pay]{.underline}** to save Poland --- **[and who should foot that
bill.]{.underline}**

At present, **[European states are gambling on the U.S.
paying]{.underline}**, **[even though they have more to lose than the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[from Russian
aggression]{.underline}**. **[It may be time]{.underline}** for Trump
**[to call that bluff and make them pay up if they really care about
security]{.underline}**. If they don't, the United States might be
better off creating a new alliance of willing states that are prepared
to contribute to collective security against modern threats including
cyber attacks and other forms of warfare. That might guarantee better
protection for Poland and Estonia than do their free-riding neighbors.

#### European defense [interests have diverged]{.underline} from the US\-\--need for increased [burden sharing]{.underline}

Since 1945, **[Europe has been in a situation that has never occurred
since the fall of the Roman Empire: it has largely lost its
responsibility for defending itself.]{.underline}** Several countries in
Eastern Europe underwent Soviet domination from 1945 to the 1980s, which
for half a century deprived them of the possibility of determining their
own defence policy. In Western Europe, in the context of the Cold War,
the **[European countries by and large placed themselves under US
protection, in the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)]{.underline}** created by the Washington Treaty of 4 April 1949.
Only two countries have chosen to maintain an autonomous capacity to
defend their vital interests by rapidly acquiring nuclear arms: the
United Kingdom (which has had nuclear weapons since 1952) and France
(which has had them since 1960). Even today, the United States accounts
for about two-thirds of NATO efforts. The situation now, however, is
that faced with the growing challenge of China\'s hyper-power status,
the United States has made clear to its European allies that it no
longer intends to play such a substantial role in the defence of Europe.
That is what the **[United States means by its regularly repeated demand
for "burden-sharing." By the time of the 2006 Riga Summit, the allies
had agreed to raise their national spending to a minimum of 2% of
GDP.]{.underline}** It was in this context, that this prospect was
confirmed at the 2014 NATO Summit held at Newport, by a specific
commitment that the allies would make that figure the goal to be reached
in 10 years.29(\*) A second goal was that at least 20% of these defence
budgets would be allocated to equipment purchases. In fact, **[the end
of the Cold War led the European States to believe that they would be
able to "collect the dividends of peace" by continuously reducing their
defence efforts.]{.underline}** The significant element of this new
context is that two developments not directly related to one another
have met and converged: - On the one hand, **[the United States has
found itself facing challenges on a global level of a kind not seen
since the Second World War, and has felt the burden of its commitment to
European defence more acutely;]{.underline}** - On the other hand, the
**[European States have become increasingly aware of the threats they
face, especially in the wake of Russia\'s annexation of Crimea. This was
a symbolic shock, because it dramatically manifested Russia\'s will and
ability to challenge internationally recognised borders,]{.underline}**
including those that it had itself recognised until then. Source: NATO
The graph above shows the increase in the share of defence spending in
GDP for most European countries between 2014 and 2019. **[Expenditures
have increased for the fourth year in a row. However, for the time
being, the majority of European NATO members still fall short of the
2%]{.underline}** of GDP criterion.30(\*) This is particularly the case
in Germany, at 1.36%; Italy, at 1.22% and Spain, which is at 0.92% of
GDP. **[Here, American and European perspectives diverge. It is quite
clear that for the United States there is no common measure between
these two challenges. For the United States, China is a universal
competitor, contesting American supremacy in all domains]{.underline}**:
first of all in the economic domain, then in the financial domain, and
in the cultural, diplomatic and strategic domains as well. In this
competition, the military dimension does not dominate, although it is
present. Russia has the opposite profile: it is a country with a weak
economy, and a GDP between those of Spain and Italy - even though it is
the largest country in the world and endowed with considerable natural
resources. In addition to this, the Russian population is undergoing a
net decline. Though **[Russia\'s interventionist and sometimes
provocative policies pose a clear and immediate threat to European
countries, and are of course more urgent for those closest to it, it
does not pose a threat to US pre-eminence worldwide.]{.underline}**
These are the issues at stake in the organisation of the system for arms
control in Europe, a matter that is of key importance for Europeans. In
this light, the scheduled expiration of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear
Forces (INF) Treaty next August is extremely concerning.
**[Significantly, the issue is the subject of very broad consensus in
Europe.]{.underline}** **[This, then, is the deep root of the awakening
of the European spirit of defence: our fundamental security and defence
interests have diverged from those of the United States. But this
divergence, of course, does not mean opposition.]{.underline}**
Extremely strong ties unite the countries of Europe to the United
States. These ties are multiple, and range across all the economic and
social fields, but in general they may be considered as being of two
fundamental types: - First there are blood ties, forged in common
military engagements against common enemies. While these ties are
particularly old in the case of France, it can be said that they include
all European nations, in respect of the liberation of Western Europe in
1944-1945. As we have lately been commemorating the 75th anniversary of
the Normandy landings, your rapporteurs here wish to take a moment to
salute the memory of the thousands of American soldiers who gave their
lives during the campaign in France. Their sacrifice cannot and will not
ever be forgotten, and has forged an eternal bond between our two
peoples. - Then there are ties of a political nature. The United States
is a democratic regime, based, in the same philosophical and ideological
tradition as the European countries, on the belief that every individual
has inalienable rights, and that the rights and duties of all members of
society are defined and protected by the rule of law. This is an
abiding, fundamental difference between the United States and other
powers like China or Russia. **[The use of the term "burden-sharing" in
regard to European defence would thus seem appropriate. In substance,
then, it is difficult to see what could lastingly justify Europe\'s
continued under-sizing of its defence efforts.]{.underline}**

#### European countries are accepting the need for burden sharing now\-\--stability depends on it

WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - **[European countries must shoulder more
of the political and economic responsiblity for NATO's common defense to
ensure the continued relevance of the alliance in coming
years]{.underline}**, Norwegian Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soreide
said on Thursday. Soreide, who met with an number of U.S. lawmakers this
week and is due to meet with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on
Friday, said the **[United States could not be expected to continue
paying for over 70 percent of NATO's defense needs. "European allies
need to step up to the plate, take a bigger part of the political and
economic burdens,"]{.underline}** Soreide told Reuters in an interview
after a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies
think tank. **["We need to do our part. We need to be more than a net
importer of security. We need to export security,"]{.underline}** she
said. In her speech, Soreide said her meetings with U.S. lawmakers
revealed that both Democrats and Republicans in Congress were
increasingly questioning the value of continued U.S. investments and
engagement in Europe. Soreide said European fears of being abandoned by
Washington had been fanned by U.S. plans to focus more on the
Asian-Pacific region, but those concerns were likely overblown. Still,
some **[changes were clearly needed, she said, calling for greater
investment in Europe's own security, increased planning for future
crises, and development of high-end capabilities that could be easily
deployed if needed.]{.underline}** "Norway believes that **[global
stability depends on the ability of Europe and the U.S. to work
together, and that this will become even more important in the
future,"]{.underline}** Soreide told the think tank, citing threats from
terrorists, emerging state powers and the re-emergence of old powers
such as Russia. She called for increased NATO exercises and training,
greater engagement in areas outside allied terrorities, and said
European allies should be more willing to address U.S. security concerns
outside Europe. The participation of **[Norway and Denmark in efforts to
destroy Syrian chemical weapons was a good example of "trans-Atlantic
burden-sharing in practice," Soreide said.]{.underline}**

### 2NC INB---Russia---Solves Baltics

#### European underinvestment in force structure and continental mobility primes [Russian aggression]{.underline} in the Baltics\-\--European [focus]{.underline} undergirds the [credibility]{.underline} of NATO's deterrent. 

**Blachford 20**, a Lecturer of International Relations at the Baltic
Defence College, Estonia, (Kevin, February 7th, 2020, "Can NATO and The
EU Really Defend the Baltic States Against Russia?",
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/can-nato-and-eu-really-defend-baltic-states-against-russia-121711)

Primarily, **[the challenge facing NATO is dealing with the possibility
of Russia using the Baltics as a way to test]{.underline}** the
**[credibility of the]{.underline}** NATO **[alliance]{.underline}**.
**[The Baltic states]{.underline}** of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia
currently **[rely on NATO's enhanced forward presence]{.underline}** and
air policing missions to deter Russian aggression. But **[this provides
only short term reassurance]{.underline}** to the region **[and
overlooks]{.underline}** the **[lessons of the Cold War in which West
Germany played a vital role]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** the
**[credibility of NATO's deterrence posture]{.underline}**. The
**[reluctance]{.underline}** of Germany **[to think
seriously]{.underline}** **[about the military security of Europe
is]{.underline}**, therefore, **[becoming a hindrance to NATO's
deterrence capabilities]{.underline}**. Germany has repeatedly
emphasized its aversion to militarism in recent years and its military
has faced numerous bouts of austerity. But this
**[reluctance]{.underline}** to be seen as a military power **[overlooks
the role of the]{.underline}** West German **[Bundeswehr which acted as
the first line of NATO's defense]{.underline}** in the Cold War.

The history of the Cold War provides clues to how deterrence could be
increased in the Baltic region today. The **[defense and deterrence
capability]{.underline}** of West Germany **[revolved not just around
the nuclear deterrent]{.underline}**, **[but on the ability of the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and]{.underline}** its
**[allies to deploy forces quickly]{.underline}**. **[This related to
the logistic capabilities]{.underline}** **[to move
forces]{.underline}** quickly **[to the border with East
Germany]{.underline}**. An important part of NATO
strategy therefore relied on the West German autobahns as a way to move
both goods and people. Today, **[the Baltic region lacks]{.underline}**
any **[meaningful infrastructure]{.underline}** **[in which
reinforcements could be moved quickly to the region]{.underline}**.
**[Train lines are outdated]{.underline}** **[and travel between the
Baltics to Poland or]{.underline}** further to **[Germany is
painstakingly slow]{.underline}**. **[The Baltic states]{.underline}**
**[also do not have any significant capabilities to host allied
forces]{.underline}** in large scale numbers, particularly **[as access
to the area in a conflict scenario]{.underline}** **[would be limited
due to Russian air superiority]{.underline}** and anti-access,
area-denial capabilities. The large placement of U.S. forces in this
sensitive area would no doubt invite reprisals and escalation from
Russia. But **[showing the capabilities to quickly respond to a crisis
by having the capacity to move resources]{.underline}** to the region
**[would enhance NATO's deterrence]{.underline}** in the long term.
**[NATO should therefore consider developing its forces]{.underline}**
in Germany and even Poland, but **[with the added caveat of being able
to move these forces quickly]{.underline}** to where they are needed
**[in the Baltics]{.underline}**.

The **[lack of infrastructure]{.underline}** across the Baltic region,
therefore, **[creates two]{.underline}** main
**[problems]{.underline}**. Firstly, **[it limits NATO's credibility to
respond to a crisis on the border with Russia]{.underline}**. Secondly,
**[infrastructure serves a dual purpose in both war and
peacetime]{.underline}**. The **[lack of European
investment]{.underline}** and interest in the region **[creates
opportunities for Russia to undermine]{.underline}** the
**[societies]{.underline}** **[of the three Baltic
nations]{.underline}**. This shows the primary challenge facing NATO in
European defense. The European Union needs to do more to show its
commitment to the East. **[Continual expansion eastwards has not had the
de-securitizing effect once expected]{.underline}**. **[The lack
of]{.underline}** German commitment and **[Brussel's
interest]{.underline}** **[in the region is also effecting NATO's
ability to defend the Baltics]{.underline}**.

### 2NC INB---AT: Non-Numeric Metric Bad

#### Current burden-sharing strategies are based in too many skewed factors\-\-- new burden sharing is necessary for [fairness]{.underline} and [recognition]{.underline} among allies.

**Mattelaer, 16** \[Alexander Mattelaer, 3-1-2016, Assistant Director of
the Institute for European Studies (IES) in Brussels, Belgium. PhD in
Political Science from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 'Revisiting the
Principles of NATO Burden-Sharing',

/alundy\]

**[A thousand different ways exist for evaluating Alliance burden
sharing.]{.underline}** This has **[not only to do with methodology, but
also with the tendency in all nations to discount the value of the
efforts undertaken by others]{.underline}**. Engaging in this debate,
therefore, requires careful consideration of the available approaches
and the broader purpose these serve. This section reviews the metrics
currently in use and contrasts these with frequent criticisms and
alternatives. It goes on to discuss their historical inspirations, which
helps to transform a debate that tends to focus on defense accounting
into one on military strategy. **[Commonly agreed principles of Alliance
strategy are of greater importance than numeric details divorced from
their historical and geographical context]{.underline}**. At present,
NATO defense planners evaluate burden-sharing on the basis of eleven
metrics that measure financial inputs as well as military outputs. The
**[best known of these are the investment parameters, namely the
percentage of GDP spent on defense]{.underline}** expenditure and the
percentage of overall defense expenditure spent on major equipment and
Research & Development, currently set at 2 percent and 20 percent. With
respect to military capabilities, NATO planners track the percentages of
any ally's armed forces that are deployable and sustainable on
expeditionary US Leadership and NATO Mattelaer 27 operations. They also
evaluate the extent to which every ally implements the national
capability targets assigned under the NATO defense plan- ning process.5
An additional guideline in this regard is that no ally can be asked to
provide more than 50 percent of any individual capabil- ity set during
the apportionment of national targets. The underlying idea here is to
wean the Alliance off its near-exclusive reliance on a single
ally---read the United States---for certain capabilities. A third set of
metrics concerns actual contributions: the percentages of deploy- able
land forces, airframes, and vessels that are effectively deployed on
operations, the extent to which an ally fills assigned staff positions
in the NATO Command Structure and NATO Force Structure headquarters, and
the contribution made to filling the requirements of the NATO Response
Force. **[Depending on what measurement parameters one prefers to look
at, a different picture emerges. The share of GDP spent on defense often
makes media headlines, but this metric draws frequent criticism on
methodological grounds]{.underline}**.6 Most importantly, **[it does not
differentiate between defense spending for national and for Alliance
purposes]{.underline}.** It is no secret the United States---which
scores the highest on this scale--- also has significant national
responsibilities that lie far beyond the remit of the Alliance, such as
its security guarantees to South Korea and Japan. In some European
capitals, it is a rhetorical question to ask whether the United States
would spend a dollar less on its military if its allies were to spend
more. In addition, alternative metrics are occasionally put forward.
These would typically skew the balance in a particular direction.
Measuring defense spending per square kilometer of national territory
would constitute an extreme example of this kind. Last, but not least,
there is the discussion on common funding. **[While small in size
relative to overall defense spending, NATO's common budgets arguably
constitute the purest expression of how the bills of the Alliance are
split]{.underline}**. The cost-sharing arrangement for the civil budget,
the military budget, and the NATO security investment program follows an
agreed formula based on Gross National Income.7 One important exception
to this formula is the United States, which assumes a 22.14 percent
share of the total, whereas its economic weight within the Alliance
accounts for more than 40 percent of the NATO total. Taking this
discount into consideration, the largest proportional share of NATO
common funding is thus borne by Germany (14.65 percent), the ally
otherwise most notorious for not meeting investment targets. It is easy
to get lost in the jungle of data that these metrics generate. They also
bear little direct relationship to the changing security environ- ment
the Alliance faces and the precise mix of military capabilities that is
required for meeting future challenges. In other words, a focus on any
particular parameter is akin to putting the cart before the horse. It is
therefore well worth remembering that during the first decades of the
Alliance's existence, **[successive strategic concepts articulated a
list of general principles deemed fundamental to the organization of a
common defense]{.underline}**. As coined by the 1949 Strategic Concept,
the list ran as follows (emphasis added)

It's like clockwork: As NATO's late June summit in Madrid

grows louder. **[NATO defense ministers
[pledged](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_67655.htm) in 2006

product]{.underline}** on their defense annually. **[Today that's become

alliance leaders, because NATO states were collectively failing to meet
the 2006 commitment, thanks to decades of chronic underinvestment by
European states on their militaries,]{.underline}** which,
unsurprisingly, led to significant capability gaps in their ability to
conduct military operations. **[This, in turn, meant that the United
States, which spends more than 3 percent annually, was absorbing the
lion's share of the costs associated with securing
Europe.]{.underline}** As the argument went in 2014, the United States
would be much more
[amenable](https://www.voanews.com/a/clinton-backs-gates-on-nato-burden-sharing-123686254/140618.html)
to continuing its investment in trans-Atlantic security if NATO nations
would just spend at least 2 percent of their GDP on defense. Getting all
NATO heads of state to agree to the 2 percent minimum target was a
laudable achievement---and one that might not have happened if Russia
hadn't invaded Ukraine earlier that yea**[r. But the 2 percent target
has proved to be both operationally insufficient and strategically
counterproductive]{.underline}**. Ultimately, without some serious
adjustments to the strategic debates, a focus on the 2 percent minimum
target only severely hurts NATO's relevance---and public support for the
alliance. The 2 percent minimum target was largely intended as a
political mechanism---for example, to help defense ministries fend off
budget cuts imposed by finance ministers. But 2 percent is an input
rather than an output metric. In other words, how that 2 percent is
spent is considerably more important than whether countries are spending
enough. Although there's a hearty debate about how much of Russia's
ham-handed approach to its war against Ukraine is due to technological
weakness versus Russian strategic incompetence, **[there is no question
that some defense investments need to be rethought,]{.underline}**
including those needed for stronger territorial defense---**[including
maritime and airspace defense]{.underline}**---of a soon-to-expanded
northeastern NATO border. With further Russian aggression likely and
Afghanistan in the rearview mirror, **[there's going to be a new
emphasis on territorial defense and deterrence.]{.underline}** That's
more people-heavy than expeditionary operations, and as any comptroller
will tell you, people are surprisingly expensive. Yes, a number of
European countries---[including
Germany](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/germany-coalition-government-cdu-agree-%E2%82%AC100-billion-military-boost/ar-AAXRMjZ?ocid=uxbndlbing)---have
decided to increase their defense spending in the wake of Ukraine, but
how will those monies be used? At the strategic level, the 2 percent
minimum target has become even more problematic. Alliances are
frameworks for communication and cooperation among states that extend
much more deeply and broadly than just security and defense; NATO's
benefits for the United States go a long way
[beyond](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR500/RR518/RAND_RR518.pdf)
military cooperation. Unfortunately, the 2 percent minimum target
reframes the conversation about security burden-sharing into one about
transactional cost-sharing. But the value of alliances cannot be
measured in terms of dollars and euros. The danger of overemphasizing a
minimum figure that European partners may not be comfortable with
meeting is that it contributes to the impression the United States is
somehow being cheated. Is it any wonder that after years of hammering
Europe about the 2 percent minimum target that the previous U.S.
president decided that his country was getting an unfair deal---and
reportedly almost pulled the United States out of NATO? Support for NATO
may be strong among the traditional foreign-policy establishment, but in
a time of rapidly shifting U.S. domestic politics, it's also potentially
fragile. Nor does the 2 percent minimum account for the nonmilitary
dimensions of contemporary security needs. Economic and political
dynamics are critically important to a nation's security---and from the
perspective of the public in NATO states are perhaps even more important
than military capabilities. European states have been at the forefront
of coping with challenges such as disinformation and
cyberwarfare---capacities and experience that are vital but not fully
reflected in military budgets. This is, arguably, why NATO's Article 2
exists: to underscore that economic and political policies must
reinforce military alliance commitments. As the Chinese tech giant
[Huawei's
investments](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2020/09/30/nato-and-the-5g-challenge/index.html)
in NATO countries demonstrate, failure to consider the security
dimensions of commercial investments can have an adverse impact on the
alliance. The conversation on burden-sharing must better account for the
broader trade-offs and risks associated with choosing alliance security
over commercial profitability. Those costs of NATO commitment in Europe
are rarely visible in Washington discussions. When NATO governments meet
in Madrid, they will endorse an updated "Strategic Concept," a vision
document for how the alliance views---and should prepare for---the
current and emerging strategic environment. Yet in order to turn that
concept into a meaningful and sustainable political reality, **[the
alliance must then have a tough but necessary conversation on how to
recalibrate burden-sharing]{.underline}**---and embed that new
understanding in any implementing guidance it develops for the Strategic
Concept.

AN END TO COMPLACENCY?

Europe's predicament is clear. **[Without a common vision for
defense]{.underline}**, **[and with destabilizing pressures on its
periphery, the continent will]{.underline}** soon **[serve as a
theater]{.underline}**, rather than a participant, **[in a great-power
competition]{.underline}**. **[Russia]{.underline}** actively
**[supports European far-right parties and]{.underline}** regularly
**[interferes in European elections]{.underline}**. In Ukraine, Russia
has illegally annexed Crimea and fomented a slow-burning war that has
killed 13,000 Ukrainians and displaced 1.5 million. Farther south,
**[the Syrian civil war has driven]{.underline}** millions of
**[refugees to Europe's shores]{.underline}**, **[causing a [split over

policy and fueling]{.underline}** the rise of **[populist
parties]{.underline}**. **[China]{.underline}**, for its part, **[has
invested]{.underline}** heavily **[in Europe's ports]{.underline}** and
technology infrastructure, in part because it hopes **[to drive a wedge
between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
Europe]{.underline}**. **[The more internally divided Europe
is]{.underline}**, **[the more it will find itself at the mercy of these
opportunistic great powers]{.underline}**. **[This is a recipe
for]{.underline}** a **[Europe]{.underline}** once again **[roiled by
nationalism]{.underline}**, **[an EU that is irrelevant]{.underline}**,
**[and a transatlantic alliance in which Europe has little
influence]{.underline}** and the United States lacks a strong partner.

**[The only prudent way to avoid this nightmare scenario]{.underline}**
**[is]{.underline}** for Europe to shed its culture of complacency in
favor of **[autonomy]{.underline}**. **[It must develop the ability to
better defend itself]{.underline}** and pursue common European
interests. The EU's foreign service outlined this goal in its [2016
Global
Strategy](https://eeas.europa.eu/sites/eeas/files/eugs_review_web_0.pdf),
and leaders have echoed the same sentiment in speeches all over the
continent. But that doesn't mean getting there will be easy.

#### Economic insecurity [doesn't explain]{.underline} European populism. 

**Palmer 19**, Ph.D Politics at Oxford, former H. B. Earhart Fellow at
Hertford College (Oxford), VP for International Programs at Atlas
Network, (Todd, 2019, *"*The Terrifying Rise of Authoritarian Populism,"
*Reason*, August/September 2019)

It's Not the Economy, Stupid

The old standby explanation of populism is that it is a predictable
response to economic oppression. Thus, the socialist pundit John Judis
argues in 2016's The Populist Explosion: How the Great Recession
Transformed American and European Politics that populism rose in
response to "the skewed distribution of jobs and income that neoliberal
economics had created over the prior decades."

Yet **[populists have surged in popularity]{.underline}** or come to
power **[in countries with very dissimilar economic
conditions]{.underline}**, **[including some with]{.underline}** low
unemployment and relatively **[high economic growth]{.underline}**. Nor
is the rise of populism a matter of age, with older people supporting
right‐​wing nationalist populists and younger people supporting liberal
cosmopolitanism: Plenty of young people have been voting for populist
parties and candidates. Nor is the populist vote explained robustly by
income levels.

The British political scientists Roger Eatwell and Matthew Goodwin point
out in their 2018 book National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal
Democracy (Pelican) that **[a common driver in]{.underline}**
"**[national populism]{.underline}**" **[is not falling wages
but]{.underline}** "**[relative deprivation]{.underline}**---**[a sense
that the wider group]{.underline}**, whether white Americans or native
Brits, **[is being left behind relative to others]{.underline}** in
society, while culturally liberal politicians, media and celebrities
devote far more attention and status to immigrants, ethnic minorities
and other newcomers." **[Rapid change]{.underline}** in the status of
groups, notably **[through immigration]{.underline}**,
**[causes]{.underline}** many **[people to experience]{.underline}**
relative **[downward mobility]{.underline}** and to feel that the status
of their group is threatened. When Britain voted to withdraw from the
European Union, Eatwell and Goodwin write, polling data showed Remainers
"talking endlessly about economic risks while Leavers were chiefly
concerned about perceived threats to their identity and national
groups." (Brexit is a complex question, of course, and some classical
liberals supported it because they feared an unaccountable E.U.
bureaucracy. But the movement for Brexit was driven far more by populist
concerns than by liberal ones.)

In the U.S., a deciding factor in Trump's victory was the estimated 9
percent of voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012 and then switched
to Trump, according to survey data analyzed by George Washington
University political scientist John Sides. Among white Obama voters who
had not been to college, the share who later voted for Trump was a
whopping 22 percent. As that past support for Obama suggests, their
**[votes for Trump can't be reduced to a]{.underline}** simple **[story
of racial backlash]{.underline}**. **[Nor was it a simple matter of
economics]{.underline}**: For the most part, those **[voters' incomes
and living standards are higher than]{.underline}** those of **[their
parents.]{.underline}**

But **[a common motivation for their support for Trump seems to be
insecurity]{.underline}** **[about their social status]{.underline}**. A
2016 Brookings Institution survey showed that 66 percent of
non‐​college‐​schooled American whites "agree that discrimination against
whites is as big a problem today as discrimination against blacks and
other minorities." Anxiety about status---in this case a perception of
an inversion of the status quo---seems to be a major factor, certainly
much bigger than ideological racism. As political scientist Karen
Stenner argued based on extensive data in her 2005 book The
Authoritarian Dynamic, threats to "collective rather than individual
conditions" trigger authoritarian "groupiness," i.e., populism.

Here's where classical liberals need to do some serious thinking. A
mainstay of arguments for free markets is that when people's incomes
rise at different rates, the important thing is that they're all rising.
Even most left‐​wing egalitarians accept some inequality, as long as it's
necessary for the poor to become less poor. The philosopher John Rawls
argued in A Theory of Justice, for instance, that inequalities can be
just if they are to the "greatest benefit of the least advantaged,"
because then, even the least well off could not complain. But human
beings are concerned about more than how well they're doing relative to
how well they did in the past. They also care about how well they're
doing compared to others. They care about hierarchies and social status.

Relative status is quite different from absolute well‐​being.
Libertarians have for many years celebrated the rise in status of women,
racial minorities, immigrants, openly gay people, and others who had for
very long periods of time suffered from low social status. Well, when it
comes to relative social status, if some rose, others had to fall. And
**[who perceived themselves as falling?]{.underline}** **[White men
without college degrees]{.underline}**.

It isn't just onetime outsiders rising in comparative status. As Charles
Murray lays out in his 2012 book Coming Apart: The State of White
America, 1960--2010, a decline in our collective emphasis on certain
traditional virtues---hard work, marriage, and the like---has opened a
gulf between college‐​schooled elites and high‐​schooled nonelites. The
resentment felt by one side of the divide is, unfortunately, often
matched by the arrogance and condescension shown by the other, which
merely accentuates the resentment.

Similar **[divisions are happening in other countries as
well]{.underline}**, **[and they seem to be a major driver of populist
sentiment]{.underline}**. Pew Research Center surveys conducted in 2017
in 15 countries identified ethnocentrism and perceptions of national
decline as characteristic of populist voters. **[In
Germany]{.underline}**, for example, **[44 percent of the
populist]{.underline}** Alternative for Germany (**[AfD]{.underline}**)
**[party's supporters say that life is worse than it was 50 years
ago]{.underline}** for people like them, compared to only 16 percent of
other Germans. While data vary across countries and, as Berlin pointed
out in 1967, no one factor can explain all populist movements, such
**[fears of national decline and group status are common]{.underline}**,
**[especially in Europe]{.underline}** and the U.S. The most important
driver in Europe and the U.S. seems to be immigration and what Eatwell
and Goodwin in National Populism call "hyper ethnic change"---that is,
rapid change in the ethnic mix of a society, with multiple ethnicities
joining the social order. (Some Americans have experienced feelings of
dislocation and threat to their place in society upon seeing that their
old Piggly Wiggly store has been replaced by a mercado with Mexican
flags. It's not the experience of ethnic pluralism that seems to be the
problem but the fear that other ethnicities will eventually displace
them.)

The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign‐​born reached 13.7
percent in 2017, the highest percentage since 1910, when it was 14.7
percent. Moreover, since the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965,
which abolished national quotas and favored family reunions, higher
percentages of immigrants have been coming from Asia, Africa, Central
America, and the Middle East, accentuating ethnic differences with the
native‐​born population.

The Alternative for Germany, which started as a movement against the
euro and has morphed into a populist anti‐​immigrant party, has drawn
increasing support from less‐​schooled voters from the former states of
East Germany. Such voters perceive their status as having fallen in
recent decades, and they fear immigration far more than do more‐​schooled
voters and those in the Western part of the country, which has seen far
more immigration. In fact, the **[AfD support was strongest
in]{.underline}** those **[regions of the East that had seen the least
population growth]{.underline}** **[due to migration]{.underline}**;
**[people in those places feel that they are being left
behind]{.underline}**, and they blame immigrants, whom they see more on
television than in their neighborhoods.

**[Similar analyses can be applied to Britain]{.underline}**,
**[France]{.underline}**, **[Sweden]{.underline}**, **[and other
democracies]{.underline}** that have seen surges of populism.

**[Hyper ethnic change is profoundly unsettling to many
people]{.underline}**, and it is helping to drive populist political
responses. One can dismiss such reactions as irrational or small‐​minded,
but many people feel them nonetheless. Moreover, many people are not
satisfied with improvements in their conditions if they perceive
others---especially outsiders---as doing even better. Envy and
resentment have long been drivers of anti‐​libertarian movements, and
they seem to be back in a big way. The problem is exacerbated by the
increase of welfare‐​state transfer payments and benefits, which
outsiders are believed to exploit or threaten.

I fear that we may be entering an age of authoritarian "groupiness" and
that the consequences will be terrible for freedom and prosperity. Not
to put too fine a point on it, but the rise of far‐​right and far‐​left
authoritarian populist movements today is more than a little reminiscent
of Europe in the 1930s.

#### European democracy is self-correcting, and the threat of populism is blown out of proportion.

Constraints On the Populists' Project of Power

**[How far populists]{.underline}** in power **[will get in
implementing]{.underline}** anything like **[the agenda]{.underline}**
sketched by Pappas **[depends]{.underline}** very much **[on a set of
constraints]{.underline}** that I would like to classify into five
categories. **[First]{.underline}**, **[there are]{.underline}** the
**[constitutional constraints]{.underline}**. In the United States,
Donald Trump has (to some extent) been checked by the courts and by
Congress. The **[institutional arrangements]{.underline}** in the United
States and also in the democracies **[of western Europe are likely to
inhibit]{.underline}** the more **[extreme forms of populist
autocracies]{.underline}** that we know from the presidential systems of
Latin America (Roberts
[2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR68)).
In the less established democracies of central--eastern Europe, however,
populists in power meet with less institutional resistance and use their
power to implement illiberal institutional reforms, as is illustrated by
the Polish and Hungarian populists in power. The same has applied to
Berlusconi's governments in Italy, which have often adopted illiberal
measures regarding the checks and balances of Italian democracy (such as
media freedom, the judiciary, the constitution, and the president of the
republic; Bobba and McDonnell
[2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR10)).

**[The electoral system provides a]{.underline}** little noticed but
**[crucial institutional constraint]{.underline}**. While majoritarian
(or nearly majoritarian) systems allow populists to gain power
undivided, **[proportional systems]{.underline}** are likely to **[force
populists to share power with coalition partners]{.underline}** who are
likely to be mainstream parties. This kind of power sharing goes a long
way to moderate both populist parties and their voters. Thus, **[when
the Austrian FPÖ entered]{.underline}** the **[government]{.underline}**
dominated by Wolfgang Schüssel's ÖVP in 2000, **[it was seriously
weakened by]{.underline}** the **[experience]{.underline}**. Its cabinet
members adopted more moderate positions, which led to an eventual split
between the moderates and the radicals, with the moderates creating
a new party, the BZÖ (Luther
[2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR50),
p. 143--5). Similarly, the Swiss SVP moderated its populist discourse
once its leader was co-opted into the government in 2003, and it also
split over the government experience of its leader (Bernhard et al.
[2015](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR6)).
Rooduijn et al.
([2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR70))
show that, **[after an electoral success]{.underline}**, **[populist
parties]{.underline}** generally **[become less populist in their party
programs]{.underline}**.

It is when populists gain power undivided and get an opportunity to
implement their project of political renewal that they may become
a major threat to democracy. In such less favorable institutional
circumstances, the strategies of the populists' own parties and of
related parties in their own camp become particularly important. Thus,
for Levitsky and Ziblatt
([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR46),
p. 7), an essential test for democracies is not whether such populist
leaders emerge but "whether political leaders, and especially political
parties, work to prevent them from gaining power in the first place."
They are afraid that institutions---written constitutions and norms of
mutual toleration and forbearance (i.e., patient self-restraint)---are
not enough to rein in elected autocrats. For them (p. 19), parties are
the essential gatekeepers. Successful gatekeeping requires that
mainstream parties isolate and defeat extremist forces. It is "the
abdication of political responsibility by existing leaders" that often
marks a nation's first step toward authoritarianism.

In this respect, it is worthwhile to remind ourselves of Linz's
([1978](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR48))
analysis of the breakdown of democracy in the interwar period: He
distinguished between loyal, semiloyal, and disloyal oppositions in
democratic regimes. Fascists and communists were the disloyal
oppositions, but most interesting from the contemporary point of view
are the semiloyal opponents from less radical parties: Linz
characterized them as willing to encourage, tolerate, cover up, treat
leniently, excuse, or justify actions of other participants in the
political process that go beyond the limits of peaceful, legitimate
patterns of politics in democracy. Ultimately, he identified semiloyalty
by its greater affinity for radicals on its own side of the political
spectrum than for the supporters of the democratic principles. Thus, in
the Weimar Republic, the semiloyal opposition contributed to the
breakdown of the system by seeking the support of the disloyal
opposition and by helping it into power. Building on Linz's analysis,
I would like to suggest that the politicians of the populist leaders'
own party and of related parties in their own camp become critical for
his or her maneuvering space. To the extent that they condone the
excesses of the maverick in power, they crucially contribute to the
danger he or she poses for democracy. This is what has happened,
tragically, in the United States, where most Republican leaders closed
ranks behind Trump, and the election became a standard two-party race
(Levitsky and Ziblatt
[2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR46),
p. 70, 201). Trump's deviance has been tolerated by the Republican
party, which has helped make it acceptable to much of the Republican
electorate. And by spring 2018, Trump's takeover of the party's
institutions has been largely complete. Another instance of this
mechanism is the toleration of Victor Orbán within the ranks of the
European People's Party. By contrast, after many years of toleration, to
be sure, the South African ANC has succeeded in ousting its maverick
leader Jacob Zuma and replacing him with a democratic leader, Cyril
Ramaphosa.

**[The third constraint is the international constraint]{.underline}**.
Following Levitsky and Way
([2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR47)),
**[external leverage and linkage may be key factors for keeping
populists in power in check]{.underline}**. However, the recent survey
of a number of key cases of populists in power suggests that
"international actors do have a difficult time when it comes to dealing
with populists in power" (Taggart and Rovira-Kaltwasser
[2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR76),
p. 356). This is related to the fact that international institutions
such as the EU or the Organization of American States have a limited
tool kit for defending democracy. In the case of the EU, membership is
conditional on meeting several democratic conditions. However, once
a country has become a member, the EU has limited capacity to impose
compliance with democratic rules and procedures. This has been
illustrated by the so-called Haider affair, which deeply traumatized the
EU (Müller
[2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR57),
p. 139). It is equally illustrated by the way the EU has been dealing
with Orbán's Hungary and Kaczyński's Poland. Moreover, as Taggart and
Rovira-Kaltwasser
([2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR76),
p. 356) suggest, outside interventions may backfire, as they give
populists in government the opportunity to denounce coalitions between
domestic and foreign actors that undermine the will of the people. This
is perfectly illustrated by the Greek referendum in 2015, when the Greek
voters turned down the austerity package offered by the international
actors, although they were under great pressure to accept it.

**[A fourth constraint is the constraint imposed by the
markets]{.underline}**. Thus, during the final phase of the protracted
Italian government formation in 2018, the **[markets reacted sharply
when the leaders of]{.underline}** the two **[populist parties submitted
a list of prospective ministers]{.underline}** to the president that
included a finance minister who was an explicit opponent of Italy's
membership in the Eurozone. **[When the populists backed
down]{.underline}** and were prepared to compromise, **[the markets
calmed down to some extent]{.underline}**, too. The sanctioning
potential of the markets seems to be much bigger than that of
international political actors.

Finally, **[the most important constraint is constituted by the
voters]{.underline}**. **[Aspiring despots may be beaten at the
polls]{.underline}**. Of course, it is by no means certain that voters
will vote against populists in power. As Schedler
([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR73))
points out, it has been quite puzzling and disturbing "to see majorities
(or at least pluralities) of voters supporting, once and again,
illiberal governments who have been, step by step, dismantling their
democratic rights and liberties." Schedler suggests that voters might
care more about other values (such as social justice, religious piety,
security, or the national soul) than democracy; they may fail to see
that democracy is being taken apart before their eyes; or they may have
competing conceptions of democracy. However, let us not forget that
liberal democracy is strong, because, as Galston
([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR25))
suggests, to a greater extent than any other political form, it harbors
the power of self-correction. It is possible that **[voters will unseat
aspiring autocrats]{.underline}**. Armenia, Malaysia, the Maldives,
Turkey, and Ukraine provide recent examples from outside Europe of the
voters' power. In April 2018, a protest movement succeeded in ousting
Serzh Sargsyan, who had ruled Armenia for the past decade, replacing him
with Nikol Pashinyan, a journalist turned lawmaker. Meanwhile, in
Malaysia's general elections in early May 2018, a broad coalition of
voters ousted Prime Minister Najib in spite of his shameless attempts to
rig the elections and hold on to power. Malaysia's citizens have finally
been able to reassert their right to change the way the country is run.
In the case of Malaysia, the sentiments reflect "less a revolution than
a restoration"---a return to an earlier era of settled law, fair judges,
and democratic accountability that has survived in the national
imagination (The Economist, May 17, 2018). In September 2018, the
opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih was elected to replace the
authoritarian incumbent in the Maldives. The Turkish local elections
that were equally held in spring 2019 indicate that voters are able to
impose limits on the autocratic ambitions of President Erdoğan.

In Europe, we need to distinguish between regions. **[In northwestern
Europe]{.underline}**, **[where the radical right has been the main
populist force]{.underline}**, **[its illiberal potential has been
curbed so far by institutional and partisan
constraints]{.underline}**---**[the division of power]{.underline}** by
proportional electoral systems **[and the need to form coalitions when
getting into power]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[the radical right
constituency became less dissatisfied in all the cases where these
parties got into power]{.underline}** (see Kriesi and Schulte-Cloos
[forthcoming](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR40);
Haugsgjerd
[2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR28)).
**[In southern Europe]{.underline}**, where **[the radical
left]{.underline}** has been the main populist force, its illiberal
potential **[has also been limited so far by institutional and partisan
constraints]{.underline}**---proportional electoral systems and the need
to enter into coalition with other parties, as well as by market
constraints. The partisan constraints worked even in the case of the
coalition of populists who governed Italy in 2018/2019: Because of their
incompatible programs, the coalition partners imposed limits on each
other. In central--eastern Europe, there are fewer constraints on
populists in power because the electoral systems allow them to get
undivided power in countries like Hungary and Poland. The market
constraints as well as the international constraints have also proved to
be weak so far. However, **[democracy's power of self-correction may
also assert itself in this part of Europe]{.underline}**. Thus, Zuzana
Čaputová's victory in the presidential elections in Slovakia in March
2019 provides a signal that **[liberal democracy is recovering
central-eastern Europe]{.underline}**. And **[the Ukrainian presidential
elections in April 2019]{.underline}**, which were **[won by a complete
outsider]{.underline}**, **[confirm the power of self-correction that
voters wield even in hybrid democracies]{.underline}**.

Conclusion

There clearly are dangers for democracy, but let us underscore with
Galston
([2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR25))
a less fashionable point: **[This is no time for panic]{.underline}**.
As we have seen, **[modernization theorists concur]{.underline}**. They
believe that **[democracy]{.underline}**, in the long run, **[will
impose itself as a result of the spread of fundamental values that
underpin it]{.underline}**, **[even if we find some
short-term]{.underline}** limited **[reversal]{.underline}** of the
long-term progress of democracy. **[In Europe in
particular]{.underline}**, **[there is no reason to
dramatize]{.underline}**. Among the European citizens, **[the principles
of democracy are widely supported]{.underline}**, **[even if
dissatisfaction]{.underline}** with democracy **[is
widespread]{.underline}**---especially in the European south and the
European east. To be sure, there is widespread indifference and
alienation in different parts of Europe, in particular among the
youngest generations, which is indeed preoccupying. However, there are
also large groups of critical citizens who combine support of democratic
ideals with dissatisfaction with the existing democracies of their own
countries, especially in southern and central--eastern Europe (see
Kriesi and Vidal
[2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-020-00231-9#ref-CR41)).
It is these critical citizens who may reassert themselves and exercise
the self-corrective power of democracy.

Democratic dissatisfaction contributes to the rise of radical challenger
parties, especially on the radical left in southern Europe but also on
the radical right across western Europe. These parties express
widespread dissatisfaction with democracy and contribute to it by their
populist discourse. The good news is that **[across western
Europe]{.underline}**, **[once these parties are in
government]{.underline}**, **[democratic dissatisfaction seems to
evaporate among their voters]{.underline}**, **[and they arguably become
parties like any other mainstream party]{.underline}**, provided they do
not gain power undivided. Most dangerous are situations where populist
challengers do not have to share power in government. In western Europe,
**[parliamentary democracies and proportional electoral
systems]{.underline}** tend to **[guard against populists gaining
undivided power]{.underline}**. The Italian case shows that populists of
different persuasions may join forces to govern, but it also suggests
that **[they may not be able to govern effectively]{.underline}**. The
institutional context is less favorable for democracy in
central--eastern Europe, where semipresidential systems (Poland,
Romania) and electoral systems heavily skewed in favor of the largest
party (Hungary) provide the possibility for populists to gain undivided
power. Other safeguards---partisan, international, and market
constraints---may be less reliable than often hoped for. In the final
analysis, it is the voters who may resort to sanctioning aspiring
autocrats in this part of Europe as well.

#### Increased European populism is challenging the continuity of democratic institutions

**Pintsch et. al 6-15**-22, Anne Pintsch is an associate professor at
the Department of Political Science and Management and the coordinator
of the Jean Monnet Centre of Excellence at the University of Agder in
Norway; Dennis Hammerschmidt is a data scientist with a PhD in
International Relations and Quantitative Methods from the University of
Mannheim; Cosima Meyer is a data scientist with a PhD in political
science from the University of Mannheim, "Introduction: the declime of
democracy and rise of populism in Europe and their effect on democracy
promotion," June 15^th^ 2022, *Cambridge Review of International
Affairs*,
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09557571.2022.2082797

European countries, international organisations (IOs) and civil society
organisations have a long history as major democracy promoters around
the world (Calingaert et al. 2014; OECD-DAC 2020). Democracy promotion
here refers to deliberate 'activities engaged in by external actors to
encourage the development of democracy within a given country' (Stewart
2009, 647). However, **[democracy promotion is currently facing several
challenges]{.underline}**. First, **[democracy promoters are
increasingly experiencing a pushback across the globe]{.underline}**.
Former recipient governments have passed laws or established practical
hurdles that impede external support for democracy and non-governmental
organisations (Carothers and Brechenmacher 2014; Dupuy and Prakash
2020). One of the latest examples is the closing of both Russia's oldest
human rights group Memorial and a related Human Rights Centre in
December 2021. They were accused, among others, of having broken the
foreign agent law by not labelling all their publications with the
respective label indicating foreign funding (Osborn and Antonov 2021;
Osborn and Kiselyova 2021). Second, the very model of liberal democracy
has also lost attractiveness for citizens (Bridoux, Hobson, and Kurki
2012; Poppe, Richter, and Wolff 2018, 2). **[In democracies even more
than in autocracies, people doubt that their voices are heard and
governments act in their interest]{.underline}** (Rasmussen Global
2018). Finally, democracy promotion 'is simultaneously undermined by
serious problems on the side of key democracy promoters' (Poppe,
Richter, and Wolff 2018, 1). One of those is the decreasing material
leverage. As one of the most important democracy promoters worldwide,
the European Union (EU) has lost relative economic power (Godfrey and
Youngs 2019). Between 2009 and 2020, the EU's share of world trade in
goods and services declined from 18.1 per cent1 to 16.8 per cent, while
China's share increased from 9.6 per cent to 14.7 per cent (European
Commission 2021, 21). **[Another problem runs even deeper and concerns
the 'phenomenon of democratic contestation and erosion "at home"'
(Poppe, Richter, and Wolff 2018 2018, 2). This global phenomenon has
been described as a 'long democratic recession', which has been ongoing
for 15 years (Repucci and Slipowitz 2021, 1). The European continent is
no exception]{.underline}**. As Smolka's (2021) analysis of democratic
decline in the European Union and decreases in democratic quality shows,
both old and new member states are affected by the two phenomena. 20 EU
member states2 faced at least one period of democratic decline between
2004 and 2016. While Smolka does not identify a systematic third wave of
democratic decline in the EU, she calls the observations 'gloomy' (2021,
101). **[In many cases, this challenge of domestic democratic
contestation and erosion is directly -- if not exclusively -- related to
the rise of populism]{.underline}** (International IDEA 2020; Kyle and
Mounk 2018). Out of 22 countries in which Luhrmann and her co-authors
determine a downturn of liberal democracy € between 2008 and 2018, 14
were governed by a populist government or president (Luhrmann et al. €
2019, 906).3 Hungary and Poland -- democratic forerunners after the end
of the Cold War and later advocates of democracy with a unique
transition experience -- have become the most prominent examples of this
development (Stanley 2017). However, **[populist parties have achieved
significant electoral successes in Western Europe too, and formed part
of the government in various countries such as Austria, Greece, Italy
and Switzerland]{.underline}** (Taggart 2017, 248). As Copelovitch and
Pevehouse point out, **['\[t\]his rising populism/nationalism has been
most prevalent in the very countries that founded and have been at the
core of global leadership: the United States and Western
Europe']{.underline}** (2019, 170). At the same time, populism's
relationship with democracy itself continues to be debated. Overall,
while **[populism has been identified as a potential challenge to both
democracy and democracy promotion]{.underline}**, we do not know much
about its actual impact. That is, while we observe a rise in populism in
Western democratic states, we know very little about the impact of this
rise on states' and their organisations' policy-making and the
consequences thereof.

#### Populists are making a comeback in Europe after their relative decline during the pandemic

**Dettmer 6-29**-22, Jamie Dettmer is an Opinion Editor of POLITICO

Last autumn, centrists delightedly seized upon signs that populism was
finally ebbing. But as the world moves from one crisis to the next,
**[Europe's cohort of populist nationalist leaders have started making
their moves, ready to mine voter frustration, exploit openings and make
the most of the turbulence caused by the seismic economic effects of the
pandemic, now compounded by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The game is
changing once again --- and populism is far from out.]{.underline}** In
2021, two populist luminaries who rode to power on waves of anti-elitism
anger --- Bulgaria's Boyko Borissov and the Czech Republic's Andrej
Babiš --- were ousted. And although its voting numbers held up in the
east of Germany, the Alternative for Germany party saw a national drop
in support during the country's parliamentary ballot last September. A
survey
[published](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/international/articles-reports/2021/11/18/european-support-populist-beliefs-declines)
by British pollster YouGov in November similarly found support for
populism had declined in 10 European countries across the previous three
years, suggesting its electoral appeal may have peaked. The populist
tenet that the "will of the people should be the highest principle in a
country's politics" no longer resonated as forcefully as it did, YouGov
concluded. Other pollsters agreed, saying the political tide was
seemingly turning against populists in Central Europe and elsewhere on
the Continent, and that support for such sentiments across Europe had
fallen sharply since the advent of COVID-19. Populist leaders had been
unable to revive their fortunes by exploiting public frustration with
pandemic restrictions or vaccine mandates as they had hoped. **[There
was some restoration of public faith in expertise too]{.underline}**.
Tony Barber of the Financial Times
[suggested](https://www.ft.com/content/9e49b94d-0cb9-4b27-ac34-6c3d73e4442d)
populists' "trademark scorn for expertise" helped Joe Biden defeat then
United States President Donald Trump because it unsettled many voters
who were "worried about their health and livelihoods." And as incumbent
governments and establishment parties strove to cushion lower-income and
rural populations from the economic misery of the pandemic, they reduced
recruitment opportunities for populists, whether left or right of the
political spectrum. **[But this year, there's a different story. The

the increasing strength of Giorgia Meloni's national-conservative

### 2NC INB---AT: Econ Turn---Link Turn

#### European defense spending [bodies]{.underline} economic decline.

**The Economist 22**, British weekly newspaper, 4/16/2022, "What bigger
military budgets mean for the economy,"
<https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/04/16/what-bigger-military-budgets-mean-for-the-economy>,
RH

**[In the wake of]{.underline}** the war in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**,
**[military budgets around the world are about to get
bigger]{.underline}**. This is most notable in Europe, where the threat
of Russian aggression looms largest. **[Germany, Italy and Norway, among
others, have already decided to spend more on defence]{.underline}**.
**[America and China]{.underline}**, the world's two biggest military
spenders, **[are also ramping up their allocations]{.underline}**.
**[Pressure on smaller countries to do likewise seems
inevitable]{.underline}**. What are the economic consequences of this
push? When governments spend more on soldiers and arms, they have less
available for other things. A common assumption, therefore, is that
extra spending on armies is harmful to growth and development. But the
relationship is not so straightforward. In some cases bigger defence
budgets may in fact yield substantial economic benefits.

That there is a trade-off between spending on the army and on, say,
roads or hospitals is a lesson that students of economics internalise
early on. The classic model for illustrating the concept of opportunity
costs is guns versus butter: the more you produce of one, the less you
can of the other. In any given year, that simple model holds true.
Governments have finite budgets, which can only be pulled in so many
different directions.

It is thus easy to see how spending on defence, taken to an extreme,
could be corrosive for an economy. If a government shortchanges the
education system in order to buy shiny new weapons, the long-run impact
on productivity and, ultimately, growth would be baleful. Some
economists think America is nearing that danger zone.
The rand Corporation, an influential think-tank supported by the Air
Force, not exactly known as a peacenik outfit, published a report in
2021 laying out two risks. First, when the government allocates money to
defence at the expense of infrastructure, that may undermine long-run
growth prospects, since America has a pressing need for better roads,
ports and more. Second, defence spending contributes to the public-debt
load. In both cases, the analysts conclude, anything that erodes
America's economic strength will ultimately hurt the armed forces.

Perhaps there is something to the point that these trade-offs are
damaging to the economy at America's levels (over the past decade its
military budget averaged more than 4% of gdp, second-highest in
the oecd club of wealthy countries). But **[a complication emerges when
examining trends over time.]{.underline}**
**[The]{.underline}** oecd **[member that spends the most on
defence]{.underline}**, at about 6% of gdp, is Israel. **[It also
consistently boasts one of the fastest-growing economies in the
group]{.underline}**. By contrast, **[Japan is one of the lowest
military spenders]{.underline}** as a share of gdp in the oecd, **[and
one of the slowest growers]{.underline}**. In fact, it is almost
impossible to discern a pattern in the data: there are also countries
such as Ireland, with military budgets similar to Japan's and growth
records similar to Israel's. A basic regression reveals no consistent
relationship between gdp growth and military spending for the 38
countries in the oecd.

**[A sprawling body of research has come to a similar]{.underline}**,
albeit **[more nuanced, conclusion]{.underline}**. In a discussion paper
at Monash University in 2014, Sefa Awaworyi Churchill and Siew Ling Yew
examined 42 separate studies. Effects are generally quite small, but
they found two distinct categories: **[military expenditure in poorer
countries is often detrimental to growth]{.underline}**, **[whereas in
wealthier countries it is more likely to be beneficial.]{.underline}**
One possible reason, they suggest, is weaker governance in developing
countries; a big military budget is a juicy target for corrupt
officials. Another possibility relates to the gun-versus-butter
framework. **[The potential returns on civilian investments, from health
care to education, are so great in poor countries that military spending
has a particularly high opportunity cost. In rich countries with good
schools and hospitals, the opportunity costs ought to be
lower.]{.underline}**

**[One way in which defence spending might be said to boost the economy
is as a jobs programme]{.underline}**. **[If the armed forces were a
corporation, they would be America's largest employer with 2m
workers]{.underline}** (counting active-duty personnel and civilians),
beating Walmart and Amazon. That said, it would be an eye-wateringly
expensive jobs scheme, running at nearly \$400,000 per employee a year.

**[Defence spending may deliver better returns as an undeclared form of
industrial policy]{.underline}**. In a paper last year Enrico Moretti of
the University of California, Berkeley, and two colleagues looked at
government funding for research and development (r&d), with a focus on
defence spending, in oecd countries. On average, they found that **[a
10% increase in government-financed r&d leads to a 5% increase in
privately financed r&d in the targeted firm or industry]{.underline}**.
Moreover, there are knock-on benefits for productivity. **[If France and
Germany raised their defence spending to roughly the same level as in
America,]{.underline}** Mr Moretti estimates that **[their productivity
growth rates would be slightly higher as a result.]{.underline}**

An obvious objection is that the government could achieve the same
results by supporting r&d in general, without pumping money into the
armed forces. In an economic sense that may be true. But there is a
political constraint---namely, how to marshal support for
experimentation that may fail. **[Public support for defence is less
susceptible to mood swings]{.underline}**. Without having to worry about
its next grant application, [**the American military system has been
free to** *churn out* **innovations, from duct tape to the internet,
without which modern life would be scarcely imaginable.**]{.underline}

Important as it is to trace the impact of military spending on growth or
innovation, such exercises risk missing the wider context as
demonstrated by Russia's war in Ukraine. **[A foundational element for
any successful economy is peace and stability, giving firms the
confidence to invest and people the space to flourish.]{.underline}**
Textbooks may talk of guns or butter. But **[in a world unsettled by
revanchist powers, the truth is that it is both guns and butter. A
strong defence is]{.underline}**, regrettably, [**a necessity for a
strong economy. **■]{.underline}

![Chart Description automatically

The first thing that stands out in Figure 1 is that the relationship
between increases in military spending and social spending is
conditional on the contemporaneous ordering of the variables in our VAR
model. Most importantly, **[the first quarter following an increase in
military spending sees a significant increase in social spending in
scenarios 1 and 2]{.underline}** and a significant decrease in social
spending in scenarios 3 and 4. **[This lack of a general, short-term
trade-off]{.underline}** between military spending and social spending
**[is consistent with]{.underline}** most **[empirical
research]{.underline}** on the topic. Furthermore, **[the relationship
between military spending and social expenditures]{.underline}** in the
short run **[is not random]{.underline}**. That is, when military
spending increases, **[we observe a guns-versus-butter trade-off
in]{.underline}** the two **[scenarios that mimic leaders willing to
reduce social spending]{.underline}** (scenarios 3 and 4) **[and a
complementary relationship between military and social spending when the
variable orderings reflect leaders who want to protect or expand the
social welfare state]{.underline}** (scenarios 1 and 2). Our results,
therefore, are consistent with research that finds the
**[guns-versus-butter trade-off is conditional on decision-makers'
preferences regarding]{.underline}** the **[social
welfare]{.underline}** state.

The results in Figure 1 also demonstrate that **[the marginal effect of
military spending]{.underline}** on social spending **[can vary over
time.]{.underline}** For example, **[increasing spending on national
defense has a negative]{.underline}** and significant marginal **[effect
on social spending in quarter 1 and positive and statistically
significant]{.underline}** marginal **[effects in quarters 2 and
4]{.underline}** in scenario 3. Less dramatically, **[increasing
military expenditures has]{.underline}** a positive and significant
marginal effect on social spending in quarter 1 and then **[negative and
insignificant marginal effects in quarters 2--20 in scenario
2]{.underline}**. The differences in the direction and magnitude of the
marginal effects over time complicate our ability to identify the
overall effect of military expenditures on social spending. Figure 2,
therefore, plots the cumulative effect of a one-period, one-standard
deviation shock to Military Spending on Social Spending (with 95%
confidence intervals) over twenty quarters.

![Chart Description automatically

**[Figure 2 illustrates]{.underline}** the utility of considering
**[both the marginal and cumulative effects of military spending on
social spending]{.underline}**. This is perhaps most clear with scenario
4. Here, **[the cumulative effect of increasing military spending is
a]{.underline}** statistically significant **[reduction in social
spending in quarters 1--3. However, the direction]{.underline}** of this
relationship **[reverses in quarter 4 and is positive and statistically
significant between quarters 7 and 16]{.underline}**. The cumulative
effects of increasing military spending on social spending are
informative but less dramatic in the other scenarios. **[The overall
effect]{.underline}** of military spending on social expenditures
**[is]{.underline}** negative and significant in scenario 3 in quarter 1
and statistically **[insignificant in the remaining
quarters]{.underline}**. Scenario 2 suggests a positive and significant
relationship between military expenditures and social spending in
quarters 1 and 2 and an insignificant relationship in subsequent
quarters. Finally, **[the cumulative effects of increasing military
spending on social spending are positive and statistically significant
for quarters 1--15]{.underline}** in scenario 1.

Figure 3 reports the FEVD (with 95% confidence intervals) for each of
the four scenarios for a one-quarter, one-standard deviation shock to
Military Spending. FEVDs identify the importance of changes in military
spending for changes in social spending relative to the other variables
in the VAR model. The change in military spending has a large influence
on social spending in scenario 1, explaining between 49 and 59 percent
of the variance in social spending starting in the second quarter after
the shock in military spending. The shock to military spending explains
between 5 and 10 percent of the variance in social spending during the
first four quarters and between 10 and 15 percent of changes in social
spending in subsequent quarters in scenario 2. In scenario 3, changes in
military spending explain approximately 35 percent of the growth in
military spending during the second quarter following the increase and
approximately 20 percent of social spending in subsequent quarters.
Changes in military spending also have a significant influence on social
spending in scenario 4, explaining roughly 30 percent of the growth in
social spending in quarters 2--4 and 45--50 percent of social spending
in quarters 5--20.

has on social spending is conditional on variation in leaders'
preferences over how to finance]{.underline}** national **[defense and
can change over time.]{.underline}** We now present our findings for the
relationship between changes in military spending and economic growth.

The **[Effects of Military Spending on Economic Growth]{.underline}**

Figure 4 presents the marginal effect of a one-period, one-standard

Two things stand out about Figure 4. First, **[the IRFs identify the
same qualitative relationship between military spending and economic
growth in each scenario.]{.underline}** Second, changes in military
spending have a non-linear effect on economic growth that varies over
time. The initial marginal effect of increasing military spending on
economic performance is negative and statistically significant in each
scenario. However, **[the marginal effect of military spending on the
economy quickly changes signs and becomes positive and statistically
significant for multiple quarters in each of the four
scenarios]{.underline}** (scenario 1: quarters 5--7; scenarios 2 and 3:
quarters 4--7; scenario 4: quarters 4--8). Notably, the results in
Figure 4 are substantively similar to Oatley's (2015, 95--97) findings
on the short- to medium-term relationship between security shocks, the
military build-ups they induce, and economic growth.

#### Europe [can afford]{.underline} to spend more on defense.

Relations at Johns Hopkins University, 7/9/2018, "What NATO's
burden-sharing history teaches us,"

**[NATO has dealt successfully with its burden-sharing problem
before]{.underline}**, and it can do so again. History shows that
the [pressure U.S. President Donald Trump is placing on key
allies](https://www.defensenews.com/smr/nato-priorities/2018/07/09/trump-rips-nato-ahead-of-summit/) could
have a positive impact if he does not overplay his hand at the Brussels
summit.

In 1970, the relative defense expenditures of the United States and
Europe were proportionally roughly what they are today. Europe spent
only about 45 percent as much on defense, as did the United States. The
U.S. was in the midst of the Vietnam War, which drove U.S. defense
spending well above previous levels. **[The burden-sharing imbalance
then was one of the largest in NATO's history.]{.underline}**

But the decade of the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in European defense
spending of about \$80 billion (in constant 2011 dollars), roughly
comparable to the growth President Trump is now demanding. By 1980,
**[Europe was spending about 76 percent as much as the U.S. on defense ―
a massive improvement.]{.underline}**

Three **[factors contributed to this remarkable growth.]{.underline}**

First, Russia was becoming more belligerent. The Brezhnev Doctrine was
announced in November 1968, which was designed to forcefully crush
anti-communist movements in other communist countries. Soviet military
spending increased, and the country began to introduce the SS-20
intermediate-range nuclear-tipped missile, which directly threatened
Europe.

Second, the United States appeared to be less reliable. Washington was
focused on ending the Vietnam War, and the second half of the decade saw
U.S. defense cuts and retrenchment under President Jimmy Carter. To
stimulate European defense spending, Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield proposed amendments to withdraw U.S. troop from Europe.

And third, **[European economic growth averaged about 3 percent, enough
to afford spending increases.]{.underline}**

All three factors are present again today. Russian aggression in
Georgia, Ukraine and Syria have already stimulated a surge in European
defense sending. President Trump's threats are not dissimilar to those
of Mike Mansfield. And **[Europe has overcome much of the recent
recession with growth at 2.4 percent in 2017, the fastest pace in
decades.]{.underline}**

By the end of the Cold War, **[European defense spending was at about
2.5 percent of g]{.underline}**ross **[d]{.underline}**omestic
**[p]{.underline}**roduct. U.S. and European defense spending fell
during the decade of the 1990s, with both sides of the Atlantic taking a
peace dividend. **[The burden-sharing balance by 2000 was equitable,
with Europe contributing 78 percent as much as the U.S.]{.underline}**

Then the U.S. was attacked on 9/11. President George W. Bush drove U.S.
spending from 3.3 percent to about 5.3 percent of GDP to finance
trillion-dollar wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While the European allies
contributed significantly to operations in Afghanistan in particular,
they continued to take their peace dividend. Their defense spending sank
to 1.6 percent of GDP by 2013.

So today's disparity, as was the case with the Vietnam War, flows at
least partially from the fact that the U.S. was fighting wars outside of
Europe.

The 2014 NATO summit in Wales turned the European decline around with
the commitment by heads of state to seek to spend 2 percent of GDP on
defense by 2024. Defense cuts have been reversed everywhere. The number
of allies to meet that 2 percent goal has risen from three to eight in
the past four years. More than 16 have clear plans to attain the goal by
2024.

In addition, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has usefully
broadened the definition of burden-sharing to include not only "cash,"
but "capabilities and commitments." Capabilities will flow from the NATO
agreement to spend 20 percent of defense on new equipment. In this, 19
NATO countries are at or near the target. Enhanced capabilities will
also flow from the new readiness initiative, which will be agreed upon
at Brussels.

European commitments have been clearly demonstrated in Afghanistan, in
the war against ISIS and with new forward deployments in the Baltic
States.

**[There are still problems]{.underline}** that President Trump has
tried to address by writing letters to **[those allies who are unlikely
to meet the 2 percent goal]{.underline}**. The effort was excessively
blunt, but it did address the remaining issues.

**[The largest problem by far is Germany]{.underline}**, which currently
spends less than 1.3 percent of GDP on defense and is unlikely to go
much beyond 1.5 percent. Germans raise a series of reasons for their
unwillingness or inability to meet the agreed target. They have domestic
coalition problems. They would have difficulty absorbing all of that
defense spending efficiently. They spend more than others on official
development assistance to stabilize threats. They do not want to reward
Trump. What would their neighbors think given their World War II
history?

None of these reasons are convincing.

How should President Trump maximize his efforts at the summit to deal
with those whom he calls "free riders"? He has actually set the stage to
declare a victory. But if he pushes too hard and disrupts the unity and
cohesion that summit planners seek to attain, it will backfire. NATO can
not afford a broken summit as happened at the recent G-7 meeting.

Trump's **[best tactic is to]{.underline}** **[recognize that
burden-sharing is not only a trans-Atlantic problem]{.underline}**. It
is also a European problem. About half of the allies plan to live up to
their spending pledge, while the other half does not. The half will let
down not just the U.S. but its own European neighbors. That should be
Trump's message.

**[If handled with some dexterity]{.underline}**, **[the factors now at
work should yield results similar to those of the 1970s]{.underline}**.
Overreaching will just create confusion and disunity at a time when the
alliance needs to show strength in the face of tough challenges from the
east and south.

### 2NC INB---AT: Econ Turn---Europe Not Key to Global

#### It won't even affect the US

/alundy\]

Much of **[the volatile behavior of the stock and bond markets over the
past few days has been attributed to fears that Europe is heading into a
recession and that this will drag down the U.S. economy]{.underline}**.
Today's post covers the age old adage **["perception versus reality" and
looks at how European growth could impact U.S. growth]{.underline}**.

First, let us walk through a quick explanation of how international
trade feeds into U.S. GDP growth. One component that makes up total GDP
growth is a category called net exports. This measures the change in net
exports from one quarter to the next. Net exports has two components:

1\) Exports

2\) Imports.

Exports are sales of U.S. made goods to the international markets
(including Europe). An increase in exports from the previous quarter
adds to GDP growth while a decline in sales from the previous quarter
reduces GDP. Imports are purchases of foreign goods. Imports subtract
from GDP growth because the money is not spent in the U.S. A rise in
imports from the previous quarter subtracts from GDP growth while a
reduction in imports from the previous quarter adds to GDP growth.

Data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis shows that since the 3rd
quarter of 2010, **[net exports have contributed .02% to U.S. GDP
growth]{.underline}**.

With that primer covered, let us look at perception versus reality.

Perception:

1\) Europe is sliding into a recession

2\) Since Europe is the largest trading partner with the U.S., a
recession in Europe will have a major impact on the U.S. and might even
drag us into recession.

Reality:

1\) Europe does appear to be sliding into recession. In fact, some of
the European countries in the Eurozone are already in recession. The
Eurozone's GDP growth for the 2nd quarter of 2014 was zero and Germany's
GDP growth contracted (.2%).

2\) **[Research by a Canadian economist]{.underline}** (David Rosenberg)
shows that **[exports to the Eurozone could fall by 50% and the total
impact to U.S. GDP growth would be .6%. If U.S.]{.underline}** GDP
maintains its 2% level of GDP growth then, all else being equal, **[that
would reduce growth to 1.4%.]{.underline}**

The problem is that all else is not equal because there is another
dynamic going on with international trade that positively impacts the
import side of the equation. That dynamic is the energy complex. With
U.S. oil production booming, the U.S. is now importing less oil than in
the past. This has led to the trade deficit narrowing from over 5% of
GDP in 2005 to less than 3% now. **[Falling imports are a positive for
U.S. GDP growth that potentially offsets the negative impact from
falling exports]{.underline}**. Oil prices are another component of the
energy complex. With oil prices falling, then the value of imported oil
drops which is a reduction in value of imports. Once again, lower
imports adds to GDP growth and is another potential offset to falling
exports.

So, the **[perception that a recession in Europe will drag down the U.S.
economy is not necessarily a reality, especially with the positive
dynamics happening on the import side of the equation]{.underline}**.

The reason for the high volality in the stock markets has more to do
with the concerns over the exposure of U.S. companies to Europe, because
of their foreign sales, rather than the concerns about the impact to
U.S. GDP growth. Companies in the S&P 500 have approximately 40% of
their revenue derived from international sales. So, a **[recession in
Europe holds the real risk that U.S. companies that have heavy European
sales exposure could see their stock prices impacted. The reality is
that you could see high volatility in the stock market that would be
independent of the economy]{.underline}**.

**[European policymakers must devise ways to protect consumers and
businesses from economic hardship resulting from the war in
Ukraine]{.underline}**. This PIIE Chart lays out **[short- and long-term
effects of the war]{.underline}**, difficulties including **[loss of
exports to Russia, the fallout of sanctions, and the humanitarian
crisis]{.underline}** of dealing with millions of refugees.

More specifically, the **[shocks on supply chains from COVID-19 as well
as the war may prompt EU adjustments in just-in-time delivery
models]{.underline}** that sacrifice efficiency. **[Disruptions of food
supplies]{.underline}** from  Russia and Ukraine, particularly wheat,
**[are raising prices and causing shortages felt most acutely in
developing economies, which could increase immigration]{.underline}** to
Europe from food-insecure regions. 

**[Europe\'s dependence on Russian energy varies across EU member
states]{.underline}**. An oil embargo like the one proposed by the
European Commission should reduce Russian revenues. For gas, however,
embargo is not a short-term option, and more targeted measures such as a
tariff should be considered. **[The scramble to reduce EU dependency on
Russian energy and find alternative suppliers will be costly and take
time, requiring a faster transition to renewable sources.]{.underline}**
In the short term, consumers and firms will need protection from higher
energy bills that does not undercut the efficacy of sanctions. Lumpsum
transfers to low-income EU households are preferable to energy subsidies
and can be financed through deficit spending. But policymakers need to
be nimble as conditions change.

## Entrapment DA

### 1NC Entrapment DA

#### Security Cooperation triggers [allied aggression]{.underline}. [Conditional]{.underline} assistance avoids these entrapment risks.

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)

The United States spends more than eleven billion dollars per year on
direct military assistance to foreign governments and substate groups
(USAID 2009). The American government expresses a wide variety of goals
motivating their use of military assistance as a foreign policy tool.
**[Frequently, US administrations have explicitly linked military
aid]{.underline}** or arms transfers **[to a quid-pro-quo expectation of
compliance from a government]{.underline}** (Sislin 1994). More
generally, military assistance is expected to augment US national
security by increasing recipient state cooperation with US objectives.
According to the State Department\'s 2007 Report to Congress: Section
1206(f) of the 2006 National Defense Authorization Act:

Security cooperation remains a critical foreign policy tool that allows
the United States to advance its national security interests
worldwide.... Building partner nation security capacity is one of the
most important strategic requirements for the United States to promote
international security, advance U.S. interests and prevail in the war
against terrorism (1).

**[Importantly, the policies that guide the provision of US military aid
have changed significantly in recent years]{.underline}**. Shortly after
the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the **[Bush]{.underline}**
administration **[sent Congress an antiterrorism bill that would have
lifted all restrictions on military aid and arms
transfers]{.underline}** to foreign governments in cases where such
assistance could "help fight terrorism" (Federation of American
Scientists 2002, 1). **[The provision specifically called for lifting
bans on counterterrorism aid for states with a history of human rights
abuses or noncooperation]{.underline}** on counterterrorism.1 **[The
bill]{.underline}** was eventually modified to include "sunset clauses"
and some requirements for Congressional oversight, but it **[initiated a
year of radical changes in the way US military aid was allocated,
restricted, and justified]{.underline}**. In 2002, Congress amended the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, removing Armenia, Azerbaijan,
and Tajikistan from a list of states barred from receiving US arms
transfers. The United States has also extended military aid to Pakistan,
the Philippines, Turkey, Georgia, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Oman,
Yemen, Uzbekistan, and Columbia, among others, in the name of rewarding
or encouraging cooperation in the fight against terrorism (DSCA News
Releases, 2002--2008).

**[What are the consequences]{.underline}** of US military aid in a
rapidly changing, unpredictable global security environment? In this
study, we systematically investigate the effects of US military
assistance on recipient state behavior toward the United States between
1990 and 2004. Our analysis improves upon existing studies in several
ways. First, we develop three competing, clearly defined, and
falsifiable theoretical models of the relationship between military aid
and recipient state behavior. These models---Arms for Influence, Lonely
Superpower, and Reverse Leverage---range from a conventional
understanding of US military aid as a way to buy cooperation from the
recipient state to a more counterintuitive assessment of US aid as a
sign of American dependence on the recipient government for the
provision of some foreign policy good. Second, our focus on the
post-Cold War era allows us to measure recipient state compliance using
events data rather than the UN voting records that most studies rely on.
Third, **[we employ multiple statistical methods in order to match our
empirical models to]{.underline}** the **[hypotheses]{.underline}** we
are testing. For example, a number of our hypotheses predict a
reciprocal relationship between military aid and cooperation or
anticipate selection effects. To address these challenges, **[we use
both a simultaneous equations model with fixed effects and a two-stage
Heckman model]{.underline}**. Finally, we control for pre-existing
preference similarity between the United States and aid recipients in
our empirical analyses, so that **[our results capture the influence
military aid has on recipient state behavior]{.underline}** independent
of any dyadic predisposition toward cooperation or conflict.

Our research is relevant to larger academic debates about the utility
and limitations of foreign aid as a policy instrument. We attempt to
evaluate the effectiveness of foreign aid, and security assistance more
specifically, in terms of its ability to move recipients toward more
cooperative foreign policies. **[We test the conventional "arms for
influence" explanation of military aid]{.underline}** **[but find that
the relationship between US assistance and recipient state behavior is
considerably more complicated]{.underline}**. In general, we find that
**[military aid does not lead to more cooperative
behavior]{.underline}** on the part of recipient states. With limited
exceptions, **[increasing levels of US aid are linked to a significant
reduction in cooperative foreign policy behavior with the United
States]{.underline}**. US reaction to recipient state behavior is also
somewhat counterintuitive; instead of using a carrot-and-stick approach
to military aid allocations, our results show that increased recipient
state cooperation is likely to lead to subsequent reductions in US
military assistance.

**[The results of our inquiry also have implications for US foreign
policy. Policymakers]{.underline}** and military advisors **[invariably
justify military assistance to foreign governments on the basis of an
expectation that providing military aid to these governments will
increase US influence over the recipients\' foreign or domestic
policies]{.underline}**. In the 1980s, despite concerns about
Pakistan\'s efforts to develop nuclear weapons, the Reagan
administration began providing direct military assistance to Pakistan
and funneling money and weapons to Afghan rebels through Pakistan\'s
Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) after the Soviet Union invaded
Afghanistan. The primary objective was to support Islamic insurgents
fighting the USSR and the Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan. And,
in one important sense, the US policy was a tremendous success. The
Afghan rebels prevailed and the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan---a
result some attribute directly to US assistance and, more specifically,
to the highly accurate FIM-92 Stinger Surface-to-Air Missiles (SAMs) the
US provided. However, several hundred of the Stinger missiles are
unaccounted for, and Osama bin Laden is thought to have procured a
number of Stingers and other SAMs with which he could target US military
or civilian aircraft (Jane\'s Intelligence Review). Moreover, the
Pakistan Army\'s Inter-Services Intelligence diverted an unknown
quantity of US arms and assistance to groups it considered less
threatening to Pakistan than the Afghan mujahedeen---including some
radically anti-US Islamic factions (Debate in US House, June 22, 2001).
After a total ban on military assistance to Pakistan throughout the
1990s, the United States resumed providing billions of dollars of
military assistance and arms to Pakistan after the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 (Grimmett 2009). And, once again, there are concerns
that Pakistan is channeling some of the money to extremist groups on its
border with India. Perhaps more seriously, the ISI remains closely
linked to the Taliban militants the American military is fighting in
Afghanistan (Gopal 2008; Mazzetti and Schmitt 2009; Murphy 2010).

#### Multiple scenarios for NATO entrapment---causes escalation

THE BALTIC REPUBLICS AS A FLASHPOINT

Other **[existing]{.underline}** and potential **[NATO allies have
greater potential]{.underline}** **[to become tripwires]{.underline}**
**[for a war]{.underline}** **[between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and Russia]{.underline}**.
**[That]{.underline}** **[danger]{.underline}** **[already exists with
respect to the Baltic republics]{.underline}**; and if NATO enthusiasts
and anti-Russia hawks get their way and add Georgia or Ukraine to the
alliance, the risk of such a calamity mounts.

One should not exaggerate the danger of the Baltic countries and Russia
going to war, despite the hysteria in the United States and much of the
West about Vladimir Putin's alleged fondness for military aggression. 10
Menacing Russian actions toward those countries have been relatively few
and mild. Still, **[the outbreak of an armed conflict there is an
ever-present danger]{.underline}**, **[if not as the product of outright
aggression]{.underline}**, **[then as a consequence of
miscalculation]{.underline}** **[or disputes that spiral out of
control.]{.underline}**

**[An especially troubling issue is the less-than-cordial]{.underline}**
**[relationship between the Baltic ethnic majority]{.underline}**
populations **[and Russian minorities]{.underline}**. Lithuania's
population is only 9.4 percent Russian, according to that country's
latest census, but both Latvia and Estonia have larger ethnic Russian
minorities. In Latvia, Russian speakers make up 27 percent of the
population, and in Estonia, the figure is 26 percent. The ethnic
Russians tend to be concentrated in major metropolitan centers. As a
result, several cities in both countries have Russian majorities.
**[Most of that population]{.underline}** in all three Baltic republics
**[are the descendants of settlers that Joseph Stalin's regime imported
when the USSR seized]{.underline}** those **[countries at the beginning
of World War II]{.underline}**. **[That]{.underline}** ugly **[history
has fostered hostility]{.underline}** **[and led to various
forms]{.underline}** **[of legal and social
discrimination]{.underline}** following the breakup of the USSR and the
reemergence of independent Baltic nations.

**[The continuing discrimination against ethnic Russians is not a minor
matter]{.underline}**. Moscow has asserted a right to protect Russian
minorities from abuse in all of the independent states that emerged from
the wreckage of the Soviet Union. 11 That does not mean the Kremlin is
itching to reconquer the Baltic republics. Even without the military
risks that would exist because of the republics' membership in NATO, the
political, diplomatic, and economic drawbacks to Russia of taking such a
drastic step are apparent, and there is no credible evidence that Moscow
intends to do so. 12 Nevertheless, **[the persistence of ethnic tensions
is a worrisome factor that could force the hand of a Russian government
at some point or serve as a pretext for aggressive
action.]{.underline}**

Either development would create an awful dilemma for the United States.
As a 2016 RAND Corporation study concluded, it would be nearly
impossible for NATO to defend its Baltic members against a full-scale
Russian invasion for more than a few days without an extensive upgrade
of the alliance's existing force deployment. 13 **[Washington would then
face the horrid choice of either accepting]{.underline}** the
**[conquest]{.underline}** of a NATO member **[or escalating the
confrontation to the nuclear level]{.underline}**. So again, from the
standpoint of U.S. interests, it is hard to make the case that the
Baltic republics are not strategic liabilities rather than assets.

TURKEY: A DANGEROUS , ROGUE ALLY

**[The danger]{.underline}** that **[Turkey could drag the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and other NATO members
into a perilous confrontation]{.underline}** **[with Russia is even
greater]{.underline}** than the ability or inclination of the Baltic
republics to do so. A 2015 episode highlights Ankara's willingness to
engage in reckless actions that pose a danger to its alliance partners.

**[On November 24]{.underline}**, 2015, **[a Turkish air
force]{.underline}** F-16 **[shot down a Russian Sukhoi]{.underline}**
Su-24 **[fighter]{.underline}** near Turkey's border with Syria,
**[killing the pilot]{.underline}**. **[An especially troubling aspect
of the incident was the]{.underline}** needlessly **[harsh and
provocative nature]{.underline}** **[of the]{.underline}** Turkish
**[action]{.underline}**. Evidence indicated that the Russian plane had
crossed into Turkish airspace for a trivial 17 seconds. 14 Indeed, even
the exact demarcation of the border between Turkey and Syria in that
area is not clear. Moscow could plausibly claim that its jet was still
in Syrian airspace. Since Russian air and ground forces were in Syria at
the invitation of the Syrian government to help suppress the armed
rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad, the presence of Russian
combat aircraft on that side of the border was legitimate under
international law.

**[Ankara's reckless belligerence]{.underline}** **[was exceeded only by
its hypocrisy]{.underline}**. Turkish planes had violated the airspace
of Greece more than 2,200 times in 2014 alone, and 2014 was a typical
year for such incidents. 15 Greek officials have long complained that
the country must devote an annoyingly large portion of its defense
budget to intercepting Turkish aircraft engaging in such violations.
Fortunately, though, Athens has not adopted Turkey's apparent standard
and blasted offending aircraft out of the sky.

**[The Turkish incident with Russia is the harbinger of potential
peril]{.underline}**. Fortunately, Vladimir Putin's government responded
to the November 2015 incident with restraint, merely imposing some
economic sanctions. Even those penalties proved only temporary. Talks
between Putin and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan soon produced a
rapprochement between the two governments. Indeed, bilateral relations
have warmed so much that U.S. leaders worry that Russia and Turkey are
becoming too cozy. The growing compatibility between the two autocratic
leaders eventually produced a crucial arms sale in December 2017, with
Russia selling Turkey S-400 air defense missiles over Washington's
objections. 16

Given the bilateral rapprochement since the 2015 crisis, worries about
war between Turkey and Russia might seem irrelevant. Yet **[as events
throughout history have demonstrated,]{.underline}**
**[circumstances]{.underline}** can **[change quickly]{.underline}**,
**[and nations on friendly terms one moment can become staunch
adversaries the next]{.underline}**. **[The 2015 incident still
highlights disturbing issues about Turkey's behavior and the Article 5
obligation]{.underline}** to regard an attack on one NATO member as an
attack on all. The risks entailed in that obligation multiply as the
number of members increases. Maintaining a commitment to defend the
relatively stable nations of Western Europe during the Cold War is one
thing---although the tensions between Greece and Turkey indicate the
problems involved with even those obligations. Doing so on behalf of
nearly twice that number of NATO countries, some of which are far less
stable and predictable, is more perilous.

Even the task of sorting out which party to a conflict is the aggressor
is not always easy. For example, **[it was far from clear whether the
2015 incident was a case of Russian aggression or a clumsy Turkish
overreaction and provocation]{.underline}**. Yet **[if Russia had
responded to the downing of its plane by launching strikes against the
Turkish]{.underline}** missile **[batteries]{.underline}**, **[it is a
safe bet that Ankara would have demanded]{.underline}** that its **[NATO
partners]{.underline}**, especially the United States, **[help repel
such]{.underline}** "**[aggression]{.underline}**"---**[despite
the]{.underline}** potentially dire **[consequences of escalating a
conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary]{.underline}**. Wise American
leaders should be wary of alliance commitments that enable any supposed
ally to put the republic in such a quandary.

Nawaz Sharif "insisted" on meeting with President Bill Clinton,
according to Clinton's senior director for Near East and South Asian
affairs on the National Security Council, Bruce
Riedel.[56](https://tnsr.org/2020/07/wormhole-escalation-in-the-new-nuclear-age/#_ftn56)
The United States stepped in after Clinton called both India's and
Pakistan's leaders. Washington also sent its senior military commander
in the region and a senior State Department official to Islamabad.
Later, former deputy secretary of state Strobe Talbott wrote that the
world was closer to nuclear confrontation than during the Cuban Missile
Crisis.[57](https://tnsr.org/2020/07/wormhole-escalation-in-the-new-nuclear-age/#_ftn57)
Clearly, diplomatic interventions that can deescalate a crisis and
forestall a nuclear conflict should always be pursued. However,
**[expectations that]{.underline}** the **[great powers will step in to
rescue small nuclear states caught in an escalatory spiral may shift the
burden of restraint and reduce accountability]{.underline}** and
responsibility **[for managing strategic stability]{.underline}** among
regional actors in ways that may reinforce rather than reduce
risk-taking. In such a scenario, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[may not initiate an escalation
wormhole]{.underline}**, **[so much as get pulled through
one]{.underline}**.

Reckless Driver Escalation

**[Third-party]{.underline}**, "escalation pull" **[dynamics may also
emerge through extended deterrence when a nuclear]{.underline}**
"**[protectee]{.underline}**" **[feels emboldened]{.underline}** in its
interactions with regional nuclear powers **[due to protection under a
larger state's nuclear umbrella]{.underline}**. In these circumstances,
smaller states --- both nuclear and non-nuclear --- may drive escalation
in hopes of triggering intervention by other actors on their behalf. As
the only country in the world to extend a formal nuclear umbrella over
many of its formal treaty alliance partners, this risk is most acute for
the United States. As Barry Posen writes, these "**[reckless
drivers]{.underline}**" **[may take bold actions with little regard for
U.S. interests]{.underline}**, despite their relative dependence on the
United
States.[58](https://tnsr.org/2020/07/wormhole-escalation-in-the-new-nuclear-age/#_ftn58)
These participants and stakeholders may have asymmetries of stakes and
interests that drive their choices and behavior. **[In
Asia]{.underline}**, **[the complex dynamics between a small nuclear
power]{.underline}** (North Korea), **[larger nuclear
powers]{.underline}** (China and the United States), **[and extended
deterrence alliance members]{.underline}** (**[Japan and South
Korea]{.underline}**) **[underscore the challenge]{.underline}**. In
Europe, **[some of these dynamics play out along the]{.underline}**
"**[old NATO-new NATO]{.underline}**" **[divide as states closer to the
Russian periphery]{.underline}** **[may feel the need to test NATO
resolve]{.underline}**. Some have argued risks of U.S. entrapment were
not as high in the bipolar world of the Cold War, when the loss of any
one smaller partner would not have dramatically upset stability, and
there were no major differences in interests between the United States
and its
allies.[59](https://tnsr.org/2020/07/wormhole-escalation-in-the-new-nuclear-age/#_ftn59)
But **[today's more diffuse global power structure is more conducive
to]{.underline}** "**[reckless driving]{.underline}**," **[as
medium-size partners]{.underline}**, such as India, **[may be more
confident the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would
come to their aid]{.underline}** given their greater importance to the
global balence of power. Moreover, **[in a multipolar
system,]{.underline}** **[the interests of U.S. partners
are]{.underline}** more **[likely to diverge]{.underline}** from the
United States.

### 2NC UQ---Restraint Now

#### NATO is restrained now---Ukraine proves

University of Maryland's School of Public Policy, "**[NATO's restraint
has made things worse for Russia in Ukraine]{.underline}**" 3/15/22

**[NATO's decision to forgo direct intervention in Ukraine is proving to
be a wise strategy]{.underline}** for opposing Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. **[It]{.underline}** immediately **[robbed]{.underline}**
Russian President Vladimir **[Putin of the ability to blame the United
States and the West for its lack of military progress]{.underline}**,
thereby highlighting Russia's inability to wield its own power against a
much smaller neighbor. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has instead dragged
into an ongoing siege against a surprisingly resilient Ukrainian defense
that underscores the hollowness of Putin's stories that he would
liberate Ukraine from Western influence. Given its inability to overrun
its much smaller neighbor despite a preponderance of power, Russia has
proven to be its own worst enemy for its long-term plan in the region
and beyond. Though the Kremlin has executed a comprehensive propaganda
effort to justify and maintain support for its actions, it is
increasingly clear that Russia is paying a heavy price in its
international standing. As such, **[the international
community's]{.underline}** --- and namely Washington's --- **[choice to
avoid direct military action might have done more to undermine
Russia's]{.underline}** global **[standing]{.underline}** and Putin's
stability at home than overt intervention might have done. **[While
Putin might have been able to justify Russia's slow advance and even its
supposed liberation of Ukraine from Western influence if NATO and the
United States had taken a more active role in the
conflict]{.underline}**, **[Ukraine's]{.underline}** irrepressible
**[independence from its much stronger neighbor has undermined Russia's

superpower.

### 2NC L---Allied Manipulation

#### Unconditional assistance triggers [aggressive]{.underline} and [non-cooperative]{.underline} allied behavior

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)

In this model, **[we anticipate a paradoxical effect of military aid in
which powerful donor states become dependent on]{.underline}** the
**[recipients of their military aid]{.underline}** (Mott 2002). The
United States gives military aid to gain leverage and influence. But it
is in a competitive market for leverage through aid; it must compete
with other states to keep its influence over client states. At the same
time, we can assume that the United States chooses to invest heavily in
training and equipping the military forces of other countries, with all
the attendant risks this entails, because it needs something from these
states. Materially weak **[states]{.underline}** can **[exploit the fact
that a much stronger donor relies on them to provide some vital
good]{.underline}**---and the threat of defection to an alternative
supplier---**[to exert influence over the donor]{.underline}**.
According to Mott (2002), during the Cold War, **[US security assistance
recipients]{.underline}** learned to **[manipulate the United
States]{.underline}** ''by putting Moscow and Washington into an aid
competition, by diversifying across suppliers, and converting the
expected recipient dependence into a perverse sort of supplier
dependence'' (8). Although the Cold War competition with Moscow is no
longer central to US foreign policy, other states and even nonstate
actors have stepped in to replace the Soviet Union as alternative arms
suppliers. Stokke (1995) observes that strong states have typically used
foreign aid ''as a lever to promote objectives set by the donor, which
the recipient government would not have otherwise agreed to'' (12). But
Singer (2003) argues that the increasingly privatized military market
''fundamentally alters this patron-client relationship'' (211). Since
weaker states can now purchase weapons on the open market, the patron's
ability to influence client behavior is greatly diminished. **[Generous
US military funding runs the risk of creating militarily strong,
assertive clients that become more willing to ignore US
interests]{.underline}** (Mott 2002). **[Recipient states should be more
likely to defy the United States if they believe that the United States
will be]{.underline}** unable or **[unwilling to punish them for
defection]{.underline}** (Walt 2005). US dependence on recipient states
for oil, troop basing, over-flight permission, counternarcotic and
counterterrorism operations, etc... makes withdrawing aid potentially
more costly for the United States than for the aid recipients. It may be
easier for aid recipients to find alternative suppliers than it would be
for the United States to find an equally valuable place to base its
troops.

### 2NC L---Unconditional Support

#### Security cooperation during peacetime [emboldens allies]{.underline} and [causes entrapment]{.underline} during conflict scenarios---cooperation signals a [willingness to cooperate]{.underline}.

Consequently, JMEs are public and costly forms of interstate **[security
cooperation]{.underline}**, and, as seen in Figure 1, their **[frequency
has risen over time]{.underline}**. They are "sharp in," in that their
inputs -- national military contributions, chain of command, exercise
objectives, timing, and other considerations -- are clearly defined for
all participants at the outset. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine
Command Regulation 350-50-3 **[outlines six purposes of mission command
training programs,]{.underline}** including:6 1. Warfighting exercises,
where troops simulate plausible defense scenarios; 2. Command exercises,
where officers prepare for integrated command with Joint Staff (across
military services) and geographic commands; and 3. Mission readiness
exercises, where defined units test their ability to immediately carry
out specific missions. The number of troops involved depends on the
mission. The smallest are typically command post exercises, where
participants focus on the battle readiness of staffs to handle simulated
combat situations. Actions on the "battlefield" are simulated (often via
computer), and these results are fed to participating officers, who then
respond and issue orders, which are again carried out via simulation.

Command Training Program (2014). 4 Figure 1: Number of Joint Military
Exercises by Year, 1974--2010. exercises, by contrast, are "test runs"
of often large-scale operations. They can involve thousands of troops,
combat vehicles, and military and civilian transportation and logistics
support, all overseen by cadres of commanding officers. Regardless of
size, joint military exercises are typically self-contained, tightly
controlled and coordinated, and last between a few days to a few weeks.
In the United States, the Department of Defense or the Joint Chiefs of
Staff will establish an exercise's training objectives, force and
equipment requirements, and the chain of command in coordination with
all international participants. FM-25-4 recommends 13-14 months of lead
time to prepare for an exercise.7 Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) are
signed to ensure 7Army Field Manual 25-4: How to Conduct Training
Exercises (1984: Table 4). 5 all participants understand the JME's
terms, and there is a final meeting to confirm all parameters and
restrictions. In addition, the exercise commander has terminal
responsibility for all troops and their actions, and so is provided with
extensive lists of personnel and equipment (down to the serial number).
In total, JMEs are sharply delimited in their structure, purpose, and
participants to ensure accountability at all levels. But while JMEs are
"sharp in," they are not "sharp out." They produce strategic effects
exceeding and not managed by their operational bounds and command
structure. This can be best understood through the scholarship on "arms
and alliances." According to Morrow (1993), **[states have two general
paths to generate security. The first is "arms," by which we typically
mean the direct acquisition of military power solely under a single
state's authority. The second is "allies," commitments of military
support from one country to another. JMEs appear to advance both paths
simultaneously.]{.underline}** Training improves warfighting
performance, organizational resilience, and logistical efficacy (the
"arms" pathway). Critically, this increases the likelihood of conflict
escalation and war by prompting leaders to reach for military solutions
to foreign policy challenges.8 Along the "allies" pathway, JMEs
**[signal, at minimum, the willingness of the two countries' military
forces to cooperate in specific scenarios. Moreover, as McManus and
Nieman (2019) elaborate, exercises are an integral means for
(particularly powerful) states to demonstrate broader alignment and
support for a security partner]{.underline}**. In 1963, for example, the
United States agreed to hold an exercise with and in Saudi Arabia to
challenge United Arab Republic intervention in North Yemen and deter any
further incursions into nearby Saudi territory (Department of State
Office of the Historian, 1995: 290-291, 300). Despite not having an
alliance treaty with Riyadh, the **[JME implied that the United States
would at minimum bolster Saudi defenses through training and material
support, if not direct intervention. By signaling support through both
the arms and allies paths, exercises are doubly effective at deterring
adversaries]{.underline}**. But too much **[support, as Snyder (1997)
discusses, can lead partners to escalate conflict through adverse
behavior -- activities that one partner does not want to encourage in
another partner, because such an action has negative repercussions for
the first state's security. Chief among these potential risks is
entrapment, in which a state, emboldened by and seeking to stretch a
partner's support, escalates conflict for its own individual advantage
while dragging its partner]{.underline}** into the conflict through
reputational, strategic, and/or 8 See, for example, Stares (1975); Craft
(1999); Kinsella and Tillema (1995); and Krause (2004). 6 audience cost
mechanisms. Later authors contend that entrapment is rare because states
can use ambiguity, conditionality, "backing up" from their commitment,
and outright reneging to avoid being entangled in their partners'
conflicts (Kim, 2011; Benson, 2012; Beckley, 2015). However, **[even if
states are able to avoid having to support their partners in wartime,
their signals of support in peacetime may nevertheless embolden partners
to act aggressively]{.underline}** (Snyder, 1997; Cesa, 2010; Edelstein
and Shifrinson, 2018).

#### Unconditional security cooperation [entangles]{.underline} the US in allied conflicts. Only the counterplan solves.

**Priebe et al '21** \[Miranda; Dec 2021; Ph.D. in political science,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; M.P.A. in international
relations, Princeton University; RAND Corporation "Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the United States in Conflict?,"
https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA739-3.html\]

Advocates of a grand strategy of restraint or offshore balancing, also
known as **[restrainers, call for greater emphasis on diplomacy and less
U.S. military engagement abroad.]{.underline}** These strategists call
for reduced forward military presence, a higher bar for the use of
force, and negotiations to settle conflicts of interest with U.S.
adversaries diplomatically. They argue that **[the United States should
stop expanding its alliances, renegotiate alliances to reduce
entanglement risks]{.underline}**, or even end some of its existing
alliances and partnerships.

**[Fear of entanglement is one of the reasons that advocates of
restraint say the United States should reexamine its security
relationships.]{.underline}** This is not to say that all restrainers
believe that the United States should end all existing commitments.
**[Rather, many of these strategists argue that the United States should
keep its security commitments limited to states that help protect vital
U.S. interests and should take steps to mitigate entanglement
risks.]{.underline}**

For example, some restrainers have called for maintaining the U.S.
alliance with Japan to balance against China but have advocated for
renegotiating the alliance terms so that Japan does more for its own
defense.

Advocates of restraint highlight three ways in which alliances entangle.
First, **[allies and partners might see a U.S. security commitment as
evidence that the United States will defend them regardless of how a
conflict begins. This belief in an unconditional U.S. commitment could
embolden allies and partners to adopt policies that make a conflict more
likely because they think they have a "blank check" to bankroll
aggressive policies. As]{.underline}** one group of restrainers put it,
When someone else is going to pay the price for an ill-advised action---
that is, when the United States is going to come "fix" any predicament
that its allies get into---there is little incentive to avoid trouble.
**[It is easy to gamble with someone else's money.]{.underline}**

Restrainers express the fear that, **[if a crisis escalates, the United
States might feel compelled to defend the reckless ally or partner
because it believes that its own credibility is on the line, so failing
to act could cause other allies and adversaries to question U.S.
commitments elsewhere]{.underline}**. This combination of ally
emboldenment and U.S. intervention to defend the ally constitutes
entrapment.

### 2NC L---Strategic Blackmail

#### Freeriding enables [strategic blackmail]{.underline}, which [ensures]{.underline} entrapment

**Ashford '17** \[Emma M.; Jul 6; Defense and Foreign Policy Studies,
Cato Institute; Canadian Foreign Policy Journal "Hegemonic blackmail:
entrapment in civil war intervention,"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11926422.2017.1341843#2b85d6ca-6520-4a3d-8e4a-aa9f2ee3f33d-357c6cfb-53ba-4fa0-8e6b-e69fc2b8ce9f\]

Entrapment occurs largely when no national security interest is at
stake; indeed, this is the key distinction between entrapment and the
classic notion of "chain-ganging" (Christensen and Snyder 1990). The
mechanisms by which **[entrapment can occur include: (1) a state's
choice to defend its ally for reasons of credibility; (2) socialization,
which encourages the adoption of an ally's interests (so-called
"self-entrapment"); (3) provocation, as alliance formation creates a
security spiral; (4) an alliance emboldens a small state to attack a
competitor]{.underline}**; or (5) a state, fearful of abandonment,
initiates conflict in a last-ditch attempt to preserve the alliance
(Snyder 1984, Betts 2011, Findley et al. 2012). Of these, **[both
credibility and socialization pressures are plausible drivers of
involvement in civil conflict.]{.underline}**

In effect, each can be understood as a strategic interaction between
State A (the potential intervener) and State B (A's ally) over an
intervention in a third-party state (State C). In the case of
credibility, **[State A may fear that its refusal to back B's
intervention in C's civil war may undermine its commitments to other
allies.]{.underline}** Alternately, **[the process of alliance
socialization, with frequent meetings and joint military exercises over
time, may encourage State A to absorb B's interests, including those it
is pursuing in its intervention.]{.underline}** In both cases, alliance
dynamics push A toward support of B's ongoing intervention. In addition
to these "natural" forms of civil war entanglement -- i.e., pressures
that are an inevitable result of strong security ties -- **[it is also
possible for State B to increase the odds of an intervention by State A.
Indeed, B sometimes has a strong incentive to do so, particularly when A
has substantially higher military capacity.]{.underline}**

Put more simply, **[small states can benefit substantially from the
intervention of a major power ally, particularly if they lack the
capacity or manpower to carry out an effective campaign
alone.]{.underline}** African Union peacekeeping forces, for example,
typically lack military assets required for their missions; **[training,
logistical support and equipment are often provided by the United States
to overcome this deficiency]{.underline}** (Williams 2011). Such
pressure is far less likely if A and B both have high military capacity,
or if A is weaker, as State B wouldn't need external support to achieve
its objectives in these cases. Likewise, if both A and B have low
military capacity, then A's support is unlikely to be of help. In these
three scenarios, **[there is also a high potential for free riding,
particularly in cases of humanitarian crisis]{.underline}** (Gent 2007).
Thus, pressure from allies to join an intervention is likely to be
highest when A is larger (i.e., relatively more capable in military
terms) than B, and has the potential to tip the balance toward B's
intervention objectives. **[There are two ways in which State B can seek
to entangle A in its ongoing intervention.]{.underline}** First, **[it
can seek to manipulate public and policymaker opinion, purposefully
using diplomatic pressure, as well as lobbying and media manipulation to
shift public opinion on intervention.]{.underline}** Prior studies show
that **[media coverage is often a necessary, if not sufficient,
condition for intervention]{.underline}**, particularly in humanitarian
crises (Jakobsen 1996, Gilboa 2005). Second, State B can seek to alter
the strategic balance inside C's civil war in ways that alter A's
incentives. Indeed, actors within a civil war can deter third-party
intervention using methods like salami tactics to reduce threat
perceptions (Werner 2000); **[State B can use similar tactics, seeking
to empower rebel forces and increase the level of threat State A feels
from the conflict.]{.underline}** B can also take steps which increase
the odds of victory or shorten the projected time horizon of the
intervention. **[These two approaches form a rough type of strategic
"blackmail," allowing State B to entangle A in its ongoing
intervention.]{.underline}**

### 2NC L---Interest Expansion

#### Security co-op opens the door to interest expansion which enables [reckless driving]{.underline}

**Priebe et al '21** \[Miranda; Dec 2021; Ph.D. in political science,
Massachusetts Institute of Technology; M.P.A. in international
relations, Princeton University; RAND Corporation "Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the United States in Conflict?,"
https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA739-3.html\]

Third, **[once the United States makes a security commitment, it might
begin to define its interests more expansively, effectively adopting the
ally's or partner's interests as its own. Diplomatic and military
interactions with the ally might cause the United States to become
socialized to its concerns. Even having a seat at the table with U.S.
leaders could give states opportunities to influence U.S.
choices.]{.underline}** Domestic lobbying by allies and partners might
further socialize the U.S. public or policymakers to ally and partner
concerns. Through lobbying, these **[allies and partners could create a
constituency within the United States that promotes military involvement
in a wider variety of issues involving those states.]{.underline}**

Restrainers also note that **[there are forms of entanglement that
remain short of U.S. involvement in military conflict]{.underline}**,
which we do not evaluate in this report. Edelstein and Itzkowitz
Shifrinson argue that **[entanglement dynamics in Asia have affected
U.S. force levels and the way the United States approaches its
relationship with China]{.underline}**. Posen uses **[the term reckless
driving to refer to allies and partners that adopt riskier policies of
all kinds because of an expectation of continued U.S. support. For
example, Posen argues that U.S. military aid and political support have
freed up resources for Israel to spend on settlement activities in the
West Bank.]{.underline}** The U.S. association with Israel's policies on
settlements and toward the Palestinians more generally, Posen argues,
has harmed U.S. standing in the Arab world and has undercut its foreign
policy goals with these countries, including counterterrorism.

### 2NC L---Studies

#### Studies prove the link is significant

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)

In the results from equation 1, we see that, contrary to Hypothesis 1a
(Arms for Influence), but consistent with Hypothesis 3b (Reverse
Leverage), **[there is a significant, negative correlation between
levels of US military aid and recipient state
cooperation]{.underline}**. Economic aid, on the other hand, appears to
have no effect on recipient state cooperation. The recipient country\'s
GDP and S score are also not correlated with a state\'s behavior toward
the United States. Recipient states that are democratic, and those that
have US troops stationed on their soil, appear to be more cooperative
with the United States, all else equal.

Table 3 presents results from using equation 1 to simulate the
substantive impact of the statistically significant independent
variables on recipient state cooperation. States that do not receive any
US military aid display an average level of cooperation with the United
States of +1.5 when all other variables are held constant at their
means. The model predicts that states that obtain the average amount of
US military aid (\$20 million) will be less cooperative---scoring an
average of −11 on the cooperation-conflict scale. **[An increase in US
military aid]{.underline}** to one standard deviation above the mean
**[leads to]{.underline}** an additional six-point **[reduction
in]{.underline}** the monthly **[cooperation]{.underline}** score **[of
the recipient state]{.underline}**. In contrast, an increase in the
number of US troops from its mean to one standard deviation above the
mean raises recipient state cooperation almost one point. Democratic
recipients are on average four points more cooperative than
nondemocratic recipients.

#### Stats prove

**Sullivan 11**, Professor at UNC-Chapel Hill, with Brock Tessman,
Assistant Professor at Georgia and Xiaojun Li, PhD in Political Science
from Stanford (Patricia, "US Military Aid and Recipient State
Cooperation," *Foreign Policy Analysis*, No. 7)

In this paper, we attempted **[a systematic investigation]{.underline}**
into the relationship between US military aid and the level of foreign
policy cooperation exhibited by the states that receive that aid. We
aimed to improve on the existing literature by building and testing
three explicit theoretical models (Arms for Influence, Lonely Superpower
and Reverse Leverage), focusing on a new measure of cooperation
generated from events data rather than UN voting records, and
controlling for preference similarity, so that our results **[capture
the influence military aid has on recipient state behavior independent
of any dyadic predisposition toward cooperation or
conflict]{.underline}**.

**[We test seven hypotheses associated with three different theoretical
models]{.underline}** and find mixed results. **[There is little
evidence in favor of the Arms for Influence model]{.underline}**:
**[there is an inverse relationship between]{.underline}** absolute
levels **[of US military aid and recipient state
cooperation]{.underline}**, and there is no relationship at all between
recipient state dependence on US aid and recipient state behavior. Thus,
while the Lonely Superpower hypothesis was on the right track by
predicting an unorthodox relationship between aid and cooperation, it
did not perform as well as some of the Reverse Leverage hypotheses when
it came to explaining exactly what form such unorthodoxy would take.

In several ways, **[the Reverse Leverage model was quite
accurate]{.underline}**: (i) **[states receiving military aid from the
United States exhibit lower levels of cooperation than states that do
not receive military aid]{.underline}**, (ii) in the population of all
states, higher levels of **[military aid appear to produce more defiant
behavior]{.underline}**, and (iii) the United States does not punish
defiance with reductions in aid or reward greater cooperation with
increases in military aid. Together, these results suggest that US
military assistance is allocated for reasons that are largely
independent of overall recipient state behavior toward the United
States. The Reverse Leverage model contends that military aid is
delivered to states that the United States depends on for security
reasons. Realizing their leverage over Washington, **[states that
receive high amounts of aid are actually more able to engage in
uncooperative behavior]{.underline}** than are states that the United
States does not depend so heavily upon. We attempted to test for the
effects of an aid recipient\'s "security value" directly by comparing US
allies to nonallies. Consistent with the Reverse Leverage model, we find
that **[states with a defensive alliance with the United States
are]{.underline}** more likely to receive US military aid but **[less
likely to respond to aid by increasing their cooperation with American
preferences]{.underline}**.

### 2NC L---Empirics

#### Libya proves NATO entrapment is [certain]{.underline} and [impossible]{.underline} to deescalate if we give them unconditional security cooperation

**Ashford '17** \[Emma M.; Jul 6; Defense and Foreign Policy Studies,

entrapment in civil war intervention,"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/11926422.2017.1341843#2b85d6ca-6520-4a3d-8e4a-aa9f2ee3f33d-357c6cfb-53ba-4fa0-8e6b-e69fc2b8ce9f\]

In order to better understand these dynamics, this article offers a
preliminary analysis of two recent cases where the United States has
faced substantial pressure to intervene in civil wars: Syria and Libya.
In both cases, **[American allies have taken active military and covert
actions, and have sought to induce the United States to join
them.]{.underline}** These case studies do not aim to test a specific
hypothesis -- or to prove that alliance pressure is the only factor
which influences intervention decision-making -- but rather aim to
further explore and illustrate the process of civil war entrapment. The
two cases are distinct: **[the United States chose to join a major North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervention in
Libya]{.underline}**, but has been more reticent to intervene directly
against the Assad regime in Syria.

**[Alliance dynamics in Libya]{.underline}**

During 2011, **[substantial pressure was placed on American policymakers
by France and the United Kingdom, both of whom strongly supported a
pro-rebel intervention in Libya.]{.underline}** This intervention has
sometimes been portrayed as a choice by the Obama administration, a
policy infamously described as "leading from behind." Yet the timing of
pressure implies strongly that **[American allies instead actively
lobbied to obtain necessary American military support.]{.underline}**
Indeed, **[as then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates noted in his
memoirs, "Asked if the situation in Libya involved our 'vital national
interests,' I honestly said I did not think so -- but our closest allies
felt that it affected their vital interests and therefore we had an
obligation to help them"]{.underline}** (Gates 2014, p. 521). For
France's Nicholas Sarkozy, an intervention in Libya offered substantial
domestic political benefits, while historical British animosity toward
Gaddafi was enhanced by concerns about the growing humanitarian costs of
the Arab Spring uprisings. Yet both **[Britain and France would have
struggled to conduct an intervention alone; as British Defense Secretary
Liam Fox later admitted, "NATO could not have done it without the
US"]{.underline}** (quoted in Wintour and Watt 2011).

Protests against the government of Muammar Gaddafi began as early as
February 2011, but it was not until Gaddafi launched a military
counteroffensive against rebel groups that international pressure began
to grow for an intervention to protect civilians. Even then, as Chivvis
(2012, p. 67) notes, "when the conflict in Libya began, another US
military intervention in the Middle East seemed a distant possibility at
best." Instead, France and the United Kingdom took the lead, building
momentum for intervention on humanitarian grounds through an aggressive
public relations (PR) campaign (Adler-Nissen and Pouliot 2014).

Though the United States only agreed to join the intervention two days
before the key vote on United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution
1973, American military capacity was instrumental (Barry 2011). Indeed,
**[though the United States tried to step back from the air campaign
after the initial 10 days, it came under consistent pressure to commit
more resources.]{.underline}** European states found it difficult to
maintain a high-intensity air campaign without American support, and
were only able to manage 150 of 300 planned daily strikes inside Libya.
**[The United States provided 80 per cent of all air-to-air refueling
(Barry 2011), and "surged" hundreds of staff to the Combined Air Ops
Centre in Italy in order to handle European intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (ISR) shortfalls (Chivvis 2012).]{.underline}**
Despite this reliance, America's allies sought to expand the campaign.
Indeed, even as France and the United Kingdom were publicly calling on
the United States to join them in creating a no-fly zone, they privately
recognized the National Transitional Council as Libya's government, and
began to covertly assist rebel groups (Kuperman 2013).

**[Allied pressure was most apparent in the run-up to the intervention,
as concerted diplomatic and public relations efforts focused on
obtaining American support.]{.underline}** Both Sarkozy and Cameron
strongly favored intervention, a marked contrast to the skepticism and
debate in the White House (Chivvis 2012). During a later parliamentary
enquiry, British policymakers were clear that they felt it was their
influence that tipped the balance in internal American debates. **[As
Liam Fox, British Secretary of Defence, later noted, "It is no secret
that the US were quite reticent about getting involved militarily ... in
a Libyan campaign."]{.underline}** William Hague, Foreign Secretary,
concurred: "**[I think in the UK and France we did influence the United
States on this subject where there were divisions"]{.underline}** (House
of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee 2016).

It was under this pressure that President Obama sent his Secretary of
State, Hillary Clinton, to meet with Libyan opposition leader Mahmoud
Jibril in Paris; her advocacy on Jibril's behalf would later prove
influential in the American choice to join the intervention (Becker and
Shane 2016). **[As Obama himself later admitted: "this is not so at the
core of US interests that it makes sense for us to unilaterally strike
against the Gaddafi regime. At that point, you've got Europe and a
number of Gulf countries ... who are calling for action"]{.underline}**
(quoted in Mason 2016).12 Defense Secretary Robert Gates ultimately
concluded in his memoir that "Qaddafi's bloodthirsty rhetoric ... the
action of the Arab League, and strong British and French **[pressure for
NATO to act, I think, persuaded the president"]{.underline}** (Gates
2014, p. 518).

**[French and British leaders took a two-pronged approach to achieve
this influence, relying on private diplomatic channels and the media to
build public support.]{.underline}** At the United Nations, British
diplomats handled the drafting of several Security Council resolutions,
building momentum for Resolution 1973 authorizing the use of military
force. In order to bolster the case that the intervention was a widely
accepted humanitarian mission, diplomats procured an Arab state amenable
to the intervention (Lebanon) and a defector (Ibrahim Dabbashi)
(Adler-Nissen and Pouliot 2014). French policymakers, including French
Foreign Minister Alain Juppé, spoke openly of their unhappiness with
Washington's "slowness" on the issue (cited in Erlanger 2011). Both
states sought to be the main source of information on the unfolding
crisis, highlighting their joint narrative even when embassies in
Tripoli presented contrary reports (Adler-Nissen and Pouliot 2014).

In parallel**[, both governments pursued an aggressive media strategy,
seeking to build popular support and making a concerted effort to keep
Libya in the headlines, even as other Arab Spring crises and Europe's
financial meltdown threatened to knock it off the front pages. The
implication that the United States was a bad ally for refusing to back
the intervention was a key component of this strategy]{.underline}**;
one only has to look at the treatment Germany received for its choice to
abstain on Resolution 1973 to see how effective this strategy was
(Brockmeier 2013). Germany's abstention "provoked speculation that
Germany wanted to shed its supporting role in the US-led Western
alliance," highlighting the credibility pressure that allies can face
(Bremmer and Leonard 2012).

Despite this, **[the primary focus of PR efforts in London and Paris was
in using the "framing power of the media" to portray intervention as a
humanitarian necessity, using Gaddafi's own inflammatory rhetoric to
build a case that mass casualties were imminent]{.underline}**
(Adler-Nissen and Pouliot 2014). In fact, **[as later studies would
demonstrate, much of this evidence was found to be substantially
exaggerated by Libyan expatriate groups]{.underline}** (Kuperman 2013).
Nonetheless, France and Britain were able to use it to build public
support, helping proponents inside the United States government to gain
the upper hand in ongoing debates (Chivvis 2012). While other factors
certainly affected the American decision to engage in intervention in
Libya, **[it is undeniable that this pressure from America's NATO allies
played a key, potentially decisive role.]{.underline}**

#### Syria proves increased US involvement facilitates NATO entrapment.

**[Pressure to intervene in Syria]{.underline}**

**[The interaction between Middle Eastern countries and the United
States over intervention against the Assad regime presents another
illustration of the logic of civil war entrapment. With the notable
exception of NATO member Turkey, the United States does not have formal
commitments to any state in the region.]{.underline}** Yet the United
States does have strong regional security ties, including a long history
of military cooperation with Saudi Arabia, bases housing substantial
numbers of troops in Qatar and Kuwait, and the headquarters of the
United States Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. At the same time, the capacity
deficiencies of regional states were more pronounced than those of
America's NATO allies; these states simply did not possess the
capabilities to mount a successful intervention against the militarily
powerful Assad regime. Though the Gulf States were not successful in
obtaining a full-scale American military intervention, their efforts
appear to have shaped America's covert funding and training of Syria's
rebels.

Though the Syrian civil war began in 2011, the Obama administration
initially chose to pursue non-military measures, such as sanctions,
humanitarian aid and disruption of arms shipments. It was not until
mid-2013, following the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons, that
**[the United States substantially increased its involvement,
orchestrating a surprising diplomatic deal with Russia to facilitate the
disarmament of Syria's chemical weapons, and authorizing the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to arm and train some rebel
groups]{.underline}** (Londono and Miller 2013). Even with President
Trump's more recent use of cruise missiles against regime airfields --
again in response to chemical weapons use the bulk of America's
involvement in Syria remains focused not on the Assad regime, but on the
Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).

**[This limited involvement has frustrated the Gulf States and Turkey,
all of whom were actively engaged in arming and funding rebel groups
inside Syria as early as 2012]{.underline}** (BBC News 2014).
Unfortunately, this aid was poorly coordinated and served to create
resource competition, contributing to the fragmentation and
radicalization of the Syrian opposition (Ostovar and McCants 2013).
Turkey is the only American partner to have directly committed troops to
fight inside Syria (Ozdal and Davison 2016). As the ongoing Saudi-led
intervention in neighboring Yemen highlights, the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) remains largely incapable of mounting a military
intervention without American logistical and intelligence support (Black
2016).

**[The push for a United States-backed intervention began in 2012, when
Qatar made strong representations at the United Nations in favor of
arming the Syrian opposition, providing a no-fly zone, or overthrowing
Assad]{.underline}** (Lynch and Gearan 2012). Diplomats attempted to
mitigate the concerns of American policymakers about potential
extremism, with Qatar's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs arguing
against "excluding anyone at this stage, or bracketing them as
terrorists ... . We should bring them all together and we should work on
them to change their ideology" (Dickenson 2012). By the following year,
the **[Saudi and Qatari governments began to bankroll a substantial
lobbying effort, led by Bandar bin Sultan, a former ambassador with
strong Washington connections. Behind closed doors, diplomats tried to
persuade the Obama White House to join them]{.underline}**
(Gartenstein-Ross and Schanzer 2013). **[At the same time, they took
steps inside Syria to ameliorate American concerns. In response to
concerns about the fragmentation of the opposition, Saudi Arabia and
Turkey worked together to create a coalition of rebel groups (Jaish
al-Fateh); to counter American concerns about extremists, they sought to
bolster moderate groups]{.underline}** (Butler 2015).

Yet these strategies were ineffectual, and **[the next few years saw a
shift toward more public tactics. High-profile opinion articles made the
case for intervention on the grounds of regional
stability.]{.underline}** As Saudi Arabia's Ambassador in London argued
in the New York Times, "the West's policies on both Iran and Syria risk
the stability and security of the Middle East" (Bin Nawaf Bin Abdulaziz
Al Saud 2013). **[Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were also
among the top 10 foreign spenders on DC-based lobbying firms in
2013]{.underline}** (Sunlight Foundation); with the latter spending
US\$11.1 million and the former a whopping US\$14.2 million (Itkowitz
2014). Certainly, this spending was not focused solely on Syria -- for
example, Saudi leaders also sought to smooth arms deals -- but the role
of lobbying firms in the intervention debate cannot be ignored. This
effort spanned "both the inside game, which is lobbying and government
relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend
to reach a broader audience" (Ho 2016). **[The public relations firm
Qorvis, acting on behalf of the Gulf States, initiated a campaign to
create the impression of a coherent, "moderate" Syrian opposition,
capable of benefiting from Western intervention. In reality, it is
doubtful such an opposition ever existed. But Qorvis created websites,
ran a Syrian Opposition Coalition twitter account, and coordinated
meetings on Capitol Hill, rarely disclosing their connection to the
Saudi government (Quinn 2015).]{.underline}**

### 2NC L---AT: Plan is Narrow

#### Empirics prove entrapment even with narrow commitments

**Priebe et al '21** \[Miranda; Dec 2021; Ph.D. in political science,

relations, Princeton University; RAND Corporation "Do Alliances and
Partnerships Entangle the United States in Conflict?,"
https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA739-3.html\]

**[Advocates of restraint often present entrapment as a general risk
that is associated with U.S. security relationships.]{.underline}** They
have not made any explicit distinctions between alliances and
partnerships as we do here. **[These strategists have pointed to the
potential entrapment risks associated with the U.S. alliances
with]{.underline}** Japan, the Philippines, and **[Eastern European and
Baltic allies in NATO.]{.underline}** Restrainers also see risks in
relationships with U.S. partners, such as Taiwan and Georgia. They argue
that **[Taiwan's leaders would have been more cautious in their rhetoric
about independence in the past if Taiwan had not had a long-standing
security relationship with the United States]{.underline}**. Advocates
of restraint also claim that **[expectations of U.S. support led Georgia
to adopt provocative policies toward South Ossetia in 2008, which led to
war with Russia.]{.underline}** Although the United States was not drawn
into this conflict, restrainers argue that **[the case highlights how
U.S. security relationships incentivize risk-taking by allies and
partners.]{.underline}**

Second, alliances can entangle if the United States sees its
credibility--- specifically, its reputation for upholding its
commitments---as being on the line in a wider variety of issues
involving its allies and partners. **[Even though a U.S. commitment
might be narrow]{.underline}**, such as defending the ally's homeland in
the event of an attack, **[the United States might worry that other
allies and adversaries see a U.S. response to any issue involving the
ally as an indication of U.S. commitment in different contexts. The
United States might come to believe that, to protect its credibility, it
has to fight wars over peripheral interests involving U.S. allies both
to reassure allies and to deter adversaries.]{.underline}** Entanglement
dynamics do not have to involve the ally or partner that the United
States is defending. Rather, entanglement would be at work if the United
States were to become involved in conflict to show its reliability to
other allies and partners who might be watching. These mechanisms could
result in the United States risking or fighting wars that it would not
have considered absent the alliance or partnership.

### 2NC !---Comparative 

#### Alliance entrapment is [uniquely more likely]{.underline} than direct war---[narrow]{.underline} foreign policy, [nuclear innovation]{.underline}, and [rising tensions]{.underline} drive entrapment.

Is this competition likely to lead to war between the United States and
China, Russia, or other countries? In short, the **[probability of great
power war is higher now than it has been in some time]{.underline}**,
but nuclear weapons continue to limit the likelihood of a systemic great
power war breaking out. However, as the United States becomes more
concerned about Chinese intentions and as **[Beijing becomes more
focused on short-term targets of opportunities in the South China Sea
and elsewhere, the probability of conflict rises.]{.underline}** Where
**[war is most likely to occur is through a process of alliance
entrapment]{.underline}**, a potentially volatile scenario that has been
**[underappreciated by advocates of an American-led global international
order]{.underline}**. Skeptics of entrapment have typically pointed to
the experience of the Cold War to argue that the likelihood of great
powers becoming entrapped by their weaker allies is limited. **[During
the Cold War, however, both the United States and the Soviet Union
defined their interests globally, making it difficult for either to be
entrapped into a conflict it had not defined as part of its
interests]{.underline}**. Today, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates may be more tempted to **[define its interests
more narrowly]{.underline}** even as it recognizes the risk posed by a
rising China. The result is a **[higher likelihood of American
entrapment]{.underline}** in conflicts it might otherwise prefer to
avoid. Such **[entrapment]{.underline}** is a particular **[risk for
great powers like the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
that **[remain absolutely powerful]{.underline}** but are arguably in
relative decline. The United States has an interest in not seeing China
become a hegemonic power in East Asia. At the same time, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates is **[not likely to
confront China]{.underline}** directly over its growing interests and
aspirations in the region. The **[anticipated costs of direct conflict
between the two countries]{.underline}** are **[likely sufficient to
dissuade either side]{.underline}** from initiating such a war. Instead,
**[conflict is more likely to emerge when a friend or ally of the United
States]{.underline}** --- such as Vietnam, the Philippines, or Japan ---
**[finds itself in a crisis with Beijing. Washington]{.underline}** will
be tempted to **[intervene on behalf of these friends]{.underline}** in
order to **[put the brakes]{.underline}** on any growing Chinese
influence in the region. Dangerously, **[smaller powers may be tempted
to provoke China precisely to generate this American
response.]{.underline}** Military clashes in the waters of East and
Southeast Asia are relatively easy to envision, and have already
occurred in recent decades --- consider, for example, the Mischief Reef
disputes in the 1990s, or the Scarborough Shoal incident in the 2000s.
Fortunately, such **[clashes are likely to remain limited in
scale]{.underline}**. While some worry that **[innovations in nuclear
weapons technology]{.underline}** have **[made such weapons more usable
and more practical]{.underline}** in the conduct of warfare, the
dynamics of escalation from the use of a small, low-yield nuclear weapon
are still difficult to predict. The dangers of a catastrophic nuclear
conflagration will continue to place a lid on any possible future
conflicts between the United States and China. Importantly, however, the
**[risks of continuous crises and skirmishes are significant --- and
escalation is possible.]{.underline}**

### 2NC !---Yes Entrapment---Top Level

#### Entrapment is a [process]{.underline}, not an event. Critics of the thesis [miscount case studies]{.underline} and [underestimate the risk]{.underline}. 

**Edelstein and Shifrinson 18**, \*David M. Edelstein, Professor of
Foreign Studies at Georgetown, and \*Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson, an
Assistant Professor of International Relations, Boston University,

**[Recent efforts to examine entrapment]{.underline}**, however,
**[define the issue differently]{.underline}**. In a widely cited study,
for example, Tongfi Kim argues that Snyder's definition, is "too broad"
because it encompasses both military and non-military behaviors that may
or may not be desirable from the perspective of the state in question.
Instead, Kim argues that Snyder's original definition should more
properly be understood as "entanglement" -- "the process whereby a state
is compelled to aid an ally in a costly and unprofitable enterprise
because of the alliance" -- while "entrapment" more narrowly refers to
"undesirable entanglement in which the entangling states adopts a risky
or offensive policy not specified in the alliance agreement \[emphasis
added\]."14 **[Beckley embraces Kim's approach]{.underline}**,
**[arguing]{.underline}** that **[entrapment occurs]{.underline}**
"**[only when an ally instigates a conflict]{.underline}** with a third
party in order **[to drag its alliance partners into the
dispute]{.underline}**." **[Entanglement]{.underline}**, **[by
contrast]{.underline}**, "**[occurs when a state is dragged into a
military conflict by one]{.underline}**, or more, **[of its
alliances]{.underline}**" -- a definition very close to Snyder's
original -- with "alliances" themselves requiring states to be bound by
a formal treaty.15 Meanwhile, **[Lanoszka's]{.underline}** rigorous
**[examination of mechanisms]{.underline}** that might undergird
entrapment **[relies on a similar distinction]{.underline}**. As he
writes, "Entrapment is a type of entanglement" that "occurs because of
risky or offensive actions taken outside the parameters of the original
alliance treaty."16 And, just as Kim notes that entrapment is
"undesirable entanglement," Lanoszka argues that "entrapment by
definition cannot take place if the defender wishes to fight in order to
protect an ally that it sees as vital for the goods that it provides."17
In short, recent redefinitions relabel Snyder's original concept as
"entanglement," narrow entrapment to only include going to war for an
ally in overt contravention of one's interests, and narrow its
applicability to formal alliances.

In this paper, **[we adopt a revised form of Snyder's original
conception because of conceptual and empirical limits in the revised
definitions]{.underline}** advanced in recent studies. Before offering
our definition, it is first worthwhile noting the problems posed by the
revised definitions. On one level, **[defining entrapment solely as an
issue of formal alliances sidesteps]{.underline}** the reality **[that
many real world debates]{.underline}** **[concern worries of entrapment
via informal alliances]{.underline}**. Critics of **[American backing
for Ukraine]{.underline}**, for instance, **[worry]{.underline}** that
**[informal]{.underline}**-but-real American security
**[engagement]{.underline}** with Ukraine **[may end up pulling the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[into a
conflict]{.underline}** with Moscow for the sake of Kiev.18 Likewise,
**[as U.S.-Indian ties strengthen]{.underline}** as the U.S. seeks
partners to confront China, **[it is reasonable to question whether the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[will]{.underline}**
**[end up courting]{.underline}** an increased risk of
**[conflict]{.underline}** with China as Indian-Chinese relations
themselves deteriorate for issues separate from those the United States
has with the PRC.19

Not coincidentally, **[treating entrapment as only]{.underline}** an
issue of **[formal alliances]{.underline}** also **[highlights
questionable solutions]{.underline}** to the problem,
**[namely]{.underline}**, **[crafting loop-holes and escape clauses
into]{.underline}** alliance **[treaties]{.underline}**. In reality,
even formal treaties with notionally clear obligations among its members
are often the subject of significant intra-alliance haggling, and
debates surrounding the credibility of states willingness to follow
through on the terms of the agreements. After all, **[if alliance
provisions]{.underline}** (loopholes and all) **[were sacrosanct and a
panacea]{.underline}** for real political debates, **[there would be no
questions of the scope and credibility of alliances]{.underline}** at
any point in international politics.20 That this is not the case -- that
states in practice bargain hard with their partners over even formalized
alliance terms -- suggests that linking entrapment to formal alliances
creates erroneously adopts an essentially legal approach to thinking
through a fundamentally political and strategic problem, in addition to
narrowing the scope of analysis. 21

At the same time, **[narrowing the definition]{.underline}** of
entrapment solely **[to cover]{.underline}** **["undesirable" instances
of military escalation]{.underline}** for a partner virtually **[defines
away the problem entrapment seeks to explain]{.underline}**. **[To have
Beckley]{.underline}**, **[Kim]{.underline}**, **[and others tell
it]{.underline}**, **[entrapment can only occur if states knowingly
throw caution to the wind]{.underline}** **[and roll the iron dice for a
partner]{.underline}** for uncertain or avowedly irrelevant ends.
**[Setting entrapment at such a bar]{.underline}**, however, **[ignores
that Snyder's original formulation heavily focused on the risks states
run in the course of forming and adjusting alliances]{.underline}** over
time. Put differently, the new definition ignores the process by which
policy and strategy evolve over time and, in doing so, may cause
entrapment.

At a basic level, **[the decision to go to war is rarely a dichotomous
or discrete event]{.underline}**.22 **[Most]{.underline}** international
**[conflict is preceded by extensive]{.underline}** diplomatic
**[deliberations with both opponents and allies as states try to
obtain]{.underline}** their **[objectives through means short of war
while preparing for conflict]{.underline}** on the most advantageous
political and military terms possible.23 Even fast-moving crises involve
such diplomatic engagement and coordination: **[the run-up
and]{.underline}** immediate **[outbreak of World War
One]{.underline}**, for example, **[saw]{.underline}** extensive
**[negotiations across the Triple Entente]{.underline}** and the Triple
Alliance, diplomatic **[consultations within]{.underline}** the
**[alliances and domestic efforts]{.underline}** within various states
**[to prepare]{.underline}** the policymaking apparatus and public for
conflict. **[The net result is that dissenting voices]{.underline}** on
the necessity of a particular course of action (here, conflict) **[tend
to be minimized]{.underline}**; 24 by the same measure, **[policymaking
elites may come to hold particular and debatable
understandings]{.underline}** of the national interest **[\[d\]riven by
psychological]{.underline}**, **[domestic]{.underline}**, **[or
decision-making biases]{.underline}**.25 Hence, **[even an ally
that]{.underline}** -- in Snyder's terms **[-- shares
interests]{.underline}** "**[only partially]{.underline}**" with a
partner **[may end up concluding]{.underline}** that
**[conflict]{.underline}** on behalf of the ally **[is
viable]{.underline}**: the process of forming and managing the alliance
in a competitive international system can alter how states perceive
their interests. Not only does this make it problematic to treat
entrapment as undesired conflict, but it makes it difficult -- as
scholars such as Kim and Beckley attempt -- to assess the frequency of
entrapment by evaluating states' perceptions and decision-making
deliberations in the run up to war.

Finally, missing from all treatments of entrapment is recognition that
**[entrapment is not solely a problem of pre-war
deliberations]{.underline}** -- **[entrapment can be a wartime issue as
well]{.underline}**. After all, even if Allies A and B agree on the
necessity of confrontation and conflict against Adversary C, A and B may
hold different preferences over how, where, and when to engage in this
confrontation.26 This again reflects the reality that allies may share
interests "only partially": partners can disagree on what the form and
substance of a confrontation with a common adversary should entail. In
turn, as states try to keep an alliance together for the sake of
prosecuting a conflict while still pursuing the conflict in ways that
best serve their interests, states may end up entrapping (or being
entrapped by) their partners by pursuing policies and accepting risks
that they would not otherwise.

Recognizing these shortcomings, **[we adopt a modified version of
Snyder's original definition]{.underline}**. **[For our
purposes]{.underline}**, **[entrapment constitutes a process whereby
states seeking security progressively take on greater risks of being
dragooned into a partner's political or military endeavors by virtue of
having an alliance]{.underline}**, even if the state in question shares
few interests besides the continuation of the alliance itself in the
partner's moves and even if the alliance is never formalized. There are
several elements to this definition. First, and in keeping with Snyder's
original formula, **[entrapment can occur in stages]{.underline}**,
**[as states take on sequentially greater risks]{.underline}** on behalf
of partners in the hopes of creating security for themselves. This may
or may not be seen as "desirable" in the moment -- the key for this
concept is that states can be seen to accept real risks of confrontation
or conflict that they would not otherwise if not for the existence of
the alliance. Second, **[this conceptualization is agnostic as to the
degree of formality in the alliance]{.underline}** -- **[entrapment can
manifest in informal as well formal alliances]{.underline}**. Third,
entrapment is not limited to pre-war behaviors: entrapment during
wartime is also a logical possibility. Finally, **[entrapment is
fundamentally a byproduct of the politics of alliance
management]{.underline}**: states may take on progressively greater
risks on entrapment owing to the existence of the alliance and its
partners moves both therein and vis-à-vis an adversary.

coincide with the visit.]{.underline}**

However, in addition, Secretary Blinken took time to
both **[publicly call attention to the [specific details of a
longstanding
alliance](https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/asia/us-philippines-south-china-sea-intl-hnk/index.html) between
the US and Philippines and explain its meaning; "We also reaffirm that
an armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft
in the South China Sea would invoke US mutual defense commitments under
Article IV of the 1951 US-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty."]{.underline}**

When political leaders focus **[public attention on existing security
commitments in this manner, it is unlikely that they are only attempting
to send a signal to potential adversaries.]{.underline}** The
conventional wisdom is that, in direct **[state-to-state communication,
actions speak louder than words. For instance, as noted above, during
Blinken's trip the US sent a clear signal to China's leaders by
detaching a naval vessel to the region.]{.underline}**

We believe that **[public statements are better understood as political
acts designed to mobilize domestic opinion and communicate to potential
adversaries that there is sufficient popular support to follow through
on promises to defend a security partner.]{.underline}** Indeed**[,
mobilizing domestic political support within an alliance during a crisis
is critical to the success of deterrence threats, and emphasizing formal
security commitments is, in part, intended as a guardrail against
shifting domestic foreign policy preferences.]{.underline}**

So, does this communication strategy work? The answer is unclear.
Foreign policy research has traditionally focused on the degree to
**[which formal alliances shape the expectations of external
audiences---allies and adversaries---in the lead-up to conflict.
Interestingly, recent scholarship has demonstrated that international
law sometimes also works in the opposite direction; it can shape
domestic attitudes about conflict behavior.]{.underline}**

For example, **[there]{.underline}** **[is evidence that the public is
less likely to support military action when it violates explicit legal
commitments]{.underline}** to protect human rights. This result extends
to the broader obligation that governments should attempt to protect
civilians during conflict.  However, because the primary focus of
existing research is on human rights law that emphasizes moral
obligations to others, this scholarship might not extend to
self-interested national security concerns.

To answer this question directly, we conducted a novel survey experiment
on a **[representative sample in the United States]{.underline}**. **[We
presented respondents with a narrative describing a military crisis on
the Korean peninsula. Half of our respondents received a cue about the
American mutual defense treaty with South Korea. The other half of our
respondent pool did not receive this treatment. Subjects were then asked
(1) whether they would support the use of U.S. combat troops in defense
of South Korea, (2) how many U.S. military casualties they would be
willing to accept, and (3) how many North Korean civilian casualties
they would tolerate.]{.underline}**

In a second wave, respondents received a stronger and more detailed
experimental treatment that included information about the specific
content of the U.S.-South Korean defense agreement. In addition, our
**[experiment included several questions designed to evaluate the causal
mechanisms by which defense treaties might potentially influence public
support for military action.]{.underline}**

Our research produced several interesting findings. **[First,
emphasizing the defense treaty between Washington and Seoul increased
support for military action on behalf of South Korea. However, the
magnitude of this effect depends on the specificity of the information
provided. Merely noting the fact of a prior commitment only affects
attitudes of self-declared Independents.]{.underline}** Democrats and
Republicans, by contrast, were initially less responsive to our subtle
priming on the **[U.S-Korean defense agreement.]{.underline}** However,
**[once individuals receive more detailed information describing the
specific legal nature of the treaty]{.underline}** -- modeled on the
kind of statements by American officials noted above -- the gap between
Independents and partisans largely disappears.

Second, we find that the reason **[defense treaties increase support for
military action]{.underline}** is that they elicit a belief that the
United States is **[morally obligated to defend its ally and that
backing down damages America's international reputation]{.underline}**.
Third, **[formal alliances increase public "casualty tolerance."
Individuals in our treatment groups were both more tolerant of U.S.
military deaths and more willing to accept North Korean civilian
casualties than other respondents in the study.]{.underline}**
Interestingly, the subtle prime only influenced casualty tolerance among
strong conservatives. However, again, as subjects received information
about the specific legal nature of the U.S. obligation the gap between
strong conservatives and others largely disappeared.

So, is **[framing conflict decisions around prior security commitments
an effective way to shape public perceptions about conflict? The results
reported here suggest that it is.]{.underline}** Highlighting an
existing promise to defend allies increases public willingness and
resolve for military action. We find that this effect is not uniform
across individuals and that support for military action and casualty
tolerance increases as people receive more specificity about their
country's obligation.

These results demonstrate that **[security commitments, in addition to
shaping the expectations and incentives of external actors, also contour
the domestic political incentives for foreign policy
action.]{.underline}** This is, in part, why pollical leaders take such
great pains to detail the nature of their country's defense obligations
to domestic audiences, even as they are communicating directly with
allies and potential adversaries. Taken as a whole, these findings
reveal a nuanced set of relationships between security commitments and
individual-level attitudes about conflict and, as a result, generate new
insights into the conditions under which leaders can use existing
security agreements to mobilize the public.

### 2NC !---Yes Entrapment---Credibility Gaps

#### Entrapment true -- state credibility gap proves 

Elizabeth **Calos 12** --- (Elizabeth Calos; Published: 2012; \"The
Weakest Link: Credible Deterrence Threats and Alliance Entrapment\";

However, this paper argues that there is a codicil to this argument.
**[In order for a defensive alliance to act as an effective deterrent to
external aggression, the alliance must be able to pose a credible
threat]{.underline}**, which will **[prevent states outside of the
alliance from threatening its members]{.underline}**. Thus, **[defensive
alliances must present a strong enough deterrent threat to protect even
the weakest members of the alliance.]{.underline}** This means that the
**[weak or medium powered states within an alliance are particularly
invested in maintaining the strength of the deterrent signal sent by the
alliance]{.underline}**. The deterrent **[signal that is sent by the
alliance is the combination of each state\'s relative strength and
military capability, thus any loss of strength by one alliance member
decreases the efficacy of signal sent by the alliance as a
whole]{.underline}**. Since weaker states depend on this signal to
protect the state from potential adversaries, there is an inherent
obligation for lower powered states to ensure that the signal remains
strong. Conversely, **[great powers or strong states depend less on the
deterrent signal sent by the alliance and more on the military and
economic strength of the state itself. Thus, weaker states within a
defensive alliance would be drawn into conflicts where the other
alliance members are the aggressor because if the alliance member should
lose, the credibility of the alliance\'s deterrent threat would be
diminished.]{.underline}** Even though the mandate of the defensive
alliance does not cover entry into non-defensive conflicts, **[states
involved in defensive alliances could find themselves involved in
conflicts originated by weaker alliance members.]{.underline}** Figure 1
demonstrates the logic of this argument visually.

### 2NC !---Yes Entrapment---Timing Entrapment

#### Timing entrapment creates multiple scenarios for war -- Russia proves

**[Timing entrapment occurs when members of an alliance disagree over
the optimal moment at which to confront an opponent. Weaker
members]{.underline}** of an alliance, for example, may feel
**[proportionally more threatened]{.underline}** **[by an adversary at
an earlier date than proportionally stronger members of an alliance, and
so be more inclined to adopt hardline policies that increase the
likelihood of war]{.underline}** **[before the alliance's stronger
members reach that point.]{.underline}** 30 Likewise, unsettled
**[domestic politics may give some members of an alliance incentive to
go to war sooner than its allies prefer if a ruling coalition seeks to
resolve an external threat but fears being turned out of office before
its allies are prepared for joint action.]{.underline}**31 Under these
circumstances, **[even if Ally A might eventually be willing to
assertively confront or fight alongside Ally B against a common
opponent, B may initiate a confrontation at a time that State A finds
unattractive, yet A feel compelled to back B for fear of later having to
stand alone later (when it would prefer to fight).]{.underline}** Put
differently, Ally A left to its own devices might prefer to address an
external threat without resorting to behaviors that increase the risk of
conflict, feeling it has the capacity to wait or hoping that war can
avoided through deterrence or a negotiated settlement; nevertheless,
**[Ally B may behave in ways that makes war more likely in the
short-term for fear that time is no longer on its side.]{.underline}**
In theory, **[states seeking to entrap partners at times its partners
would rather avoid can do so in a number of ways]{.underline}**. Some
states, for instance, may **[spoil negotiations with an opponent
designed to settle outstanding disputes so that a diplomatic standoff
festers or escalates]{.underline}**.32 Alternatively, **[states may
engage in provocative behavior over disputed issues designed to trigger
an aggressive stance by an opponent that merits an allied
response]{.underline}**. And, in extremis, **[states can simply begin
hostilities despite allied opposition, thereby daring its partners not
to back it up]{.underline}**. In all these situations, **[Ally A is
faced with the choice of either being drawn into an escalating crisis or
war, or abandoning B.]{.underline}** When A chooses to support,
entrapment occurs. To not act, despite the ill-advised timing of B's
provocations, would potentially leave B weakened and vulnerable to a
defeat in the face of a seemingly pressing threat that, in the end, may
be far worse for State A. **[Russia's involvement in World War I on
behalf of Serbia presents an example of timing
entrapment]{.underline}**. Few would deny that Russia believed it had a
strategic interest in defending Serbia and bolstering the pan-Slav
identity. As Jack Levy and William Mulligan argue, however, the timing
of this support poses a puzzle. **[If Russia was perceived by Germany as
a rising power and a potential threat, then it would have been sensible
for Russia to lay low and avoid provoking Germany into a wider
war]{.underline}**. Yet in the **[dangerous summer of 1914, St.
Petersburg stood by its Serbian allies even as they issued an ultimatum
to Austria-Hungary that made war considerably more
likely.]{.underline}** As Levy and Mulligan note, "1914 was not Russia's
favored year for war." But the Russians were also fearful of the
diplomatic consequences of an unfavorable outcome to the Austro-Serbian
crisis." And, "**[Although Habsburg control of Serbia did not present an
immediate threat to Russian territorial integrity, a more prominent
consideration was Russian credibility.]{.underline}** In the context of
Balkan politics, **[Russian inaction in the face of Austro-Hungarian
aggression could have had severe consequences]{.underline}**."33 To
reiterate, our contention is not that Russia supported Serbia despite
strategic interests wholly to the contrary. Rather, our claim is that
**[entrapment occured in a more subtle yet very consequential manner:
rather than waiting for a more opportune moment for war, Russia was
pulled in on behalf of its ally, Serbia, at a time more of Serbia, than
Russia's, choosing.34]{.underline}**

### 2NC !---Yes Entrapment---Goal Entrapment

#### Goal entrapment undermines alliance unity

David **Edelstein 18** --- (David Edelstein; Vice Dean of Faculty in

Published: December 2018; \"Entrapment Revisited: Strategic and

A third type of entrapment is goal entrapment. Here, **[Ally A may be
willing to initiate a confrontation or fight alongside Ally B, but the
two states diverge in their preferences for the goals of the contest
and/or terms for settling the dispute]{.underline}**. In theory, this
can occur through two different pathways. First, if **[Ally A has more
modest goals than Ally B, A may become entrapped in the more ambitious
goals of its ally once confrontation begins simply by B's refusal to end
a standoff or conflict when A desires]{.underline}**. Again, **[A's only
alternative is to abandon its ally, a risky proposition with a
confrontation looming or war at hand.]{.underline}** Second, and closely
related, **[one ally may entrap another by expanding the scope of a
confrontation. Here, Ally B might seek broader gains or more ambitious
terms than A, and so layer on new demands or carry a contest into new
venues.]{.underline}** This move **[risks entrapping Ally A, as failure
to back B may result in B's defeat]{.underline}**, the **[loss of
crucial resources, and opening up inter-allied political fissures that
may dissolve the alliance]{.underline}**. As an example of goal
entrapment, consider the sequence of decisions that led to the allied
Operation Torch landings in northern Africa in 1942. In May 1942,
President **[Franklin D. Roosevelt promised Josef Stalin that the allies
would shortly alleviate the pressure that the Germans were putting on
the Soviet Union]{.underline}**. Great Britain, however, resisted a
cross-channel attack, seeing in an assault against the main body of
German strength in Western Europe -- which would have to be led largely
by British forces as the U.S. forces were still mobilizing -- an
exercise that risked exhausting British strength. **[British leaders
instead preferred an assault on North Africa, a move that would be less
costly, divert]{.underline}** (at least in theory) German resources away
from the Soviet Union, and relieve continued Axis threats to British
colonial holdings in the Mediterranean/Middle East. **[The resulting
Anglo-American dispute over military strategy continued throughout the
summer of 1942 and, as Mark Stoler showcases, significantly undermined
Allied unity]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[American leaders faced with
sustained and immutable British opposition to a 1942 attack on France
acceded to British demands.]{.underline}** Though many American leaders
suspected that Britain's efforts were motivated less by military factors
and more by a political effort to bring American resources to bear to
protect British influence in the Mediterranean, no cross-channel assault
was to come until 1944.35 What is striking about the decisions leading
up to Operation Torch is how the driving considerations were
simultaneously the pledge of assistance made to Stalin, and Britain's
successful efforts to channel these pledges into a campaign that widened
the European war to include North Africa. Once again, **[entrapment does
not have to entail fighting a war against one's own interests - it can
mean pursuing certain objectives for little reason other than to
accommodate a partner]{.underline}**. Vincent O'Hara offers a damning
critique of Operation Torch, "\"Torch was a rushed, **[half-baked
experiment in the art of war, full of untested ideas and amateur
touches]{.underline}**. The politicians mandated if for political
reasons over the objections of most of their military chiefs.\" O'Hara's
political reasons were precisely Roosevelt's determination to meet the
obligation he felt he had to intervene in a way that would distract
Germany from its assault on the Soviet Union.36 The **[entrapment in
this case was in terms of the goal of the war, not the general decision
to fight in the first place.37]{.underline}**

Finally, **[means entrapment describes a situation in which Ally A is
maneuvered by Ally B into committing more resources to confrontation
than it otherwise desired]{.underline}**. This is distinct from goal
entrapment: **[even if A and B agree on their strategic objectives, B
may still end up dragging A into a costlier commitment than intended by
underproviding the capabilities required and pushing A to make up the
difference]{.underline}**. This situation can either be intentional --
where B withholds available resources from a contest in order to deploy
them elsewhere and/or shift the burden onto its partners -- or
unintentional -- where B underestimates the capabilities required to
achieve a specified end and, lacking the requisite resources, turns to
A. In either case, **[A is compelled to intervene for fear of harming
the alliance's credibility]{.underline}**, prestige, and future
functions. Metaphorically, and occasionally literally, **[B calls for
A's cavalry to ride over the hill to its assistance. Although poorly
catalogued, means entrapment may be the most common form of
entrapment]{.underline}**. States, after all, regularly promise one
another the military tools required for joint military action, only to
change course and leave their partners high and dry. During the opening
days of World War One, for example, **[Austria-Hungary reneged on
agreements to deploy most of its forces against Russia while Germany
attacked France, exposing Germany to Russian assault and requiring
Germany to alter its own war plans]{.underline}**.38 Similarly,
**[Soviet and Chinese officials only agreed to back North Korea in the
Korean War when assured by North Korea that the contest would be quickly
won and limited in scope]{.underline}**; when this **[assumption proved
overly optimistic]{.underline}** following the American-backed
intervention in June 1950, the **[USSR and China were forced to commit
their own forces rather than see their client collapse]{.underline}**.39
As we discuss below, the 2011 allied intervention in **[Libya also
demonstrates means entrapment as the United States found itself
committing substantial resources in support of the intervention despite
an initial instinct to limit its involvement.]{.underline}**

### 2NC !---Scenario---Norway/Russia---1NC

#### Norway will [escalate-to-deescalate]{.underline} -- increasing US cooperation inculcates [the cult of offensive]{.underline}.

**Heier, 18**---professor, Norwegian Defence University College (Tormod,
"Avoiding War: How Should Northern Europe Respond to the US-Russian
Rivalry?," Arctic Review on Law and Politics Vol. 9, 2018, pp. 267--286,
dml)

Norwegian willing compliance with allied injunctions has contributed to
making Norway a "small middle power" in Europe.44 This is because
**[NATO guidance has helped Norway stir a military
transformation]{.underline}** that has channelled scarce resources from
a large mobilisation force into a more agile professional force. Despite
a lack of sustainability however, **[prospects for]{.underline}** more
permanent **[US reinforcements]{.underline}** -- seen since 2014 -- have
to some extent eased Norwegian apprehensions. This is particularly so as
Russian "snap exercises" and cyberattacks towards critical
infrastructure have increased over the past few years.45 Burden sharing
in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, as well as intensified intelligence
gathering towards Russia's Northern Fleet **[have]{.underline}**
nevertheless **[cemented transatlantic ties]{.underline}**. This logic
has long roots in Norwegian strategic thinking. According to Defence
Minister (1986--1989) Johan Jørgen Holst, **[a potential crisis with
Russia should not end up as a war with Norway, but rather as a war about
Norway]{.underline}**.46 **[Burden sharing]{.underline}** abroad
**[would make it easier to get US attention and support if a Norwegian
tripwire needed to be triggered in the High North]{.underline}**. This
burden sharing takes place in part through military channels in the
Norwegian Intelligence Service, as well as in various parts of the Navy,
Air Force and Special Forces commands, which on a daily basis operate
closely with US forces in the United States, Norway, Belgium, Germany,
Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates. It also occurs through
Norway's extensive diplomatic networks embodied in the Ministry of
Defence and Foreign Affairs, which on a daily basis cultivates US ties
in Washington D.C., Brussels and London.47 Norway's fears of abandonment
by NATO have been allayed, in accordance with Snyder's theoretical
assumptions.

In addition, these networks can be interpreted as a sort of deterrence
towards Russia. **[A more visible US presence in Norwegian airspace and
territorial waters]{.underline}**, as well as in the northern counties
of Finnmark, Troms and Trøndelag underscores a more credible US
deterrent component in Northern Europe. Combined **[with]{.underline}**
updated **[reinforcement and readiness plans, as well as more allied
exercises]{.underline}**, this enhanced NATO presence **[sends the
signal to Russia that Norwegian and US security are inseparable, at
least in theory]{.underline}**. The credibility of this claim is further
seen through a softening of previously self-imposed restraints, such as
restrictions on allied bases and exercises closer to Russia's second
strike capability on the Kola Peninsula. Other examples are found in the
US Marine Corps' presence on a rotational basis in Mid-Norway,48 high
intensity combat exercises in Finnmark county with extensive US
participation,49 new infrastructure for US Air Forces in southeast
Norway, and new facilities for the US ground forces in Troms county.50
These developments are consistent with Walt's expectation of a small
state's balancing behaviour towards an assertive neighbour.

Coupled with more **[security arrangements between Sweden, Finland, the
US and NATO]{.underline}**, Norway's renewed "policy of invitation"
**[has tied US commitments more explicitly to the Nordic states'
national security concerns]{.underline}**. Vulnerable states on Russia's
border are assured, while the United States gets a firmer grip on the
geopolitical challenge of providing Baltic NATO allies with credible
reinforcements while preventing Russian submarines and aircraft access
to the North Atlantic. Lifting the Cold War's self-imposed restraints
can be interpreted as a way of compensating for the abnegation of a
sustainable territorial force, which during the 1980s enabled Norway to
solve national episodes, incidents and crises alone -- and even sustain
national operations for more than four weeks.51 The contemporary absence
of trimmed and well-functioning command structure in NATO increases the
validity of this perspective.52

5.1 The Disadvantage of Allied Compliance

**[Relinquishing an adequate defence in the lower end of the conflict
spectrum has long-term implications. The most serious but often
neglected side effect is that Norwegian forces have become more inclined
to pursue a more robust combat posture closer to Russia's border. This
means that deterrence is favoured before restraint; the "stick" becomes
more important than the "carrot". Minor bilateral events, episodes and
crises are more likely to escalate than de-escalate]{.underline}**, at
least up to the point where Russian forces consider withdrawing out of
fear of possible US involvement. How can this slide towards a more
robust combat posture be explained?

Propensities to go on the offensive are closely linked to inadequate
sustainability, which is a key characteristic for smaller allies that
have undergone a cost-intensive transformation in NATO. **[Lack of
volume and sustainability]{.underline}** therefore **[makes it more
rational to communicate resolve and combat agility]{.underline}**. This
is because **[a decisive outcome becomes critically important on short
notice]{.underline}** -- preferably within a few days. The alternative,
which would be a prolonged and indecisive situation, would instantly
stir operative deterioration and a subsequent collapse before a clear
political outcome has been reached. This is because troops that are put
on a '24--7' alert status face grave problems in sustaining agility
without the constant support of sufficient logistics, maintenance and
extra troops.

**[Ambiguous incidents, episodes or crises that are neither proper war
nor proper peace]{.underline}**, but something in between,
**[may]{.underline}** thereby **[reduce prospects for rapid assistance,
and may ultimately lead to a diplomatic fait accompli where Norway ends
up in a bilateral crisis with Russia before a US tripwire has been
activated]{.underline}**. This would complicate **[the
Norwegian]{.underline}** Armed Forces' **[strategy]{.underline}**, which
-- in the wording of former Chief of Defence (2005--2009) General Sverre
Diesen -- **[is as follows: faced with]{.underline}** "... **[a limited
military provocation, Norwegian forces must]{.underline}** \[...\]
**[create a conflict which is so intense that our allies]{.underline}**,
due to reasons of national and collective credibility, **[are forced to
get involved]{.underline}**".53

By default, then, **[Norwegian forces might be forced to pursue an
aggressive "deterrence by punishment"]{.underline}** 54 **[strategy in
situations where disputes could be solved diplomatically with more
patience, and a more cautious modus operandi]{.underline}**. Maintaining
a more agile force closer to Russia's border counteracts a defensive
posture, which during the Cold War was accomplished by a strategy
labelled "deterrence by denial" in Troms county, approximately 1000
kilometres from the Russian border.55

Norway's slide towards a more agile posture is underscored by empirical
evidence from the Norwegian Defence Concept. Since 2012, the threshold
defence concept has emphasised deterrence rather than assurance towards
Russia.56 **[By rapidly raising the costs of aggression, scaring Russia
from assertive action has become more important than pursuing
self-restraints as a means of building confidence]{.underline}**. Moving
more forces closer to the Northern Fleet thereby challenges Norway's
previous self-imposed restraints codified in limitations on US exercises
in Finnmark, or US bases in Trøndelag and Troms in peacetime.57
**[During the Cold War, keeping military forces further away from the
border provided both Russia and Norway with longer strategic warning
time]{.underline}**.58 **[As these restraints have been removed,
Norway's strategy towards Russia has also evolved]{.underline}**. From
following a logic of absolute security for both states during the Cold
War, which according to Johan Jørgen Holst was called "a silent
cooperation",59 **[the contemporary strategy seems to emphasise relative
security for Norway at the expense of Russia]{.underline}**. More
emphasis on this kind of 'zero-sum' logic is also found in the political
rhetoric of the Stoltenberg-II (2009--2013) and the Solberg Governments
(2013--).60 Empirical evidence is also found in the conceptual idea of
Threshold defence, 61 as well as in the pattern of contemporary joint
exercises. According to Norwegian senior staff officers, **[NATO
exercises]{.underline}**, such as Cold Response, **[are]{.underline}**
more **[focused on rehearsing high intensity warfare after "deterrence
failed", than on mechanisms for de-escalation, mediation, and
civil-military cooperation]{.underline}**, which characterised most of
the joint exercises between 2002 and 2010.62

6\. Conclusion

Based on the Norwegian case, how should Northern Europe respond to the
Russian assertiveness? Is closer integration into Western security
arrangements a viable approach, e.g. for smaller non-aligned states like
Sweden and Finland? Three conclusions can be deduced.

First, **[as Northern Europe increasingly aligns with the US
and]{.underline}** other **[NATO]{.underline}** forces, **[states like
Sweden and Finland may more easily gain access to US decision
makers]{.underline}**. From this vantage point, national concerns can be
voiced more clearly in tough competition with numerous other European
allies striving for US attention and reinforcements. **[Such access
increases]{.underline}** US awareness, and thus **[prospects for
successful activation of US security guaranties if
needed]{.underline}**. This logic is anchored in the traditional tenets
of alliance theory, where balancing is more commonly pursued by smaller
states than bandwagoning.63

But **[such a strategy may also increase the risk of more tension,
instability and unpredictability]{.underline}**. This is arguably so
because **[Russia's strategic forces will need an extended zone of
security to protect their forces from US or other NATO allies' precision
guided missiles. As an extended part of Northern Europe opens up for US
and NATO operations on their own territories, this reassuring effect
could be nullified by Russian counter efforts aiming to protect its
force. Balancing with the stronger part thereby creates a typical
security dilemma because Russia]{.underline}**, according to Snyder,
**[will respond with more assertiveness]{.underline}**.64 In particular,
**[Sweden and Finland's slide from "buffer" to "springboard" may
increase the risk of geopolitical change]{.underline}** in Northern
Europe. This is because both states' territories play a more prominent
role in US and Russian defence planning.

It can be argued that **[this is not likely to provide]{.underline}**
the population with **[more security because]{.underline}** their
national **[territories will be more exposed to unwanted Russian
attention necessary for military planning and readiness]{.underline}**.
A question for further research could be to examine to what extent
accelerated Nordic-Baltic defence cooperation could alleviate a
situation where smaller states more vigorously can address a military
vacuum currently filled by US and Russian forces.

Second, **[the slide from "buffer" to "springboard" also means that
domestic policy in Sweden and Finland will be more exposed to US
expectations and demands]{.underline}**. Based on the Norwegian
experience, **[this is particularly so with regard to US expectations of
reciprocity abroad]{.underline}**. As in the case of Norway and Denmark,
more troops from Northern Europe will be expected to participate in
open-ended engagements in Central Asia, the Middle East and possibly
Africa. This logic is consistent with another alliance dilemma raised by
Snyder, which is that **[clients may easily become entrapped into a
patron's war elsewhere because clients are afraid of being abandoned at
home]{.underline}**.65

Deployments abroad may on the one hand energise combat experience and
critical competence among forces that will also operate at home. But
they may also increase the risk of fragmentation and critical
shortcomings within a national force structure that needs to be
cohesively trained at home. **[Vulnerabilities deriving from this
over-stretch problématique may accelerate US dependency because
simultaneous engagements abroad and at home are detrimental to small
states' military readiness and cohesiveness in the lower end of the
conflict spectre. This]{.underline}** trend, it may be argued, **[may
hamper]{.underline}** efforts undertaken by small states, such as Sweden
and Finland, to exert influence on how the strategic balance between
deterrence and **[restraint]{.underline}** can be tailored **[vis-a-vis
Russia]{.underline}**.

A question for further research however, would be falsify this
assumption, and explore alternative ways to cope with small states'
endemic over-stretch problématique. Could it be that "pooling and
sharing" among small states would provide more security than outsourcing
defence responsibilities to US forces even at the lower end of the
conflict spectrum?

Third, **[increased US dependency may increase the risk of energising a
"cult of the offensive" among smaller states in Northern
Europe]{.underline}**. While **[dependency]{.underline}** may favour
integration and interoperability among like-minded states in the West,
it **[may]{.underline}** also **[lead to a deterioration in diplomatic
relations with Russia]{.underline}**. This is because **[national
vulnerabilities make smaller states more inclined to escalate rather
than de-escalate tense situations; seeking to avoid a fait accompli with
Russia, a decisive outcome on short notice will be required in order to
trigger a US tripwire]{.underline}**.

**[Such a strategy]{.underline}** may -- in a narrow sense -- provide
more security for Northern Europe because Russia will gain less security
in relative terms. But in absolute terms, it **[will]{.underline}**
also, in accordance with the logic put forth by both Schelling and
Holst, **[create less security for Northern Europe and
Russia]{.underline}**. This is because **[US forces will be increasingly
important at a much earlier stage in a potentially tense situation,
which forces Russia to take precautionary efforts]{.underline}**.66 It
is important to note that **[Russia does not fear the smaller states in
Northern Europe. Russia only fears that the region will become a
'stepping stone' for US operations]{.underline}** towards Russia. A
question for further research could therefore be to what extent
self-imposed restraints put forth by smaller North European states are
possible without displaying weakness and thus invoking more Russian
assertiveness. Could stronger mutual dependency between Russia and
Northern Europe, e.g. on energy and trade, alleviate some of the
military tension currently fuelling the regional security situation?

While this **[greater emphasis on Russia as human rights violator is
voiced mostly by the Norwegian MFA and the Prime Minister, also MoD
representations construct Russia as an opposite to Norway/the West/NATO
in terms of values.]{.underline}** Further, MoD texts now represent
Russia as a security-oriented big power in the North. **[Modernization
of the Russian military is no longer associated with "normalization" as
in 2012, but with Russia's rising big-power ambitions.]{.underline}**
Norway is held to need new military capabilities in the North to defend
its sovereignty and protect its interests. **[Presenting a strong NATO
as prerequisite for Norwegian security, the new government also seeks to
strengthen transatlantic bonds and reinforce collaboration with
NATO.]{.underline}** These entities are represented as trustworthy,
orderly, and reliable, whereas Russia's status is tilting toward
threatening. According to MoD texts, greater collaboration is needed
within the transatlantic community, not necessarily with Russia. The
NATO--Russia Council is seen as the best multilateral forum for relating
to Russia. **[We also note the expressed ambition of giving Norway a
more central role in NATO and of taking the NATO footprint North,
through more allied training and exercises as well as military
capabilities.]{.underline}** In sum, and building on the changes in
Norwegian Self/Other representations, **[we find a clear re-orientation
toward a realist mode of policy]{.underline}** already before the
annexation of Crimea---in MoD understandings of the High North as
primarily a security space, as well as in policies aimed at making
national security a priority in the North.

4.2. A tectonic shift, 2014--2016

These **[new representations of "Russia," "Norway," and relations in the
High North become amplified following the crises in Ukraine, which
official Norwegian discourse describes as a tectonic shift in
international relations]{.underline}**, heading nearly every official
account of international developments in 2014, 2015 and 2016.
**[According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Børge Brende, Russia had
"moved into a fundamentally new phase in relation to the outside world,"
pursuing "power-politics belonging to a different age" and "acting in a
way nobody had done since the Second World War."]{.underline}** In
sum**[, the Russian Other becomes a rule-breaker, a thief, even a liar,
an actor that disregards established institutions and cannot be
trusted.]{.underline}** "The High North," and even "the Arctic," are
reframed in Norwegian government discourse with reference to Russia's
actions in Ukraine (later also to its actions in Georgia in 2008 and in
Syria from 2015). **[The discursive positioning of the High North into
the new orbit of potential conflict with Russia grows stronger and
stronger]{.underline}**, at least in MoD texts. In late 2016, **[the
Minister of Defense states, with clear reference to Russia, "we cannot
preclude that military force will not be used against
Norway]{.underline}**... It is no longer so that war is declared through
diplomatic messengers."

The Arctic is still seen as a space governed by collaboration and
international law, but Russia is, with reference to its actions in
Ukraine, projected as a potential rule-breaker. Hence, Norway as a
principled actor must hold Russia accountable. The government continues
to speak of preserving cooperation, but the North now figures
increasingly as a military strategic space. **[Security becomes a key
priority for Norwegian foreign policy, with special reference to the
North: With the new challenge from the eastern neighbor, the Norwegian
Self figures as a small power in need of protection.]{.underline}**
Good-neighborly relations in the North are now construed as the result
of Norway being firm, predictable, principled, and adhering to
international law. By upping the civilian and military presence in the
North and anchoring Norwegian security more firmly in NATO, Norway can
contribute to "stability" and "predictability" in the North. **[It is
even indicated that increasing such transatlantic presence and making
Norway into "NATO in the North" may be required to keep tension levels
low and preserve the Arctic as a "peaceful region."]{.underline}**

**[As in all securitization processes, calls for unity and protection
follow such re-phrasing of the Other from partner to threat. The
Norwegian government's discourse now projects the need to strengthen
NATO collaboration and cooperation with the USA (implicitly or
explicitly given as the guarantor of Norwegian security)]{.underline}**
and Europe. These three entities are represented as being trustworthy
and having "good values." Noteworthy is how **["the West," "NATO," "the
USA,"]{.underline}** "Europe," "the EU," "the Nordic countries," and
"Norway" as "friends," "allies" or "likeminded" **[get merged into one
positive social unit/Self---juxtaposed to a Russian Other with no
positive distinctions.]{.underline}** The strength of the transatlantic
vector in Norwegian foreign policy is now explicitly given as the
precondition for good relations with Russia in the North---it is no
longer an issue of what Russia and Norway can do together.

Could the crises in Russian--Western relations be limited to the
specific situation in Ukraine? Judging from the texts reviewed here, the
Norwegian government's answer was no. **[Relations had changed
irrevocably: not even a solution to the Ukraine crises could alter the
new security situation in Europe. The reason was Russia's use of force
against another European country, but also its poor democratic and human
rights credentials.]{.underline}** In breaking international law, Russia
was undermining the international order and its entire underlying set of
values. Russia is now represented as a power inclined to use military
means instead of diplomacy, incapable of respecting other states'
political goals. **["We" had been naïve, failing to understand Russia's
true intentions and ambitions. Russia had not become like "us" in terms
of values. It was "assertive" and "aggressive," and its military was now
highly capable of "rapid," "precise" operations that also Norway had to
be prepared for.]{.underline}** The modernization of Russia's Northern
Fleet is explicitly included in this narrative. The phrase Russia "has
both the capacity and will to use military power for political gain"
recurs, and by 2016 also the idea of Russia acquiring a "strategic
advantage" in the North. **[Norway is no longer capable of "area
denial." Although Russia is never directly named as a "threat" to Norway
in official discourse, taken together, the various representations
constitute Russia as a threat in the North.]{.underline}** The proper
response is no longer "strategic partnership" and "constructive
engagement" but "firmness" and "deterrence"---and "reassurance" not of
Russia, but of the Baltic states and Poland. "We" must realize that the
deterioration in Russian--Western relations might spill over into the
North. Standing by our allies and speaking out on negative developments
in Russia becomes essential.

Both MoD and MFA texts put the blame for deteriorating relations firmly
and solely on the Russian side. Russia must "change its ways" first,
before any improvement can take place. Here the MoD texts represent
Russia as a threat to military security, and MFA texts more as a threat
to international law---Norway's "first-line defense." The "liberal
interventionist" position, which accords fundamental importance to the
political system of a foreign state in defining how to relate to that
state and the kind of policies to be pursued toward it, also becomes
stronger in MFA discourse in this period.

This new interpretation of Russia and relations with Russia in the North
indicates that Norwegian polices on Russia have changed substantially
since 2014, making it reasonable to label the mode of Norwegian policies
on Russia as primarily realist. Norway immediately and unconditionally
joined the EU sanctions regime on Russia in 2014. **[The policy
initiatives taken in recent years, made acceptable by the changes in
official representations of the Russian Other, have largely abandoned
the Cold War practice of "balancing" between deterrence and reassurance:
since 2017, 330 US Marines have been stationed at Værnes/Trondheim in
mid-Norway, initially on a rotational basis but now apparently de facto
permanently.]{.underline}** The Norwegian MoD has also been lobbying for
the establishment of a new maritime command in the North and has
proposed a Norwegian contribution to the European missile shield, with
reference to the "Russian threat." This has been **[accompanied by a
significant decline in diplomatic contacts.]{.underline}** Between 2014
and mid-2016 not one Norwegian minister visited Russia. In June 2016,
the Minister of Fisheries went to St Petersburg. Not until March 2017
did the Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs travel to Russia, to
attend the conference "Arctic---Territory of Dialogue" in Arkhangelsk.
**[Norwegian ministers would go to Kiev, London or various NATO capitals
instead, to discuss greater collaboration, often in the
military-strategic sphere and in the High North.]{.underline}**

Russian officials elaborate on relations with Norway especially in the
context of ministerial visits, but also in commenting on specific events
and answering questions from the press. **[In this explicit, official
Russian discourse on Norway, we find]{.underline}** several distinct
representations of Norway, fairly stable, but with **[a shift in
emphasis since 2014: Norway is increasingly seen as the prolonged arm of
NATO and the USA---a significant point, given the representation of NATO
as a threat.]{.underline}**

Initially, Norway appears mainly as a good neighbor, in bilateral
relations and through multilateral institutions like the Arctic Council,
the Northern Dimension, and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council. Norway is
often mentioned in the energy context, with Statoil as a promising
corporate partner for Russian companies and an example of a successful
state corporation. Norway gets recognition for its contribution to
cooperative efforts aimed at removing chemical weapons from Syria. In
particular, the 2010 maritime delimitation agreement between Russia and
Norway is hailed as a key achievement under the Medvedev presidency, and
is later defended against internal Russian accusations that the treaty
was a "gift" from Russia to Norway---the treaty is presented as "just
and in accordance with international law," and "advantageous to both
states."

Prior to Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Brende's visit to Moscow
in January 2014, his Russian counterpart Lavrov had a clear and positive
message:

The relations between Russia and Norway are developing dynamically and
with good results within all the important directions. The dialogue at
the level of the states' leadership is deepening: last year there were
two meetings between the prime ministers---April 5 in St Petersburg and
June 4 in Kirkenes. The perspectives for organizing new contacts are
being discussed.

During the visit itself, Lavrov dismissed insinuations from the press
that rising Russian--Western tensions had negative impacts on
Russian--Norwegian relations. However, he would soon start answering
such questions differently.

**[Representations of Norway as a "good neighbor" are increasingly
complemented by representations of Norway as a country that consciously
chooses to be a less good neighbor. Catering to its Western partners,
Norway is seen as acting against both Russia's and Norway's own
interests.]{.underline}**

In October 2014, Lavrov visited the border town of Kirkenes on the
occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet liberation of Northern
Norway in World War II. Amid praise of the veterans, Norway's honoring
of the wartime history, and the shared "joint combat brotherhood" that
"substantially strengthened the fundament for good-neighborliness and
friendly relations," **[Lavrov also commented on the current state of
affairs in bilateral relations:]{.underline}**

**[Today these relations are of course experiencing a certain tension in
connection with Norway's joining of the unilateral restrictive measures
against Russia for reasons, as we understand it, lie outside of the
country. (...) We hope that common sense and each country's national
interests---and not external pressure---in the end will
prevail.]{.underline}**

**[Lavrov notes how Russia's and Norway's joint interests are threatened
by "various directions of the bilateral cooperation being subject to
artificial restrictions, based on Euro-Atlantic solidarity and with
reference to the Ukrainian crisis."]{.underline}** Here **[Norway is
presented as part of a Euro-Atlantic social entity seen as hostile
toward Russia.]{.underline}**

This identification has also framed events on Svalbard. In
Russian--Norwegian relations, disagreements on the Norwegian management
of Svalbard have a long history. In the period under study, one episode
is particularly instructive---one that also taps into the discontent
expressed by Lavrov.

On April 18, 2015, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitrii Rogozin paid a
brief visit to Svalbard as his plane made a layover before he headed
further north into the Arctic. **[In 2014 Rogozin had been added to the
EU/Norwegian sanctions list and banned from entering Norway. The
Norwegian authorities reacted negatively to what they saw as a Russian
provocation and breach of Norwegian sovereignty. In turn, their Russian
counterparts accused Norway of not respecting the Svalbard Treaty of
1920, which allows access to Svalbard for all citizens of the signatory
states, and regretted this "unfriendly step" from the Norwegian
side.]{.underline}** The Russian MFA saw this not as an isolated
incident, and expressed doubt over Norwegian willingness to continue
"the spirit of partnership in the Arctic that Norway until now always
has shown." In the same statement, it acknowledged problems in the
bilateral relationship: "We regret Norway's initiative to join the EU's
anti-Russian sanctions, which will have negative consequences for
Russian--Norwegian relations and, we believe, leads to our Norwegian
neighbors having a distorted perception of reality." Again, Norway's
acting in concert with its Western partners is presented as harming
good-neighborly relations.

**[One distinct and important representation of Norway could be seen as
the logical extreme of Russian concerns about Norway's Russia policy
being dictated by its allies. This representation places Norway as part
of the US military system, and that system as an offensive force
directed against Russia.]{.underline}** Addressing the Seliger Youth
Camp in August 2014, Putin stated:

The Arctic plays a very important role for us when it comes to
safeguarding our security, because---unfortunately---it is the case that
US attack submarines are concentrated there, not far from the Norwegian
coast, and I remind you that the missiles they carry would reach Moscow
within 15--16 minutes.

**[It is in this narrative that Norway's decision to invite 330 US
Marines to be based near Trondheim on a "rotational" basis is
placed.]{.underline}** As explained by the Russian MFA spokesperson
Mariya Zakharova:

Obviously, we have taken note of this fact. We believe that it
contradicts the Norwegian policy of not allowing foreign military bases
in the country in peacetime. (...) **[This decision by the Norwegian
government appears to be yet another link in a chain of US-led military
preparations that have markedly intensified lately against the backdrop
of the anti-Russian hysteria.]{.underline}** This step **[clearly does
not contribute to maintaining stability and security in the North of
Europe.]{.underline}**

Also in other fields of the bilateral relationship, **[Norway is
represented as essentially obeying orders from Washington, as when the
Russian MFA criticized Norway for extraditing a Russian citizen to the
USA at the request of the US Secret Services, arguably at the expense of
respect for international law---a "politicized" approach that Russia
would "take into account in the further development of relations with
Norway."]{.underline}**

**[Russian representations of Norway change during the period under
study, effectively merging Norway into NATO/the USA, a social entity
long construed as the threatening Other.]{.underline}** Representations
of Russia that appear through the texts also evolve, although more in
degree than as a qualitative change: the **[representations of Russia as
a responsible international actor promoting predictable relations
between equal partners stand out even more clearly as Norway is
increasingly presented as working against these ideals to the benefit of
NATO.]{.underline}**

**[In line with the changing Russian representations]{.underline}** of
the Arctic and the key actors in this region, **[we observe changes in
Russian military policies.]{.underline}** Examples include the
**[establishment of the Joint Strategic Command North in 2014 and the
creation in early 2015 of the 80th Arctic Brigade, both ahead of
schedule]{.underline}**. We also note the **[increase in Russian snap
military drills in the Arctic and in naval and air patrols near
Norwegian territory, as well as enhanced submarine training in Arctic
waters. All these changes are presented as responses to NATO activity in
the North.]{.underline}** Overall, it is reasonable to label the mode of
Russian policies in the Arctic as increasingly realist.

In sum, then, **[Russia's developing mode in relation to
Norway]{.underline}** in the Arctic 2012--2016 **[shows an unmistakable
drift---from an institutionalist mode based on the perception that both
states benefit from pursuing their own interests in a predictable
manner, to a more realist mode.]{.underline}** Seen from Moscow, this
drift is due to policy changes on the Norwegian side---in particular,
Norway's acting in concert with its Western partners. As a result,
**[security concerns may seem to crowd out other aspirations in relation
to Norway.]{.underline}**

Affairs (MFA), the Prime Minister\'s Office, and the Ministry of Defense
(MoD). The Russian data are transcripts and statements from the Russian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and transcripts from the public appearances

"scraped"---downloaded in full---from www.regjeringen.no, www.mid.ru,
and www.kremlin.ru. Using the open source "corporaexplorer" software
(Gjerde 2019), we then extracted a clearly defined subset of this large
document collection: The **[final text collection contains documents
that include references to both Russia and the Arctic on the Norwegian
side, and documents that include references to Norway or the Arctic on
the Russian side]{.underline}**---the difference being due to the far
higher number of documents on the Norwegian side. In certain parts of
the analysis, the official texts retrieved through web-scraping have
been supplemented by media articles referring to comments from Russian
and Norwegian officials. **[The aim has been to sample more statements
at particularly critical events in order to study action--reaction
patterns.]{.underline}**

**[The texts have been studied by using discourse
analysis]{.underline}** in the tradition of Laclau and Mouffe (1985),
**[with emphasis on the contested nature of
meaning-making.]{.underline}** This has implied **[systematically
mapping the changing pattern of self and other representations in
official texts. The method has been designed to foreground the
constitutive power of language and capture securitization as a process
by studying a plethora of official utterances over time]{.underline}**
(Wilhelmsen 2014, 58--64; Stengel 2019). I focus not only on how
**[certain verbs, adverbs, and adjectives attached to nouns might help
to constitute the other as increasingly different and dangerous to the
self]{.underline}** (Milliken 1999, 232--33), but also on how
**[linguistic repetitions, mergers, and comparisons might contribute to
such a process.]{.underline}** The article also lists **[concrete policy
practices that have been implemented in line with Norway\'s changing
representations of Russia]{.underline}** in the section "A new Norwegian
approach to Russia." These have been retrieved from Norwegian media and
from Norwegian MOD and MFA websites. While the combination of
**[systematically reading and manually coding such large bodies of
text]{.underline}** is exceptionally time-consuming, the mixture
arguably **[strengthens the reliability of interpretivist
endeavors]{.underline}** such as this (Hopf and Allan 2016, 20).

More generally, **[the approach used here recovers the identity
categories from texts and other sources of shared meaning]{.underline}**
(Hopf and Allan 2016, 27). That **[Norway and Russia are securitizing
each other is thus not a claim made a priori, but a conclusion I draw
after consulting a plethora of texts.]{.underline}** In the fifth
section, on internal cohesion and external offense, the challenge has
been to stay within the confines of relying on **[explicit utterances to
capture the interactive dynamics at play when two social entities engage
in mutual and multifaceted securitization.]{.underline}** This has
entailed trying to reach conclusions on **[strategies of externalization
and mirroring by consulting texts where one party explicitly refers to
something the other party said or did.]{.underline}**

### 2NC !---Scenario---Norway/Russia---Yes Escalation

#### NATO is militarizing the arctic but only Norway can start a conflict and hybrid war is escalating

Johnjo **Devlin, 6-15**-2022, \"Beyond the Wall: The NATO Soldiers
Guarding the Arctic from Russia,\" No
Publication, <https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zj87/norway-russia-border-ukraine-arctic>//EZAY

It may seem odd that Østtun is defending this barren tundra. But make no
mistake: Control of the Arctic is of vital strategic importance for the
Kremlin.

Much of Russia's oil and gas production sits within the Arctic Circle,
and about 20 percent of Russian exports are generated here. As global
warming thaws the ice, sea trade routes are beginning to open up too.
Controlling these may give Russia influence over global commerce in
decades to come, and the invasion of Ukraine has shown just how far
Vladimir Putin is willing to go to achieve his strategic goals. **[Not
since the Cold War has Arctic security been such a high priority for
NATO.]{.underline}**

**[Norway]{.underline}** isn't the only treaty member with an Arctic
presence -- **[the US, Canada, Denmark and Iceland all have control over
northern waters -- but it is the only one sharing a land border with
Russia]{.underline}**. That puts this Scandinavian nation in a difficult
position. **[Here, unlike in the US or Britain, Russia is not a distant
bogeyman but an ever-present danger. The notorious Russian security
service the FSB -- the main successor to the Soviet Union's KGB --
staffs the border towers just over the Jakobselv river; a constant
reminder of the nature of this violent and unpredictable
neighbour.]{.underline}**

As the conflict in Ukraine has dragged on, once positive **[relations
between Russia and Norway have deteriorated.]{.underline}** The
geopolitical fault lines in the Arctic are deepening, and the role of
conscripts like Østtun and Trettenes is more important than ever.

**[As a founding member of NATO, Norway has long carried the heavy
weight of Arctic security on its shoulders.]{.underline}** But soon, it
won't be alone: **[After decades of military non-alignment, Sweden and
Finland could be poised to become part of the alliance.]{.underline}**

The countries submitted joint membership applications in May. Finland
Prime Minister Sanna Marin said the move was an "act of peace\", while
Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson said, with a characteristic lack of
bombast, that the country was \"leaving one era and beginning another".

But the shift in policy cannot be overstated. If the bids are successful
-- and NATO member Turkey has said it will veto them because of what it
sees as their support for Kurdish groups -- it will mark the most
significant geopolitical realignment in the region since the Iron
Curtain came down 30 years ago.

Finland has an 830-mile border with Russia, and it was invaded by the
Soviet Union in the 1940s. But despite a difficult history, polls have
shown consistent opposition to NATO membership in the Finnish
population. That changed when Vladimir Putin rolled tanks into Ukraine.

"I think there's this sense that the eastern bear has shown its face,"
says Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Finnish Institute
of International Affairs. "As the president \[of Finland\] said, the
masks are off now."

"You have a young generation of Finns who didn\'t have this personal
connection to World War II, but now they\'ve seen \[the invasion of
Ukraine\] and they realize this is what the Russians could do and that
Finns just need to prepare and prepare and prepare."

Charly Salonius-Pasternak, lead researcher at the Finnish Institute of
International Affairs.

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.

While Sweden shares no border with Russia, it has been at pains to avoid
conflict with the Kremlin. The country has remained neutral for more
than 200 years, and the change in attitude marks a momentous shift.

The fact that both Sweden and Finland are on track to join the alliance
is perhaps the greatest irony of Putin's assault on Ukraine. The man who
has repeatedly warned against NATO expansion has inspired it.

But who could be surprised by the Nordic change of heart?

Both Sweden and Finland are Davids to the Kremlin's Goliath, and as
evidence of Russian atrocities in Ukraine have come to light, fear and
loathing for Putin's war machine has grown.

"It was very predictable; the Russian army even has a culture of
violence against its own people," says Pekka Toveri, former chief
intelligence officer for the Finnish Army.

"That has happened in every fucking war that \[Russia\] has done. It's
always been war crimes, rapes, looting. In the Chechnyan wars, in
Georgia."

"It's amazing how stupid the Russians can be not understanding that this
creates a huge reaction in the Western government against them."

Many defence experts have predicted that Finland and Sweden may
officially join the organisation during this year's NATO conference,
taking place in Madrid at the end of July.

But this is by no means a done deal as Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan has opposed ratification of these potential member states. US
Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Ankara will come around, but
behind closed doors NATO officials have said that their applications
could take up to a year.

During that time, Sweden and Finland will remain exposed.

Putin has made ominous warnings against both countries following their
bids. As a show of support, a number of Western nations, including the
US and the UK, have promised to step in should the Kremlin decide to
start yet another war.

But with most of his troops tied up in Ukraine, another invasion may be
a bridge too far, even for Putin.

**["Russia has proved to be amateurish when it comes to conventional
warfare," says Kjell Inge Bjerga, director of the Norwegian Institute
for Defense. "It\'s not likely at all that we see some kind of
conventional attack on the Nordic countries."]{.underline}**

"**[But this will make them more focused on developing their hybrid and
cyber toolbox, and we are already in the midst of a hybrid
war."]{.underline}**

Norwegian soldiers patrol the Arctic border with Russia.

Bjerga says that such **[hybrid attacks]{.underline}** could see Russia
attempt **[more large-scale hacks of Nordic computer systems, airspace
violations or increased radio jamming in the Arctic.]{.underline}**

Of course, even if the Kremlin did decide to strike out with
conventional military force against its neighbor, Toveri says the
**[Finns would be ready]{.underline}**:

"We have this total defence concept," he says. "**[We have general
conscription]{.underline}** -- all males are required to serve -- and
civil society is prepared for a crisis too."

"**[In Finland if you build a block of flats, you're legally required to
have a \[bomb\] shelter in the basement]{.underline}**. Bridges are
built so that they are easy to rig with explosives, so Finnish engineers
can blow them up."

"**[Finland doesn't have a defence force; Finland is a defence
force."]{.underline}**

**[Sweden boasts an impressive airforce and financial muscle.
Strategically, the Swedish island of Gotland is also a huge boon for
Baltic defence]{.underline}**. Should a conflict with Russia ever arise,
the alliance could use it as a staging point for air and naval forces.

On the Russian border itself, the **[battle-ready Finns can field almost
a million reservists,]{.underline}** and figures from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute show that the country already
**[spends more per capita on its military than any other in the
EU.]{.underline}** While that still doesn\'t amount to the 2 percent of
GDP technically required of NATO members, **[both Sweden and Finland say
they will build up to this in the coming years.]{.underline}**

Bjerga, of the Norwegian Institute for Defence, says that if and when
these Nordic nations join forces with Norway, they will form a bulwark
against future aggression.

"**[Norway takes care of the navy, Sweden has the air force, Finland has
the army]{.underline}**. From **[Moscow this is close to a catastrophe.
Because you have a very strong NATO complement close to the
border."]{.underline}**

**[All three nations are set to increase military spending, and in
Norway, that money will flow toward the Arctic]{.underline}**. In March,
its government announced **[hundreds of millions of dollars in new
spending, for frigates, corvettes and subs to defend the northern sea

Focusing **[on the changing relations between Norway and
Russia]{.underline}**, I show how **[rising tension spread from the 2014
crises in Ukraine to the North]{.underline}**.1 Initially, both parties
declared that they neither wanted nor believed that the new strategic
tension between Russia and the West would spread to or define relations
in this region. This was not surprising. Norway and Russia had managed
to build a close and practical partnership in the North following the
end of the Cold War. **[Relations in the region had been characterized
as pervaded by a spirit of cooperation and a "culture of
compromise"]{.underline}** (Hønneland and Jensen 2015). **[However, by
October 2018, NATO was conducting "Trident Juncture," the largest
military exercise since the Cold War on Norwegian territory, with
twenty-nine NATO countries participating, as well as Finland and Sweden,
involving 50,000 troops in all]{.underline}**.2 While this exercise was
underway, **[Russia unexpectedly announced that it would conduct missile
tests in the Norwegian Sea simultaneously]{.underline}**.3 Few could
deny that the **[new Russia--West tensions had spread to the
North]{.underline}**. **[Although the Norwegian authorities were
reluctant to identify Russia as a "threat" for an entire year after the
annexation of Crimea, today they openly speak of and prepare for
hostilities. Russia, for its part, recently claimed that Norway has
become "the frontier of deterrence of Russia" in the policy plans of the
United States and NATO]{.underline}**.4

This development will be explained with reference to changing **[Russian
and Norwegian representations of each other: toward construing the other
part more as a threat than a partner in one issue-area, the rippling
outward of this representation to other issue-areas, the policy changes
effectuated in line with these shifting representations, and how these
changes have been (re-)acted upon by the other side.]{.underline}**
Within such a process of **[mutual and multifaceted securitization,
attention to domestic audiences, quests for internal unity, and coherent
identity articulation in volatile times send signals of offense and
non-recognition across the border to the foreign state
audience---playing into a mutual blame game, shaping interaction, and
further escalating tensions to the point where the threat of hostilities
seems imminent.]{.underline}** As long acknowledged by security-dilemma
theorists, both the classical realist and newer constructivist
proponents, interaction has a dynamics of its own (Herz 1950; Jervis
1978; Mitzen 2006; Booth and Wheeler 2008). I argue that **[the emerging
and mutual pattern of representing the other as a threat, not only in
the military sphere, but also across issue-areas, has become an
"autonomous" driver of conflict---regardless of whether either side
(Norway/NATO/West, and Russia) might originally have had offensive
designs on the other]{.underline}**.5

By invoking the new Cold War in this article, I do not intend to measure
the level of threat and distribution of power between the parties or
suggest that these are the same as in the old Cold War. This article
does not speak to the recent discussion on the similarities and
differences between the old and the new Cold Wars (Legvold 2016; Lieven
2018). Rather, I put the spotlight on the mutual and evolving social
identification processes between political entities that can help to
push a relation to the point where an outbreak of hostilities seems
imminent. **[Just as during the Cold War, the parties today hold
increasingly and mutually incompatible descriptions of self and
other]{.underline}** (Ringmar 2002) and focus on blaming each other
(Legvold 2016). I believe **[the totalizing "blame game" now underway
and the mutual and intensifying descriptions of the other, metastasizing
to a level where the other stands out as an "existential threat" at
every encounter, are central to understanding the unlikely return of
high military tension in the North.]{.underline}**

**[Drawing on a detailed study of Russian and Norwegian official texts
in the years following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and applying a
discourse-theoretical approach to securitization theory]{.underline}**,
this article offers two theoretical contributions to second-generation
securitization theory post-Copenhagen School (Balzacq 2005; Stritzel
2007; McDonald 2008; Salter 2008; Floyd 2010; Hagmann 2015; Wilhelmsen
2017; Stengel 2019, building on Wæver 1994 and 1996; Buzan et al. 1998).
First, I propose that **[securitization processes should be understood
and studied in dyads because the shift to more radical representations
of the other---i.e., a higher degree of securitization---often unfolds
in a mutual pattern of identification and interaction between political
entities.]{.underline}** Second, an **[issue-specific
securitization---say, representing the other part as an existential
threat in the military domain---may spread to other dimensions of the
relationship, making the other part appear as different and dangerous at
every encounter.]{.underline}** Such **[multifaceted securitization can
intensify a negative spiral, ultimately blocking the chances for
positive mutual representation and recognition. Military means then
become a logical and legitimate way of relating to the other: contact
and collaboration in other issue-areas are precluded.]{.underline}**
With this approach, I seek to expand on and integrate a
discourse-theoretical version of securitization theory into the study of
how and why relations escalate to the brink of war.

Although the post-positivist foundation of this study complicates direct
communication and compatibility with much of the classical literature on
the security dilemma and spirals, it does **[speak to the central
question of how collective actors, such as states, become unsure of
whether the other has defensive or offensive intentions and why they
come to see and act toward each other as aggressive, regardless of the
"true intentions" of the other]{.underline}** (see e.g., Jervis 2001;
Mitzen and Schweller 2011). The positivist literature on the security
dilemma and spirals usually theorizes such pathways to conflict as an
encounter between actors reasoning through preference structures in
rational games, or a set of games (Jervis 1978; Fearon 1995; Mearsheimer
2001; Glaser 2010; Copeland 2011; Mitzen and Schweller 2011). In
contrast, my approach, building on the fundamental insight that
**[political entities are socially constituted and that the identity of
self and other is subject to change through linguistic practices,
theorizes such pathways to conflict as emerging through many encounters
and gradually changing relations where identity dynamics serve as the
causal engine.]{.underline}**

This article proceeds as follows: I first lay out the theoretical and
methodological underpinnings of the argument, building on
second-generation securitization theory and the concept of ontological
security. Then, after a short presentation of the historical background
of Russia--Norway relations in the North, I turn to changing Russian and
Norwegian mutual representations in 2014--2018, and the shapes taken by
the securitizing narratives on both sides. Investigating the Norwegian
side in depth, I show how **[the image of Russia as a threat has
solidified over time, spilling over into non-security issue-areas, and
made a string of initiatives that reject Russia' logical and legitimate
policies in a new Norwegian approach.]{.underline}** I examine how
Norwegian official securitization of Russia has been driven by the quest
for unity and continuity in representations of the self in a time of
uncertainty and disruption. The fifth section concerns this driver and
the unintended consequences of skewed attention to internal cohesion and
domestic audiences at the expense of Russia. **[I point out how Russia
has interpreted and (re-)acted to Norway\'s securitizing moves and
policies, showing how mutual and multifaceted securitization unfolds in
practice---and results in escalation.]{.underline}**

Studying Escalation through Mutual and Multifaceted Securitization

While some hold that the growing rhetoric of confrontation between
Russia and the West can be employed without running the risk of war
(Lieven 2018), I take this use of words seriously. Political language
serves to make some courses of action legitimate and logical, while
precluding others (Hansen 2006, 21; Jackson 2006; Wilhelmsen 2017).
According to this fundamental discourse-theoretical insight,
**[securitization---defined as a process where the other is increasingly
cast as different and dangerous to the self---will manifest itself in
concrete policy practices]{.underline}** (Hagmann 2015, 9; Hayes 2009,
985; Wilhelmsen 2017, 28--29). Thus, there is a link between the
rhetoric of confrontation that produces the subjectivities of threatened
self and threatening other, and the policy responses initiated in the
course of such a securitization.6 **[The more different and dangerous to
the self the other is construed as being, perhaps even to the level of
"existential threat," the more reasonable and logical will the use of
force against this other appear]{.underline}** (Bandura 1990, 7--8;
Wilhelmsen 2017, 24--26).

Securitization, viewed through a discourse-theoretical lens, emerges
through a plethora of utterings and is, therefore, best theorized as a
gradual process, not one specific happening (Ciuta 2009; Hagmann 2015,
21--22; Wilhelmsen 2017, 21--24). That is not to say that
securitizations cannot end up in a radical black/white juxtaposition,
where They represent an existential threat to US and can be related to
only through the barrel of a gun. Indeed, the aim of this article is
precisely to show how the gradual and increasing securitization of
Russia in Norway, and of Norway in Russia, is bringing relations to a
point where the threat of hostilities seems imminent. But **[there is no
necessary evolution to this point of possible destruction: it is a
contingent process]{.underline}** (Guzzini 2011). When securitization is
produced through a myriad of statements that together make the other
stand out as a threat, **[there is always a possibility for more and
more statements that construe the other as "defensive" or even
"potential partner" to feed into the process, bringing the threat image
a few levels down and making possible a policy of restraint or even
collaboration.]{.underline}** Here, however, I seek to identify
mechanisms that push securitization upward to the point where the
buildup of force seems necessary and hostilities imminent.

My first suggestion is to conceptualize and study securitization
processes in dyads, that is, as a mutual process. **[The shift to more
radical representations of the other]{.underline}** (a higher degree of
securitization) often **[occurs in a reciprocal pattern of
identification and interaction between political entities]{.underline}**
(Wilhelmsen 2020, 30). How political entities such as states identify,
talk to (or about) each other, and the policies they launch in
accordance with and following such speech, play into and shape the
speech and policy courses of other states. **[There are essential
effects of securitization processes where the other party is cast as
different and dangerous to the self]{.underline}** (Wæver 1995; Buzan et
al. 1998; Stritzel 2007; McDonald 2008; Hagmann 2015; Wilhelmsen 2016).
**[Within a dyad of political entities that increasingly identify the
other as a threat to the self, a self-perpetuating logic sets in, with
the two securitizations fueling each other.]{.underline}**

Under what conditions and how does this happen? As noted by Mitzen
(2006) and others, **[states do seek not only physical security, they
also seek security of the self (ontological security),]{.underline}**
mainly because agency requires a stable cognitive environment.7
Particularly **[at a time of crisis states strive to create continuous
narratives of self]{.underline}** (Steely 2008a; Zarakol 2010; Subotic
2016). Routinized security talk and the **[projection of the other as a
threat delivers ontological security.]{.underline}** It creates inner
cohesion in the referent group and the ability to act (Wilhelmsen 2017,
27--32). This is because **[representations of self and other are bound
together, dependent on each other]{.underline}**. Collective identities
and the social groups they refer to are constituted in relation to
difference and **[maintained through the continued juxtaposition and
drawing up of boundaries between self and other]{.underline}** (Barth
1969; Connolly 1991). However, **[securitizing the other for enteric use
also creates a "securitization dilemma"]{.underline}**---"a difficult
choice where a securitizing move represents a powerful and attractive
opportunity for political mobilization, but with the danger of perverse
and unintended consequences" (Van Rythoven (2019, 2). The unintended
**[consequences of securitization have been suggested to be of several
kinds: contextual, social, and temporal]{.underline}** (Van Rythoven
2019, 10). Within the social type of contingency, which concerns how an
audience can interpret a security claim in unexpected ways, much
attention has been given to situations in which a securitizing move can
be rejected by the audiences it is meant to mobilize (Wæver 1989,1;
Collins 2014; Van Rythoven 2019). Of particular relevance for relations
between political entities, but less investigated, is the unintended
consequences that a securitization within one political entity of
another political entity may have on that other political entity.

To maintain ontological security, actors must not only be able to assure
themselves of who they are (endogenously)---and **[protecting a
continuous narrative of self becomes particularly pressing in a time of
crisis---but they also need to be identified and recognized by others,
and on their own preferred terms (exogenously)]{.underline}** (Steely
2008b, 51--52; Zarakol 2010, 3; Ringmar 2014). A securitizing actor\'s
firm (but probably unconscious) attention to ontological security and
the domestic audience at a time of crisis can communicate
non-recognition to the other (foreign) audience. **[If both parties in a
dyad of political entities push securitization of the other upward for
enteric use but disregard how the other will interpret it, as well as
the non-recognition of the other party that such securitization implies,
a negative spiral sets in.]{.underline}**

For example, a **[securitization of NATO as different and dangerous to
Russia creates both inner cohesion in the Russian polity and makes
possible a policy of "military modernization" and a posture of
"defensive deterrence,"]{.underline}** but it can have unintended
consequences. It can be taken as a **[rejection of NATO\'s
self-constituted identity as a legitimate, reliable, security-seeking
actor and elicit a string of representations of Russia as different and
dangerous on the NATO side]{.underline}**.8 Failure to be recognized by
the other on one\'s own preferred terms might not necessarily result in
**[feelings of inferiority and shame, triggering efforts to reconstruct
one\'s own identity]{.underline}**, as Bially Mattern has suggested
(2004, 12--13) or "progressive change" of self to become like the other,
as Ringmar (2014) holds. As Lupovici (2012, 818) notes a collective
actor that experiences ontological threat can "redefine the situation in
order to protect identity." "Avoidance," he says, building on Giddens
(1991, 188) "allows an actor facing an ontological dissonance to
revalidate its identity rather than to change it or to change its
behaviour." Lupovici explores the strategy of avoidance in situations
where dissonance is created endogenously, between conflicting
self-identifications and the responses undertaken to offset threats to
these self-identifications within one political entity.

Avoidance may play out differently when the ontological dissonance
emerges exogenously in a dyad of political entities. To reduce the
dissonance between the understanding of self and the explicit
identification of one\'s own political entity by the other as being
something different and dangerous, **[revalidation of own identity can
be achieved through externalization, by simply returning the negative
identification]{.underline}**. This strategy is manifest as a clear
pattern in the texts by Norwegian/Western and Russian leaders studied
below. It is hardly surprising that a collective actor would respond to
the non-recognition implicit in being securitized with externalization
in the form of talking and hitting back instead of undertaking some form
of internal revision. **[Responding by mirroring the securitization of
your group by the other party can be rewarding in terms of delineating
and maintaining self-identity, particularly in a time of
crisis.]{.underline}** To restate and return to the case in focus:
**[the non-recognition implicit in Russia\'s securitization of NATO can
elicit highly antagonistic representations of Russia from the NATO side,
triggering another round of representations and accusations from the
Russian side, and so on.]{.underline}**

Such **[a negative spiral of mutual representations and accusations can
be driven further when the different non-military issue-areas in which
collective political entities engage also become subject to
securitization.]{.underline}** While **[relations]{.underline}** between
such entities usually take place on different international arenas
addressing different issue-areas and exhibit a mixed pattern of friendly
and hostile interaction (Jervis 2001, 37; Bially Mattern 2004), they
**[may become subject to patterned all-encompassing friendly or hostile
interaction.]{.underline}** The latter, I propose, can happen when
security concerns take center-stage in relations, **[through a spillover
from mutual securitization in the military sphere into other arenas of
potentially neutral or friendly interaction, such as trade, culture, or
even diplomacy.]{.underline}**

In more scholarly terms, a negative spiral in relations is intensified
when the other is securitized, i.e., construed, through speech, as
different and dangerous at every encounter, and when **[every policy
move in any issue-area is represented as a tool in the hands of this
threatening other.]{.underline}** Such multifaceted securitization
pushes the representation of the other upward on the scale of difference
and danger and can create a situation where positive recognition is not
granted in any sphere. **[In this situation, the collective actor
experiences an exogenous rejection of its self-ascribed identity in
every policy sphere where it seeks outside confirmation---making the
experience acute. In turn, this experience of acute ontological
dissonance may be met by a strategy of avoidance and externalization: a
counter-securitization that mirrors and matches the near-total rejection
to which the political entity itself has been subjected.]{.underline}**
In the course of the ensuing spat, **[with hostile representations flung
back and forth on every arena of encounter, the other is finally left
with no face but that of an enemy. That resolves the dilemma of knowing
what the intentions of the other are, as each party is now quite certain
that the other has offensive designs.]{.underline}**

**[The defence of Norway, including its arctic islands, must be seen in
the context of the NATO alliance.]{.underline}** Experiencing the failed
policy of neutrality in 1940, followed by five years of German
occupation, **[Norway has, since the foundation of NATO in 1949, looked
westward for her security. After deciding to join NATO, Norway sought to
improve the likelihood of receiving support in crises and war through
several means, including the active policy of inviting foreign troops to
exercises in Norway, and increased military coordination and integration
with other western powers, especially the USA.]{.underline}** To adapt
the Norwegian force structure, including its operational concepts, to
conform with her key NATO partners, particularly the USA, and to some
degree the UK, has, since 1949, been given high priority, influencing
both ways and means. In this perspective, working to ensure both
American willingness as well as ability, to assist Norway on NATO's
northern flank has been crucial in Norway's effort to deter potential
Soviet aggression. From this perspective, the **[massive nuclear
capabilities of the Northern Fleet represent not only a Norwegian
problem, but also a challenge for the USA and its NATO
allies.]{.underline}** Norway has both overlapping interests with NATO,
as well as its own unique national interests. As a state directly
bordering Russia, Norway has a particular need to combine the deterrence
policy of invitation and integration of allied forces, with certain
screening measures and self-imposed restrictions. These restrictions are
most notably, disallowing the siting of foreign bases with regular
combat units during peacetime, restrictions forbidding nuclear weapons
in Norway, and restrictions on how far east allied exercises and
training in Norway can take place. Norway's policy-line, influencing
both ideas about military objectives, concepts and resources, captures
the country's dual approach, and can be summed up in the phrase
"integration and screening".

Norway has been of particular interest to the US given the country's
proximity to the Kola Peninsula and the Russian Northern military
district. This location was, and remains, an unusually well-placed
location for the collection of military intelligence in addition to
potential force projection. In addition, **[Norway's closeness to the
North Atlantic and the crucial transit route for Russian submarines
seeking to enter central areas of the Atlantic Ocean and posing a threat
to trans-Atlantic communication]{.underline}**, has been another vital
aspect of US military interest in Norway.

**[In the post-Crimea (2014--) international environment, familiar
dilemmas from the Cold War can be seen. In welcoming a larger number of
US Marines to cold weather training in central and Northern Norway, the
government continues to emphasize military integration with the
USA]{.underline}**, while still avoiding the construction of any
permanent bases. The move to invite more US Marines **[has spurred
external complaints from Russia]{.underline}** as well as opposition
from certain sections of the political spectrum in Norway today. **[The
"Supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement"]{.underline}**, signed 16
April 2021 between Norway and the USA, **[represents the latest
development in this area.]{.underline}**

Options 1 and 2 are based on the **[assumption that]{.underline}** the

things: **[ramp up]{.underline}** spending on **[defense]{.underline}**;

**[despite]{.underline}** the continuing **[decline in American military

Three consequences follow from this analysis. First, doubling down is
unlikely---because Americans won't pay for it---and neither form of

macro-security environment are likely to occur only after substantial

#### Countries have [limited]{.underline} budgets and can't afford defense

**Gilli 17** (Andrea Gilli is post-doctoral fellow at Stanford
University's Center for International Security and Cooperation. "The
Trump administration wants Europe to pay more to defend itself. It's not
that easy." Washington Post. Feb. 3, 2017.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/02/03/europe-may-not-be-able-to-expand-its-defenses-like-president-trump-wants/)

**[The transatlantic gap in military capabilities]{.underline}** --- how
much defense output the two sides of the Atlantic are able to generate,
respectively --- **[has three main causes that cannot easily be
addressed:]{.underline}**

1\) **[European countries have limited defense budgets]{.underline}**
--- On average, defense expenditure in Europe is just over 1 percent of
GDP, while the U.S. defense budget is well above 4 percent of GDP.
**[Would a U.S. retrenchment push European allies to fix this
imbalance]{.underline}**, and bring NATO members closer to the 2 percent
threshold they pledged to move toward in 2014?

**[Maybe]{.underline}**. **[But half of NATO's members are small
countries with small defense budgets,]{.underline}** well below \$2
billion per year. Thus, **[a substantial bump in their military spending
won't bring about a significant increase in Europe's overall military
investments]{.underline}**. Estonia's 2 percent GDP defense expenditure
amounts to just \$500 million, for instance. **[That might pay for the
operational costs of a few of middle-sized U.S. warships, but wouldn't
push back a Russian invasion.]{.underline}**

With the exception of Germany and Poland, **[large E.U. countries face
financial and political constraints to increasing military
expenditure]{.underline}**. The U.K. is going through
**[Brexit]{.underline}**, which will also affect several countries, in
particular the Netherlands and Ireland. **[Italy's bank
problems]{.underline}** loom large, and **[Spain]{.underline}** and
**[France]{.underline}** have **[limited financial]{.underline}** and
**[political room]{.underline}** **[for additional public
spending]{.underline}**. This points to a broader problem.

In part, U.S. security assurances may have freed up state funds in
Europe for other priorities, including a robust system of social
services. However, **[cutting welfare state provisions in Europe to fund
defense expenditures is going to be extremely difficult, if not
counterproductive.]{.underline}**

On the one hand, **[those who receive these benefits are far more
numerous, and thus politically more influential]{.underline}**, than
those receiving a direct benefit from military spending. On the other,
**[cuts in welfare spending risk actually bringing additional support to
anti-establishment parties]{.underline}** like the Five Stars Movement
in Italy, Die Linke in Germany or Podemos in Spain --- **[all of which
have strong anti-defense stances.]{.underline}**

2\) **[European countries pay more in defense overhead]{.underline}**
--- **[All armed forces require military bases, training facilities, and
administrative support. So in a continent with several small, national
armed forces, overhead necessarily absorbs a higher fraction of
resources than in the United States.]{.underline}**

A solution for Europe would be to share some military assets and
functions. In recent years, there have been important bilateral and
multilateral initiatives in this respect --- but there are strong
political limits as well.

**[Countries have no guarantees their partners ultimately will support
them in a military crisis]{.underline}**. Thus, if sharing turns into a
lock-in, countries run the risk of having access to fewer military
capabilities than they might need. This explains why the width and depth
of past initiatives have been generally limited.

However, this comes at the cost of intra-alliance inefficiency and thus
an inferior capacity to generate military capabilities. An E.U. Defense
Union could address these problems, but efforts to set this up face many
of the same challenges: Why should a country tie its destiny to others?
How can it ensure that its interests will be respected? And what
tangible benefits would it observe in the short term, beside loss of
jobs and income, following base closures and defense industry
consolidation?

3\) **[Implementing defense cooperation in Europe won't be
easy]{.underline}** --- Some analysts think that by promoting
cooperation among NATO allies, any U.S. retrenchment from Europe would
help address existing problems, but there are strong reasons to be
skeptical.

**[With Europe's limited funds to spend on defense, large cooperative
projects will be difficult to launch]{.underline}**. In the past,
**[countries in Europe abandoned cooperative projects because of their
negative domestic implications for jobs, technological know-how or
military exports. In an age of austerity, amid a refugee crisis and high
youth unemployment, this mind-set is unlikely to change anytime
soon.]{.underline}**

And **[some countries may have little interest in
cooperation]{.underline}**. **[They may operate in completely different
environments]{.underline}** --- **[Mediterranean vs. North
Sea]{.underline}**, for example. **[Or]{.underline}** they perceive **[a
different strategic threat at home]{.underline}** --- **[think Russia
vs. the Islamic State]{.underline}**. **[Some countries may even have a
strategic interest in leaving unaddressed some capability gaps --- to
compel proximate allies to come to their defense. This was Finland's
military strategy during the Cold War.]{.underline}**

### Deficit---Say No---Domestic Politics

#### Say No---Domestic politics and faith in US security guarantee

**Zannella, 20** \[Anthony Zannella Seton Hall University, majored in

Sharing in NATO and the Problem of Free Riding,\" Political Analysis:
Vol. 21 , Article 5,

/alundy\]

**[The literature on burden sharing has shown great
development]{.underline}** over the years moving from a more pecuniary
focus, to a focus that incorporates a variety of inconspicuous factors.
From a deterrence and pure public goods standpoint, the United States is
bearing an unfair share of the burden. The simple fact that it is
leading the way economically (and in turn with the efficiency and
effectiveness of its forces) shows that **[non-U.S. NATO allies are
indeed benefitting]{.underline}** unfairly from its ally's efforts.
**[The decline in NATO allied defense spending indicates the acceptance
of relying on U.S. capabilities and letting their own forces bear less
of the financial responsibility associated with collective
defense]{.underline}**. However, **[the simplicity of this model does
not consider other factors that can be just as important]{.underline}**
to burden sharing. The joint product model would seem to take better
account of factors that do not seem immediately pertinent to burden
sharing but are without a doubt just as important. **[The dedication of
alliance forces can produce strain in a political manner due to the
potential loss of life and the ramifications]{.underline}** such losses
can have back home. Furthermore, **[the introduction of excludable goods
levels the playing field in different ways.]{.underline}** The massive
output of defense provided by the U.S., **[incurs significant benefits
that are only a positive for the U.S. alone]{.underline}.** The
expansion of the defense industry, for example, can provide jobs and
further stimulate the U.S. economy; however, this is a good that other
nations cannot benefit from directly. This same idea can be redirected
back to non-U.S. NATO allies. **[Many of them intend to focus more on
domestic issues at home while letting their forces weaken under the
greater protection of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. With new threats on the rise and a turn to
out-of-area operations, it becomes apparent that if the U.S. "is able to
provide politically or physically sufficient levels of security for the
rest of NATO's members in response... then other members can free ride
and will provide little additional assistance. Therefore, we should
expect even more free riding than in the past," (Siegel 2009).

### Deficit---Say No---Nationalism

#### Nationalism breeds distrust---prevents support for burden sharing

**Kluth 19** \[Andreas Kluth is a columnist for Bloomberg Opinion, was
previously editor in chief of Handelsblatt Global and a writer for the
Economist, "A European Army? It'll Never Happen," Dec 2, 2019,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-12-02/a-european-army-will-never-happen-nato-remains-essential\]

The complications that caused that stillbirth linger. **[The nations
in]{.underline}** what is now **[the European Union still care about
their sovereignty]{.underline}**, which is expressed above all in the
decision to send young soldiers into harm's way. **[They]{.underline}**
also **[have different interests. The French are busy in their former
African colonies. The Poles and Balts feel most threatened by Russia.
Germany]{.underline}**, caring not a whit about all that, **[is merrily
building itself a second gas pipeline to Russia, circumventing the
eastern EU]{.underline}**.

**[Member states]{.underline}** also **[have dissonant historical
traditions, which make integration into one command
hierarchy]{.underline}** almost **[impossible]{.underline}**.
Postcolonial France considers military action a legitimate tool of
foreign policy, and its president has ample powers to direct its army.
**[Germany]{.underline}**, still atoning for World War II, **[disavows
military interventionism]{.underline}**. Unlike France, it has a
"parliamentary army," which must get explicit approval from the
Bundestag to do anything. Would a French president patiently wait for
the German legislature before deciding whether to shoot at little green
men speaking Russian in an Estonian forest? Would 27 states cede that
decision to Brussels?

**[The fundamental problem]{.underline}**, as Jan Techau of the German
Marshall Fund puts it, **[is distrust: The French and Germans don't
fully trust]{.underline}** **[each other, the Italians trust neither of
them, the Germans don't even trust themselves, Warsaw distrusts Berlin,
Bucharest and Budapest distrust each other, people in the Balkans don't
trust anybody, and so forth]{.underline}**.

That's why Macron is seen in central Europe as a neo-Gaullist. When he
talks about "strategic autonomy" or "European sovereignty," he seems
mainly to be eager for France, the EU's only nuclear power after Brexit,
to lead Europe, snubbing its nose at the U.S. and accommodating Russia.
To advance that vision, he's sponsored a fledgling alliance called the
"European Intervention Initiative," which is part of neither NATO nor
the EU. Needless to say, **[the EU's eastern members would much prefer
to keep relying on the U.S]{.underline}**.

### Deficit---Say No---AT: Pressure Solves

#### Say no and the cp collapses NATO

A further, critical implication of this assessment of the strategic
environment is rarely noted: **[it is]{.underline}** entirely
**[inconsistent]{.underline}** **[with shock therapy's
assumption]{.underline}** **[about the lack of serious threats to
European security to say that calling]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'

**[create more military capacity]{.underline}** **[via increased
spending]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}**
**[coop]{.underline}**eration. **[On the contrary]{.underline}**,
**[a]{.underline}** relatively **[benign security setting
is]{.underline}** arguably **[more conducive]{.underline}** **[to
allowing]{.underline}** (p.260) narrow national perspectives to trump
EU-wide initiatives and to foster the continuation of **[minimalist
defense efforts]{.underline}** **[than]{.underline}** the status quo of
**[US leadership]{.underline}**. America's **[NATO allies
make]{.underline}** **[up]{.underline}** nearly **[a
fifth]{.underline}** **[of global]{.underline}** military
**[spending]{.underline}**. **[Britain is the fourth
biggest]{.underline}** military spender in the world, **[with
France]{.underline}** close **[behind]{.underline}** (after another US
ally, Japan) as sixth. **[Germany]{.underline}**,
**[Italy]{.underline}**, **[Turkey]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
**[Canada]{.underline}** all **[rank among]{.underline}** the world's
fifteen **[biggest spenders]{.underline}**.41 Very **[secure
states]{.underline}** like Norway and Canada **[purchase]{.underline}**
**[sophisticated weaponry from the US]{.underline}** military-industrial
complex **[and order]{.underline}** their **[soldiers into battle in
America's wars]{.underline}** in far off lands. **[Why?]{.underline}**
**[A major]{.underline}** **[reason is]{.underline}** **[the alliance
with the United States]{.underline}**---it is **[the existence
of]{.underline}** the **[overseas hegemon]{.underline}** **[and the
perceived need]{.underline}** **[to retain access to it and standing
with it]{.underline}** that **[drive much of]{.underline}** this
**[behavior]{.underline}**.42

Options 1 and 2 are based on the **[assumption that]{.underline}** the
international **[system generates]{.underline}** strong **[pressures for
European states to]{.underline}** do one or all of three very costly
things: **[ramp up]{.underline}** spending on **[defense]{.underline}**;
reform entrenched domestic defense practices and institutions; and set
aside national prerogatives to generate genuine supranational military
defense and decision making at the EU level. **[Take away]{.underline}**
**[Uncle Sam's "welfare for the rich]{.underline}**" **[and the logic of
anarchy will]{.underline}** somehow **[force]{.underline}** this
**[outcome]{.underline}**. It cannot be ruled out that there is
something special about Europe that would cause it to act in this
collectively martial way without the US umbrella. But **[that
expectation is inconsistent]{.underline}** **[with most
of]{.underline}** **[what we know about]{.underline}** **[international
politics]{.underline}** **[and with the lived experience]{.underline}**
**[of the EU]{.underline}**'s European Security and Defense Policy and
Common Foreign and Security Policy. **[Governments just don't
do]{.underline}** **[extremely expensive]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[politically costly things]{.underline}**
without a major prod of some sort. The problem is that **[there is
neither a compelling external security incentive]{.underline}** **[nor
a]{.underline}** **[European hegemon]{.underline}** **[to help
solve]{.underline}** the **[collective action]{.underline}**
**[problem]{.underline}**. **[Germany may play]{.underline}** **[this
role in economics]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** it is
**[not]{.underline}** going to do so **[in security]{.underline}**.43
The **[likelihood that]{.underline}** **[a US revocation of Article
5]{.underline}** **[would spur France]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[Britain]{.underline}** **[to set aside national
feeling]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[unite defense
efforts]{.underline}**---**[and that middle powers]{.underline}**
**[from Poland]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**
**[Turkey]{.underline}** **[would acquiesce]{.underline}**---**[is
exceedingly low]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[the downward trend in
European defense spending has continued]{.underline}**
**[despite]{.underline}** the continuing **[decline in American military
forces in Europe]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** despite
increasingly **[loud calls for retrenchment]{.underline}**.

Three consequences follow from this analysis. First, doubling down is
unlikely---because Americans won't pay for it---and neither form of
retrenchment will work---because **[Europeans won't]{.underline}**
**[pay the political]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}** **[economic
costs]{.underline}** **[even]{.underline}** **[if the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[steps
aside]{.underline}**. Second, major changes to the current benign
macro-security environment are likely to occur only after substantial
strategic warning, and therefore projected low costs and risks for US
security provision will likely remain adequate. And third, **[there is
no]{.underline}** net **[security benefit]{.underline}** **[to
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
(p.261) **[of administering a shock]{.underline}** **[to NATO
via]{.underline}** **[even more dramatic reductions]{.underline}** **[in
presence or commitment]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[there are
serious]{.underline}** **[expected costs]{.underline}** **[in terms of
lost security cooperation]{.underline}** **[and even less
capable]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[interoperable
allies]{.underline}**. **[With militarily capable allies
like]{.underline}** **[NATO]{.underline}** and the Republic of Korea,
**[a major benefit of presence is]{.underline}** **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** (joint training, planning, etc.) **[that is
difficult]{.underline}** or impossible **[to replicate
with]{.underline}** **[rotational deployments]{.underline}**. According
to a recent comprehensive RAND study, the US presence in NATO is getting
near the floor of deployed personnel needed to sustain security
cooperation at current level.44

Now let's consider how this vision of NATO aligns with American grand
strategy. The US grand strategy of deep engagement is essentially about
three objectives: managing the external environment to reduce near- and
long-term threats to US national security; promoting a liberal economic
order to expand the global economy and maximize domestic prosperity; and
creating, sustaining, and revising the global institutional order to
secure necessary interstate cooperation on terms favorable to US
interests.45

NATO's declining capability for large-scale optional expeditionary
operations to address conjectural security threats or humanitarian
ideals does little to impede this grand strategy. The Obama
administration's policy pronouncements and military deployments do not
in any way represent a change away from deep engagement. They reflect a
refocus on the strategy's core. For that core, NATO retains value as an
institutional framework for:

• Coordinating transatlantic security cooperation;

• Maintaining key infrastructure and lines of communications to sustain
a US-led containment strategy in the greater Middle East;

• Reducing inefficient duplication of defense efforts among allies,
preventing full renationalization of security;

• Hedging against the emergence of a more threatening Russia or the
appearance of a new, serious security threat.

The retrenchment options (One and Two) put these benefits at risk. Full
retrenchment does so because it is obviously inconsistent with deep
engagement. "**[NATO-friendly" retrenchment]{.underline}** does so
because it confuses secondary aims with the grand strategy's core aims.
It **[is willing]{.underline}** **[to trade US leadership of the
alliance for ephemeral]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** likely
**[unattainable gains]{.underline}** **[in indigenous European
capability]{.underline}**. Doubling down on NATO makes the same mistake
of viewing optional capacities as essential, and magnifies it by
ultimately imposing its costs on the US taxpayer, as it has no answer to
the "free rider" problem aside from exhortation.

**[If the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[engineers]{.underline}** **[a dramatic
shift]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** its **[grand strategy to
a]{.underline}** strong version of **[restraint]{.underline}** **[that
devalues]{.underline}** **[the capacity]{.underline}** **[to mount light
footprint]{.underline}** military **[operations]{.underline}** around
Eurasia as well as the incipient "coalition in waiting" represented
(p.262) by NATO, **[then the alliance would cease to make
sense]{.underline}**. But if, as is likely, it pares the deep engagement
strategy to its core objectives, then muddling though, with no new grand
bargains, no grand "rebooting" of the alliance, no sudden new infusion
of defense dollars and euros, and no "post-American" NATO emerges as the
optimal choice. In other words, the transatlantic bargain should contain
three parts: NATO should continue to guarantee territorial defense;
external operations in Europe's neighborhood where the United States has
no interest should fall under the EU or individual European allies
(e.g., France in Mali, Central African Republic); and NATO should only
engage beyond Europe's borders when the United States wishes to be
involved.

**[Yet there inevitably are areas of national strategy that a
process]{.underline}** alone **[cannot shape]{.underline}**. **[We
maintain that national strategic cultures, national political
economies]{.underline}**, **[and E.U. macroeconomic and fiscal policy
decisively influence how countries allocate resources to defense --
before NATO and E.U. planning processes take place]{.underline}**.
Specifically, the more Atlanticist (a preference for a transatlantic
approach to European security, in which the United States' role is
central) a country's national security strategy was, the more it
contributed to shared operational priorities during NATO's "out of area"
period (from 2000 to 2012). As European states experience increased
unemployment, they "slightly decrease top-line defense spending in
response to unemployment, while shifting much more substantial amounts
within defense budgets out of equipment and into personnel." E.U.
members respond similarly to supranational (E.U.) fiscal constraints
agreed to by heads of state and government as part of the Maastricht
Treaty on European Union, and "monitored" (enforced) by the European
Commission. Processes cannot address these tough choices, which amount
to rival claims on strategic resources, but politico-strategic dialogue
may. For example, when NATO allies agreed to a "pledge on defense
investment" at their 2014 Wales Summit, their heads of state and
government gave broad but clear guidance not only to defense ministries
to "meet\[\] capability priorities," but also to finance ministries to
"reverse the trend of declining defense budgets." Two years later, E.U.
heads of state and government formally adopted the NATO goals of moving
toward spending two percent of GDP on defense and 20 percent of defense
spending on equipment modernization. Early indications are that these
political agreements are having some effect on resource allocation, as
Figure 3 shows. European allies' defense spending increased by \$87
billion from 2014 to 2018. That this would occur in spite of
disagreements regarding threats, economic fragmentation within Europe
and the broader transatlantic community, and fiscal austerity in the
European Union, points to the importance of cultural factors like
Atlanticism. However, as Figure 3 also shows, increases may be stalling
-- a transatlantic divide may harm burden-sharing and, perhaps
paradoxically, weaken Europe as a strategic actor. Figure 3: Annual Real
Change in Defense Spending, NATO Europe and Canada Source: NATO, Defence
Expenditure of NATO Countries (2013-2019), 2020. NATO and European Union
agreement on exigent defense investment guidelines, as well as the
downstream effects on coordinated capability development, point toward
other opportunities for the two organizations to cooperate
strategically. This is especially true given the tight interconnection
between the economic strength of the transatlantic community and its
military strength. For example, NATO and the European Union could build
on current cooperation proposals to include the grand strategic area of
resource allocation, ensuring that NATO and E.U. defense spending goals
are not in competition with E.U. fiscal rules for scarce resources.
Italy's 2015 defense White Paper, for example, suggests the possibility
that some defense spending "could be excluded from the thresholds of the
Stability and Growth Pact." Trouble Behind, Trouble Ahead At some level,
all states must prepare for war. Robert Osgood called alliances "latent
war communities" -- they are designed for that purpose. Indeed, Bear
Braumoeller's recent work extends Charles Tilly's insight that "war made
the state and the state made war" to international orders, which he
argues prevent war among their members but are dangerous to non-members.
Processes like those that NATO and the European Union have developed
during the last eight decades of relative calm and prosperity are
central to the transatlantic community's ability to prepare for, and
perhaps forestall, future wars. They are the best tools its members have
to convert political will into capabilities that they believe will have
strategic effects, like deterring adversaries or, if necessary,
defending national territory and shared interests. Processes are,
however, no substitute for grand strategic vision. Such vision animated
the creation of both NATO and the European Union. There is now a strong
case for a bolder vision of transatlantic cooperation in defense
planning and grand strategy to keep the "fog of peace" from turning into
the "fog of war." What might such a vision look like? Some scholars have
proposed to address the fog of peace by "rediscovering geography" to
regionalize NATO defense planning, enabling allies to focus on
capabilities that are most directly relevant to their own strategic
priorities. Others have argued that it is time for Europe to seek -- and
achieve -- true strategic autonomy, either by "Europeanizing" NATO
(whereby the United States would reduce its footprint in the alliance
and concentrate on its strategic challenges elsewhere), or by subsuming
NATO into a broader European political-security framework. Even the
possibility of extending France's nuclear deterrent to its European
allies has been raised, first by French scholars discussing "nuclear
solidarity," and then by President Emmanuel Macron, who invited European
partners to "be associated with the exercises of French deterrence
forces" in the interest of a "true strategic culture among Europeans."
Macron further clarified his intent in an interview with Wolfgang
Ischinger at the 2020 Munich Security Conference, pointing to an
"unprecedented dialogue" on nuclear deterrence among Europeans.
Challenges abound. First, **[transatlantic discord creates challenges
for European Atlanticists, making it more difficult to align national
strategies, and may even incentivize countries to curb defense spending
to appeal to domestic electorates that bristle at external
pressure]{.underline}**. Second, the combination of economic recession
and fiscal austerity that plagued Europe during the 2008 crisis appears
likely to return in a more virulent form, which is almost certain to
dampen defense investment. Taking Europe's "destiny in its own hands" is
easier said than done. Years of low defense investment, the complicating
effects of Brexit, the rise of populist politics across Europe, and
uncertainties about Turkey, among other issues, cloud prospects for
greater European defense autonomy. While retaining the transatlantic
bond, in an era of great-power competition when conflict would almost
certainly not be confined to one operational theater, it may be wise to
encourage allies to "concentrate on those tasks for which they are most
geographically suited." For example, Baltic Sea states could focus on
defending their territory from Russian aggression, while states along
the Mediterranean could focus on combatting terrorism and building
partner capacity -- each without fear of being criticized for
inadequately supporting allies. Doing so would help link operational and
strategic planning to threat assessments, while also helping to blunt
conflict among allies about defining the array of threats, risks, and
challenges that characterize the emerging security environment. It would
enable the transatlantic security community to incentivize and leverage
the national defense planning efforts of its members. Specializing like
this would enable institutional work to focus on harmonizing, which
encourages **[burden-sharing]{.underline}**, as opposed to dominating,
which incentivizes free-riding. But such specialization **[demands
trust, which is currently in short supply in the transatlantic community
and beyond]{.underline}**.

**[The use of national defence spending is justified by the fact that
much of NATO's operations and activities are funded by national defence
spending]{.underline}**, while only some funding is channelled through
the NATO budget. Thus, **[the idea of measuring contribution to NATO by
considering GDP]{.underline}** shares of national military spending
makes some sense, but it **[is neither an accurate, nor]{.underline}** a
necessarily **[useful, indicator of contributions]{.underline}**
(Zyla [2009](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750),

Kunertova [2017b](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)).

US military spending in 2017 was at a level of 610 billion USD, thus
representing not only a majority of NATO spending, but 35% of the
military spending of the entire globe; 9.2 times that of Russia and 2.7
times that of China (These calculations are based on data by
SIPRI [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750)).[^3^](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750) Thus,
if we use the GDP share of national military expenditure as an
indicator, it seems clear that the US, with about a 45% share of the
NATO GDP , (GDP data is calculated from "The World Factbook --- Central
Intelligence Agency" n.d.) has a too high a national expenditure, as it
add up to more than 50% of the sum of national defence expenditures of
all NATO countries.

**[If we look at the funding of NATO itself]{.underline}** and of such
functions and operations that are under the direct control of the
alliance rather than member countries, **[the picture changes
dramatically]{.underline}**. If security is a public good and there is
an agreement on how best to protect it, one could assume that NATO
countries should have no difficulties in channelling their military
spending through a common, rather than a national, decision-making
structure. The fact that this is not the case already challenges the
credibility of seeing security as a public good for NATO countries.

Direct **[NATO funding is proportional to each member country's
GDP]{.underline}**, with the exception of the US, which is compensated
in its NATO shares for its superior national spending. According to NATO
statistics on defence spending (NATO 2018) from 2016 and the CIA World
Factbook ("The World Factbook --- Central Intelligence Agency" n.d.,
NATO [2018](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/09662839.2019.1578750))
data on GDPs, **[all NATO countries contribute more to NATO's budget
than their GDP share]{.underline}** (the GDP share equals the GDP of the
country divided by the GDP sum of all NATO countries), excepting
Luxembourg and the United States. While NATO's budget share from
Luxembourg is likely to be a result of fluctuation in GDPs and a
specific year's (2016) contribution, and while the share of Luxembourg's
contribution to the NATO budget is still very close to its share of GDP,
the case of the US is different. **[US funding for NATO is
systematically lower than its GDP share, less than half]{.underline}**
of it. Obviously, this relates to US superior national military
spending, but again, **[it highlights problems with the assumption that
the security needs of NATO countries are identical]{.underline}**. If
the US actually contributes 22% of the NATO budget while its GDP share
would be 45%, **[then we either have to believe that US national defence
spending serves NATO's security needs or relinquish the conclusion that
the US is such a disproportionate contributor to NATO]{.underline}.**
However, the question of burden sharing is much more complicated than
the debate on defence expenditures may suggest.

#### Allies are [unwilling]{.underline} to meet 2% burdens\-\--it's not realistic

**Techau 15** \[Jan Techau; director of Carnegie Europe, a part of
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; 9/2/15; THE POLITICS OF 2
PERCENT;
[https://carnegieendowment.org/files/CP_252_Techau_NATO_Final.pdf\]](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/CP_252_Techau_NATO_Final.pdf%5d)

If **[2 percent has become the gold standard for defense
spending]{.underline}** in the debate on NATO's future, then how
realistic is it that the goal will ever be reached? Pessimism prevails
on this issue. "The guideline . . . **[if taken literally, would create
an impossible situation for some allies]{.underline}**," writes Ian
Anthony of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. A
country like Germany would have to absorb €74 billion (\$82 billion) of
defense spending instead of its current €37 billion (\$41 billion),
something it **[would be unable (and unwilling)]{.underline}** to do and
that would in turn lead to "inefficiency and waste, rather than an
increase in useful capability."20 Germany is also the focus of another
argument that aims at making 2 percent look unrealistic. The enormous
increase in absolute defense spending in Germany, with its large
economy, that would result from 2 percent could also lead to a degree of
nervousness among some of the country's allies. As Karl-Heinz Kamp of
the German Federal Academy for Security Policy argues, "If Germany spent
2 percent of its huge GDP, it would produce a defense budget
overshadowing those of France and the UK, arguably causing more concern
than reassurance among its neighbors."21 This is a weak argument, as it
essentially questions the political reliability of a key NATO partner
that is most under pressure to spend more The strength of the 2 percent
metric is its triumph of simplicity over complexity. 12 \| The Politics
of 2 Percent: NATO and the Security Vacuum in Europe on defense. For the
most part, it is a self-serving defensive argument against higher
defense spending that has been used primarily by Germans themselves, not
so much by other NATO allies. **[But the lack of capacity among member
states to absorb significantly increased defense budgets is not the only
factor that leads to doubt about hitting the 2 percent target. The
biggest concern comes from the fact that many NATO countries agreed to
the 2 percent pledge in Wales but have no real intention to make good on
the promise.]{.underline}** "The problem is not that most NATO allies
will fail to reach the 2 percent bar. The trouble comes with those that
don't even try," as Kamp puts it.22 Initial budget decisions made around
or after the Wales summit and even public announcements by many member
states seem to indicate that the **[political will to really reach 2
percent is indeed underdeveloped across NATO]{.underline}**. Overriding
economic concerns are also reasons for skepticism that the 2 percent
pledge can be fulfilled. "As long as austerity remains the eurozone's
economic mantra, it is unlikely that European allies will meet the
target," one researcher argues.23 Under the prevailing economic
circumstances, it is often claimed that a reversal of the downward trend
in defense spending would already be a success, but that an **[increase
to 2 percent would be too much to realistically expect.]{.underline}**
The Wales summit declaration itself makes **[2 percent dependent
on]{.underline}** positive **[economic development, stipulating that
allies "aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as GDP
grows."]{.underline}**24 This conditionality is meant to generate more
defense spending from the moment economic recovery sets in. The volume
of growth that would be needed to increase defense spending is not
specified, nor is a time reference for growth given. Should spending be
measured against absolute GDP growth on an annual basis, or should the
growth rate be the metric? Or should GDP growth be measured against a
fixed point in time---for instance, GDP before the financial crisis?

The president's critique is not unfounded. American power today differs
from its heights in 1945, or even 1990. The United States will need help
shouldering the maintenance of a liberal international order that has
increased global security, prosperity and freedom these past seven
decades. Nevertheless, the **[manner in which an American administration
approaches the burden-sharing issue matters]{.underline}**. Trump has
pointedly called for NATO allies to pay more for defense and his team at
the United Nations has circulated a potential policy to make foreign aid
contingent on alignment with U.S. positions, so that aid dollars "only
go to America's friends." Though increased action among allies and
partners is necessary, **[to simply demand greater burden-sharing is
insufficient. Policymakers confront two central questions if they are to
promote effective burden-sharing]{.underline}**: first, **[how to ensure
other stakeholders do step forward, rather than leave a vacuum around an
issue]{.underline}**; and, second, **[how to protect and advance U.S.
interests if burden-sharing cedes the initiative]{.underline}** to
others. Demands for increased activities from partners **[must be
coupled with coordination and a measure of U.S. leadership for an
effective burden-sharing campaign]{.underline}**. A **[number of cases,
therefore, reveal bases for eliciting burden-sharing of the quality and
variety the United States should want---as well as the risks of forcing
burden-sharing via disengagement]{.underline}**. The notion of
**[compelling other nations i]{.underline}**nto taking
actions---**[particularly by arousing skepticism around U.S.
credibility]{.underline}**---is a **[recipe for shortchanging American
interests.]{.underline}** Consideration of both **[UN peacekeeping
operations]{.underline}** and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis and Malaria **[illustrate how effective burden-sharing
requires continued U.S. commitments]{.underline}** in order **[to spur
burden-sharing over inaction]{.underline}**. Furthermore, the success of
the Global Fund, the **[worsening of some crises in]{.underline}** the
Middle East, such as in **[Yemen, and the mixed record of the U.S.
withdrawal from]{.underline}** the Trans-Pacific Partnership
(**[TPP]{.underline}**), similarly **[demonstrate that leadership
creates the leverage necessary for Washington]{.underline}** to advance
U.S. interests **[when others do step up to act.]{.underline}**
Americans may legitimately want others to do more, but how that aim is
pursued matters. **[Nowhere is this more evident than the debate over
NATO.]{.underline}** Even before the signing of the Washington Treaty,
concerns around NATO burden-sharing arose. U.S. military planners
worried that an American security guarantee would perpetually deter
defense spending by the new European allies. This concern dogged the
allies throughout the Cold War. Disagreements flared almost immediately
in the Senate's "great debate" over deploying troops to Europe without
additional European support in the Korean War, a peripheral interest to
many European leaders. **[Disagreements resurfaced in the 1960s as
Western European economies recovered from their postwar
devastation]{.underline}**. The Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations repeatedly sought to navigate clashes between security
interests in Europe and trade or balance of payments deficits.
Compounded by the strains of Vietnam, both the **[security and economic
arrangements boiled over in the Nixon administration with the resulting
shifts of the Nixon Doctrine]{.underline}** and the shocks to the
Bretton Woods system. Though the transatlantic partners were in sync on
détente and then counterbalancing in face of the Soviet Union in the
1970s and early 1980s, disagreements surrounding approaches to European
security, particularly around the deployment of intermediate-range
nuclear missiles, maintained a measure of tension between the
Euro-Atlantic allies. The subsequent Soviet collapse transformed the
global security environment; yet, it **[did not take long for a new
generation of burden-sharing issues to emerge. The Clinton
administration at first evidenced ambivalence on respective roles and
responses on Balkans crises. Others, like then-French foreign minister
Hubert Vedrine, derided the U.S. "hyperpower]{.underline}**." During
this period even Paul Wolfowitz admitted a "need to believe that others
are doing their share." Frustrations persisted in the George W. Bush and
Barack Obama administrations. Under both presidents, Secretary of
Defense Robert Gates forewarned of a potential "two-tiered alliance" at
the 2008 Munich Security Conference and the "the growing difficulty for
the United States to sustain current support for NATO if the American
taxpayer continues to carry most of the burden in the Alliance" in his
2011 farewell address at NATO. Jeffrey Goldberg further captured this
sentiment in President Obama's derision of "free-riders" in his
revealing 2016 article "The Obama Doctrine" in The Atlantic.
**[Surviving these crises, NATO's story reminds that the organization
has been and remains, like many of America's global partnerships,
inherently reformable]{.underline}**---**[provided the United States
engages with tangible and realistic ambitions]{.underline}**.
**[Without]{.underline}** initial U.S**[. involvement, no effective
collective defense organization would have developed in
Europe]{.underline}** sufficient to manage the Soviet threat. **[Without
continued engagement]{.underline}** that same **[organization would not
have changed as needed, for instance, to be a stalwart partner in
Afghanistan. NATO]{.underline}** and the broader transatlantic
partnership certainly **[require further shifts to manage today's era of
resurgent great power competition; however, this past precedent
emphasizes the need for active U.S. leadership and reasonable
agenda-setting]{.underline}**. Pragmatic engagement will yield practical
results. Peacekeeping by the United Nations offers an important example
of what burden-sharing means and what elicits it. During the Cold War,
UN peace operations were confined to interposing a deployment between
formerly warring parties. The clash of the Cold War superpowers as
veto-wielding United Nations Security Council (UNSC) members meant that
was all the traffic would bear. In settings like Cyprus and Lebanon,
long-standing deployments kept additional military duties off the U.S.
plate through decades of the Cold War. **[The Cold War's end ushered in
more numerous and ambitious UNSC mandates---as the United States and
Russia were more often willing to align on authorizing peace
operations]{.underline}**. In the 1990s, along with a couple of dramatic
failures marred by murky mandates (in Bosnia and Rwanda, where excessive
impartiality left atrocities to occur on peacekeepers' watch), an
**[array of peace operations took hold with a variety of
governance]{.underline}** and post-conflict goals beyond the traditional
interpositional model.

In anticipation of the 2018 NATO Summit, analysts have commented
on [several positive regional security
enhancements](http://www.atahq.org/2018/02/projecting-stability-adapting-nato-readiness-action-plan/):
command and control structure changes, new headquarters for maritime
forces, and higher defense spending levels. **[European scholars and
policy experts would like to see the Summit move past the issue of
burden sharing]{.underline}.** Certainly, **[there is much more than
burden sharing to discuss]{.underline}**. Yet, **[a lack of consensus
about Russia and threats from terrorism have limited the progress the
Alliance should have gained]{.underline}** since Wales in 2014. Coercive
tactics with tariffs and trade imbalances will only increase resistance
and weaken consensus on a way ahead with regard to security arguments.

At the Summit, the attendees will be able to see a clear reversal of
declining defense spending as several NATO members are expanding their
defense budgets. Despite President Trump's desires for rapid achievement
of the 2% threshold, **[European disarmament occurred over a long period
of time, and given economic realities in Europe, it will not be overcome
in a matter of one or two years]{.underline}**, as Frank Hoffman
noted [last
year](https://www.fpri.org/article/2017/03/making-nato-less-obsolete/) on
this topic. However, as shown in Figure 2, European and Canadian defense
expenditures are on a clear upward trend. Given U.S. persistence, and a
bit of patience from U.S. leaders, these positive improvements should
continue.

2.5.1 The Reassurance Dilemma. One **[might thus conclude that
reassurance is suboptimal, and that patrons are best served by casting
their protection into doubt]{.underline}**. The **[reality is not so
simple,]{.underline}** however. Because the patron's side of the bargain
entails providing protection to its allies, **[if that protection comes
into doubt then allies have less reason to honor their end of the
bargain]{.underline}**: namely, to **[remain loyal to the
patron]{.underline}** by siding with it against its adversaries,
providing basing access, and supporting its other foreign policy
priorities (Morrow, 1991; Lake, 2009). **[The patron thus faces a
dilemma]{.underline}**. It must **[choose between withholding
reassurance to maximize burden-sharing, on the one hand, and providing
reassurance to ensure that allies have incentives to remain loyal to it,
on the other.]{.underline}** Directly studying the relationship between
reassurance and burden-sharing is difficult, however. The first two
problems are methodological. **[Any relationship that exists between
patron reassurance and allied burden-sharing may be
spurious.]{.underline}** For example, U.S. troop presence is likely to
be correlated with threat, which may have an independent effect on
allied military spending. Second, the relationship between reassurance
and burden-sharing may be endogenous; patrons may withhold reassurance
from allies which are under-contributing and then reward them with
assurances of protection once they have increased their efforts. The
third problem is theoretical -- even if troops are present, **[allies
may fear (and, indeed, the patron may threaten) that they will be
withdrawn.]{.underline}** It is difficult to know, for example, whether
a large U.S. troop presence in a country indicates that the host is
highly dependent on the United States, or whether it is instead the
United States that is dependent upon the host. Indeed, while Lake (2007,
2009) and Machain and Morgan (2013) find that states which host U.S.
troops have lower defense contributions, Allen, VanDusky-Allen, and
Flynn (2016) show that NATO allies' defense efforts are positively
related to U.S. military presence. Moreover, Bennett, Lepgold, and Unger
(1994) find that states with a large U.S. military presence -- which
they treat as a proxy for partners' dependence on the United States --
were more likely to contribute to the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War.

### Deficit---Cohesion/Relations---Abandonment Fears

#### CP causes allies to perceive lack of US commitment

for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, specializing in NATO,

Winter 2019, The Fletcher forum of world affairs, vol. 43

Since its creation in response to Soviet aggression after World War II,
the majority of the U.S. public has consistently held favorable views of
NATO. But **[Trump's repeated public criticism of NATO may be having an
effect on popular support for the Alliance]{.underline}**. Support for
NATO by Republicans decreased from 52 percent in 2016 to 47 percent in
2017, during the first year of the Trump administration.81 Nevertheless,
a strong majority of Americans polled have a favorable view of NATO.
While Republican support for NATO may have gone down slightly, support
for NATO by Democrats and Independents has increased significantly. As a
result, overall public support for NATO has grown, from 53 percent in
2016 to 62 percent in 2017. 82 Still, **[Trump's tough NATO policy is
putting great strain on the Alliance]{.underline}**. It will not
convince the majority of U.S. allies to meet NATO's 2-percent
defense-spending pledge by 2024. Moreover, **[reducing U.S. commitments
to NATO and cutting contributions to the Alliance will only make the
problem worse and may make hostile powers more willing to test the
Alliance by using force or engaging in a hybrid attack against a NATO
member]{.underline}**. Instead of focusing on threats, Trump's NATO
policy should propose feasible burden-sharing ideas that can be
implemented quickly.83 But the key to a successful NATO policy from the
Trump administration must be a more accurate perspective on the central
role of NATO in U.S. national security. Trump needs to **[stop
overestimating the harm from burden-sharing and underestimating the
value of NATO to U.S. national interests]{.underline}**. The **[security
that NATO provides Europe, the North Atlantic, and the Mediterranean is
worth much more to the United States than the 5 percent of the
Department of Defense budget allocated to U.S. forces in
Europe]{.underline}**. It is critical that Trump appreciate the unique
value that previous presidents saw in NATO. As George W. Bush described
it,"These trans-Atlantic ties could not be severed by U-boats. They
could not be cut by checkpoints and barbed wire. They were not ended by
SS-20s and nuclear blackmail. And they certainly will not be broken by
commercial quarrels and political debates."84 **[NATO must not be
evaluated simply as a transactional cost]{.underline}**. It is a unique
asset for the United States that protects American citizens, interests,
and values. As Barack Obama explained,"Our nations are stronger and more
prosperous when we stand together. In good times and in bad, our
alliance has endured; in fact, it has thrived---because we share an
unbreakable commitment to the freedom and security of our citizens. NATO
is a force multiplier.... There is nothing else like it on Earth."85
Notably, on July 6, 2017, Trump gave one of his most powerful foreign
policy speeches in Warsaw. In the speech, he made two strong statements.
"Americans know that a strong alliance of free, sovereign and
independent nations is the best defense for our freedoms and for our
interests. That is why my administration has demanded that all members
of NATO finally meet their full and fair financial obligation," he
said.86 It is important that Trump recognize how his threats and
**[demands are jeopardizing the significant value that NATO
offers]{.underline}**. If Trump leaves NATO or **[unintentionally breaks
up the Alliance, the United States will not be able to replace
it.]{.underline}** Rather, the Trump administration should pursue
alternative options to produce more responsible and fair behavior from
NATO allies. As President, it is in Trump's interest to strengthen NATO
and find more positive and feasible policies to resolve the
burden-sharing problem. NATO is the most powerful alliance in history
and a key asset in U.S. national security. None of our competitors have
anything like it. **[The loss of NATO would be a major victory for U.S.
adversaries.]{.underline}** As former Secretary of Defense Mattis has
explained to the Senate Armed Services Committee, "history is clear:
nations with strong allies thrive, and those without them wither."87

#### Using the threat of abandonment to induce burden sharing causes allied distancing and wrecks assurance.

**[If the benefits of coercion---especially the capricious sort in which
Trump specializes---are small, the costs may be sizable]{.underline}**.
As we have seen, postwar American leaders saw value in asymmetric
alliances in part because, by taking on the burden of defending others,
they gained control over allies whose territory replaced the homeland as
America's front line. **[Washington spent more on defense
than]{.underline}** its **[allies, but got far more out of its alliances
than any one of them did. If the U]{.underline}**nited States continues
to **[emphasize cost-sharing above all other strategic priorities, it
will reduce its ability to assure and control allies, which
may]{.underline}** in turn **[weaken the defense and deterrence benefits
those allies provide. America may pay less, but it will]{.underline}**
also **[get far less in return]{.underline}**.

**[A loss of allied control may take the form of political distance, as
allies look for other relationships to replace their faltering
partner]{.underline}**. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has already
declared that Europe can no longer depend on the United States, and
French President Emmanuel Macron has lamented that, amid US neglect and
browbeating, NATO is "experiencing brain death." South Korean President
Moon Jae-In has prioritized his ongoing negotiations with Kim Jong Un,
distancing himself from the United States. Both South Korea and Japan
have improved their relations with China.16 **[Distance undermines
policy coordination and can]{.underline}** **[seriously diminish a
guarantor's political influence. It may]{.underline}** even **[foster
conditions in which allies to tilt toward rivals]{.underline}**.

#### CP kills assurances -- freeriding accusations and contested metrics

<https://www.jstor.org/stable/23266017>

Accusations of free-riding have marred transatlantic relations ever
since the creation of the Atlantic alliance in 1949. Then as now, **[the
rhetoric of burden-sharing has served as a useful rhetorical weapon to
blame those who were seen as not contributing enough to the cause. Each
time, however, Washington\'s call has fallen on deaf
ears]{.underline}**, at least in public. In private, European and
Canadian officials highlight other contributions they think they are
making to NATO operations, for example in the shape of development aid
or considerable troop casualties in Afghanistan. They mention UN
peacekeeping missions, such as in Lebanon, where the US is not involved.
Cynics admit that they never really bought much into the military
adventures into which the US threw them, and that the US itself did not
seem to believe much in the Libya mission. The reality, French foreign
minister Alain Juppe retorted to Gates, is that it is the Europeans who
\"think the Americans aren\'t doing enough.\"3 The evolution of the
transatlantic debate suggests two things. **[First, burden-sharing is
about more than NATO. One cannot just look at defence spending at a time
when humanitarian aid, diplomatic mediation, and the fight against
climate change can all be considered contributions of a sort to
collective security.4]{.underline}** **[Disentangling what counts as a
contribution to which public good is no easy thing. Second,
burden-sharing is a contested political concept. Statesmen and
diplomats]{.underline}** **[do not speak the abstract language of public
choice]{.underline}**, with its \"non-excludable\" and \"non-rival\"
goods. Rather, they talk about \"being fair,\" \"doing what you can,\"
and **[\"making a real contribution.\"]{.underline}** In other words,
they **[speak the normative language of justice rather than the
utilitarian language of economics]{.underline}**.

### Deficit---Cohesion/Relations---Trump Proves

#### Conditional U.S. aid undermines allied cohesion -- Trump's public views on NATO prove

**Benitez 19**, Jorge Benitez is a senior fellow in the Scowcroft Center

transatlantic relations, European politics, and U.S. national security,
"U.S. NATO Policy in the Age of Trump: Controversy and Consistency,"

These statements echo some of Trump's remarks about NATO. They
demonstrate that **[American leaders are becoming more impatient with
the persistent burden-sharing imbalance with European allies, marking
a]{.underline}** frequently overlooked yet nevertheless **[dangerous
decline in the U.S. attitude toward the behavior of its
allies]{.underline}**. They are proof that Europe has underestimated the
corrosive effect of its attitude toward fulfilling the NATO defense
commitment. These comments demonstrate that the problem of
burden-sharing is serious and will continue to jeopardize transatlantic
relations after Trump, unless significant progress is made. Trump no
doubt feels validated by these criticisms from previous presidents. But
Trump also feels that previous presidents were unsuccessful because they
did not make sufficient effort to pressure NATO allies to fulfill their
defense commitments. As a result, Trump appears willing to take greater
risks than any of his predecessors. Trump summed this up after his last
NATO summit in 2018: Now, what has happened is, presidents over many
years, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama, they came in, they said,
"Okay, hey, do the best you can," and they left. Nobody did anything
about it. And it got to a point where the United States was paying for
90 percent of NATO. And that's not fair. **[So it's
changed]{.underline}**.13 To properly understand this widening gap
between the United States and NATO allies, it is essential to recall the
timely warning from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. In 2011, Gates
spoke in very direct language to emphasize to Europe the gravity of the
problem, stating, "I am the latest in a string of U.S. defense
secretaries who have urged allies privately and publicly, often with
exasperation, to meet agreed-upon NATO benchmarks for defense
spending."14 He then made one of the starkest warnings about the health
of the Alliance, stating, "\[I\]f current trends in the decline of
European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S.
political leaders--- those for whom the Cold War was not the formative
experience that it was for me---may not consider the return on America's
investment in NATO worth the cost."15 Gates did not advocate for such a
change in U.S. NATO policy, but he feared that if allies did not make a
significant change, future U.S. leaders would lose faith in the most
powerful alliance in U.S. history. This warning may now seem prophetic
with the rise of Trump, but even Gates must have been surprised at how
quickly his warning proved true. TRUMP BREAKS FROM HISTORICAL
PRESIDENTIAL SUPPORT FOR NATO As we have seen, Trump is not the first
president to complain that NATO allies are not contributing their fair
share of defense spending to the Alliance. **[But Trump has done two
things his predecessors avoided. First, he has publicly questioned the
value of NATO to U.S. national security. Second, Trump has publicly
questioned the validity of U.S. defense commitments to NATO allies.
These two deviations from]{.underline}** decades of bipartisan
**[presidential support for NATO have weakened the cohesion of the
transatlantic alliance and caused fears in allied capitals
that]{.underline}** under the Trump administration,
**[the]{.underline}** **[U.S. may not help defend them should they face
a foreign attack]{.underline}**. Trump's views on NATO should be
understood and examined in two phases: his statements about NATO as a
candidate during the 2016 presidential campaign and his statements about
NATO since he became president.

### Deficit---Deterrence 

#### The CP's pressure undermines deterrence

**Schnaufer 21**, Tad A. Schnaufer II is a Ph.D. candidate in Security
Studies at the School for Politics, Security, and International Affairs
at the University of Central Florida and is a captain in the Florida
Army National Guard, "The US-NATO Relationship: The Cost of Maintaining
Political Pressure on Allies," January 15^th^ 2021, Georgetown Journal
of International Affairs, Conflict & Security,
https://gjia.georgetown.edu/2021/01/15/the-us-nato-relationship-the-cost-of-maintaining-political-pressure-on-allies/

These responses from European leaders show that **[startling allies into
thinking the United States will abandon them has influenced
allies]{.underline}** to increase defense spending in line with
the [2014 Wales
Pledge](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm).
However, in the **[long term, NATO policymaking should employ a balanced
approach]{.underline}**. **[If the United States brings its security
guarantee of the alliance too much into question, Russia or other states
may take action to test the United States' resolve]{.underline}**.
During the Cold War, US leaders continually reaffirmed their commitment
to allies, effectively deterring a Soviet invasion**[. Deterrence works
best when allies clearly express their mutual obligations to all actors
on the international stage.]{.underline}**

The experience of **[the United Kingdom and Germany leading up to World
War I provides an example of how the United Kingdom's lack of a solid
commitment to its allies allowed German leaders to think the British
would stand aside in the war.]{.underline}** [Barbara
Tuchman](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=92J9wTgKBOMC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=Guns+of+August&ots=mOLWViY-lK&sig=TOaFasP065_hkRLQIjryq6MJ6PI%23v=onepage&q=Guns%25252520of%25252520August&f=false) details
this situation in her book The Guns of August. The failure of King
George V and the UK Foreign Secretary to give a definite guarantee of
joining the war should Germany invade allowed the Kaiser to think that
he could attack without a British intervention**[. If the British had
made a direct declaration of support for its allies, German leadership
might have decided against escalating the war. This case gives
policymakers an idea of what could happen if the United States does not
maintain a firm commitment to its NATO allies. US leaders must watch how
far they allow the US commitment to NATO wane in competitors' eyes or
risk possible adventurism on the eastern flank of NATO.]{.underline}**

What do these two conflicting options mean for US policymakers? **[If
the United States wants allies to meet the defense spending
requirements, it needs them to fear the possibility that the United
States may abandon them because their interests no longer
align]{.underline}**. The allies will only fear abandonment if the
United States sends costly signals to them, such as troop withdrawals.
As of 2020, the [majority of
allies](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/10/pdf/pr-2020-104-en.pdf) that
meet the elusive two percent spending goal sit on NATO's eastern flank,
fearing Russia and desiring US protection. Nevertheless, [spending
across the
alliance](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/10/pdf/pr-2020-104-en.pdf) has
increased since 2014, in part, due to the Trump administration's
application of political pressure calling into doubt US interests in
Europe. **[However, in the medium- and long-term, threatening to abandon
allies will decrease the appearance of US security guarantees and invite
competitors to push boundaries.]{.underline}**

### Deficit---Conditions Fail

#### Conditional SC fails---it [doesn't induce behavioral change]{.underline}

**Munson 13** (Peter J. Munson is senior vice president for preventive
services and global crisis management for a private sector corporation
and a retired U.S. Marine Corps officer. "THE LIMITS OF SECURITY
COOPERATION" 9/10/13
<https://warontherocks.com/2013/09/the-limits-of-security-cooperation/>)

**[Planners should go to great lengths to ensure that SC is seen as a
tool for a specific purpose, not a reward to condition
behaviors]{.underline}**. **[SC-as-a-conditioning-tool becomes bribery
with diminishing returns]{.underline}**. **[If policymakers want a quid
pro quo, they need to admit as much and use much more precisely targeted
incentives: paying a fee for access]{.underline}** or head-of-the-line
transit privileges for example. **[This becomes a much more predictable
business transaction than trying to use SC funds, winks, and nudges to
get one's way.]{.underline}** Finally, in the land of perverse
incentives, SC is often seen as a means to drive defense business to
U.S. contractors. This is true. By creating arms races and supplying
prestige weapons, however useless, to unstable areas of the world, they
are creating U.S. jobs. But wouldn't taxpayer money and efforts be
better spent if officials more precisely targeted domestic concerns with
taxpayer funds rather than hoping that efforts trickle down predictably
from collaboration with corpulent and unsavory foreign generals? **[In
the land of perverse incentives, SC funding is one of the most
egregious]{.underline}**---and in the post-9/11 era, **[many officials
see SC as a critical tool of strategic positioning]{.underline}**.
However, **[the premises of SC must be reconsidered before the U.S.
military squanders more resources on white elephant
projects.]{.underline}**

### Deficit---AI---Say No

#### Despite talks and rhetoric, there's no way that NATO cooperations on AI and Tech.

**Franke '21** (Ulrike Esther Franke, Senior policy fellow at the
European council on Foreign Relations, "ARTIFICIAL DIVIDE: HOW EUROPE
AND AMERICA COULD CLASH OVER AI",
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep29123>) //sethlee

Both sides of the Atlantic are already motivated to cooperate with each
other on AI. But, **[despite these shared interests, transatlantic
cooperation on AI may not be straightforward. Four trends, in
particular, could pose problems: transatlantic estrangement; European
digital autonomy efforts; differing views on China; and, potentially,
Brexit. The transatlantic alliance has had a bad four years. The Trump
administration's criticism of the United Nations and the World Trade
Organization, the president's threats to leave NATO, and his active
criticism of the EU all made Europeans wonder whether they had lost
their most important partner.]{.underline}** Moreover, in light of the
conflict over 5G, in the minds of many Europeans**[, technology in
particular has become an area that creates conflict in the transatlantic
relationship rather than fostering cooperation]{.underline}**. Although
transatlantic relations are likely to improve under Biden,
**[substantial damage has been done]{.underline}**, and it will take
some time to mend these ties. But, even if relations improve, it is
becoming increasingly obvious that US has a diminishing interest in
Europe as a geopolitically important part of the world. This trend was
already visible under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. It is,
therefore, unsurprising that, on technology cooperation, both sides
emphasise the importance of working with other actors as well as each
other. The US National Security Commission on AI, for example,
recommends that the US Departments of State and Defense "should
negotiate formal AI cooperation agreements with Australia, India, Japan,
New Zealand, South Korea, and Vietnam". Its March 2020 report emphasises
on several occasions the importance of the Five Eyes intelligence
alliance. Meanwhile, Europeans are pursuing the idea of an alliance for
multilateralism. And, on technology and AI more specifically, they have
also begun to reach out to other democratic allies. The most important
aspect of transatlantic estrangement, however, is not the loss of trust
between the US and Europe -- which they will eventually reverse. Rather,
**[during the four years of the Trump administration, and partly in
response to isolationist tendencies in the US, Europeans have become
much more comfortable talking about European strategic autonomy or
sovereignty. Without encouraging the narrative that these efforts are
directed against the US, or were primarily an answer to Trump, Europeans
aim to empower Europe as an actor in its own right. In the technological
realm, this led to the idea of European digital sovereignty, the aim of
which is to build up European technological capabilities.]{.underline}**
Although European digital sovereignty is not specifically targeted at
the US, it has led, among other things, to efforts such as the possible
regulation of American technology companies and concerns over American
firms acquiring European start-ups. European campaigners and some
policymakers believe US tech giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook, and
Amazon are forces to protect against. European thinking on technology
partly developed in opposition to the US and US companies**[. Thus,
European efforts to build up digital sovereignty may impede
transatlantic cooperation.]{.underline}** The EU's effort to strengthen
ethical AI, and to make 'trustworthy AI' a unique selling point for
Europe**[, might also end up creating problems for transatlantic
cooperation]{.underline}**. Many EU policymakers believe that the EU's
insistence on ethical AI will eventually become a location advantage for
Europe (much like data privacy): as more people become concerned about
unethical AI and data security, they will prefer to use or buy AI 'made
in Europe' rather than elsewhere. In this respect, two European aims are
at odds with each other: on the one hand, Europeans want to ensure that
AI is developed and used in an ethical way. Partnering with a powerful
player such as the US on this matter should be an obvious way to help
them achieve this goal. **[However, if the EU considers ethical AI not
just a goal for humanity but a development that may also create
commercial advantages for Europe, then transatlantic cooperation on this
issue is counterproductive, as it would undermine Europe's uniqueness.
Finally, many Europeans have expressed scepticism about the extent to
which Europe and the US are indeed aligned on ethical AI
principles.]{.underline}** For example, the Danish national AI strategy
argues for a common ethical and human-centred basis for AI. It describes
ethical AI as a particularly European approach: "Europe and Denmark
should not copy the US or China. Both countries are investing heavily in
artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility,
ethical principles and privacy." **[Many Europeans feel that the US "has
no idea how to regulate" cyberspace]{.underline}** and continues to show
little enthusiasm for doing so. The EU, however, likes to think of
itself as a trailblazer when it comes to digital rights, such as the
2014 "right to be forgotten" or the 2018 General Data Protection
Regulation.

### AT: Blankenship

#### Their "threats key" evidence is a mis-reading of Blankenship. They think the [latent and implicit threat of abandonment]{.underline} is preferable to overt QPQs.

**Blankenship -- 1NC solvency advocate - 18** (Professor of Political
Science at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, PhD political
science at Columba, MPhil & MA political science at Columbia "Promises
under Pressure: Reassurance and Burden-Sharing in Asymmetric Alliances,"
Columbia University PhD dissertation)

**[The credibility of a patron's threat of abandonment is shaped by far
more than just the level of reassurance it provides]{.underline}**. As a
result, the extent to which reassurance and burden-sharing are
positively or negatively correlated depends in large part on whether the
patron can couple its assurances with threats. When a patron's threat to
abandon allies is credible ex ante, it can afford to reassure its allies
without worrying as much about free-riding. Indeed, **[the literature on
coercion shows that reassurance is equally as important as threats in
making for effective coercion]{.underline}**, although it is much less
studied (Davis, 2000; Sechser, 2007; Carnegie, 2015; Gerzhoy, 2015). The
target of coercive bargaining needs to know that if it gives in, its
partner will simply punish it anyway (Schelling, 1966). Thus,
**[reassurance can actually be a positive tool that is used to increase
burden-sharing]{.underline}**, though only **[if it is backed up by
threats]{.underline}**. **[These threats do not necessarily need to be
explicit, and indeed may be most effective if they are
not]{.underline}**. Allies are likely to consider how likely patron
abandonment is, and thus their **[burden-sharing efforts
will]{.underline}** in no small part **[be a reaction to the patron's
latent threat of abandonment]{.underline}**.

3.2.1 What is Exit? By exit, I refer to attempts by states in an
alliance to loosen themselves from the partnership and reduce the
benefits they provide to their partners. For allies, exit takes the form
of efforts to reclaim their autonomy and pursue a foreign policy more
independent of the patron, while for patrons exit takes the form of
efforts to reduce the security it provides. Exiting the alliance is more
credible to the extent that a state has attractive outside options for
meeting their security and/or autonomy needs. **[Violation or abrogation
of the alliance treaty are]{.underline}** only the most **[extreme forms
of exit]{.underline}**; a party to an alliance need not expect that its
partner will outright terminate the partnership. Rather,
**[exit]{.underline}** is a spectrum, and states may fear the
consequences of the more moderate step of their partners "distancing"
themselves from the alliance. Distancing **[is undesirable for two
reasons]{.underline}**. The first is that **[the perception of disunity
may weaken deterrence by tempting adversaries to drive a wedge between
the allies or by emboldening them to behave more
aggressively]{.underline}** (Weitsman, 2004; Crawford, 2011). **[Second,
distancing raises questions about the amount of support that the partner
will]{.underline}** 35 **[furnish]{.underline}**. **[Allies may fear
that the patron will give only minimal support if they are
attacked,]{.underline}** while the patron may anticipate that more
**[autonomous allies will be less likely to]{.underline}** **[provide
basing]{.underline}** rights, less likely to **[support its foreign
policy initiatives, and more likely to come to a separate understanding
with adversaries]{.underline}** (Lake, 2009). In early 2018, for
example, steps toward détente between North and South Korea -- including
North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics and discussions of
potential bilateral talks -- worried many in the United States, who
feared that such a rapprochement might undermine South Korea's support
for the United States' preferred policy of putting military and economic
pressure on the North.3 Two general forms of outside options are
available to alliance partners: self-sufficiency and search. In the case
of the former, states reduce their need for partners. Allies, for
example, can attempt to increase their own military capabilities such
that they no longer need protection. Patrons, for their part, can reduce
their need for loyal allies by pursuing a more unilateral or
isolationist foreign policy, and by striking a deal with adversaries. In
terms of search, patrons and allies can seek alternative partners. While
the types of outside options weaker allies can pursue -- ranging from
nuclearization, to neutrality, to finding other countries to rely on for
support -- are diverse, and in many cases will not be the precursor to
actual alliance termination, their causes are fundamentally similar, and
they share common features that will make them worrisome to the patron.
First, all of the forms of exit I discuss reduce allies' dependence on
the patron. **[This]{.underline}**, in turn, **[makes them less likely
to cave into its pressure]{.underline}** in the future,
**[and]{.underline}** **[gives them less incentive to be]{.underline}**
automatically **[loyal]{.underline}**. As a result, a patron has good
reason to discourage allies from pursuing any of these options. Second,
allies will be most prone to consider all of these forms of exit when
relying on the patron's protection becomes less attractive -- whether
because the patron seems unreliable, because the severity of the threat
environment makes trusting the patron risky, or because the barriers to
exit decrease. I am ultimately agnostic as to which form of exit allies
will be most likely to pursue in a given situation. Indeed, in many
cases, allies can pursue multiple options in tandem, such as unilateral
military arming coupled with efforts at rapprochement with adversaries.
Nevertheless, I treat the threat of all forms of exit as a key driver of
patron reassurance.

[Resolve]{.underline}: "To form a purpose; to make a decision;
especially, [to determine after reflection]{.underline}; as, to resolve

#### "Should" is [advisory]{.underline}, not certain. It also [equals]{.underline} "ought."

**Richman '16** \[James; August 17; Judge on the Second Circuit,
California's Court of Appeals; Westlaw, "Marin Assn. of Pub. Emps. v.
Marin Cty. Employees\' Ret. Assn.," 2 Cal. App. 5th 674\]

There is, of course, no bar to the Supreme Court adopting a Court of
Appeal\'s reasoning as its own. Yet there is legitimate reason to
question whether that was what the Supreme Court intended in 1983.
First, as just shown, **[only the least authoritative of the three
sources]{.underline}** cited \*\*385 **[actually supports the word
"must,"]{.underline}** while **[the]{.underline}** two **[Supreme Court
decisions employ "should."]{.underline}** Second, barely a month later,
the Supreme Court---speaking though the same justice---filed another
decision which used the "should" formulation from the 1955 Allen
decision as quoted in Abbott.20 Third, the 1983 Allen decision involved
retirees (and Flournoy the widow of a retiree), who historically receive
a heightened degree of judicial protection. (See fn. 19, ante.) Fourth,
and most significantly, **[the "must" formulation has never been
reiterated by the Supreme Court, which has instead uniformly employed
the "should"]{.underline}** \*699 **[language]{.underline}** from the
1955 Allen decision. (Olson v. Cory, supra, 27 Cal.3d 532, 541, 178
Cal.Rptr. 568, 636 P.2d 532 \["Although an employee does not obtain any
'absolute right to fixed or specific benefits \... there \[are\] strict
limitation\[s\] on the conditions which may modify the pension system in
effect during employment.' \[Citation.\] Such modifications must be
reasonable and any ' "changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages" ' "\]; Legislature v. Eu (1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 529--530, 286
Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309 \[quoting Olson\]; City of Huntington Beach
v. Board of Administration (1992) 4 Cal.4th 462, 472, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d
514, 841 P.2d 1034 \["changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages," citing Allen v. City of Long Beach, supra, 45 Cal.2d 128,
131, 287 P.2d 765\].)

It thus appears unlikely that the Supreme Court\'s use of "must" in the
1983 Allen decision was intended to herald a fundamental doctrinal
shift. **["Should," not "must," remains the court\'s preferred
expression]{.underline}**. And **["should" does not convey imperative
obligation, no more compulsion than "ought."]{.underline}** (Lashley v.
Koerber (1945) 26 Cal.2d 83, 90, 156 P.2d 441; see People v. Webb (1986)
186 Cal.App.3d 401, 409, fn. 2, 230 Cal.Rptr. 755 \[**["the word
'should' is advisory only]{.underline}** **[and not
mandatory"]{.underline}**\].) **[In plain effect, "should" is "a
recommendation, not \... a mandate."]{.underline}** (Cuevas v. Superior
Court (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 406, 409, 130 Cal.Rptr. 238.)

#### "Should" refers to the future.

Iowa; Westlaw, "In re Est. of Guthrie," 752 N.W.2d 452\]

phrase]{.underline}** "in the event any of my children should predecease

of "shall" to imply a duty or obligation]{.underline}**. See Black\'s

### AT: INB---European Defense High

#### European Defense spending is high and increasing rapidly

**Rolander '22** (Niclas Rolander, Reporter, "Global Military Spending
Tops \$2 Trillion for First Time as Europe Boosts Defenses",
<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-24/military-spending-passes-2-trillion-as-europe-boosts-defenses>)
//sethlee

**[Global military expenditure has surpassed \$2 trillion per
year]{.underline}** for the first time, **[and looks set to rise further
as European countries beef up their armed forces in response to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}**

In 2021, countries spent a total of \$2,113 billion on their militaries,
up 0.7% in real terms from the year before, according to a report
released Monday by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
or SIPRI. 

After a brief period of declining military spending between 2011 and
2014, outlays have increased for 7 consecutive years, according to SIPRI
data. **[In the wake of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, several
European governments have pledged a spending overhaul to boost their
forces' capabilities. ]{.underline}**

**["Europe was already on an increasing trend, and this trend will
accelerate and intensify,]{.underline}**" Lucie Beraud-Sudreau, director
of SIPRI's military expenditure and arms production program, said in a
phone interview. "**[Usually change happens slowly, until you are in a
crisis and then change really happens. I think that's where we are
now."]{.underline}**

**[The upturn since 2015 has partly been fueled by higher spending in
Europe, after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea]{.underline}** raised
the perceived threat level at the same time as the U.S. administration
under Donald Trump increased pressure on NATO allies to spend more on
their armed forces, Beraud-Sudreau said.  

**[European spending in 2021 accounted for 20% of the global
total]{.underline}**, and China's defense budget, the world's second
largest, is estimated to make up 14%. 

The U.S. remains by far the biggest spender, with \$801 billion
allocated to the armed forces in 2021, according to SIPRI. In the last
decade, U.S. military spending has made up as much as 39% of global
expenditures. While the country's arms purchases have declined, more
funds have been devoted to military research and development, suggesting
that the U.S. is focusing more on next-generation technologies,
according to SIPRI researcher Alexandra Marksteiner. 

**[As European nations from Sweden to Spain have pledged to increase
defense budgets, early indications are that modernizing and upgrading
weapons systems will be a key priority, Beraud-Sudreau said. In doing
so, they are facing a choice of whether to prioritize a quick buildup by
buying equipment off-the-shelf from arms manufacturers in other parts of
the world, or taking a more long-term approach by increasing funding for
domestic industry]{.underline}**.

#### Burden Sharing increasing now -- data proves

**Hazen '20** (Bradley Hazen, intern in the Atlantic Council's
Transatlantic Security Initiative, "NATO's progress on burden sharing
remains strong"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/infographic/natos-progress-on-burden-sharing-remains-strong/>)
//sethlee

**[When NATO leaders met in Wales in 2014, strengthening allied burden
sharing and reversing a downward trend in national defense spending were
high on the agenda]{.underline}**. In response to Russia's comprehensive
military modernization efforts and territorial aggression against
Ukraine, member
states [pledged](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm) to
increase their national defense spending to at least 2 percent of real
gross domestic product (GDP) by no later than 2024.

**[European allies and Canada have now contributed five consecutive
years of growth in defense investment, adding a cumulative total
of [\$130
billion](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_174406.htm#sg4) in
new spending since 2016. In 2019, all but three NATO allies increased
their defense spending in real terms, with nine allies reaching or
surpassing the 2 percent goal (up from seven in 2018).]{.underline}**

But progress has not been confined just to the realm of investment.
Since 2014, **[the Alliance has stepped up [military
exercises](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2019_02/1902-factsheet_exercises_en.pdf) across
Europe, strengthened multinational missions in

and reinforced its eastern flank with new enhanced Forward Presence

Looking ahead, the COVID-19 pandemic has left much regarding
the [future](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/coronavirus-and-transatlantic-security-implications-for-defense-planning/) of
allied defense planning and investment uncertain, and it is likely that
many allied governments will feel pressured to limit or cut defense
spending as the pandemic's economic toll continues to mount. That said,
**[it is clear from the data that the Alliance-wide drive towards 2
percent, though uneven at times, continued apace through 2019, signaling
NATO members' commitment to strengthening and more evenly distributing

### AT: INB---European Defense High---Ukraine

#### NATO members have increased their defense budget after Ukraine War

PARIS: **[The war in Ukraine has been a strong wake-up call for a number
of European countries who'd been basking in post-Cold War comfort
thinking that armed conflict was relegated to history and that spending
on defense could be minimal.]{.underline}**

**[The turnaround since [Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of
Ukraine](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/02/russia-aiming-to-decapitate-ukrainian-government-us-official/) has
been nothing less than stunning, to the point that six NATO members have
now pledged defense increases of \$133 billion so far]{.underline}**;
militarily neutral Sweden has also pledged an increase. And more nations
seem poised to follow suit in the days and weeks to come.

**[The first to make a 180° turnaround was Germany]{.underline}**. Just
four days after Russia's invasion began, Chancellor Olaf Scholz
announced his government would ramp up its defense spending in 2022
alone by €100 billion (\$112 billion) taking defense spending from 1.53%
of GDP to above 2%.

That is the figure recommended by NATO estimated to have been [only met
in
2021](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2021/6/pdf/210611-pr-2021-094-en.pdf) by
the US, Greece (3.82%), Croatia (2.79%), the United Kingdom (2.29%),
Estonia (2.28%), Latvia (2.27%), Poland (2.10%), Lithuania, (2.03%),
Romania (2.02%) and France (2.01%), according to NATO statistics. (That
Germany had not met that threshold was a major political sticking point
during the Trump administration, leading to tensions between Washington
and Berlin.)

**[Scholz said in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine it had become
clear "we need to invest significantly more in the security of our
country, in order to protect our freedom and our
democracy.]{.underline}**" If the money Scholz has requested comes
through, it will mark a dramatic moment for Germany, with Berlin
becoming the largest overall defense spender in Europe. How that money
will be spent will be important to watch for industry; currently,[ only
four European NATO member
states](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2021/6/pdf/210611-pr-2021-094-en.pdf) (Iceland,
Slovenia, Portugal and Belgium) spend a lower percentage of their
overall defense spending on procurement and defense-related R&D than
Germany's 18.6%.

**[NATO's]{.underline}** geographic home of **[Belgium followed suit
days later]{.underline}**, announcing on Feb. 25 it would raise its
defense budget from the current €4.2 billion (0.9% of GDP) to €6.9
billion (1.54% of GDP) by 2030. But on March 16 Prime Minister Alexander
De Croo told parliamentarians this was not enough, indicating **[more
may come.]{.underline}**

**[Romania announced]{.underline}** on March 1**[ it will up its defense
budget from 2.02% to 2.5% of GDP starting in 2023. The 2022 defense
budget of RON25.9bn (\$5.8bn) is already 14% higher than
2021.]{.underline}** Florin Cîțu, president of the Romanian Senate,
suggested a day later that a large proportion of the new funds should be
used for capital investments, but gave no precise figures. A forecast
released in December 2021 suggested investment would account for 40% of
the total defense budget by 2025. **[That will likely increase further
in light of the new 2.5% goal.]{.underline}**

#### Ukraine has prompted NATO countries to massively increase spending\-\-- CP does nothing.

**[In the wake of Vladimir Putin's beastly assault on Ukraine, multiple
NATO nations have announced immediate plans to increase defense
spending]{.underline}. [This reawakening is long overdue]{.underline}**.
In this post-post-Cold War era, there's no room in the free world for
free-riders.

Rearming What Winston Churchill said of Josef Stalin and his commissars
remains true of Putin and his henchmen: "There is nothing they admire so
much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect
than for weakness, especially military weakness."

**[Before hurling his army into Ukraine, Putin not only sensed weakness
in NATO but saw it in a range of policies: evaporating defense budgets,
lack of cohesion and commitment]{.underline}** in Afghanistan, doubts
about NATO sown by NATO leaders, the chaotic pullout from Kabul, the
feckless response to his invasion of Georgia (2008) and annexation of
Crimea (2014), flatfooted confusion over his misinformation campaigns
and cyberattacks, a shortsighted dependency on his regime for energy
supplies, the straitjacket self-restraint in NATO capitals.

Yet **[what Putin has seen in the months since he launched
his]{.underline}** catastrophic and criminal **[invasion]{.underline}**
of Ukraine **[is something he never anticipated]{.underline}**.

For individuals and nations alike, danger on the doorstep has a way of
rearranging priorities and refocusing the mind. That\'s what has
happened among NATO\'s European leaders.

In a stunning 180-degree turn just 72 hours after Putin's attack on
Ukraine, **[German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that his government
would increase defense spending]{.underline}** to 2% of GDP -- something
NATO has been begging Berlin to do since 2006. That amounts to a
near-doubling of Germany's defense budget \-- by next year. Scholz also
unveiled a massive \$112.7 billion modernization and rearmament fund and
announced plans to replace Germany\'s aging fighter-bomber fleet with
F-35s. And since energy security is inextricably tied to national
security, it's worth noting that he unveiled detailed plans to create a
strategic LNG reserve and build new LNG terminals.

"**[The world]{.underline}**," Scholz explained as Putin began his siege
to Ukraine, "**[will no longer be the same as the world
before]{.underline}."**

Berlin's extraordinary about-face was an early indication that other
NATO nations would begin to lift their defense budgets -- and finally
see Putin for what he is, not what they hoped him to be.

**[Defense spending was inching upward in Europe even before Putin's
war, but Germany's transformation that fateful last week of February
heralds a far more dramatic and rapid return to
deterrence]{.underline}** across the 30-member alliance.

**[Poland]{.underline}** -- thrust to the frontlines of Cold War 2.0 by
Putin's invasion -- **[announced that its defense budget will jump to 3%
of GDP next year]{.underline}**. Before the invasion, Poland had planned
to invest 2.5% of GDP into defense. That's a 20% spike in just one year.
Mariusz Blaszczak, Poland's defense minister, says Warsaw is committed
to fielding "one of the strongest armies in NATO.\"

Just days after the invasion, **[French President]{.underline}**
Emmanuel **[Macron revealed that his government would increase defense
spending]{.underline}**, calling it "the price for peace, freedom and
democracy." To his credit, Macron has increased defense spending every
year since 2017.

**[Italian Prime Minister]{.underline}** Mario **[Draghi unveiled plans
to "invest more in defense than we have ever done before]{.underline}**"
and to lift Italy\'s defense budget to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP.

Immediately after Putin launched his war, **[Latvia approved measures
pushing its defense budget to 2.5% of GDP]{.underline}** (up from 2.2%).
That represents a one-year increase of 13%. **[Lithuania is increasing
defense spending. And Estonia's defense minister says the country will
increase defense]{.underline}** spending to accelerate equipment
acquisitions.

Even before Russia's February invasion, the **[Netherlands had increased
defense spending]{.underline}**. The Dutch government is working on an
even bigger defense budget now, with Prime Minister Mark Rutte
declaring, "The Netherlands will spend a lot of extra money on defense."

Norway, which shares land and maritime borders with Russia, is making
immediate emergency investments to- increase the number and tempo of
naval deployments, increase the number of combat exercises, increase
ammunition and fuel stocks, enhance its \"ability to receive allied
reinforcements,\" and \"strengthen the armed forces\' ability to prevent
and stop digital threats.\"

**[Romania is increasing defense spending by 23.7%]{.underline}** for
fiscal 2023.

Thanks to major investments in defense announced in 2020, **[Britain is
already riding its largest wave of defense spending]{.underline}** since
the Cold War's end.

Sweden \-- not yet a NATO member \-- has unveiled a plan to rapidly
increase defense spending from 1.3% of GDP to 2% of GDP.

As of this moment 10 members of the alliance meet NATO'sstandard
2%-of-GDP standard. **[But NATO is headed in the right
direction.]{.underline}** In 2016, just five members met that standard.
And **[several allies are pouring significant sums into the common
defense. Belgium]{.underline}**'s defense budget is 10.9% larger than a
year ago, **[Croatia]{.underline}**'s is up 62.5% and the
**[Greek]{.underline}** defense budget is 49.6% larger.
**[Italy]{.underline}**'s is up 6%, **[Spain]{.underline}**'s 7.7%,
**[Britain]{.underline}**'s 7.5% **[and France]{.underline}**'s 5%.

### AT: INB---Burden Sharing Fails

#### No deterrence impact---burden sharing fails and gets circumvented.

/alundy\]

Regarding Libya and Afghanistan, it would appear as though **[NATO
allies were contributing to a more balanced and fair system of burden
sharing, but this is in fact not the case.]{.underline}** In
Afghanistan, alliance cooperation and burden sharing were on more equal
footing with the initial invocation of Article 5. **[Countries were
attempting to provide military assistance to the operations despite the
limitations their economies and populations imposed upon
them]{.underline}**. However, **[there were only a few countries that
provided enough force in any truly effective sense]{.underline}**. While
major allies such as Canada did indeed provide a great deal for the
alliance in the beginning, **[support tapered off
overtime.]{.underline}** Several other capable countries did not
dedicate as much as they could have, and even when they did, **[their
support provided little strategic significance.]{.underline}** Instead,
**[U.S. forces were providing for the bulk of the operation while its
allies were hampered by inefficient forces]{.underline}** and a
reluctance to give in to U.S. unilateralism. In addition, the restraints
placed on rules of engagement and other factors significantly reduced
the effectiveness of their combat roles. **[This forced the U.S. to pick
up the slack]{.underline}**, as it had done during the Cold War, **[with
its deterrence abilities]{.underline}**. The eventual decline in
alliance involvement **[also indicates support for collective action
theory as allies began to outweigh the costs to the benefits of
participating in combat operations with the U.S]{.underline}**. In
Libya, on the other hand, the U.S. attempted to reduce its role in
combat operations while **[NATO allies shouldered the burden of putting
their forces in potential danger]{.underline}**. While the U.S. was
dedicating its budget to strategic command, its **[allies
were]{.underline}** making up for their lack of defense spending by
**[taking more responsibility through both material and non-material
variables]{.underline}**. The involvement of more subtle factors
completely changes the implications of collective action. However, the
**[statistics indicated that the U.S. was still forced to engage in
taking on a larger share of the burden than it had anticipated or even
wanted]{.underline}**. The **[other allies did in fact break through
domestic constraints by putting their forces in harm's
way]{.underline}**. But Hasebrouck's work showed that such constraints
were not as prominent because Libya was considered an easier operation,
and **[the U.S. still took on a greater role]{.underline}**.
Furthermore, the implications of increased U.S. involvement show in a
concrete way that free riding is occurring. The inability of European
forces to deal with the realities of modern combat **[forced them to
rely on the U.S. even though they were trying to take more of a
leadership role in the operation.]{.underline}**

A pale shadow Yet the **[Europeans would immediately face institutional
hurdles.]{.underline}** Compared with Russia's top-down system, command
and control is hard enough in consensus-bound nato. **[It would be a
bigger challenge for Europeans alone, especially if they did not inherit
nato's command structure. The eu may want to take the lead, but military
thinking is not in its dna.]{.underline}** Besides, an eu-only alliance
would be a pale shadow of nato: after Brexit, non-eu countries will
account for fully 80% of nato defence spending. **[There would be gaps
in capabilities, too. How bad these were would depend on the
mission]{.underline}**, and how many operations were under way at the
same time. The **[European-led interventions in Libya and Mali exposed
dependence on America in vital areas such as air-to-air refuelling and
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.]{.underline}** A detailed
look at the sort of scenarios Europe might face would help to identify
other gaps, and what it would take to fill them. Bastian Giegerich of
the iiss, who is starting to work on such assessments, reckons that
realistically the **[gap-filling could take 15 years]{.underline}** or
so. **[That is a long time for places like Poland and the Baltic
countries that feel under threat. Fear and mistrust could quickly
conspire to make narrow national interests trump efforts to maintain
European unity. Hence a second, perhaps likelier, version of what might
follow an American withdrawal: Europe Divided.]{.underline}** Jonathan
**[Eyal]{.underline}** of the Royal United Services Institute in London
**[imagines a frenzy of activity, a cacophony of summits---and a
renationalisation of defence strategies.]{.underline}** Lots of
countries would seek bilateral deals. In central Europe he would expect
an alliance between Poland and Romania to guarantee the eastern border.
The **[Russians and Chinese]{.underline}** would not sit idly by, he
says, but **[would play their own games with the Greeks, Hungarians and
others. It is these games of mistrust that the American security
guarantee has largely helped to avoid. They could all too easily
resurface.]{.underline}** "**[Establishing a purely European
defence]{.underline}**", warns Michael Rühle, a long-time nato official,
"**[would overwhelm the Europeans politically, financially and
militarily]{.underline}**."

### AT: INB---Burden Sharing Fails---European Disfunction

#### Increased defense spending fails---European disfunction thumps burden sharing effectiveness

**Bergmann 21** \-- Max Bergmann, a senior Fellow at the Center for
American Progress, official at the U.S. State Department from 2011 to
2017. \[The EU Is the Military Ally the United States Needs: Take the
Pressure Off of NATO States and Embrace the Union's Defense, 1-6-21,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2021-01-06/eu-military-ally-united-states-needs\]

**[Insisting]{.underline}** that **[European states hit two percent by
2024 is setting up the alliance to fail. Not only are these
states]{.underline}** **[unlikely to hit the target]{.underline}**, but
**[even if they did, the results would likely be
underwhelming]{.underline}**. The two percent metric is, after all,
arbitrary, as it is not tied to specific defense requirements, and is
moreover subject to broader economic fluctuations. Greece, for instance,
hit two percent only because its GDP contracted so dramatically,
increasing its military's share of the shrinking budget. Indeed,
**[marginal increases in any single country's defense spending won't
automatically help improve the European pillar of NATO, which is plagued
with inefficiencies. EU member states in total spend roughly \$200
billion annually on defense, on a par with China]{.underline}**. But
**[Europe struggles to deploy forces; it runs out of munitions when it
fights; and its forces are seldom prepared to fight]{.underline}**.

**[The problem]{.underline}**, then, **[is not really low spending but
that European defense spending is fragmented, wasteful, and
redundant]{.underline}**. For instance, although Germany is the
strongest economic power in Europe, few of Germany's attack helicopters
are ready for combat. France, by contrast, has a very capable military
engaged in active combat operations in the Sahel. But French forces
depend on U.S. support for those operations. When **[European
states]{.underline}** spend on defense, most of them **[allocate too
little of their budgets to research and development and face stark
tradeoffs between acquiring expensive new technologies
and]{.underline}** simply **[maintaining the forces they
have]{.underline}**. As the European defense analyst Sven Biscop of the
Egmont Institute assesses, **["The status of Europe's armed forces and
their dependence on the US will basically remain unaltered, even if they
all spend 2 percent of their GDP."]{.underline}**

A Collective Concern

U.S. leaders have long viewed the EU as just another complicated,
multilateral bureaucracy. To the extent that it got involved in defense,
Washington imagined, the EU would duplicate and undermine NATO's
function. But the EU has transformed since its founding in 1993,
becoming something much more like a state than a multilateral
organization. Europeans in the EU are EU citizens, subject to EU law,
free to live and work where they please in the union. They have their
own currency, a de facto national language (English), and a federal
government in Brussels.

As the union has drawn together, **[Europeans]{.underline}** have come
to **[perceive defense and foreign policy as more of a collective
concern than a national one]{.underline}**. Support across Europe for EU
defense is extremely high, consistently polling above 70 percent.
**[Within European states]{.underline}**, however, **[there is
considerably less support for diverting national resources away from
domestic priorities, such as health and education, and toward the
high-end weapons systems that are required to marginally improve NATO's
collective defense capacity. The lack of national interest in defense
spending is]{.underline}** therefore **[not a short-term problem for
NATO; it is structural]{.underline}**.

### AT: INB---No Impact---US increase spending

#### Independent of what Europe does, the US will just increase spending for strategic and nuclear dominance.

**Thimm, 18** \[Johannes Thimm, Head of Research Division "The Americas"
at Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, German Institute for International
and Security Affairs, 4-09-2018, 'NATO: US Strategic Dominance and
Unequal Burden-Sharing Are Two Sides of the Same Coin',
<https://www.swp-berlin.org/en/publication/nato-us-strategic-dominance-and-unequal-burden-sharing-are-two-sides-of-the-same-coin>
/alundy\]

US defense policy is made strictly on US terms.

Second, **[the US defense budget does not depend on Europe's military
spending]{.underline}**. It is misleading to argue that **[Europe must
spend more so that the United States can spend less.]{.underline}** The
**[Pentagon's budget is determined by Washington's assessment of the
capabilities necessary to maintain US strategic dominance]{.underline}**
-- on its own, not through any alliance. When **[Congress adopts the
annual defense budget, European expenditures play a marginal
role]{.underline}.** In 2017, President Trump increased the US defense
budget, despite the fact that European states also spent more (and
Russia's spending decreased by 20 percent). According to calculations by
the International Institute for Strategic Studies, **[US spending on
NATO and the defense of Europe amounts to \$30 billion, or just over 5
percent of its defense budget.]{.underline}** Comparing that figure to
the roughly \$240 billion of European spending for NATO, **[the
imbalance no longer seems so great]{.underline}**. Given these numbers,
it is also hard to argue that Europe is principally to blame for a US
defense budget of around \$600 billion.

Looking specifically at the cost of the US nuclear arsenal, it becomes
even clearer **[how detached the US budget is from burden-sharing in
NATO]{.underline}**. Washington defines the US **[nuclear strategy with
little regard for Europe's policy priorities]{.underline}**. Over the
next thirty years (calculated from 2017), Washington plans a massive
qualitative nuclear build-up, spending \$400 billion on modernizing its
nuclear arsenal -- in addition to the costs of maintaining existing
systems. This move was partly a reaction to Russian aggression in
Ukraine, but above all a concession by President Obama to the Republican
Congress in exchange for its approval of the 2014 New START treaty, in
which **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and
Russia pledged to limit numbers of strategic nuclear
warheads.]{.underline}** If Trump were really interested in reducing
costs, he would make serious efforts on arms control. Instead, he
refused Russia's offer to extend the New START treaty beyond its 2021
expiration date and increased spending on nuclear weapons by almost 20
percent. So, yes, to some extent Europe is free-riding on US security
guarantees. But **[the reasons include the US desire for unrivalled
military and nuclear capabilities, and not simply European reluctance to
spend money on defense.]{.underline}**

#### No impact\-\--defense spending is [irrelevant]{.underline}.

Alliances," Harvard University Press//Wompus =)

But it is also reasonable to argue that these **[spending gaps are of
little consequence]{.underline}**. The important question is whether it
is cheaper to have a foreign policy that relies on sustained cooperation
with allies afflicted by moral hazard than to have a unilateral policy
with no burden-sharing at all. On this view, **[as long
as]{.underline}** US defense **[spending does not exceed national means,
it is hardly tragic if allies spend a bit less]{.underline}** as a
proportion of GDP. **[There is no evidence]{.underline}** that
**[American defense spending hampers growth or makes the country less
competitive]{.underline}**. And **[while the defense budget makes up a
sizable chunk of federal spending, a relatively small
portion]{.underline}** of that money **[goes to forward basing. To those
who bemoan burden-sharing gaps, a reasonable rejoinder is]{.underline}**
that **[Washington should ensure]{.underline}** that **[its own budget
commitments are sound in national terms]{.underline}**, rather than
preoccupy itself with false equivalence abroad.7

Finally, when we think about the costs of alliances, we should be
mindful that **[alliance agreements themselves impose no financial
burdens on the US Treasury. What costs money]{.underline}**---and
potentially lives---**[is]{.underline}** the associated **[force
posture. Proposals for cutting US alliance spending are]{.underline}**
usually **[suggestions about curtailing overseas defense presence. This
is not a semantic difference]{.underline}**. It points to an important
reality that many miss when they refer to alliances as extravagant: in
order to generate substantial savings in its own defense budget---that
is, to close the gap between its "allied contribution" ratio and those
of its thriftier partners---the United States would have to close
overseas bases and return the personnel and materiel to the continental
United States. Simply consolidating bases and relying more on rotational
deployments would not generate substantial cost savings.8 Leading
**[scholars]{.underline}** have **[argued for]{.underline}** just this
kind of move---**[ending alliances and shuttering]{.underline}** related
**[bases]{.underline}** to curb commitments and spending. **[Such
dramatic changes would require not just a transformed alliance policy
but a completely different grand strategy]{.underline}**--- one that
does not seek to secure the balance of power in Eurasia through forward
defense, deterrence, and allied assurance and control.

**[In December 2021, the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific
coordinator, Kurt Campbell,
[detailed](https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/conversation-white-house-indo-pacific-coordinator-kurt-campbell)
the shape of U.S. thinking about China and Asia during a conference on
Indo-Pacific security]{.underline}**. He hit all the familiar notes: the
importance of alliances, weapons sales to counter China, the centrality
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the
optimistic view that Sino-U.S. relations could be at once competitive
and stable. In any other era, such talk might have been comfort food for
regional experts and policymakers. **[But absent from Campbell's remarks
at the conference, which was organized by Australia's Lowy Institute,
was any meaningful statement about political economy---the single aspect
of statecraft most crucial to the Indo-Pacific region's stability. It is
in this arena of policy that China has done more to displace the United
States than in any other, and it remains the glaring hole in
Washington's attempts to craft an Indo-Pacific policy]{.underline}**.
When pressed on this by his host, Campbell acknowledged that defense
initiatives were not enough. But he could mention no concept, policy, or
action to suggest economics was anything more than a throwaway gesture
in a speech. Grand references to a forthcoming "economic framework" that
would be "cutting-edge" lacked all specifics and stated no purpose other
than wanting the United States to "design" the region's standards. To
the extent Campbell's remarks reflect Washington's view of Asia, they
are at once modestly reassuring and highly troubling. Reassuring because
Campbell's bland rhetorical restraint is a refreshing departure from the
volatility and pugnaciousness of the Trump administration. **[Troubling,
however, because the ideas powering U.S. President Joe Biden's Asia
policy are as bland as the rhetoric itself.]{.underline}** U.S. policy
toward the world's most important region is no more than a mashup of the
residual inertia from Trump's
[military-first](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-10-19/sleepwalking-world-war-iii)
Asia policy with a revival of then-U.S. President Barack Obama's
well-intentioned but ill-fated "pivot to Asia," which also had a
[heavily
militarized](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/asia/2021-03-12/americas-indo-pacific-folly)
agenda. Consequently, **[the United States is misallocating its
attention and influence relative to what would actually benefit the
region most.]{.underline}** **[Economic policy, not defense policy, is
the only way to address the interrelated problems]{.underline}** of
development, pandemic recovery, and adaptation to climate
change---issues **[that plague policymakers throughout Asia and threaten
to derail the region's peace and prosperity.]{.underline}** Washington
must also stop conflating economic strategy with stale tropes on free
trade and coercive sanctions. **[This is precisely the trouble with U.S.
engagement in Asia to date: The United States has no economic strategy
for the region]{.underline}**---at least not since Obama's ill-fated
attempt to negotiate a new U.S.-Asia trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership. And **[it is unrealistic to expect any economic strategy
beyond the free-trade pabulum so sharply at odds with U.S. domestic
political constraints]{.underline}**.

MIXED MESSAGES But these same polls illustrate that Biden's gains are
limited, if not tenuous. The 2021 ISEAS **[survey showed respondents
believe U.S. economic influence in Southeast Asia has decreased since
Biden took office.]{.underline}** The survey also found almost half of
respondents think China has greater regional political sway than the
United States. The Lowy Asia Power Index may have found that the Biden
administration restored the United States' diplomatic influence, but it
docked Washington more than ten points (from 61.7 to 51.1) on economic
sway. The index also found the **[U.S. military's relative lead over
China shrank in 2021---and that was before Beijing conducted its
alarming hypersonic missile tests. For the United States, both these
challenges will intensify. On the economic front, China is expanding its
financial footprint across the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}** U.S. allies
such as Australia and Japan have privately pledged to help keep Beijing
out of the CPTPP and to hold a place in the trade agreement for
Washington. But the Biden administration has said it has no plan to
return to the CPTPP, and officials in Canberra and Tokyo warn they
cannot hold off China for more than a few years without some positive
signals from the United States. Meanwhile, in addition to trying to join
the CPTPP, China has also asked to join the Digital Economy Partnership
Agreement (DEPA) with Chile, New Zealand, and Singapore---yet another
economic group with no U.S. seat at the table. The Biden administration
has promised "the development of an Indo-Pacific economic framework"
focused on a patchwork of issues---trade facilitation, digital trade,
supply chain resiliency, clean energy, infrastructure, and worker
standards. **[But at best, the United States' closest Asian partners see
the framework as a save-the-date card for what they hope will be the day
when Washington decides to join the CPTPP or a comparable agreement. The
announcement on January 21 of a new U.S.-Japanese economic dialogue
helps, but most Asian policymakers and business leaders view the
vagueness of the Indo-Pacific economic framework as indicative of a lack
of focus and commitment to deep economic engagement.]{.underline}** The
relative strength of the U.S. economy continues to drive the region's
investment and trade with the United States, but as things stand,
**[Washington is losing influence over the rules that will govern trade,
investment, supply chains, and ultimately, geopolitics in
Asia]{.underline}**. **[The administration has no long-term economic
strategy toward Beijing. The United States' vague economic policies
extend to its goals with Beijing.]{.underline}** The Biden
administration has rightly sought to limit sensitive technology
transfers---particularly of semiconductor- and [artificial
intelligence](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-12-05/artificial-intelligence-and-chinese-power)-related
technology---to China. But the administration has no long-term economic
strategy toward Beijing beyond seeking more Chinese agricultural and
energy exports under the 2020 Phase One trade deal negotiated by the
Trump administration to end the trade war the White House started in
2018. U.S. businesses cannot get a clear answer about whether the
administration will promote trade and investment with China in
non-sensitive sectors, such as retail and automobiles. (Washington
originally championed the TPP to gain leverage in economic negotiations
with China, but this tool is now missing.) U.S. defense policy faces
different but equally formidable challenges. The Biden administration
has clearly made gains at [deterring
China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-02-05/kevin-rudd-usa-chinese-confrontation-short-of-war)
by strengthening its alliances, but it has been less purposeful about
the types of military capabilities it deploys in Asia---and where it
puts them. **[The Defense Department's signature Global Posture Review
resulted in almost no significant additions to U.S. military forces in
the Indo-Pacific beyond what the Trump White House already had planned.
The administration and Congress have failed to properly fund the new
Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), legislation that was designed to
improve the composition of the military's funding for much needed
capabilities in the Indo-Pacific theater]{.underline}**. Although many
experts expect Congress to increase defense spending next year, **[the
crisis in Ukraine could drain resources to the continuing detriment of
the Indo-Pacific theater]{.underline}**.

#### U.S Asia Pivot Signals European Weakness

**Erlanger '21** (Steven Erlanger, Chief Diplomat correspondent in
Europe for the NY Times, "The Sharp U.S. Pivot to Asia Is Throwing
Europe Off Balance"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/world/europe/biden-china-europe-submarine-deal.html>)
//sethlee

BRUSSELS --- Until this week, **[the so-called "pivot to Asia" by the
United States had been more of a threat]{.underline}** than a reality
**[for Europe.]{.underline}** But that changed when the Biden
administration announced a new defense alliance against China that has
left Europe facing an implicit question:

Which side are you on? It is a question that European leaders have
studiously sought to avoid since [former President Barack
Obama](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/us/obama-presidential-center-chicago.html)
first articulated that America should ["pivot" resources and attention
to
Asia](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/09/world/asia/obama-laos-asia-asean-tour.html)
as part of its rivalry with China. **[European leaders hoped that the
relationship between the two superpowers could remain stable and that
Europe could balance its interests between the two. Then the Trump
administration sharply raised the temperature with China with tariffs
and other trade barriers. And now the Biden administration on Wednesday
announced an alliance between the United States, Britain and Australia
that would help
[Australia](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/us-france-australia-betrayal.html)
deploy nuclear-powered submarines in the Pacific ---]{.underline}** and,
in doing so, also tore up [a \$66 billion
deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/world/europe/france-australia-uk-us-submarines.html)
for Australia to buy a French fleet of diesel-powered subs. "Europeans
want to defer the moment of truth, to not make a choice between the
two," said Thomas Gomart, director of the French Institute of
International Relations, or IFRI. "The Biden administration, like the
Trump one, is provoking the moment of choice." [France was
enraged](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/world/europe/france-australia-uk-us-submarines.html).
Yet if it was a humiliation --- as well as the cancellation of a
lucrative defense deal --- it possibly did have a silver lining for
[France](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/us-france-australia-betrayal.html)'s
broader goals. President Emmanuel Macron of France has been Europe's
loudest proponent of "strategic autonomy," the idea that Europe needs to
retain a balanced approach to the United States and China. "We must
survive on our own, as others do," said Josep Borrell Fontelles, the
European Union's foreign policy chief, echoing the French line. The
French embarrassment --- the Americans also announced the submarine deal
[with little if any
warning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/16/us/politics/france-us-biden-australia-submarine.html)
--- came after the disastrous fall of Afghanistan. **[European allies
were furious with]{.underline}** the **[Biden]{.underline}**
administration, blaming the Americans for acting with little or no
consultation and feeding Mr. Macron's argument that the United States is
no longer an entirely reliable security partner. "The submarines and
Afghanistan, it reinforces the French narrative that you can't trust the
Americans," said Ulrich Speck of the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. But
whether France will succeed in turning this bilateral defeat into a way
to promote strategic autonomy is doubtful, analysts suggest. "Many
Europeans will see this as a transparent way for the French to leverage
their own interests," said Robin Niblett, director of Chatham House, the
London-based research institution. **[Even so, there seems little doubt
that Europe's balancing act is becoming trickier to
maintain.]{.underline}** "Europe needs to think hard about where it sits
and what it does," said Rosa Balfour, director of Carnegie Europe. **[A
Europe that spends more on defense is to be desired, but it also needs
allies]{.underline}** --- **[including]{.underline}** Britain and **[the
United States,]{.underline}** she said. And a Europe that does more to
build its own security capacity "is the best way to be listened to more
by its partners," she added. The new alliance, known as AUKUS, is an
effort to integrate Australia and Britain into the broader American
effort to create a security deterrent to China. For Australia, which has
seen its once-strong relations with Beijing deteriorate, America and
Britain provide a much stouter deterrent to China in the Indo-Pacific,
analysts agree, than could the deal with France. "It's sending a very
big signal to Beijing, which is useful for the U.S., but especially
useful to Australia," said Ian Lesser, acting director of the German
Marshall Fund and head of its Brussels office. "And the weight of that
signal is important because of who the partners are." Mr. Lesser also
questioned why the American moves in the Pacific have to be interpreted
as a zero-sum equation in which Europe's importance is diminished. "I
don't see any diminution of American interest and commitment to European
security in the wake of Afghanistan or the moves in Asia," he said. The
biggest issue for the European Union may be finding the political will
for strategic autonomy, a point made by the president of the European
Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in her [state of the European Union
address](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/strategic-planning/state-union-addresses/state-union-2021_en)
earlier on the day the new Asian alliance was announced. France may be
pushing autonomy, but whether the rest of the European bloc has an
appetite for it --- and for creating greater distance from Washington
--- is uncertain. "France could end up isolating itself," said Mr. Speck
of the German Marshall Fund, noting that in nearly every region where
France has security concerns --- including Russia, the Sahel and even
the Indo-Pacific --- the United States continues to be a critical
partner. **[There are deeper questions about America's future
reliability as a security partner, especially if the conflict with China
turns kinetic,]{.underline}** which is part of Mr. Macron's argument,
Mr. Lesser acknowledged. **["For all the U.S. commitment to Europe, if
things go wrong in the Indo-Pacific, that would change the force
structure in Europe pretty fast."]{.underline}** In Poland, a strong
American ally in the European Union and NATO, the reaction to the new
alliance was more positive, focusing not on a pivot away from Europe
"but on the U.S., with the British and the Australians, getting serious
about China and also defending the free world," said Michal Baranowski,
who heads the German Marshall Fund office in Poland. At the same time,
he said, Poles see another case where the supposedly professional,
pro-European Biden administration "again doesn't consult and shoves
European allies under the bus," he said. "This time the French, but for
us, it was Nord Stream 2, when we were thrown under the bus for
Germany," he said. That was a reference to Mr. Biden's decision to allow
the completion of a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany,
bypassing Ukraine and Poland, that was a priority for European
powerhouse Berlin. "**[The U.S. will say again that 'We're building
strong alliances]{.underline}**, with Germany and Australia,'" Mr.
Baranowski said. **["But who suffers? Other allies."]{.underline}**

### AT: INB---Populism Turn---2AC 

#### European Defense spending causes populism spread

**Fay 17**, Director of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies @ Niskan
(Matthew, also cites Andrea Gilli, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford
University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, "THE
PROBLEM WITH EUROPE PAYING ITS DEFENSE BILLS," *Niskan Center*,
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/problem-europe-paying-defense-bills/>)

The European Union is also unlikely to force member states into a
cooperation arrangement, according to Gilli. Given the rise of
nationalist populist parties across Europe, any such assertion of power
from Brussels will likely create a greater backlash. The two reasons
Gilli notes for the inability of European states to increase defense
spending also raise another question: should the United States want
European states to do so? Writing at the end of the Cold War, political
scientist John **[Mearsheimer warned that a Europe free from superpower
domination would return to its recurrent patterns of interstate warfare.
Europe's major states would be forced to pay for their own defense
absent American and Soviet security guarantees. To convince domestic
populations to support investment in military capabilities---likely at
the expense of welfare spending---state leaders would likely lean on
nationalist rhetoric and policies.]{.underline}** According to
Mearsheimer, **[the reason they have not had to do so was because the
American "pacifier" has remained]{.underline}** in place even after the
superpower standoff in Europe ended. An **[American withdrawal as an
effort to induce greater defense spending in Europe might lead to the
empowerment of the very nationalist populist parties that would like to
see the European Union dismantled. The disintegration of
Europe---coupled with increased spending on military capabilities by its
largest states]{.underline}**---**[could lead to the return of security
competition and the dilemmas inherent in it.]{.underline}** Meanwhile,
**[smaller states---Estonia just being one
example]{.underline}**---**[unable to invest sufficiently
in]{.underline}** their own **[defense will be subject to manipulation
and domination]{.underline}** by the continent's major powers. So the
question of **[whether the Trump administration should consider
withholding defense]{.underline}** of America's European **[to encourage
them to "pay their bills" hinges on]{.underline}** two things:
**[whether they can, and if so, whether doing so is worth potentially
undermining the peaceful integration of Europe]{.underline}**.

#### Populism [structurally guarantees]{.underline} more conflict and heightens escalation risks

**Drezner 17**, PhD, Professor of Int'l Politics (Dan,
"**[The]{.underline}** Angry **[Populist]{.underline}** as Foreign
Policy Leader: Real Change or Just Hot Air?, *41 Fletcher F. World Aff.

'

**[Leaders who rise to power in lower-probability scenarios
are]{.underline}** also **[likely to have a greater appetite for risk in
foreign affairs]{.underline}**. This matters, as Jeff Colgan notes:
\"risk tolerance leads to aggression in international affairs because it
increases the perceived payoff of risky gambles.\" 17 **[Populist
leaders more closely resemble revolutionaries than more established
politicians]{.underline}**. **[And]{.underline}** as Colgan warns,
\"**[the ambition]{.underline}** of revolutionary leaders also
**[contributes to aggression]{.underline}**. **[Ambition makes it more
likely that a leader will reject the status quo internationally as well
as domestically]{.underline}**.\" 18 **[We can see this kind of ambition
on display among elected populists]{.underline}**. Hugo Chávez \[\*30\]
persistently proposed radical alternatives to the Washington Consensus.
One longtime friend of Viktor Orbán noted, \"he has always wanted to
upset the status quo, to become a change-maker.\" 19 Orbán himself, in a
meeting with Polish Law and Justice Party head Jaroslaw Kaczynski,
proposed a \"cultural counter-revolution\" in Europe. 20 Donald Trump\'s
inaugural address categorically rejected the postwar liberal order,
arguing in favor of an \"America First\" approach to international
relations. **[Populists are therefore more likely to pursue high-risk,
revisionist foreign policies]{.underline}**. **[Populist
leaders]{.underline}** also care about recognition by others, and
**[will be quick to anger]{.underline}** if that recognition is not
forthcoming. Populists build their legitimacy on their support from
\"their\" people, but part of that support comes from displays of
dominance over others. Russian president Vladimir Putin is well-known
for his over-the-top efforts to look strong and powerful. These range
from his shirtless photos to videos of him weightlifting to scoring
eight goals in an exhibition game with former NHL All-Stars. 21 In
Erdogan\'s first two years as Turkey\'s president, the government has
prosecuted more than 1,800 cases of Turkish citizens insulting
him\--including a former Miss Turkey. 22 Donald Trump has insulted
anyone who has criticized him since he started running for president,
ranging from erstwhile GOP rivals to federal judges to media outlets to
a former Miss Universe to Meryl Streep. When dealing with domestic
rivals and critics, such displays of dominance are an easy strategy for
elected leaders to pursue. Populist leaders engage in such behavior to
project their strength and mastery over the political fates. It is
tricky to do this on the international stage, however. **[Populist
leaders will]{.underline}** therefore **[be more concerned than most
politicians about]{.underline}** the personal **[respect]{.underline}**
afforded to them by others. At the international level, this leads to
one of two outcomes: recognition by other heads of state, or a
denunciation of leaders who fail to confer such recognition. If
**[populists]{.underline}** cannot exploit the respect conferred by
others, they **[will be quick to reject and delegitimize the leaders who
spurn them]{.underline}**. We can see this kind of pattern at work in
how populist leaders have reacted to setbacks on the global stage.
Vladimir Putin began his tenure in office with a much warmer attitude
towards the West. During the first decade of this century, however,
Putin lost an ally during Ukraine\'s Orange Revolution, and witnessed
NATO expanding to Russia\'s borders. It was at this point that Putin
began adopting a more hostile attitude towards the West. After President
Obama cancelled a meeting with Duterte, the Filipino president responded
with a series of tirades insulting the American president. 23 In
Trump\'s first week as president, he faced pushback from the \[\*31\]
Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto on his policies for the southern
border. In response, Trump tweeted that Peña Nieto should not bother
coming to Washington. The Mexican president responded by canceling his
visit. Populists do not possess a monopoly on anger in politics, but
most populists tend to project anger as part of their leadership style.
Based on their pathway to power and their philosophy of governance, it
should not be surprising that they are commonly associated with that
emotion. As previously noted, populist parties do particularly well
after financial crises. They are adept at exploiting the (often
justified) anger that voters possess towards authorities that were in
charge when the crisis happened. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage warned
of \"political anger\" if the United Kingdom did not follow through on
Brexit. In a press conference blasting the United States, Duterte said,
\"If you Americans are angry with me, then I am also angry with you.\"
24 During one of the GOP primary debates, Donald Trump explicitly
stated, \"I will gladly accept the mantle of anger.\" Trump famously
refuses to apologize when he makes controversial or problematic
statements. 25 Numerous press reports suggest that Trump lost his temper
with the Australian prime minister in their first phone conversation.
**[This wave of populist anger reverses a centuries-long western effort
to contain that emotion in international relations]{.underline}**. 26
Recent scholarship on emotions in world politics suggest that
**[sustained levels of anger carry risks in world
politics.]{.underline}** Anger was valorized in societies with strong
honor cultures and warrior castes, biologically conditioning citizens
towards that feeling. Furthermore, as Neta Crawford notes, \"**[threats
that evoke anger]{.underline}** (if they are associated with perceived
insults) tend to **[decrease the perception of a threat and
simultaneously heighten risk-taking behaviors on the part of those who
feel angry]{.underline}**.\" 27 This is particularly true if populist
leaders find ways to institutionalize anger and resentment through new
laws, executive orders, or bureaucratic structures. **[This tendency
towards angry rhetoric can be exaggerated through misperception and
mistranslation]{.underline}**. Conventional foreign policy leaders are
prepped to stay within the lanes of \"accepted\" diplomatic discourse,
so that observers can detect subtle shifts in phrasing as a foreign
policy signal. In contrast, populists scorn diplomatic language as
exercises in sophistry and hypocrisy. They rely on language designed to
appeal to their base, which increases the likelihood that outside
observers misconstrue their words. **[Angry tirades from
leaders]{.underline}** like Trump, Duterte, or Iran\'s Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad have been mistranslated\--and usually in a direction that
\[\*32\] **[paints the leader as more bellicose than
intended]{.underline}**. 28 **[Populist leaders will be reluctant to
correct such misperceptions]{.underline}**, because that would require
them to engage in the diplomatic discourse they have derided. Displays
of righteous indignation might play well with a populist leader\'s
domestic base. The international effect of angry outbursts, however, is
to narrow the zone of cooperation between countries. If a leader
unleashes an angry tirade against another country, that is sure to gain
considerable public attention in both nations. This automatically raises
the \"audience costs\" for both leaders. The larger the audience that is
paying attention to any dispute, the greater the political costs a
leader can suffer if they back down in that dispute. 29 Displays of
temper make it harder for the populist to compromise, but it will also
make it more politically difficult for the object of the tirade to make
any concessions. Through effects on leaders and populations,
**[provocations make negotiations more costly and conflict escalation
more likely]{.underline}**. 30 Perhaps the most important intellectual
trait that populist leaders share is their tendency to think like
hedgehogs. According to the classical Greek poet Archilochus, \"a fox
knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing.\" Isaiah Berlin
popularized that quote, arguing that intellectuals could be divided into
foxes and hedgehogs. This works for decision-makers as well. Foxes will
possess the necessary metacognition to adapt to new facts and new
circumstances; hedgehogs will rely on their core beliefs, fitting the
world into their preexisting worldview. 31 Populists are hedgehogs: the
one big thing that they know is to reject the elites and technocrats who
heretofore governed their country. As Philip Tetlock observed more than
a decade ago, foxes and hedgehogs have different strengths when it comes
to thinking about the world. 32 Foxes are much better than hedgehogs in
their predictive accuracy about world events; simply put, foxes are
better at incorporating new information and updating how they think
about the world. Hedgehogs are better than foxes at anticipating big and
unexpected events happening in the world, such as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the 2008 financial crisis.
Anticipating those events requires an assuredness about the way the
world works that hedgehogs are more likely to possess. The effects of
these different intellectual styles on foreign policy are
straightforward. As hedgehogs, **[populists are more likely to have
their expectations confounded in world politics]{.underline}**. At the
same time, **[populist foreign policy leaders will face psychological
and domestic political barriers to admitting error or reversing a
failing policy]{.underline}**. Any public recognition of a misstep
demonstrates a leader\'s fallibility\--which is problematic for leaders
\[\*33\] who claim that they can divine the general will of the people.
At the same time, as hedgehogs, populists will be reluctant to take any
action that deviates from the way that they think the world works.
Stepping back, we can proffer some tentative predictions of how populist
foreign policy leaders will behave in the coming years. **[Populist
foreign policy leaders are likely to reject the pre-existing liberal
international order and espouse]{.underline}** a strong form of
**[ethnic nationalism]{.underline}**. They might try to create
alternative international arrangements to the status quo, but these
efforts are likely to be Potemkin efforts, with more pomp and
circumstance than substance. **[Populist leaders will have greater
appetites for risk and ambition on the global stage]{.underline}**.
These heads of state will crave recognition from their fellow world
leaders, and be quick to anger if they are spurned in this area. These
displays of anger could become institutionalized and will increase the
audience costs of all the involved actors, making cooperation less
likely. And **[populists are less likely to correctly perceive how the
world works]{.underline}**, and more likely to hold firm with policies
that are not viewed as working terribly well. **[One disturbing
conclusion to draw from this particular constellation of traits is that
populist leaders are more likely to foment international
crises]{.underline}**. **[Breaking with pre-existing global governance
structures can guarantee a crisis escalation]{.underline}**. **[An
international crisis can trigger rally-round-the flag
effects]{.underline}** within the domestic population and make it easier
for a leader to suppress domestic dissent. At the extreme, **[one could
envision populists threatening or launching diversionary wars to appeal
to a nationalist base in times of trouble]{.underline}**. Vladimir Putin
employed this tactic. In early 2014, he was still reeling from protests
over his return to the Russian presidency, and a slowdown in the Russian
economy. He responded by annexing the Crimea after the fall of his ally
in Ukraine, and bankrolling a secessionist conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
These efforts caused his public support to skyrocket even though the
Russian economy contracted in 2014 and 2015. It should be stressed that
these are all probabilistic statements. Many of these traits are hardly
unique to populists; other heads of state are likely to display some
subset of these leadership traits. Still, **[this combination
of]{.underline}** \[\*34\] **[attributes suggest that the world is
experiencing an increase in the number of revisionist, risky, and
violent actions in world politics.]{.underline}**

### AT: INB---Populism Turn---Burden Sharing Causes Populsim

#### More military spending [directly contributes]{.underline} to populism across Europe by undermining the [political power]{.underline} of centrist and establishment parties

Edoardo **Saravalle 17**, a Researcher at the Center for a New American
Security, "NATO Funding Frustration Could Cause Friction in Europe",
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-funding-frustration-could-cause-friction-europe-20216

Second, **[increased burden sharing may]{.underline}** actively **[hurt
the cause of EU stability]{.underline}**. **[Military buildup in
Europe]{.underline}** **[would]{.underline}** **[sap the political
capital]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[limit the nondefense

**[establishment]{.underline}** pro-American **[leaders]{.underline}**
**[confronting the gravest threat to the EU and U.S. power on the
continent, the insurgent populist movement.]{.underline}**

**[Many EU countries are in a cycle of elections that could be decisive
for the future of Europe and the West]{.underline}**. **[Dissatisfaction
over lackluster economic prospects and opposition to immigration have
powered anti-EU and anti-NATO parties]{.underline}** like Marine Le
Pen's National Front **[and placed electoral victories within their
grasp.]{.underline}** Brexit proved that **[EU integration is neither
inevitable nor irreversible]{.underline}**. **[Now]{.underline}**,
**[populist parties are trying to follow the example]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[reshape Europe in a more nationalistic
vision.]{.underline}**

**[The example of Italy shows the potential dangers of prioritizing
military spending.]{.underline}** **[The country currently spends [1.1.
percent of its
GDP](http://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2017_03/20170313_170313-pr2017-045.pdf) on

a caretaker government following Matteo Renzi's resignation. **[Spending
toward the NATO target would divert resources and embolden the populist
parties opposing the government]{.underline}**. **[This budgetary
trade-off suggests the fundamental calculation of burden

contribution, the United States will choose the former. The 1.1 percent
of GDP military spending under Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni of
the Democratic Party will always be preferable to 2 percent under Beppe
Grillo's Five Star Movement.

#### Some examples of specific parties

**Fay 17** - Director of Defense and Foreign Policy Studies @ Niskan
(Matthew, "THE PROBLEM WITH EUROPE PAYING ITS DEFENSE BILLS," *Niskan
Center*,
<https://niskanencenter.org/blog/problem-europe-paying-defense-bills/>)

Writing at the Washington Post's "Monkey Cage" blog, Andrea **[Gilli---a
postdoctoral fellow at Stanford]{.underline}** University's Center for
International Security and Cooperation---**[identifies some of the
domestic barriers to European states investing in their militaries.
Gilli names]{.underline}** three main **[constraints]{.underline}** on
the ability of European states to balance, but two of them are
particularly important. **[The first is the inability of many European
states to contribute financially to their own defense. Some European
states simply do not have large enough economies to adequately invest in
military capabilities]{.underline}**. Gilli notes that Estonia is one of
the few European countries to meet the minimum standard of defense
spending for NATO member states---two percent of gross domestic
product---but that still only amounts to \$500 million in defense
expenditure. **[Larger states have greater financial resources to
invest, but they are tied up in welfare programs]{.underline}**. As
Gilli writes, **[\[C\]utting welfare state provisions in Europe to fund
defense expenditures is going to be extremely difficult, if not
counterproductive]{.underline}**. On the one hand, **[those who receive
these benefits are far more numerous, and thus politically more
influential, than those receiving a direct benefit from military
spending]{.underline}**. On the other, **[cuts in welfare spending risk
actually bringing additional support to anti-establishment parties like
the Five Stars Movement in Italy, Die Linke in Germany or Podemos in
Spain --- all of which have strong anti-defense stances]{.underline}**.
It is possible European states could combine their military
capabilities, but as Gilli argues, that option is also problematic. He
notes, **[With Europe's limited funds to spend on defense, large
cooperative projects will be difficult to launch]{.underline}**. In the
past, countries in Europe abandoned cooperative projects because of
their negative domestic implications for jobs, technological know-how or
military exports. **[In an age of austerity, amid a refugee crisis and
high youth unemployment, this mind-set is unlikely to change anytime
soon]{.underline}**. And **[some countries may have little interest in
cooperation.]{.underline}** **[They may operate in completely different
environments --- Mediterranean vs. North Sea, for example. Or they
perceive a different strategic threat at home]{.underline}** --- think
Russia vs. the Islamic State. **[Some countries may even have a
strategic interest in leaving unaddressed some capability gaps --- to
compel proximate allies to come to their defense]{.underline}**. This
was Finland's military strategy during the Cold War.

#### Increased defense spending mobilizes populist voters

**Henke 21** \[Marina Henke; 17/2/21; Professor of International
Relations at the Hertie School and Northwestern University, focuses on
military interventions, peacekeeping, and European security and defense
policy; "The populist challenge to European defense";
<https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/13501763.2021.1881587>\]

**[Right-wing populist parties in the EU are broadly
nationalist]{.underline}**, sovereignist, and Euroskeptic (Mudde, 2007;
Vasilopoulou, 2018). But while these **[parties sharply oppose
supranationalism and the EU\'s broader integrative
trajectory,]{.underline}** it is less clear whether their anti-EU
sentiment extends to other forms of institutionalized cooperation, and
in particular to coordination or collaboration with other EU member
states on defense.12 We argue that **[populist parties are likely to
constrain European defense cooperation]{.underline}** under the
following two conditions: First, **[populist parties hold strong
anti-EU, anti-globalization, and anti-establishment sentiment and a more
general skepticism over the merits of international
cooperation.]{.underline}** If these preferences are given clear
precedence over national security interests or concerns, **[we are
unlikely to see these parties engage in defense
cooperation]{.underline}**. This form of **[populist challenge to
European defense cooperation may come from either right-wing or
left-wing parties.]{.underline}** While left-wing populist parties
highlight economic anxieties and grievances, right-wing populist parties
**[emphasize threats to national identity, culture, and
sovereignty]{.underline}** (De Vries & Edwards, 2009). They also often
mix populism with nationalism (Camus & Lebourg, 2017). These nationalist
sentiments are likely to stoke intra-EU divisions and constrain defense
cooperation. Second, [European defense is presented as an issue that
populist parties may use **to mobilize the mass public, polarize the
electorate, and win votes.**]{.underline} In other words, populist
parties **[politicize European defense issues for electoral
purposes.]{.underline}** According to De Vries et al. (2021), **[two key
elements lead to the politicization of international cooperation: public
discontent about existing forms of international cooperation and the
mobilization of this discontent by political
entrepreneurs.]{.underline}** Since most mainstream parties have not
politicized European defense cooperation, **[populist parties may
perceive an incentive and opportunity to mobilize opposition on this
issue to attract new voters,]{.underline}** and often in tandem with
anti-immigrant and nationalist messages (Hobolt & De Vries, 2015).

### AT: INB---Populism Turn---Populism Low

#### Opposition parties are uniting to remove populist leaders.

**Meyer '22** \[Brett; 6 Jan; Research Fellow; Tony Blair Institute for
Global Change, "A Playbook Against Populism? Populist Leadership in
Decline in 2021,"
https://institute.global/policy/playbook-against-populism-populist-leadership-decline-2021\]

In our annual update to our Populists in Power database, **[we find that
the number of populist leaders in power at the beginning of 2022 is down
from 17 at the beginning of 2021 to 13 -- the lowest since
2004]{.underline}**. Three of the four populist leaders who lost power
were less ideological anti-establishment populists, meaning that the
remaining populists are almost all culturally right wing.

**[Two common factors appear to have contributed to this significant
fall]{.underline}** in the number of populist leaders. First, **[the
pandemic may have reminded the public of the importance of seriousness
and expertise in policymaking]{.underline}**. **[Countries with populist
leaders around the world had higher Covid-19 case and death rates than
those without populist leaders, and populist leaders in Europe have seen
a sustained dip in their polling popularity relative to more
conventional parties]{.underline}** throughout the pandemic.

Second, **[unusually broad opposition coalitions have emerged to depose
populist incumbents. Historically divided opposition parties adopted a
narrow focus in their election campaigns to remove the populist
leader]{.underline}**. This happened in three out of four populist
losses in 2021. **[We also see evidence of opposition parties following
this "playbook" in countries where populist leaders are facing elections
in 2022.]{.underline}**

The danger posed by populism lies in the damage leaders can do to the
norms and institutions of liberal democracy. However, we find that,
**[in most of the cases where populist leaders lost power last year,
there is limited evidence that key norms such as a free press, an
independent judiciary and the peaceful transfer of power have been
obviously weakened]{.underline}**. That said, elections in the coming
years in countries where populist governments have invoked more radical
reform to entrench their positions give less cause for optimism.

Finally, if the formation of broad coalitions provides an emerging
playbook for fighting populism, it's important to examine how stable
these coalitions are once in power. The danger is that, because the
opposition parties have such substantive policy disagreements, they will
prove unable to hold power for long, potentially threatening a reversal.
To avoid instability, these coalitions should focus on a limited
programme of reforms targeted at shoring up institutions against future
populist threats.

The experience of the past four years shows that **[countries with
populist leaders aren't sentenced to autocracy]{.underline}**. But while
**[the wave of early 21st-century populism appears to have
peaked]{.underline}**, it will be some time before we can conclude that
liberal democracy is no longer under threat.

### AT: INB---Econ Turn---Kills Growth

#### Military spending [decks]{.underline} economic growth.

spending stifle economic growth? The empirical evidence from non-OECD

Undeniably, **[peace and long-term sustainable economic development are
the prime agenda of all countries.]{.underline}** This study aims to
empirically evaluate the impact of military spending on economic growth
for a panel of 35 non-OECD countries over 1988--2019. A multivariate
regression model based on the augmented production function is used to
achieve the objective of the study. The panel autoregressive distributed
lag (ARDL)/pooled mean group (PMG) technique is employed, while, in
addition the robust least squares and fixed-effect estimators are
implemented for the robustness of the results. **[This study found a
clear negative effect of military spending on economic
growth.]{.underline}** The pairwise Dumitrescu Hurlin panel causality
test results exhibit bi-directional causality between military expenses
and economic growth. Overall, these **[estimates provide strong support
that military expenditure is not beneficial rather detrimental to
economic growth.]{.underline}** **[The empirical findings of this study
suggest that policymakers need to redesign the military budget to
stimulate economic growth and improve social welfare.]{.underline}**

The assessment of the economic and social effects of military
expenditure remains an interesting desirable area of research. The
ultimate objectives of underdeveloped and developed countries are to
achieve sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the long-run.
There is a substantial volume of literature about the economic
consequences of military expenditure; however, no consensus has been
developed, whether military spending is beneficial or detrimental to
economic growth. Military spending according to the Keynesian approach
is a component of government consumption, which stimulates economic
growth by expanding demand for goods and services. Military spending
affects economic growth through many channels. When aggregate demand is
lower relative to prospective supply, rises in military spending tend to
enlarge capacity utilization, raise profits, and consequently, enhance
investment and aggregate output ([Faini et al.,
1984](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib33)).
Several prior studies have drawn findings that support the Keynesian
military view of the positive influence of military expenditure on
national output ([Benoit,
1978](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib17); [Khalid
and Noor,
2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib45); [Raju
and Ahmed,
2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib63)). In
a study conducted by [Lobont et al.
(2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib51), it
is ascertained that military spending has several positive effects on
capital, labor, growth, and the effectual use of available resources in
the economy as a whole.

The focus of academicians, researchers, and developmental economists for
peace economics are useable as military spending is one of the main
concerns of countries, regardless of their development status. According
to conventional logic, **[the military formulation is an economic
encumbrance]{.underline}**. **[While comparatively more resources are
devoted to military formulations, and lesser proportion is left for
investment in the education and technology sectors, which play a vital
role in the economic growth process and provide a broader base for
socio-economic development]{.underline}**. Generally, it is believed
that in the insecure region, **[each country deliberately allocates an
uneven share of its meager economic resources to "unproductive" military
expenditure]{.underline}**. In the absenteeism of international
collaboration to minimize political pressure, military expenditures can
be driven more and more across a region as each country goes beyond its
neighbors to safeguard its security, raise the level of regional
military expenditure and bring little rise or even a decline in the
security of all. However**[, there are two direct and interconnected
ways by which higher military expenditure may unfavorably affect
long-run economic growth]{.underline}**. First, **[military spending
upsurge may diminish the total accumulation of existing resources
available for other domestic usages such as investment in prolific
capital, education, and market-oriented technological
enhancement]{.underline}**. Second, **[high military expenditure can
intensify misrepresentations that condense the efficiency of resource
distribution]{.underline}**, thereby **[diminishing the total yield
factor]{.underline}**2.

Military expenditure tends to attenuate productivity because more funds
diversion to **[military expenditure causes the government to either
increase taxes or get loans from the foreign capital market to balance
its budget]{.underline}**. The second alternative **[is therefore
primarily harmful to economic prosperity]{.underline}**, since **[it
escalates the rate of interest, decreases investment and consumer
demand, and drives economic growth sluggish]{.underline}** (Russett,
1969; Borch and Wallace, 2010). In a similar vein, some other studies
including Lim (1983) noted that **[military expenses are harmful to the
growth of any economy.]{.underline}** Even, a study by Dunne (2000)
focusing on the Keynesian framework reveals that military spending has
no influence on growth at best, but most **[probably has an inverse
effect]{.underline}**; obviously, **[there is no indication of a
positive influence of military burden on economic growth]{.underline}**.
This implies that disarmament certainly offers a prospect for augmented
economic performance.

Despite the voluminous empirical studies on the military-growth
connection, the empirical findings are still inconclusive6. The
discussion in the present literature on the influence of military
spending opened with the seminal work of Benoit (1978) which opined that
military spending and growth have a positive correlation. Afterward,
many studies are continuously performed to empirically verify the
relationship between these variables by using different models,
estimation techniques, set of countries, and data period. Several other
studies support the positive effect of defense spending including
Atesoglu (2002), who observed that there exists a significantly positive
association in military outlays and aggregate output in the case of the
United States from 1947:2--2000:2. The empirical analysis of the study
by Yildirim et al. (2005) found that military spending boosts national
income in the Middle Eastern countries and Turkey over 1989--99. Narayan
and Singh (2007) empirically verified that defense expenses Granger
causes exports, and exports Granger causes national income (GDP),
indicating that defense spending indirectly Granger causes national
income in the short-run for Fiji over 1970--01. According to Borch and
Wallace (2010), higher levels of military expenditure are better
prepared to stave off the harmful influences of an economic slump than
states with lower levels of military spending in the 49 U.S. states
during 1977--04. Malizard (2010) observed two-way causality between
military spending and growth in France during 1960--08. Findings of
Farzanegan (2014) study supported the positive impact of the military
outlay on growth in Iran during 1959--07. Khalid and Noor (2018)
concluded that military spending has a positive relationship with growth
in sixty-seven developing economies during 2002--10.

On the other hand, some **[prior studies]{.underline}**, for
example, [Faini et al.
(1984)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib33) **[detected
that a greater military burden is related to sluggish
growth]{.underline}** for 69 countries during 1952--70, whereas **[a
rise of 10% military spending leads to a decrease of annual economic
growth by 0.13%]{.underline}**. [Deger
(1986)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib23) revealed
that overall the direct and indirect effects of military expenditure
will dampen growth rate and impede development in a panel of 50
developing economies during 1965--73. The author suggested that
empirical indication goes against the conclusions of Benoit and others
about the positive impact of military outlay on growth in less-developed
economies. [[Abu-Bader and Abu-Qarm
(2003)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib2)** found
that military expenditure hampers economic growth, but civilian expenses
have a positive impact on growth for Egypt, Israel, and
Syria**]{.underline} (1975--98), (1967--98), and (1973--98)
respectively. **[The empirical findings]{.underline}** of [Klein
(2004)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib46) **[reveal]{.underline}**
that overall **[the military outlay has a negative influence on the
growth]{.underline}** rate of Peru over 1970--96. [Chang et al.
(2011)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib20) found
that **[military expenditure leads to deleterious growth for low-income
countries]{.underline}** in the whole sample of 90 countries during
1992--06. [D\'Agostino et al.
(2017)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib32) observed
a significantly negative effect of military spending on growth in 83
countries from OECD over 1970--14. [Saba and Ngepah
(2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib65) examined
the causal link between military spending and economic growth for 35
African countries over 1990--15. The authors found that (i) no causal
link in seven countries; (ii) one-way causality from military spending
to growth in two countries; (iii) one-way link from growth one-way in 14
countries; and (iv) two-ways link in 12 countries. Overall, the GMM
estimates reveal that **[military spending has a significant negative
effect on economic growth]{.underline}** in Africa.

Similarly, other studies provide evidence of mixed results on the
economic effects of military expenses on growth, for example, the study
of [Frederiksen and Looney
(1982)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib37) divided
the economies into financial resource restrained and unrestrained groups
over 1960--78. The findings revealed that enhanced military expenditures
promoted growth in the unrestrained group, but a small visible impact
was found in resource-constrained countries. In a study on three North
American countries namely Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. during
1963--05, [Bremmer and Kesselring
(2007)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib19) found
that enhanced military expenditure promotes nominal GDP in Canada and
Mexico, while it declines the growth in nominal GDP in the U.S. [Aye
et al.
(2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib8) observed
no Granger causal association between military outlay and growth for
South Africa during 1951--10. However, by using the bootstrap rolling
window estimation approach, the study finds two ways Granger causality
in different subsamples. The results of [Chang et al.
(2014)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib21) supported
the neutrality hypothesis for France, Germany, and Italy, while, the
military expenditure--growth hampering hypothesis for Canada and the UK,
and unidirectional Granger causality running from national income to
military outlay for China. Moreover, the results supported the
feedback[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#fn7) between
military spending and national income in the case of Japan and the U.S.
over 1988--10. Using the "Hendry General-to-Specific modeling"
methodology, the study of [Abdel-Khalek et al.
(2019)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib1) fails
to find any causal linkages between military spending and economic
growth in India over 1980--16. Some more related empirical studies are
given
in [Table 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/table/tbl1/).

Several empirical studies are available on the relationship between
military spending and economic growth, but their empirical findings are
yet inconclusive. Undeniably, the economic effect of military
expenditure is an essential issue for the developing world. Therefore,
this research work aims to determine empirically the impact of military
expenditure along with some other control variables on the growth, for a
set of thirty-five countries from non-OECD over 1988--19. According to
the nature of the data, the widely used panel unit tests are employed to
check the order of integration of each variable. The results are found
mixed (i.e., I(0), and I(1)) based on stationarity, and thus, the panel
ARDL/PMG approach is applied. Afterward, the panel robust least squares
and fixed-effect estimators are also employed as analytical techniques
for parameters' estimation to affirm the results, and the Dumitrescu
--Hurlin Granger causality test is employed to find the direction of
causality between the variables.

**[The empirical results of all the methods suggest that military
spending and economic growth have a strong inverse
relationship]{.underline}**, suggesting that **[encouraging military
expenditure is not a good option because it discourages economic
growth.]{.underline}** Moreover, the Dumitrescu--Hurlin Granger
causality test exposes bidirectional causal nexus between military
expenses and economic growth in the sample countries. The bidirectional
causal linkage between military spending and growth though exhibits a
degree of interdependence between military spending and economic growth
policy objectives. Thus, **[the execution of economic growth policies
should not be given more primacy over the military burden while other
than military expenditure factors shall be considered.]{.underline}**

Overall, [**the empirical results validated that military spending is
undesirable for national economic development. The results of the
significantly negative effect of military spending on national income go
against the results obtained by **[Benoit
(1978)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib17)]{.underline},
and others who claim that military expenditure positively contributes to
the aggregate output, while, consistent with the findings by [Dunne and
Tian
(2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#bib29) for
106 countries over 1988--10, Dunne and Tian concluded that "These
results do seem to provide valuable robustness checks and support
strongly the view that military spending hurts growth" (p.29). The
findings of the present study are technically and statistically
acceptable and plausible for frontwards policy recommendation purposes.

From these findings, **[the unequivocal negative effect of military
spending on economic growth]{.underline}** indicates that non-OECD
countries are developing countries with scarce resources, and these
**[economies can\'t afford military spending]{.underline}**, while when
these economies grow, governments can contemplate rising its military
spending to strengthen its military power. **[Enlarged military spending
can\'t be used to boost economic growth]{.underline}** in the non-OECD
countries, since any positive impacts it would have on the economic
growth through augmented demand, modernization, and resource outset,
would have overwhelmed by the damaging effects on economic growth
through reduced investment. **[Policymakers should thus leave military
spending for security objectives only and restructuring public resources
from the military sector toward civilian
objectives]{.underline}**[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779781/#fn8).
Likewise, policymakers should focus on rationalizing their budget
spending more on improving social welfare. Furthermore, incremental
efforts are required to adopt an effective and prudent policy to further
encourage growth, while shrinkage in military spending can largely
benefit the economies. Therefore, **[military expenditures need to be
reduced]{.underline}** while expenditures on other developmental sectors
including health and education sectors to be increased.

The **[Euro]{.underline}**pean **[debt crisis started as a small local
policy shock in Greece, but it has come to threaten the survival of the
euro with potentially far reaching consequences for the world
economy]{.underline}**. Since December 2011 financial markets have
stabilized somewhat, but **[fundamental issues remain
unsolved.]{.underline}** This crisis is due partly to fundamental
economic developments, such as growth and competitiveness, and partly to
uncooperative behavior between the main policy makers in Europe. One of
the paradoxes of this crisis is that, despite all its problems, the euro
has remained relatively firm in its internal (inflation) and external
value (exchange rate). Financial markets may be concerned with some
parts of the euro area, mainly in the south, but they still see the euro
as a major currency in the world. However, the euro will only maintain
this role if European governments can get the sovereign debt crisis
under control. Whatever the ultimate conclusion of the drama, the
experience has shown that **[Europe needs a much tighter form of
economic governance if it wants to live up to the ambition of providing
the world\'s alternative reserve currency]{.underline}**. While a series
of events has progressively deepened the European debt crisis, it is
important to distinguish between sudden shocks and underlying
**[fundamental problems in Europe's economic governance]{.underline}**.
Their interaction has been the specific flavor of this crisis. There are
two views to the European debt crisis. For the "fundamentalists", the
debt crisis is caused by the lack of discipline in sticking to the
principles of "a sound and competitive macroeconomic base and solid
public finance" (Weidmann 2001). Hence, the remedy is to implement
"painful reforms" and consolidate budgets, which would rebuild trust and
confidence in financial markets (Issing 2009). For the "monetarists",
the European debt crisis is a liquidity crisis. **[A small local
liquidity shock causes a sudden deterioration in a specific class of
asset values, can cause a global systemic financial
crisis]{.underline}** when the need for liquidity spills over to banks
that then get distressed because the deteriorating asset prices put
their balance sheets into difficulties and reduce bank capital (Chacko
et al. 2011). In this case, a crisis can be stopped by a lender of last
resort that provides the necessary liquidity and stops the crisis from
turning into a default avalanche.

**[The trade and investment links between the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[and the European Union]{.underline}** (EU)
**[are significant. Europe consumes twenty percent of U.S. exports and
holds more than 50 percent of U.S. overseas assets,]{.underline}** while
the United States holds close to 40 percent of Europe's foreign assets.
**[Lower growth and higher volatility in Europe could therefore have
serious consequences for the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, **[hindering export growth and endangering
assets]{.underline}**. Europe has already shown itself to be the laggard
in the global recovery---in the first quarter, European GDP was up only
0.3 percent (y/y), compared to 2.5 percent in the United States and 11.9
percent in China---and the situation may well get worse before it gets
better.

IMGXYZ5032IMGZYXThe crisis will likely lead the euro to depreciate
further in the coming months. The euro has already fallen more than 20
percent against the dollar since late November---two months before Obama
unveiled his goal of doubling exports in the next five years---and it
may fall to parity. In sectors where U.S. and European exports overlap
(e.g., aircraft, machinery, professional services), a lower euro will
hinder the competitiveness of U.S. goods on the global market. The
depreciation will also reduce the purchasing power of European tourists
traveling to the United States and make European goods relatively
cheaper in U.S. markets at a time when policy makers are hoping to avoid
a return to high current account deficits. **[With imports likely to
rise and exports likely to fall, the U.S. bilateral trade balance with
Europe will likely deteriorate.]{.underline}** By definition, the
profitability of U.S. companies operating in Europe will be affected by
the Euro crisis when profits and assets on the balance sheets are
expressed in dollars. U.S. companies selling in Europe and sourcing in
dollars will see even sharper profit declines, though U.S. companies
selling into the dollar area and sourcing in Europe will benefit.

Despite the negative effects a weaker euro would have on U.S. job
creation, **[the most important consequences of]{.underline}** the

the most vulnerable countries in Europe is limited to \$176 billion, or
5 percent of their total foreign exposure, their indirect linkages to
these countries, which operate through all of the international banks,
are much larger. Not surprisingly, European banks hold large amounts of
their own countries' bonds and, according to a recent World Bank report,
these holdings exceed reserves in some instances. **[A string of bank

/alundy\]

Ideological incoherence is the main threat to the Western alliance, but
a close second can be found in the West's imperial center---the U.S. And
here, again, we return to Trump. The essence of his complaint about
Europe was not simply that it was not contributing enough; it was that
he didn't really believe in the U.S.-led order itself. **[Trump believed
the whole structure was unfair to the U.S.: Why should it shoulder most
of the burden of policing the world? But the thing with
orders---liberal, "rules-based," or any other---is that they need
ordering,]{.underline}** and **[this is the job of the
hegemon.]{.underline}** Burdens can be better shared, and Europe can do
more to free America for its contest with China, but **[ultimately the
U.S. either guarantees European security or it doesn't]{.underline}.**

**[Biden will]{.underline}** undoubtedly **[speak a familiar language to
European leaders---one of liberal values and the defense of democracy,
and that will be comforting to them]{.underline}**. But the question
that nevertheless troubles European politicians, diplomats, and
officials is whether instead of Trump being an eccentric one-off, his
instinctive antagonism to the obligations of global leadership
represents a trend in American public opinion more generally. **[The
question that follows is whether the U.S. has the political will to be
the hegemonic power it has been since the end of the Second World War,
the basis on which the Western world functions.]{.underline}**

As one former NATO insider put it to me, **[the alliance's strength is
its strategic capability, and this is possible only because the U.S.
dominates it]{.underline}**. An alliance of lots of similar-size states
would not be the same: It would be the European Union---a worthwhile
political and trade bloc, but not a capable military grouping. What
happens if Washington decides it no longer wants the role of leader?

One somewhat counterintuitive conclusion from the past 20 years is that,
if anything, **[America's relative dominance over Europe has grown, not
declined]{.underline}**. After the financial crash, **[it was the
Federal Reserve that stepped in to become the global lender of last
resort, while Europe descended into a set of rolling
crises]{.underline}**. **[The fundamentals of U.S. economic strength
remain extraordinary]{.underline}**: the dollar, Silicon Valley,
America's universities, Wall Street. Europe lags behind on all of these,
and Germany's sudden commitment to additional defense spending will do
little to bridge the yawning security gap.

The reality is that **[the West functions as an American-led alliance,
but it is not clear that Europe entirely agrees on America's principal
strategic threats.]{.underline}** Whether Trump returns to the White
House or Biden is the one who returns to some future NATO summit, there
will come a point when Europe and the U.S. must decide whether and how
to renew their alliance for the next challenge---be that Russia, or
China, or something else entirely. And if they do, **[it will take far
more than a small uptick in defense spending and a change in energy
policy to keep them united]{.underline}.**

**[Entrapment]{.underline}** could also **[result from transnational
ideological factors]{.underline}**. Driscoll and Maliniak (2016) suggest
that defenders like the **[United States get ensnared in conflicts
"where their national interests are not implicated" for reasons of
"issue slippage" (p. 593). This issue slippage occurs when the alliance
takes on additional purposes, losing sight even of its original purpose.
In the case of NATO, issue slippage ensued when the Soviet military
threat no longer existed and the alliance became instead a political
community based on liberal democratic values]{.underline}**.
Accordingly, an actual or **[potential ally can "position itself in the
imagination of liberal idealists in the West" to maximize external
support]{.underline}** (Driscoll & Maliniak, 2016, p. 594). Similarly,
Cooley and Nexon (2016, pp. 77--82) argue that foreign elites can forge
bonds of trust and friendship with American officials and politicians,
thereby **[eliciting more cooperation than what was strategically
warrante]{.underline}**d. The common mechanism underlying these
arguments is that the ally exploits some transnational connection via
elite networks. This **[connection often has an ideological character
since foreign elites play to the ideological prejudices of the defender
by professionalizing the national bureaucracy]{.underline}**,
highlighting religious and political affinities with the West,
**[contracting with lobbying firms in the defender's capital
city]{.underline}**, and developing embassy connections (Cooley & Nexon,
2016, pp. 88--94; Driscoll & Maliniak, 2016, p. 601). Sometimes they
**[might instead play on ethnic ties if those ties exist]{.underline}**.
The net effect is to make foreign policy-making in NATO capitals more
amenable to a state's particular interests. The **[mechanism
resembles]{.underline}** what Schimmelfennig (2003) calls **[rhetorical
action, which refers to the "strategic use and exchange of arguments to
persuade other actors to act according to one's
preference]{.underline}**s" (p. 5). By appealing to the ideological
sensibilities of the defender's elites, the ally can co-opt that
defender, thereby **[increasing the probability that the defender would
assist the ally even if doing so is detrimental to its strategic
interests.]{.underline}**

### Turn---Relations Solve Entrapment

#### Stronger relations cause NATO to restrain US aggression- solves entrapment

Scowcroft Center's Transatlantic Security Initiative, a political
scientist at the RAND Corporation, Published: 2019; \"An Attack Against

Concerns about a mismatch of goals could be overcome if coalition
participants are more confident in their ability to influence the
coalition's actions. **[Potential participants could have concerns about
restraining any ally, but in a Baltic scenario, these concerns are
likely to be most acute with respect to the most powerful and leading
members]{.underline}** of the coalition and the Baltic states.
Typically, **[weaker states]{.underline}** **[are thought to have less
leverage in the alliance and, therefore, greater concerns about
entrapment by a stronger ally like the United States.]{.underline}**78
However, weaker allies do have some ways to restrain more-powerful
allies. First, **[longstanding diplomatic and military relationships
among NATO members mean that states might have insight into their
allies' decision making processes and the contacts needed to influence
those processes]{.underline}**.79 Second, **[allies also have some
sources of leverage]{.underline}** over a coalition leader, including
the **[ability to withdraw participation or place limits on access to
military bases or airspace]{.underline}**.80 Such actions could
**[restrain a coalition leader's behavior by affecting its ability to
carry out operations, raising the costs of a military action, or
undermining the domestic or international legitimacy of the
operation.]{.underline}** To the extent that a coalition **[leader
values the support of its allies in the longer term, threats of exit
from the coalition or NATO itself could affect a coalition leader's
decisionmaking.]{.underline}**81 There is **[evidence]{.underline}**
**[that NATO allies used NATO decisionmaking structures to restrain U.S.
actions during the air war over Kosovo]{.underline}**. Wesley Clark, who
was NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, complained about the influence of
NATO members on military decisions, including campaign phasing and
individual targeting.82 In a now-famous incident at the Pristina
airport, the **[British commander of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps
was able to leverage his chain of command in London to thwart Clark's
plan to block the airport runway]{.underline}** with helicopters---a
move that the British commander believed could have triggered a security
incident between NATO and Russia.83 Ultimately, concerns about
constraints posed by NATO structures in Kosovo contributed to the U.S.
decision to form a coalition of the willing for initial operations in
Afghanistan in 2001.84 NATO members that do not participate could still
face direct Russian retaliation or other consequences. Given that
possibility, members who do not entirely support the aims of the
operation might still participate in order to seek greater influence
over operational decisions than they would have if they were on the
outside.85 This logic appears to have influenced France's decision to
join NATO's air war over Kosovo. French Secretary General for Defense
and National Security Louis Gautier argued that French participation in
the operation meant that France was "able in Kosovo to impose itself in
the decisionmaking process and affect strategy."86

#### No entrapment -- Empirics 

-allies restrain the us rather than embolden it

-draw-in is always domestic

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

**[American concerns about entangling]{.underline}**
**[alliances]{.underline}** are as old as the Republic itself. **[During
the post--World War II era]{.underline}**, however, there have been
**[only five ostensible episodes of U.S. entanglement,]{.underline}**
and even **[these cases are questionable. The case in]{.underline}**
**[which alliance obligations had the largest impact on U.S.
decisionmaking]{.underline}** (the 1995--96 Taiwan Strait crisis**[)
entailed minimal military action, and the case that entailed the most
military action (the Vietnam War) contained only a marginal role for
alliance politics in U.S. decisionmaking.]{.underline}** In the other
three cases (the 1954--55 Taiwan Strait crisis and the wars in Bosnia
and Kosovo), **[both the effect of alliance obligations on U.S. policy
and the costs suffered by U.S. forces were moderate. And beyond these
cases,]{.underline}** entanglement was virtually nonexistent in U.S.
foreign policy. Against this limited evidence of entanglement are
numerous cases in which alliances restrained the United States.
**[Allies]{.underline}** **[dissuaded the United States from escalating
the Korean War and crises in Laos and Berlin, and struggled in vain to
prevent the United States from entering or escalating other conflicts,
the 2003 Iraq War being only the latest major example.]{.underline}**
Indeed, instances of **[alliance-induced restraint are evident even
within the five cases of entanglement discussed above:]{.underline}** in
the 1954--55 Taiwan Strait crisis, **[concerns about European alliances
discouraged U.S. policymakers from bombing the Chinese
mainland]{.underline}** and publicly committing to defend Jinmen and
Mazu; in the **[Vietnam War, allies impeded U.S. entry into the war and
then repeatedly implored the United States to get out; and in Bosnia and
Kosovo, U.S. allies initially restrained the United
States]{.underline}** from lashing out violently and then provided all
of the NATO ground forces and most of the postconflict peacekeepers for
the eventual operations. There **[also are several cases in which
the]{.underline}** **[United States sidestepped inconvenient alliance
commitments, restrained an ally from attacking a third party, or openly
sided against an ally]{.underline}**---and this list could probably be
expanded by looking within other cases, including the five ostensible
cases of entanglement. As explained earlier, the United States blatantly
**[retracted a pledge to Taiwan to defend Jinmen and Mazu in 1955,
refused to save the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954]{.underline}**,
delegated ground operations and most of the postconflict peacekeeping in
Bosnia and Kosovo to allies, and waited for eight months and the receipt
of private security assurances before responding militarily to China's
provocative behavior near Taiwan in 1995--96. In sum, the empirical
record shows that the risk of entanglement is real but manageable and
that, for better or worse, **[U.S. security policy lies firmly in the
hands of U.S. leaders and is shaped primarily by those leaders'
perceptions of the nation's core interests.]{.underline}** When the
United States has overreached militarily, the main cause has not been
entangling alliances but rather what Richard Betts calls
"self-entrapment"---the tendency of U.S. leaders to define national
interests expansively, to exaggerate the magnitude of foreign threats,
and to underestimate the costs of military intervention.188 Developing a
disciplined defense policy therefore will require the emergence of
prudent leadership, the development (or resurrection) of guidelines
governing the use of force,189 the establishment of domestic
institutional constraints on the president's authority to send U.S.
forces into battle, or some combination of these.190 **[Scrapping
alliances, by contrast, would simply unleash the United States to act on
its interventionist impulses while leaving it isolated diplomatically
and militarily.]{.underline}**

The main problem concerns counterfactuals. **[The factors that allegedly
generate entrapment risks can be so wide-ranging that imagining a world
in which they operate differently would require changing other
variables, which in turn can make war more or less
likely]{.underline}**. Alternatively, they **[might not exclude other
factors that could lead to the same violent outcome]{.underline}**.
After all, **[conflict drives both alliance formation and the likelihood
of war. States join alliances because they assess that the possibility
of war is non-trivial.]{.underline}** Similarly, a **[defender might be
receptive to the overtures of an ally precisely because it has a
pre-existing desire to see conflict with the adversary of that
ally]{.underline}**. In social scientific parlance, endogeneity problems
are pervasive when trying to understand whether entrapment has occurred
or is at risk of occurring. The case of the **[2008 Russo-Georgian War
is instructive by revealing these ambiguities]{.underline}**. Many NATO
members---especially those in Western Europe---were lukewarm towards
**[Georgia's bid to become a treaty ally]{.underline}**, **[arguably
because they recognized that Georgia posed certain entrapment
risks]{.underline}**. The **[United States was the most supportive of
Georgia, but it might have overstated its support to Georgia in order to
gain a bargaining chip with Russia.]{.underline}** It might have even
done so because Western European countries were so hesitant, thereby
**[ignoring Saakashvili's non-democratic tendencies]{.underline}**. But
by this very token, the United States limited its response to the
outbreak of hostilities between Georgia and Russia in August 2008. The
Georgian case suggests that **[states do not forge alliances mindlessly
nor do they follow their allies off the cliff
thoughtlessly]{.underline}**. One **[cannot by definition want to be
entrapped]{.underline}**. The Russo-Georgian War of 2008 **[illustrates
the need to disentangle the factors that push states to fight wars and
to seek alliances]{.underline}** while carefully investigating the
mechanisms through which alliances fuel wars. As noted, some baseline
probability of war had already existed between the two former Soviet
republics when Saakashvili became President. Their conflict centered on
**[an unresolved dispute regarding the political status of Abkhazia and
South Ossetia]{.underline}**. Neither could commit to a durable
settlement. Moreover, territorial concessions and submission to salami
tactics could have signaled Georgian weakness, thereby encouraging new
or more assertive territorial demands. Georgian leaders might have also
faced domestic incentives to stand firm towards Russia---**[incentives
that would have existed independent of NATO.]{.underline}** To the
extent that alliance politics mattered from Georgia's perspective,
Saakashvili might have cherry-picked information that confirmed his
beliefs regarding Western support. Nevertheless, these factors are
idiosyncratic because they stem directly from his personality. **[In a
counterfactual world where NATO was not a factor, he could have had
these and other cognitive biases that would have elevated the likelihood
of war.]{.underline}** By undertaking this sort of counterfactual
analysis, scholars thus must take care to isolate the effect of an
alliance commitment---to the degree that it exists---from the underlying
propensity of war. Georgia bears a methodological and analytical lesson
for thinking about entrapment: Just because **[NATO was an issue for
Georgian security in 2008 does not mean the alliance was causally
responsible for the war.]{.underline}** **[Future
research]{.underline}** on alliances and war **[must not
only]{.underline}** **[identify correlations between alliances and
conflict]{.underline}**, but **[also sort out various causal mechanisms
that connect different causal factors with war]{.underline}**. Carefully
disentangling the factors that could lead to entrapment matters not only
for theory and methodology but also for policy. If entrapment concerns
are real, then **[defense planners must have a clear idea as to where
they come from]{.underline}**. Some entrapment risks can be attenuated
with active policy measures. **[Conditioning a political or military
commitment when dealing with a risk-acceptant ally is one example. But
doing so might not matter if we have reason to think that systemic
forces make that ally more aggressive. Strong commitments could even
make seemingly jumpy allies more secure]{.underline}**. And so, armed
with a better understanding of what drives entrapment risks, defense
planners would be more confident in modulating political and military
commitments appropriately. As such, critics of NATO expansion and
American foreign policy may be overstating their case. NATO might bear
some indirect responsibility for the Russo-Georgian War, **[but its
culpability lessens when we consider the other factors that increased
the likelihood of war: misperceptions, overconfidence, and the
commitment problems underlying the territorial disputes
themselves.]{.underline}** If anything, the key policy challenge is for
NATO to determine whether prospective partners like Saakashvili have
psychological traits or cognitive biases that would make them
unjustifiably optimistic about the level of support that they would
receive.

### Entrapment False---AT: Reputational risk theory 

#### Reputation alone is insufficient to trigger entrapment

Alexander **Lanoszka 17** --- (Alexander Lanoszka; Assistant Professor
at the University of Waterloo, Published: 12-18-2017; \"Tangled up in
rose? Theories of alliance entrapment and the 2008 Russo-Georgian War\";
Taylor & Francis; Accessed: 7-4-2022;

**[Scholars are divided about whether fighting for reputation is a
rational motive]{.underline}** for states and thus whether it creates
perverse incentives for allies. Some claim that states calculate the
credibility of an ally or an adversary on the basis of its willingness
and ability to fulfill a threat or promise. **[Credibility thus does not
depend on having a record of keeping pledges]{.underline}** (Press,
2005). Accordingly, **[states cannot develop reputations for reliability
among their own allies]{.underline}** (Mercer, 1996; Tang, 2005).
**[Fighting for reputation is irrational]{.underline}**. However, some
dispute the proposition that actions do not matter for building
credibility since actions provide information as to the interests and
resolve of a state. Moreover, a record of standing up to adversaries
could generate credibility, which in turn helps develop a bargaining
advantage (Weisiger & Yarhi-Milo, 2015). Whichever is the case,
**[recent scholarship]{.underline}** **[has cast doubt as to whether
reputational concerns worsen entrapment risks.]{.underline}** The
**[Vietnam War is an oft-cited example of the entrapment of strong
states by friendly states, but the evidence shows that American allies
wished to restrain the United States because they feared that
questionable wars of choice would divert resources away from
them]{.underline}** (Beckley, 2015, pp. 33--38, pp. 46--47). **[Another
weakness of the reputational explanation for entrapment is its
deceptively simple counterfactual]{.underline}**. Simply stated, the
**[counterfactual is that the defender does not care about its
reputation]{.underline}**. Yet the implications of this counterfactual
are unclear. For example, does the defender not help the ally at all?
And if it does assist the ally, is it doing so only because of
reputational concerns? By offering an alliance commitment in the first
place, the defender reveals that it has some common security interests
with that ally (Walt, 1987; Yarhi-Milo, Lanoszka, & Cooper, 2016). **[A
defender unconcerned with its reputation might still help that ally for
various national security reasons, as its decision-makers understand
them. Alternatively, a defender might even enhance its reputation by not
assisting the ally in a militarized conflict that the very ally
instigated.]{.underline}** The **[defender could decide that following
the reckless ally into an undesirable war will undermine its ability to
protect other, less problematic allies.]{.underline}** The **[defender
could even limit the damage to its reputation by deflecting blame onto a
misbehaving ally.]{.underline}** These observations suggest that the
ally might not necessarily want to wager that the defender would fight
on its behalf simply because of reputational concerns. And so an ally
that is willing to make this wager is the sort of state that might
already be pre-disposed to risk-acceptant behavior. **[If war does break
out because the ally made that gamble, then the war should not be
attributed to the alliance per se but rather to the ally and its innate
risk propensity.]{.underline}**

### Entrapment False---AT: Cred Theory

#### Cred theory is fake -- allies prefer peaceful policy and minimal intervention

Centre, Australian National University, Spring 2020, "What Allies Want:
Reconsidering Loyalty, Reliability, and Alliance Interdependence,"
International Security, Vol. 44, No. 4)//EZAY

The events of the First Taiwan Strait Crisis illustrate the need to
**[delineate between innate loyalty and observed reliability.
Reliability is a broader and more useful concept that subsumes the idea
of loyalty and reduces its unwarranted prominence.]{.underline}** U.S.
**[conduct was not judged against an objective standard of loyalty:
allies desiring a confrontational posture, such as South Korea and the
Philippines, invoked Quemoy and Matsu as symbols that required
defending, and encouraged U.S. loyalty to the ROC. Most allies, however,
were more concerned about the possibility of war, and so discouraged a
U.S. defense of strategically unimportant territory]{.underline}**.
These **[allies did not mind that this would involve U.S. disloyalty to
the ROC, but instead cared about whether Washington\'s policy goals were
convergent with their own.]{.underline}**

In this case study, several **[allies cooperated to restrain the United
States]{.underline}** and **[mitigate the risk of entrapment, while
weaker allies fearing abandonment had little option but to complain
about U.S. timidity]{.underline}**. In other circumstances, however,
allies fearing abandonment could respond differently. For example, in
May 1950 Japan dispatched a secret delegation to Washington. Citing the
concern prompted by the 1949 withdrawal of United States forces from the
Korean Peninsula, and vacillating U.S. policy toward Nationalist China,
Japan expressed its desire for U.S. forces to stay in Japan, even once
the postwar occupation ended.[123](javascript:;) Similar fears of
abandonment were sparked in the 1970s, when President Jimmy Carter
planned troop reductions in South Korea. In response, Tokyo initiated a
new period of military and economic cooperation with Seoul. As Victor
Cha writes, "The most single decisive factor in this upswing in security
contacts was anxiety over the Carter plan."[124](javascript:;)

As explained, Mercer\'s argument about **[reputation is contingent upon
what constitutes desired and undesired behavior. If]{.underline}**
**[states do not always desire allied loyalty, then this leaves open the
possibility of interdependence being governed by assessments of
interests and capability]{.underline}**, but raises the **[question of
when such interdependence might be observed]{.underline}**. This article
deployed a within-case study approach, but **[interdependence was also
operative across iterative crises: allies were unsurprised by the United
States' initial response to the First Taiwan Strait
Crisis]{.underline}**, because they had just observed a similarly
belligerent approach toward the PRC during discussions on Indochina.
**[Although the United States ultimately backed down on Indochina in
1954, this did not lead its allies to expect a similar back down over
the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}** This logic supports the argument made
by Alex Weisiger and Keren Yarhi-Milo: by focusing on iterative security
crises, previous research may have overlooked the possibility that
during such events, "information gleaned from past actions ... will have
already been folded into the general assessment of
interests."[125](javascript:;) Studying prolonged security crises, where
assessments of interests are regularly updated in response to new
information, may provide fresh insight into not only how states assess
allied reliability, but when and why these assessments change.

Although this article focuses on alliances, my findings raise new
questions about the possible interdependence of threats. **[One
assumption contested in this article---that allies always want to see
their ally demonstrate innate loyalty---has an equivalent in deterrence
theory]{.underline}**. It is assumed that states always want their
adversary to back down, but are there **[circumstances in which an
adversary\'s decision to fight is
welcomed]{.underline}**?[126](javascript:;) **[A state may desire this
if it saps public support, provides geography unfavorable to the
adversary, or ties down an adversary\'s military force in an unimportant
theater.]{.underline}** China may not object to a display of U.S.
resolve in the Middle East or Europe if it believes that this decreases
the United States' focus on Asia. This counterintuitive possibility
requires further consideration and, if supported, would be further
evidence to suggest that states assess national interests, rather than
national character.

The policy implications of the alliance reliability concept are
significant, especially given President Donald Trump\'s mercurial
approach to alliance management. How should U.S. policymakers approach
the possibility of alliance interdependence? First, they should realize
that the national character of the United States is not on trial:
**[allies will be looking for evidence of reliability, not loyalty. The
idea of reliability is especially pertinent to current discussions about
a U.S. withdrawal from the Middle East: allies may not invariably
despair at withdrawal if it enables the United States to focus on other
issues of greater allied concern]{.underline}**. Second, U.S.
policymakers should consider how specific actions might influence each
ally, as different allies are likely to react in different ways.
Officials will not need a crystal ball: this First Taiwan Strait Crisis
case study suggests that **[allies will not hesitate to express their
fears. Nor will allies rush for the door at the first sign of
unreliability: in this case, their first instinct was to bargain with
U.S. leaders and convince them that disloyalty to the ROC was actually
in the best interests of the United States]{.underline}**. The
reliability concept shows that state interests are not totally exogenous
to their alliance relationships: alliance unity can require hard
bargaining over how states order their
interests.[127](javascript:;) This bargaining is made more difficult if
states in alliance are reluctant to consider situations where their
interests diverge, even privately, for fear of upsetting alliance
comity. **[Such discussions may be difficult, and frustrating for the
United States if it expects unqualified support, but they provide an
opportunity to understand what, in alliance interdependence terms, is at
stake in a crisis]{.underline}**. Finally, the United States should
consider the desirability of likely allied reactions and factor these
into decisionmaking. Fighting to preserve allied beliefs about U.S.
reliability may be worthwhile if doing so prevents unwanted reactions
such as dealignment, bandwagoning, or nuclear proliferation. On the
other hand, it may be beneficial for allies to fear unreliability if
this will almost certainly cause them to pursue policies---such as
increased defense spending---desired by the United States.

Today, several flash points around the globe could create problems of
alliance interdependence. The closest parallel to the events of 1954--55
is found in the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands,
which are covered by the U.S.-Japan alliance. Another similar case is
the recent reaffirmation, by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, that the
U.S.-Philippines alliance covers Filipino military assets in the South
China Sea.[128](javascript:;) The instinct of many in the United States
will be to regard any Chinese challenge in these areas as a test of
national character. Instead, policymakers should consider their options
and the likely allied reactions. **[Given the escalation risks present
within the U.S.-China relationship, will other allies want to risk
conflict---perhaps even nuclear war---over uninhabited territory of
debatable strategic importance or the sinking of a single naval
vessel]{.underline}**?[129](javascript:;) Of course, arguments
advocating disloyalty would have to be weighed against the likely
effects in Japan, or the Philippines. Would Japan abrogate the alliance,
conciliate China, or perhaps develop its own nuclear weapons? Or could
it be reassured, thus avoiding undesired consequences? Would the
Philippines react by bandwagoning with China? These questions will be
even harder to answer during a security crisis, but **[neither
deterrence theory nor reputation-skeptic perspectives would prompt
decisionmakers to ask them]{.underline}**. The concept of reliability
and its effect on alliance interdependence do not solve such dilemmas,
but they help to raise the right questions and more accurately identify
the actual stakes involved.

### No NATO Entrapment

#### NATO entrapment's wrong---no automatic involvement

\*italics in original

After the end of World War II, the US sought a way to protect Europe
from the USSR. Despite acute security concerns, **[fear of
entrapment]{.underline}** in unwanted conflicts **[led to limits on
military support]{.underline}**. First, as Poast (2019*a*) details, NATO
members disagreed over how to define the North Atlantic area, which was
a key condition on military support. The US and other states argued
about whether France's Algerian colony and Italy should be protected by
the alliance. Second, active **[military support from
NATO]{.underline}** members **[depends on domestic political
processes]{.underline}**.18 **[Isolationists in the US Senate feared
that an alliance would force America to intervene automatically if
partners were attacked, bypassing the power of Congress to declare war
and engaging the US in unwanted conflicts]{.underline}** (Acheson, 1969,
pg. 280-1). **[Therefore]{.underline}** **[Article V of the NATO treaty
states that if one member is attacked the others "will assist the Party
or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert
with the other Parties, *such action as it deems
necessary*]{.underline}** (emphasis mine)." **[Military support was and
is not guaranteed]{.underline}**. Secretary of State Dean Acheson stated
as much in a March 1949 press release defending NATO to the US public,
where he said that **[Article V "does not mean that the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would automatically be
at war if one of the nations covered by the Pact is subject to armed
attack"]{.underline}** (Acheson, 1949). This claim and the emphases of
the press release shows that promises of military support were highly
salient to the US public.

#### A5 Flexibility prevents NATO from being forced into conflicts

**[NATO's best answer to compellence is strategic flexibility and
ambiguity of response. While Article V dictates the defense of a member,
it doesn't stipulate what that defense must be, how it should take
shape, or where it will be applied]{.underline}**. With U.S. forces in
place, NATO members can be assured that Article V will be triggered, but
what happens next should be left a question mark. The more NATO
emphasizes the Russian threat and argues for fixed forces in place, the
less capably it can defend a challenge to its credibility as an
alliance. Anyone can count the order of battle and the balance of
forces. **[By introducing ambiguity in its potential response once
Article V has been declared, NATO reduces the chance it can easily be
manipulated into a credibility test]{.underline}**. The objective should
be shrouding a Baltic high-end fight in incalculable risk for Russia
while maintaining uncertainty and strategic flexibility with air and
naval assets.

#### Entrapment is [wrong]{.underline} and [adaption solves]{.underline}.

**Cohen** **and Monie** **19** \[Jordan Cohen is a Political science

True Value of a NATO Membership\" The National Interest, 25 November
2019,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/true-value-nato-membership-99817.\]

The second part of the counterargument deals with entanglement and
entrapment. **[The idea that U.S. presence in an alliance]{.underline}**
with an extensive security commitment and an ever-increasing number of
European countries and **[can entangle it in a conflict with Russia is
persistent]{.underline}** and not entirely incorrect.

On one hand, **[the academic literature suggests entrapment is far less
common than perceived]{.underline}**. Separate **[research by Tongfi
Kim, Michael Beckley, and Alexander Lanoszka all finds that entrapment
is an unlikely scenario in international politics.]{.underline}** In
fact, the work by **[Beckley finds that the United States has been able
to avoid entanglement by using a large alliance portfolio to balance
counteracting commitments.]{.underline}**

**[Even if one is]{.underline}** still **[concerned with the risks of
entrapment, this is a major reason why NATO should adopt a strategy less
focused on deterring Russia.]{.underline}** As we noted previously, by
constantly focusing on defense spending and balancing, NATO has
threatened Russia. Thus, our argument actually suggests **[entanglement
will be less likely if NATO begins to focus more on cooperative and
humanitarian actions within the alliance.]{.underline}**

By the mere fact of its continued existence, **[NATO has displayed a
penchant for adaptation to new circumstances.]{.underline}** To continue
surviving, though, it needs to adapt once again. The focus on balancing
against Russia made sense during the Cold War but has made Europe less
secure while also decreasing the popularity of the alliance.

By **[shifting its focus to the promotion of shared values and broader
international political cooperation, NATO can prove Macron incorrect,
and revitalize its existence in a new era.]{.underline}**

#### [Consensus requirements]{.underline} prevent entrapment

**[A]{.underline}** final **[risk of continued NATO
membership]{.underline}** that Canada must consider **[is the
possibility of being dragged into conflict]{.underline}**. While the ADM
(Policy) at DND claims that NATO increases global stability by
preventing the formation of smaller alliance blocs, this logic must be
re-evaluated in the post-Cold War era. We can turn to the international
relations theory of alliances in multipolarity, as explained by Kenneth
Waltz (and later, Jack Snyder and Thomas Christensen). **[One of the
biggest dangers of a military alliance is
"chain-ganging"]{.underline}**50**[: that one ally will recklessly drag
the others into war,]{.underline}** as was the case between
Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1914. It is true that the
**[NATO]{.underline}** alliance **[has a mechanism to stop this: Article
5 can only be invoked by consensus, which prevents the shooting down of
a Turkish jet by Russia from immediately turning into global
war]{.underline}**. However, alliance theory argues that it isn't about
automatic triggers, but survival interests. As Waltz explained, in 1914,
"If France marched, Russia had to follow; a German victory over France
would be a defeat for Russia."51 Similarly, if Russia today
conventionally invaded a Baltic state and NATO ally, it is difficult to
imagine that the alliance would not respond: not for the first time in
its history, Canada would be dragged into a faraway, conventional
European war. However, Canada can support countries around the world and
advocate for their continued survival and independence without being
bound to defend them. Canada's relationship with Israel is a good
example. Canada has supported this precariously situated democratic
country since its creation in 1948, has engaged in numerous high-level
visits and economic agreements with this state, and has frequently
(especially since 2006) taken a stand against condemnation of Israel at
the United Nations at significant cost to its own reputation. However,
there is no defence agreement: should war erupt again between Israel and
its neighbours, Canada would not come to Israel's aid by sending
soldiers. A different example is Canada's relationship with Kuwait.
While there is no long-standing mutual relationship of defence and
support between the two, it was in the interest of global security to
stop Saddam Hussein's invasion of that country in 1990/1991. Canada
answered the call then, but was not bound to support a future mission
against Iraq in 2003.

### No NATO Entrapment---AT: Article V 

#### Wars of aggression are unpopular -- allies won't follow and credibility isn't sacrificed

Constantine **Atlamazoglou**, 9-23-20**21**, (master\'s degree in
security studies and European affairs from the Fletcher School of Law
and Diplomacy. \"NATO is still living with the consequences of a
historic decision it made hours after 9/11,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-still-living-with-consequences-article-5-invocation-after-911-2021-9)//EZAY

The day after **[the September 11 attacks, most NATO countries called
for the invocation of Article 5.]{.underline}** This did not immediately
happen since the origin of the attacks had yet to be determined to the
satisfaction of some members.

It **[took until October 2,]{.underline}** 2001 --- **[when
then-NATO]{.underline}** Secretary General Lord George Robertson
**[announced that the attacks had indeed been directed from abroad ---
for Article 5 to be invoked.]{.underline}**

This was a **[watershed moment for the alliance. Failure to invoke
Article 5 would have rendered NATO obsolete]{.underline}**. Instead, the
alliance, which had **[struggled to find its raison d\'être following
the collapse of the Soviet Union, was propelled into Afghanistan and the
fight against terrorism.]{.underline}**

A number of NATO allies were involved in the war from the very
beginning.

The UK participated in the first airstrikes against Taliban and Al Qaeda
targets. German and British special-operations units took part in the
Battle of Tora Bora. A number of NATO countries contributed personnel,
aircraft, and logistical support during 2002\'s Operation Anaconda, the
successful mission to rout out Al Qaeda from Afghanistan\'s Shahi Kot
valley.

After dismantling the Taliban and Al Qaeda networks in Afghanistan,
NATO\'s role there only grew.

In 2003, at the request of the UN and the Afghan government, NATO took
charge of the International Security Assistance Force. This was a
landmark moment for the alliance.

ISAF would be NATO\'s first deployment outside of Europe and North
America. All NATO members would contribute personnel to ISAF --- some
contributed more per capita than the US.

Eventually, the ISAF mandate would expand from securing Kabul to the
whole country. This nominally transferred control of the war to NATO.

**[The war exposes NATO\'s weaknesses]{.underline}**

Assuming control of such a high-stakes mission provided significant
operational and organizational experience to NATO. However, as the
war\'s toll increased, **[weaknesses within the alliance were
exposed.]{.underline}**

**[Participation in the war in Afghanistan had been a contentious issue
in many European countries from the beginning.]{.underline}**

In some, like Spain, **[parliamentary approval had not been obtained to
dispatch troops to Afghanistan]{.underline}**. In others, like Germany
and Italy, the **[deployed troops were limited by legal
constraints,]{.underline}** which in some cases prevented them from
actually fighting the Taliban.

Most **[NATO members had not fought a war in decades, so even limited
combat casualties caused significant backlash at home]{.underline}**.
The 2004 Madrid train bombings and the 2005 London bombings --- which
brought Islamist terror to Europe in two of the continent\'s worst
attacks in decades --- **[further increased the war\'s
unpopularity]{.underline}**.

As a result, many **[NATO members only contributed a few support troops
and tried to sidle away from combat operations and troubled areas.
France even withdrew its combat forces in 2012. The lack of specificity
in Article 5 meant members could abide by their NATO commitment without
totally participating in the war effort.]{.underline}**

In 2015, ISAF became the Resolute Support Mission. A non-combat mission,
RSM significantly scaled down the number of NATO troops in Afghanistan
as it focused on supporting and advising Afghan security forces..

The alliance emerges from Afghanistan with a mixed record.

On the one hand, it undertook its largest mission ever and the first
outside its normal area of operations, learning valuable lessons about
organization and interoperability that will be useful for future
deployments.

On the other hand, the **[intractable problem at the alliance\'s core
was exposed: the near-impossibility of getting all 30 members to agree
on and commit to military and political priorities.]{.underline}**

To apply those lessons and stay relevant, the alliance will need to
ensure that alignment.

As NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg [wrote](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/opinions_186490.htm) on
the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, \"Afghanistan will not
be the last crisis for which North America and Europe need to act
together through NATO.\"

#### Alliances aren't honored mindlessly 

-- Quantitative analysis of every single alliance invocation

Table 1 lists the opportunities to fulfill alliance commitments from
1945 to 2003. This information offers some possible explanations for the
sharp decrease in promise fulfillment after World War II. One thing that
stands out is that offense pacts and neutrality agreements, which are
honored at higher rates than defense pacts and nonaggression pacts, are
less common in the modern era. Only 20% of alliance performance
opportunities from 1945 to 2003 included offensive or neutrality-based
commitments, compared with more than 70% from 1816 to 1944. Changes in
the types of alliance commitments that are invoked in war over time
might partially account for the puzzling trend that we identify. Yet we
still see sizable variation in compliance within the same commitment
type in the two eras. **[Defense pacts, for instance, were honored
61.02% of the time from 1816 to 1944 and only 13.95% of the time
post-World War II.]{.underline}** What else, then, could explain the
changing patterns over time?

The invention of nuclear weapons offers one potential answer. In the
**[post-World War II era,]{.underline}** the world's most powerful
states possessed nuclear arsenals. Given the destructive power of these
weapons, alliance commitments from nuclear powers -- especially
**[defense pacts -- have rarely been challenged in war]{.underline}**
(Fuhrmann and Sechser, 2014). **[As a result, major powers appear just a
few times in Table 1 and relatively weak states account for a sizable
percentage of all "alliance performance opportunities" from 1945 to
2003]{.underline}**. This is relevant because state power may affect
alliance treaty fulfillment. Countries should be most likely to
intervene in war when their participation might change the outcome
(Morrow, 1994; Smith, 1995). Relatively weak states, according to this
line of thinking, are less likely to fulfill their alliance promises
because they lack the material capacity to **[sway a conflict's
outcome]{.underline}**.7 Israel probably would have prevailed in the Six
Day War, for instance, even if Saudi Arabia had joined its allies in the
fight. From Riyadh's perspective, this may have made it easier to
largely remain on the sidelines. This is, however, merely a preliminary
conjecture. **[Conclusion]{.underline}** This study presented an updated
assessment of the reliability of military alliances. Our analysis, which
extended earlier work to include the post-World War II era and utilized
updated war data, yields three main conclusions. First, the **[overall
rate of alliance fulfillment in war is lower than previously
reported.]{.underline}** Second, defense pacts and **[nonaggression
pacts are honored much less frequently than neutrality agreements and
offensive alliances.]{.underline}** Third, there is a **[large disparity
in the rate of alliance fulfillment before and after World War
II.]{.underline}** This offers a lesson for researchers that extends
beyond the realm of alliance politics: trends that apply in one period
may not extend to other eras. It is important to consider whether
relationships of interest vary over time -- particularly when there are
structural shocks, like World War II. What implications does the lower
compliance rate carry for our understanding of alliance treaty
reliability? **[Our analysis does not imply that military alliances are
ineffective, nor does it challenge the evidence that defense pacts
promote peace through extended deterrence]{.underline}** (Leeds, 2003b;
Johnson and Leeds, 2011; Fuhrmann and Sechser, 2014). The most effective
threat is one that never has to be implemented (Schelling, 1966). NATO
does not appear in our dataset, for example, precisely because potential
adversaries perceive it as effective. However, **[when alliance
commitments are invoked in war, allies uphold their promises less often
than the conventional wisdom suggests.]{.underline}** This implies that
**[leaders are less restrained by treaty commitments than prior research
would expect, a conclusion that carries implications for our
understanding of international institutions]{.underline}** (for a review
of relevant literature, see Simmons, 2010). Our analysis opens up
avenues for future research. Scholars could use our updated dataset to
revisit enduring debates about alliance politics, such as whether
democracies make more (or less) reliable allies (c.f., Gartzke and
Gleditsch, 2004; Leeds, 2003a). The disparity in compliance rates over
time also represents a puzzle worthy of examination in scholarship.
Something may have changed after 1944 that fundamentally **[altered the
nature of alliance politics.]{.underline}** We have speculated about the
sources of this variation, but further analysis is necessary in order to
achieve more definitive answers. The disparity in compliance across
commitment types is worthy of further investigation in scholarship as
well. Dedicated studies on why offense pacts are so much more reliable
than defense pacts would be especially welcome. More generally, future
research might consider the implications of our findings for extended
deterrence, war-fighting, and the efficacy of international
institutions.

#### Article 5 itself doesn't assure allies and if it's invoked no impact

I focus this brief case study on **[NATO treaty design for two
reasons.]{.underline}** First, information from NATO applies to multiple
alliances, as other US treaties have similar designs. Most US
**[alliances have conditional promises of military
support]{.underline}** and understanding why is important. Second, NATO
is also the most important alliance in international politics, so
understanding how the treaty formed is worthwhile. After the end of
World War II, the US sought a way to protect Europe from the USSR.
Despite acute security concerns**[, fear of entrapment in unwanted
conflicts led to limits on military support.]{.underline}** First, as
Poast (2019a) details, NATO members disagreed over how to define the
North Atlantic area, which was a key condition on military support. The
US and other states argued about whether France's Algerian colony and
Italy should be protected by the alliance. Second, active **[military
support from NATO members depends on domestic political
processes.]{.underline}**18 **[Isolationists in the US Senate feared
that an alliance would force America to intervene automatically if
partners were attacked, bypassing the power of Congress to declare war
and engaging the US in unwanted conflicts]{.underline}** (Acheson, 1969,
pg. 280-1). Therefore **[Article V]{.underline}** of the NATO treaty
states that **[if one member is attacked the others "will assist the
Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in
concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary
(emphasis mine)."]{.underline}** Military **[support was and is not
guaranteed.]{.underline}** Secretary of State Dean Acheson stated as
much in a March 1949 press release defending **[NATO]{.underline}** to
the US public, where he said that **[Article V "does not mean that the
United States would automatically be at war if one of the nations
covered by the Pact is subject to armed attack"]{.underline}** (Acheson,
1949). This claim and the emphases of the press release shows that
promises of military support were highly salient to the US public.
Military **[support from Article V did not assuage European fears that
if the Soviets invaded, the United States would not fight. To increase
the credibility of NATO, the United States took other
measures]{.underline}**. A 1951 presentation by Dean Acheson to Dwight
Eisenhower argued European allies "fear the inconstancy of United States
purpose in Europe. \... These European fears and apprehensions can
**[only be overcome if we move forward with determination and if we make
the necessary full and active contribution in terms of both military
forces and economic aid"]{.underline}** (Acheson, 1951, pg. 3). The
first part of reassurance was the **[creation of the Atlantic
Council]{.underline}**, which is an international organization and the
main source of depth in the NATO treaty itself. The United States used
the Atlantic Council to coordinate collective defense and increase the
perceived reliability of the alliance. By **[investing in the Atlantic
Council and related joint military planning, the US addressed European
fears of abandonment.]{.underline}** For example, US officials thought
that the British Foreign Minister viewed US provision of a supreme
commander in Europe as **["a stimulus to European action"]{.underline}**
in NATO (Acheson, 1950). Many Senators also opposed military aid to
Europe (Acheson, 1969, pg 285), which limited efforts to add further
treaty depth. These legislative constraints on the executive branch
reduced the formal depth of NATO relative to what many ambassadors
preferred (Acheson, 1969, pg 277**[). Bilateral agreements on troop
deployments then became another instrument of
reassurance]{.underline}**. In 1950 the **[Germans formally requested
clarification on whether an attack on US forces in Germany would be
treated as an armed attack on the US- which the US said it
would]{.underline}** (Acheson, 1969, pg. 395). These **[bilateral
arrangements and basing rights are not covered in the NATO
treaty,]{.underline}** but they **[added substantial
depth.]{.underline}**19 NATO negotiations reveal the **[tendency of
democracies to use treaty depth to reassure their allies, rather than
unconditional military support.]{.underline}** **[Fear of foreign
entanglement led the United States to offer conditional military
support, but did not inhibit deep military cooperation, which helped
reassure European allies.]{.underline}** Limits on the promises of
military support were an important public justification for the NATO
treaty, while the Atlantic Council was less discussed. Still, the power
of treaty ratification in the Senate limited formal NATO depth to the
Atlantic Council. The Atlantic Council and associated bureaucratic
machinery are the formal core of substantial defense cooperation.
Altogether though Article V is limited, the **[US used treaty depth to
increase the credibility of NATO.]{.underline}**

Why does the US--Turkey alliance persist despite the low credibility of
the US security guarantees after the Cold War? Both the rise of
contestations against the US hegemony and the establishment of a
single-party government by the AKP in Turkey led to significant
divergences in threat perceptions and worldviews within the US-Turkey
alliance. Given its regional leadership aspirations based on strategic
autonomy, **[Turkey can be seen as a critical or 'the least likely case'
(Eckstein, 1975) for the resilience of the US alliances. If the alliance
proves resilient in this most difficult case, it is more likely to
persist in other cases too.]{.underline}**

Several factors such as the **[high credibility of the alliance and a
shared sense of belonging in a security community between the allies
explain why an alliance persists]{.underline}** (Walt, 1997). **[Turkey
maintains the US alliance in spite of the low credibility of the US
security guarantees,]{.underline}** the perceived **[leadership failure
of the US in the Middle East and the divergence of threat perceptions
and worldviews between Turkey and the US.]{.underline}** As Turkey's US
alliance reflects a combination of transactional and ontological
motivations since its eruption, both transactional and 'order-centric'
arguments contribute to the resilience of the alliance.

**[According to the transactional view]{.underline}**, the **[US
alliance has served as a 'hedge' against alternative regional orders led
by Russia or Iran. Turkey's security dependence on the US and the costs
of abrogating the alliance prevail over the AKP's search for greater
autonomy and a better status in the East.]{.underline}** **[Turkey's
energy dependence on Russia and Iran curtails the AKP's regional
leadership aspirations.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[Turkey is
uncertain about whether Russia would treat Turkey as an equal if it
abrogates its NATO/US alliance]{.underline}** (Turan, 2018). It
**[failed to play an important role during the Arab uprisings as it
found itself 'punch\[ing\] above its weight' and overinvolved in complex
regional affairs]{.underline}** (Öniş & Kutlay, 2017, pp. 176--177).
Also, it **[lacks both a coherent vision of an ideal world order and the
political will to assume global responsibilities]{.underline}** (Parlar
Dal, 2018). Accordingly, Turkey's 'double-track' strategy and its
contestations of the US hegemony can be interpreted as merely a warning
to the West. Turkey would not have pursued a rapprochement with Russia
had the US actively supported Turkey's autonomy-based strategies, its
defence industry and its fight against PKK and Gülen (Erşen & Köstem,
2019).

Alternatively, an ontologically-motivated alliance relies on an
'order-centric' nature that transcends the pragmatic motivations of
transactional and threat-based alliances. By maintaining the US
alliance, **[lesser powers like Turkey seek to benefit from the
constitutive and legitimating effects of the alliance on their
agency]{.underline}**. Alliance **[abrogation means higher uncertainty
and risk in terms of the emergence of alternative regional and global
orders.]{.underline}** Hence, Turkey does not abrogate the alliance
because the alliance legitimates Turkey's agency in the current world
order as a rising middle power. **[Rather than preventing it, the US
alliance helps Turkey assert its national role in world politics as an
actor that transcends the East- West divide]{.underline}**. For example,
Turkey **[co-sponsors the UN Alliance of Civilisations project with
Spain and it has become 'the only country that co-chairs three distinct
Friends of Mediation groups at three major international
institutions']{.underline}**, namely, the UN, the OIC and the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (Akçapar, 2019, p.
6). It has recently launched the 'Asia Anew' initiative in August 2019,
emphasising its role as 'the westernmost Asian and the easternmost
European country' (Demirci & Cam, 2019). It participates in both the
Western-led 'Geneva process' and the Russian--Iranian--Turkish
trilateral 'Astana process' about the Syrian conflict. In this context,
Turkey's alliance with the US is embedded in Turkey's national role
conception as an actor of world politics that is in between the East and
the West. Hence, the US alliance's legitimating 'order-centric' effects
on Turkey's multifaceted foreign policy contributes to the resilience of
the alliance.

#### Turkey won't invoke Article 5 -- low cred and Turkey doesn't think they say yes

İbrahim **KARATAŞ 20** (10/20/2020, "Analyzing the Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty as an Assurance of Turkey's Security", Middle
Eastern Studies, 13-2 (2021):155-176//) EZAY

**[Article 5 of the NATO agreement that orders collective defense for a
member that has incurred an armed attack has always been a matter of
debate in Turkey]{.underline}**. Turks are **[suspicious of it if it
involves Turkey in a likely war or conflict]{.underline}**. This study
analyzed whether **[Turkey and other members can rely on NATO's
assurance of security stemming from Article 5]{.underline}**. After
e**[xamining certain events and surveys measuring public opinion of
member states about NATO, it has been concluded that it is not clear
that other members will defend Turkey]{.underline}** or any other member
since the **[article was invoked only once in the history of NATO to
protect the US against relatively small states and a terrorist
group.]{.underline}** However, **[regarding Turkey's position, the claim
that NATO will not protect]{.underline}** Turkey cannot be proven since
Turkey did not face an existential threat after becoming a NATO member.
In addition, deterring the Soviet Union from attacking Turkey by making
it a NATO member can be regarded as a benefit of Article 5 without
invoking it. On the other hand, **[Turkey's own preferences and
compelling reasons in foreign policy made it to be in contention with
its NATO allies]{.underline}**. However, **[when NATO members' attitudes
are examined, it can be concluded that they could still have proposed
better solutions for Turkey]{.underline}**. In addition to the above, as
per **[public opinion surveys, NATO members hint that they may not
sacrifice themselves for others unless (1) they are at War, (2) the
enemy attacks all, (3) all attack the enemy, and (4) the US
leads.]{.underline}** According to surveys, **[this thesis is valid for
Turkey since it favors NATO least and does not seem to join a collective
defense of its allies]{.underline}**. Yet, NATO's and some members'
**[failure or reluctance to address Turkey's security problems has a
significant impact on Turkish people's views]{.underline}**. Surveys
also show that NATO members are **[not as much in allegiance to the
organization]{.underline}** as they were in the past, **[probably due to
the non-existence of an imminent threat.]{.underline}**

#### Turkey can't entrap NATO\-\--no draw-in, and NATO [refuses]{.underline}. 

Michael **Moran 16**, Visiting Media Fellow and author of The Reckoning:
Debt, Democracy and the Future of American Power, "Turkey's Article 5
Argument Finds No Takers," Carnegie Corporation of New York, 2-24-2016,
https://www.carnegie.org/news/articles/turkeys-article-5-argument-finds-no-takers/

The ferocity of the **[fighting between Syria's]{.underline}**
government **[forces and]{.underline}** various proxies vying for
control of territory and resources has **[Turkey]{.underline}** on edge
and **[has already led to]{.underline}** several **[deadly clashes
involving]{.underline}** the only **[NATO]{.underline}** member state
bordering the civil war.

**[With Turkey, Russia, Iran, Iraq, and Gulf states pursuing their
own]{.underline}**, often **[conflicting aims in Syria]{.underline}**,
all against the backdrop of a U.S.-led air and commando campaign against
the Islamic State (IS), **[there is]{.underline}** renewed **[concern at
NATO's headquarters]{.underline}** in Brussels **[that Turkey could see
the next flare-up as grounds for citing Article 5]{.underline}**: in
effect, demanding that its NATO allies deploy forces and come to its
collective defense.

**[Turkey has already invoked]{.underline}** the lesser-known **[Article
4]{.underline}**---a demand for an emergency consultation of the
alliance---following the downing of a Turkish warplane under disputed
circumstances last spring. Incidents like this and the threat that
Bashar Assad's forces might launch Scud missiles into Turkey led NATO
members---the United States, Germany, and Spain---to deploy Patriot
anti-aircraft missiles along the border in early 2013, though the German
and American batteries have since been withdrawn. Spain's---a less
capable version of the Patriot---is geared towards anti-aircraft, as
opposed to anti-ballistic missile defense, and therefore deemed more
appropriate

**[But could a]{.underline}** **[new]{.underline}**
**[incident]{.underline}**---a missile strike, an IS incursion, or
Syrian artillery bombardment across the border---**[bring
the]{.underline}** **[full might of NATO into the war?]{.underline}**
**[Many are]{.underline}** **[skeptical]{.underline}**, and
**[for]{.underline}** **[good reason]{.underline}**.

**[The history of invocations of]{.underline}** NATO's **[Article
5]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[short]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** somewhat **[underwhelming. In]{.underline}** the
**[68 years]{.underline}** of the North Atlantic alliance's history,
**[plenty of low-intensity]{.underline}** **[conflicts involving
NATO]{.underline}** nations **[have raged, from rebellion in France's
Algerian departments, to the U.S. war in Vietnam, through the Balkan
wars of the 1990s. Yet]{.underline}** **[only once]{.underline}**
**[has]{.underline}** **[Article 5's]{.underline}** "all-for-one,
one-for-all" **[facility been invoked]{.underline}**: that was
**[September]{.underline}** 12, **[2001]{.underline}**, the day after
the al-Qaida attacks on the United States.

**[Even then, its effect was primarily]{.underline}**
**[symbolic]{.underline}**. While the United States expressed its deep
appreciation at the time, NATO involvement in Afghanistan would be
minimal for years to come, though British, French, and a handful of
other elite forces arrived as early as November that year. In practice,
though, it was not until late 2003, when NATO assumed command of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), that alliance troops
arrived in force, and even then often under restrictive rules of
engagement that limited their effectiveness.

Indeed, ISAF, the force NATO led from August 2003 to December 2013, was
a UN-sanctioned operation that included not only forces from NATO's 28
militaries but troops and specialists from 48 states, including such
disparate contributors as Mongolia, Tonga, and Singapore. At its height
in 2010--11, ISAF numbered more than 42,000 troops, augmenting 100,000
U.S. troops.

**[Turkey would]{.underline}** **[sorely like]{.underline}** **[a
commitment]{.underline}** of that scale. **[Yet the]{.underline}**
subtle **[diplomatic realities]{.underline}** **[of the North Atlantic
alliance---as well as the very unsubtle nature of its own activity
inside Syria---make this]{.underline}** **[highly
unlikely]{.underline}**.

For one thing, **[Turkey's]{.underline}** **[own military]{.underline}**
has **[acted aggressively]{.underline}** in **[targeting]{.underline}**
Syria's **[Kurdish rebels]{.underline}**, the People's Protection Units,
or YPG, which Ankara views as little more than a proxy for the outlawed
separatist guerrillas of the Turkish Kurds, the Kurdistan Workers'
Party, or PKK. Last week, **[the Turks opened up on the Kurdish-held air
base at]{.underline}** **[Aleppo, in spite of the fact that the
city]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[surrounded]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** forces loyal to **[Assad]{.underline}**, the
presumed enemy in Syria. **[The act]{.underline}**
**[enraged]{.underline}** almost **[everyone]{.underline}**. Russia
demanded at an emergency Security Council meeting a censure of Turkey's
violation of Syrian sovereignty, and President Obama, who regards the
Kurdish as the most reliable ground force in the fight against the IS,
urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in an 80-minute phone call
on February 19 to avoid provocative actions.

**[While NATO has taken no]{.underline}** **[official]{.underline}**
**[position on the question of Article 5---not surprising, since
no]{.underline}** formal **[request]{.underline}** **[has been
made---through]{.underline}** **[back channels]{.underline}** **[the
alliance has been]{.underline}** **[telegraphing]{.underline}**
**[a]{.underline}** **[resounding "no" to Turkey]{.underline}** for
weeks. Last week, **[Luxembourg's Foreign Minister]{.underline}** Jean
Asselborn **[told]{.underline}** Germany's **[DerSpiegel that "NATO
cannot]{.underline}** **[allow itself to be pulled into a military
escalation with Russia as a result of the recent tensions between Russia
and Turkey]{.underline}**."

Whatever the fate of the current U.S.-push to secure a cease fire,
**[a]{.underline}** **[large NATO ground force]{.underline}**, of the
kind that deployed to Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan, **[is not on the
table]{.underline}**.

### No Norway Entrapment

#### Norway isn't interested in conflict, but US support causes deterrence---solves wider scale conflicts 

Frank **Bakke-Jensen**, 1-11-20**21**,(writing when he was the
**Norwegian minister of defense**; \"Norway's defense minister: We must
ensure strategic stability in the High North,\" Defense News,
https://www.defensenews.com/outlook/2021/01/11/norways-defense-minister-we-must-ensure-strategic-stability-in-the-high-north//EZAY

**[The United States and Norway have a strong and longstanding bilateral
relationship based on mutual interests and common values]{.underline}**.
The trans-Atlantic link remains the cornerstone of Norwegian security,
and **[our two countries cooperate closely on almost every aspect of
military operations.]{.underline}** Looking ahead, the two key
dimensions for **[Norwegian security policy are the Arctic and
Russia.]{.underline}**

**Strategic environment in the High North**

Since **[Russia began its military reform effort in 2008, it has built
layered, integrated and scalable defenses.]{.underline}** Russia's armed
forces have become an increasingly **[useful political instrument for
the Kremlin across the entire conflict spectrum, from peace to crisis
and war.]{.underline}**

The annexation of Crimea in 2014 added a more threatening undertone to
the development. In recent years, Norway has experienced **[Russian
simulated air attacks on Norwegian targets and jamming of GPS signals
that threaten the security of civilian aviation]{.underline}**. Last
fall, Russia conducted a sophisticated **[cyberattack on the Norwegian
parliament, a serious incident that affected our country's most
important democratic institution.]{.underline}**

**[The Russian so-called active defense emphasizes high readiness,
agility, mobility and close coordination, as well as the ability to
launch massive firepower. Russian prioritization of the Arctic has
resulted in a]{.underline}** **[large-scale modernization of the armed
forces and infrastructure reestablishment in the Russian
north]{.underline}**. The key task of the Russian capabilities on the
Kola Peninsula is global deterrence, making horizontal escalation a
lasting concern for Norway. **[There is no indication that Russia will
slow down its engagement in the Arctic --- rather, the
opposite.]{.underline}**

China's ambitions and increased involvement in great power competition
introduces new challenges. China's interest in the Arctic is growing,
especially in light of its Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing has a broad
range of means available, as it invests in research, ports and
infrastructure in the region. Although China currently does not pose a
military threat in the Arctic, **[Norway closely monitors China's
engagement in the north and its growing cooperation with
Russia.]{.underline}**

**Key priority**

**[Norway's key priority is to [maintain the Arctic as an area
characterized by cooperation and
predictability](https://www.defensenews.com/smr/nato-air-power/2020/08/06/bring-allied-attention-to-air-power-in-the-arctic/).]{.underline}**
The newly published whitepaper on the Arctic emphasizes its strategic
importance for Norway, and our new long-term plan for defense outlines
significant investments in relevant military capabilities.

Furthermore, **[Norway welcomes the increased presence of key NATO
allies in the High North]{.underline}**. In recent years, the Pentagon
has published Arctic strategies illustrating that the U.S. views the
High North as an area that requires attention in order to preserve
strategic stability and a rules-based international order. **[Along with
the U.S. Navy, Marines and special forces, the Air and Space Forces are
now developing strategic cooperation with likeminded nations in the
region.]{.underline}** This includes increasingly regular allied naval
and air presence in the High North. **[Norway aims to participate in
these activities when they take place in the waters off the Norwegian
coast, in order to enhance allied interoperability]{.underline}**. We
consider these activities as a sign of alliance solidarity and cohesion.

[**Norway's allies share their views on the country's new defense
plan**](https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2020/04/16/allies-share-views-on-enhancing-defense-of-norway-and-the-high-north/)

**[Norway\'s allies recognize the country as punching above its weight
and playing a critical role in the defense of the North Atlantic and
High North. But there is no time for complacency.]{.underline}**

NATO also emphasizes the **[strategic importance of the
Arctic.]{.underline}** Exercise Trident Juncture, hosted by Norway in
2018, **[proves that the alliance is able to conduct large-scale
exercises in harsh weather conditions with an Article 5
scenario.]{.underline}** As part of a more persistent allied presence,
we look forward to hosting the biannual exercise Cold Response in 2022.
This exercise will also test allied ability to protect NATO interests in
the Arctic. This is deterrence in action.

**Deterrence and reassurance**

**[The balance between deterrence and reassurance is our main approach
to achieve our security goals for the High North]{.underline}**. At the
same time, we continue to be prudent and avoid unnecessary provocation.

We remain Russia's neighbor, and we **[continue to cooperate with Russia
on issues such as search and rescue, border patrol, and coast guard
operations to control fisheries.]{.underline}** To preserve stability,
**[we uphold dialogue while at the same time remain firmly committed to
our values and a rules-based international order.]{.underline}**

I would like to commend the **[U.S. for the continued leadership in
defense and commitment to European security. Norway and the U.S.
cooperate closely on maritime surveillance and intelligence in the High
North]{.underline}**. We also **[have close cooperation on integrating
fifth-generation capabilities]{.underline}** into the force structure,
and our **[special forces work shoulder to shoulder around the
globe.]{.underline}** As maritime nations, **[the U.S. and Norway
cooperate on naval matters around the world. In 2023, we plan to launch
two satellites into orbit in a bilateral effort to establish broadband
satellite communications in the Arctic.]{.underline}**

Under shifting administrations, the U**[.S. has built lasting
relationships with allies and partners all over the world, including in
the north]{.underline}**. We look forward to continuing the close
cooperation with the U.S. and NATO allies to protect our common values
and interests.

#### Norway is [stable]{.underline}, covered by [article 5]{.underline}, and [cooperative]{.underline} with Russia

**Koivurova 16**, is Research Professor and Director of the Arctic
Centre at the University of Lapland. (Tim, 11-18-2016, "Analysis: The
Arctic conflict - truth, fantasy or a little bit of both?" High North
News,
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/analysis-arctic-conflict-truth-fantasy-or-little-bit-both)

What do we mean by a conflict? Since **[Arctic countries have so much
practical cooperation,]{.underline}** it is important to ask what sort
of conflicts could occur in the region. **[If we are claiming
that]{.underline}** the **[general deterioration of relations between
Russia]{.underline}** and the West **[is about to lead to some sort of a
conflict]{.underline}**, **[it is important to stop and think
what]{.underline}** kind of a **[conflict]{.underline}** we are talking
about. **[If a conflict means]{.underline}**, for example, **[an
unresolved dispute over]{.underline}** where **[a maritime
border]{.underline}** should lie, this does not shock many experts.
**[Arctic states have disputed over their maritime borders bilaterally
and sometimes even at the International Court of Justice]{.underline}**,
**[but such disputes have been settled]{.underline}** sooner or later.
**[It took]{.underline}** more than **[40 years for Russia and Norway to
resolve a border dispute]{.underline}** **[in the Barents
Sea]{.underline}**, but even this was settled in 2010. Furthermore,
**[the dispute did not prevent cooperation between the countries.
Norway]{.underline}**, **[a NATO member]{.underline}**, **[and the
Soviet Union used to jointly manage fish stocks in the disputed
region]{.underline}**. In fact, **[most of the Arctic maritime disputes
occur between]{.underline}** close allies, like **[the United States and
Canada]{.underline}**. Or, **[does a conflict refer to a single
event]{.underline}**, which causes diplomatic slanging match? If, for
example, the Coast Guard of the US or Norway seizes a Russian fishing
vessel or a person subject to sanctions travels to Svalbard, can this be
defined as a conflict? **[It is very rare that single events escalate
into worse conflicts]{.underline}** than a mild war of words, **[which
is quickly lost]{.underline}** in the mists of time. **[A case in point
is when a Russian fishing vessel]{.underline}** Elektron **[escaped
in]{.underline}** 2005 from **[the Norwegian Coast Guard
to]{.underline}** the **[Russian territorial waters]{.underline}**,
**[after having been arrested]{.underline}** for illegal fishing.
**[While the case lingered]{.underline}** for some time, **[it did not
affect general long-term Russian-Norwegian relations in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. **[What would it]{.underline}** mean, then, **[if
the geopolitical tension expanded to the Arctic region]{.underline}**?
In general, **[if Russian tensions grow with NATO]{.underline}**, it is
important to keep in mind that the Arctic plays a crucial role in
Russia's global military strategy: its Northern Fleet requires access to
the Atlantic. We could also claim that since **[Russia has now increased
its military presence in its Arctic regions]{.underline}**, we have a
security dilemma at hand: Could armament in Russian Arctic also lead to
increased military investment from the part of its neighbors, and such
investments reinforce each other in a vicious circle? **[Although the
Arctic states have]{.underline}** sometimes **[declared they will boost
their investments in]{.underline}** measures guaranteeing **[Arctic
security]{.underline}**, **[this has not actually
occurred]{.underline}**. **[The United States has]{.underline}** so far
**[been unable to even purchase one new icebreaker for its Arctic
areas]{.underline}**. Overall, **[it is important to ask for what
purpose Russia is militarily equipping its Arctic areas]{.underline}**.
Due to the difficult circumstances in the region, **[militaries are
needed in many tasks in the Arctic]{.underline}**, **[ranging from
rescue tasks to safeguarding shipping in the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}**. It is also important to monitor whether Russia
implements all the planned military investments in its Arctic areas.
They are expensive measures in a country whose economy is not doing
well. It is also important to consider for what strategic purposes could
Russian military act in the Arctic. Russia has demonstrated to have the
ability and will to use also military power to achieve its aims in
foreign policy. This has been visible for a long time, since Russia's
Georgia operation in 2008, and it has accelerated in 2014 with the
annexation of Crimea, war in Eastern Ukraine and military support for
the Syrian government. This consideration leads to two questions:
\"**[Could Russia gain anything by military occupation in the
Arctic]{.underline}** and what would it even mean in the Arctic?\", and:
\"**[What is the difference between Ukraine, Georgia and the
Arctic]{.underline}**?\" To the first question: Could it be possible for
Russia to also use military power in forcibly claim the Lomonosov Ridge,
if Denmark-Greenland and perhaps Canada, too, want it? We could also
ask, what would Russia celebrate as a foreign policy win, if it did
conquer the Lomonosov Ridge? It is very likely that Russia receives a
large part of the Lomonosov Ridge and its hypothetical hydrocarbon
resources just by complying with the UNCLOS rules. Furthermore, **[most
likely they have nothing economically exploitable and even if something
was found]{.underline}**, **[it would take decades for Russia to even
dream of drilling oil in these areas]{.underline}**. As regards the
second question on **[differences between Russian actions in the Arctic
and Eastern Europe,]{.underline}** **[Russia has used military power
against two states]{.underline}**, **[which both were]{.underline}**
part of the **[former Soviet Union and]{.underline}** which are **[not
NATO member]{.underline}**s. **[It is a different matter to carry out
attack in the Arctic Ocean against NATO member states]{.underline}**,
**[which are covered by alliance security guarantee]{.underline}**. But
could Putin's regime, then, attack the non-NATO members, Finland and
Sweden? Although these countries are EU member states and thus enjoy a
softer form of security guarantee, the famous fifth article of the North
Atlantic Treaty would not push the alliance to defend Finland and
Sweden. It is important to ask **[these]{.underline}** types of
**[question]{.underline}**s, since they **[allow us to reflect what
Putin's Russia is prepared to pursue with military means in actual
terms]{.underline}**. **[There are no signs of Russia's military
strategy being completely unpredictable]{.underline}**. Russia has
enabled the de facto separation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from
Georgia and annexed Crimea. All the regions have had a Russian majority,
even though they were part of Georgia and Ukraine. To be sure,
safeguarding the Crimean naval base and access to the Black Sea
contributed to the decision to annex Crimea. Considering Putin's
military strategy so far, it is difficult to draw any parallels between
the Georgian regions and the Crimean Peninsula on one hand and Finland
and Sweden on the other. **[The Arctic region lacks similar reasons for
any military confrontation]{.underline}**. If the general tension in the
relations , however, leads to military actions between Russia and
Western powers elsewhere, however, these confrontations are very likely
to expand to the Arctic region. This is for the present, though, an
unlikely course of events. A more crucial question is this: When do the
**[relations between the US and Russia]{.underline}** freeze to a point
where it starts to affect **[Arctic cooperation]{.underline}**, which
**[has so far been largely shielded from tensions from outside the
region]{.underline}**? The recent signs are not promising: The plutonium
agreement was suspended by Russia, the United States and Russia are
again on opposite sides in Syria, and the situation in Eastern Ukraine
continues to be difficult. The situation is constantly changing, and we
cannot exclude the possibility that we reach a point where the
deterioration of the relations also leads to difficulties in the Arctic
cooperation. Did we receive answers to these questions from the election
of Donald Trump as the next US President? On one hand, it seems, Trump
and Putin seem to pull in the same direction, perhaps leading to less
confrontational relations and better Arctic co-operation. However, it is
the unpredictability of Donald Trump that makes it very difficult to say
anything clear on what his foreign policy agenda will eventually look
like. Moreover, the Arctic Council may not be the forum where Trump
would like to pursue his policies, given that the climate change is at
the core of what the Arctic Council does -- a phenomenon that does not
seem to exist for the president-elect.

Whereas the end of the Cold War implied that 'for most other states than
Russia the region has remained either marginal or peripheral', the
**[importance of the High North]{.underline}** **[was revitalised in
Norway]{.underline}** with the Norwegian High North strategy from 2005
onwards.73 The **[significant Russian military build-up]{.underline}**
on the Kola Peninsula from the mid-2000s also **[raised
concerns]{.underline}** about security among Norwegian politicians,
diplomats and militaries. In particular, the Russian reopening of old
military bases, the increased level of military exercises and, not
least, the increase in overflights of Russian bombers and strategic
bombers off the coast of Norway sparked a new round of 'New Cold War'
rhetoric and media headlines.

**[Certainly, a more aggressive Russian foreign policy]{.underline}**
towards Eastern Europe and Ukraine in 2014 in particular
**[has]{.underline}** also **[put the High North]{.underline}**, where
Russia has 'geo-political and military-strategic interests', **[back at
the top of the Norwegian security and defence policy
agenda]{.underline}**.74 For instance, the main focus of the expert
commission was the security challenges that Russia represents in the
region, which they describe as 'an arena for geopolitical struggle'.75
The forward-leaning Russian foreign policy has also gained a lot of
attention in Nordic academic environments.76 **[Even
after]{.underline}** the **[Ukraine]{.underline}** crisis, however,
**[Russia has not been considered as a direct threat to
Norway]{.underline}**, at least not at present.77 As formulated by the
head of Norwegian military intelligence, 'Russia has not suddenly become
a military threat---not in the short term. But, in the long term the
picture is more uncertain'.78 Hence the focus on strengthening the
military presence in northern Norway in subsequent defence plans and
reports.79 **[Rather than seeing any impending security
threats]{.underline}** in the region, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign
Affair's Arctic slogan, '**[high north, low tension', emphasises the
safety aspect of Arctic activity.]{.underline}**

All of the peacetime, **[cooperative military bilateral and multilateral
arrangements in the Arctic are between the nation states]{.underline}**
in the region. For instance, the Ilulissat Declaration of 2008, signed
by the five Arctic coastal states, established a common framework for
maritime sovereignty in the Arctic Ocean. All
**[signatories]{.underline}** have **[agreed]{.underline}** that
**[claims and disputes are]{.underline}** to be **[negotiated between
the Arctic coastal states to prevent]{.underline}** the
**[escalation]{.underline}** of political disagreements into security
issues. **[Norway and Russia]{.underline}**, who have had overlapping
claims in the Barents Sea for decades, finally **[managed to conclude
negotiations and sign an agreement]{.underline}** in 2010.

The role of NATO in the region has been brought up from time to time.
**[NATO is not]{.underline}**, however, **[likely to increase its
activity in the Arctic in peacetime and]{.underline}** instead
**[encourages the continuation of the cooperation between]{.underline}**
all of the **[Arctic states]{.underline}**. The **[defence
establishments of the Arctic states promote peacetime]{.underline}**
**[confidence-building]{.underline}** measures.80 **[There are
regular]{.underline}** bilateral and multilateral **[military
exercises]{.underline}** in the region **[that include Russia
and]{.underline}** the **[individual NATO members]{.underline}** among
the Arctic states. There are annual informal meetings between military
leaders from all of the Arctic states where 'soft security' measures and
military support to civilian agencies responsible for safety-related
matters are discussed. **[These matters have become increasingly
important]{.underline}** with growing levels of human activity in the
Arctic Ocean. This emphasis on safety capabilities corresponds with
recent efforts under the auspices of the Arctic Council that resulted in
a new search and rescue agreement (2011) and an oil-spill preparedness
and response agreement (2013).

The requirement for monitoring and safety arrangements depends on the
volume and scope of future civilian activities. The Arctic may be a
promising area for commercial opportunities. There is a potential for
shorter transcontinental maritime transit though the Northern Sea Route,
increasing the profit and value of extraction of onshore and offshore
petroleum and mineral resources. Analysts, however, have recently
addressed several factors dampening the most optimistic future
predictions. Operations in the Arctic environment can be complex,
difficult (extremely low temperatures and icing contribute to this) and
costly. Profitability of commercial ventures in the Arctic may also be
influenced by the dynamics in the market itself and evolving concepts
for production and distribution.

**[The Arctic]{.underline}**---where Norway has invested significant
political and economic capital---**[can be seen as a unique arena for
the country]{.underline}** as a place **[where Norway meets and
interacts with many non-Arctic states]{.underline}**. Meeting both
Arctic and non-Arctic partners in the High North has been a priority for
Norway. For instance, the rapidly growing economies of Asia have
expressed a particular interest in the Arctic, which has coincided with
Norway's recognition of Asia as an increasingly important arena for
Norwegian foreign policy.81 Similar to its other Nordic regional
partners, **[Norway has been forthcoming and welcoming of Asian states'
Arctic interests]{.underline}**, as **[it encourages broad dialogue
on]{.underline}** issues affecting **[the Arctic and competence
sharing.]{.underline}** Norway welcomes the diverse opinions,
complementary expertise and outside-of-the-Arctic thinking that
non-Arctic states can provide. Norway has developed especially close
bilateral ties on Arctic issues with Singapore, South Korea and Japan.
South Korea has prioritised Norway as a cooperation partner in Arctic
and regular bilateral interactions between Norway and Singapore and
Norway and South Korea have also strengthened collaborative commitments
and interest in the region.82 Norway proclaimed its support of the Asian
states' inclusion in the Arctic Council in early 2013 and continued to
play a role in the states' ultimate acceptance and inclusion in the
council's ministerial meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, in May 2013. This
**[receptive attitude]{.underline}** **[towards]{.underline}** the
**[Asian states can be]{.underline}** in part **[explained by a
Norwegian interest in revitalising the Arctic Council]{.underline}**.83
**[Given its geographic placement and record in the High
North,]{.underline}** **[Norway can play a significant role as a
gatekeeper and facilitator of non-Arctic states'
interests]{.underline}** in the region, **[which can in turn have
positive offshoots in other bilateral, regional and international
settings.84]{.underline}**

#### No Norway-Russia war\-\--robust [cooperation]{.underline} and [mutual interests]{.underline}.

Andreas **Østhagen 18**, Senior Fellow at The Arctic Institute, Senior
Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Ph.D. in International
Relations from the University of British Columbia, "How Norway and
Russia avoid Conflict over Svalbard," The Arctic Institute, 06-19-2018,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/norway-russia-avoid-conflict-svalbard/

In 1977, Norway established a maritime Fisheries Protection Zone (FPZ)
around the Arctic Archipelago of Svalbard. **[Norway avoided claiming an
outright]{.underline}** Exclusive Economic Zone (**[EEZ]{.underline}**)
**[fearing it would be challenged due to]{.underline}** stipulations (or
lack thereof) concerning extended maritime zones in **[the Svalbard
Treaty]{.underline}** from 1920.1) A dispute with Russia over the status
of the Zone arose, although the two countries quickly agreed to disagree
as long as Russian fishermen would have access to fisheries in the Zone.

In the late 1990s, Norwegian fisheries enforcement in the FPZ became
stricter, in tandem with declining fish stocks and fear of considerable
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing in the Barents Sea.
This led the Norwegian Coast Guard to attempt to arrest Russian fishing
vessels on several occasions, resulting in reactions from Russian
fishermen, as well as officials in Murmansk and Moscow.2) In 1998, 2001,
2005, and 2011 specifically, incidents had the potential to escalate
beyond a fisheries issue.

Today, the **[risk of events spiralling out of control]{.underline}** in
the FPZ **[remains a primary concern for both the Norwegian Coast Guard
and]{.underline}** the Norwegian **[Ministry of Defence.]{.underline}**
Echoing these fears, in 2017 the Russian Defence Ministry deemed
Svalbard a potential area for future conflict with Norway, and in
consequence NATO.3) Given the potential volatility of events in the FPZ,
how do **[Norway and Russia]{.underline}** manage to **[avoid escalation
in the case of a crisis]{.underline}**? Two intertwining relationships
are integral to answering this.

Interest alignment

First, **[cooperation can be the product of discord]{.underline}**. In
other words, states cooperate when they disagree. Sometimes
**[institutions are needed to overcome the self-help tendencies of the
international system]{.underline}**. Along this line of argumentation,
**[cooperation between Norway and Russia concerning shared fish stocks,
oil spill response, search and rescue, and ship traffic management are
formalised arrangements]{.underline}** set up **[to
manage]{.underline}** potential areas of **[discord]{.underline}**.
Along the same line of argumentation, the Barents Sea maritime boundary
agreement in 2010 was a result of interests between the two states
converging sufficiently.4)

In other words, **[the reason why Norway and Russia]{.underline}**
manage to **[keep crises from escalating]{.underline}** further **[is
mutual interest in preserving]{.underline}** aspects of their
**[cooperation]{.underline}**; cooperation that benefits both parties.
This relates to multiple issue areas. Concerning resource management,
Russia is assumed to be satisfied with the current quota scheme, in
contrast to what might be achieved if an actual debate over the status
of the FPZ took place.5) Concerning the UNCLOS-regime, **[both
parties]{.underline}** **[benefit from a stable legal
regime]{.underline}** in the FPZ specifically, but also **[in the
Arctic]{.underline}** at large.6) And concerning national security,
**[both]{.underline}** parties **[have an interest in low levels of
conflict for fear of coercive efforts by other actors within and outside
the Barents/Arctic region]{.underline}**.7)

The interests that drive cooperation might, however, be subject to
change (over time). We can see changes taking place within all the
issue-areas addressed: as climate change continues to alter the marine
resource base in the Barents Sea; as external actors challenge the
validity of the UNCLOS-regime in the Arctic; or as the power relations
between various actors fluctuate. The institutions set up to manage
cooperation are also challenged and questions of institutional
resilience become salient: how will cooperative mechanisms adapt as
conditions influencing the premise for cooperation change?8)

For example, as Norway and Russia struggled to reach agreement on a
reduction of annual quotas for the Barents Sea in the early 2000s,
several institutional measures were taken. In 2002, a harvest control
rule was introduced in the Joint Fisheries Commission to set quotas
according to scientific advice while also limiting fluctuations from
year to year. This has been described as the most important change in
the work of the Commission, removing a source of friction between the
two states (which had spill-over effects into the FPZ).9)

Talking to your neighbour

Second, **[as emphasised by officials in the Norwegian Coast
Guard]{.underline}**, former Coast Guard officers, **[and]{.underline}**
multiple **[scholarly works]{.underline}** written on the management of
shared fish stocks in the Barents Sea, **[personal contact between
individuals constitute a core element of conflict
management]{.underline}** in the Barents Sea. **[The importance of
dialogue during a crisis is given]{.underline}** much **[credit for
solving incidents between the Norwegian Coast Guard and Russian fishing
vessels]{.underline}**. This includes communication between the Coast
Guard and Russian trawlers (including the use of Russian interpreters);
between the Norwegian Joint Military Headquarters and the Chief of the
Russian Northern Fleet at Severomorsk; and between the negotiating
groups in the Joint Fisheries Commission.

**[Having various means of communicating, and keeping channels
open]{.underline}** as a crisis is unfolding, **[constitute central
elements in the management of conflict]{.underline}** in the FPZ. This
can be linked to the notion of 'track two diplomacy', albeit without an
immediate large-scale international crisis as an impetus. Still,
**[instilling so called low-level or 'soft' dialogue]{.underline}** in
addition **[to other more formal channels]{.underline}** of
communication, **[have]{.underline}** -- in this case -- **[provided an
effective approach to conflict management]{.underline}**.10)

This concerns the larger concept of personal relations, as social
contact between two or more individuals representing different sides in
a dispute. The theory of socialisation emphasises not only the
communication component, but also the fact that a change occurs between
the parties. Norms (expected behaviour) socialise (change) actors
according to a logic of appropriateness.11) **[By interacting regularly
with the same individuals on the same issues]{.underline}** (fisheries,
quotas, inspections) **[over time, mutual understanding emerges as the
individuals]{.underline}** themselves **[better comprehend the position
of the other party.]{.underline}**

Maintaining low tension

**[Personal relations]{.underline}** have **[formed]{.underline}** the
basis for the **[institutionalisation of]{.underline}** some of the
**[mechanisms]{.underline}** described above, **[that enable cooperation
between Norway and Russia]{.underline}** in this specific instance.
Examples include the exchange of coast guard officers from Norway and
Russia, as well as the formalised sharing of information and annual
meetings between the Chiefs of the coast guards. This
institutionalisation and its relevance for the issues at hand in the
Barents Sea at large, and the FPZ specifically, played a central part in
sheltering the coast guard cooperation from sanctions and restrictions
put in place between Norway and Russia in 2014.12) **[There
is]{.underline}** thus **[a feedback loop taking place between
institutionalisation and personal interactions.]{.underline}**

This article does not attempt to outline a monocausal explanation for
success in maritime dispute management. Instead, the aim is to showcase
how **[multiple explanations]{.underline}** **[emphasising different
aspects of conflict relations contribute to the outcome]{.underline}**.
In sum, several factors concerning the dispute in the Svalbard Zone help
explain why it has been managed adequately in the context of a larger
quarrel.

Looking ahead, **[the writing on the wall is relatively clear: to
maintain low tension in the zone around Svalbard, Norway and
Russia]{.underline}** need both be aware of the factors that **[keep
their relations civil]{.underline}**. Upholding dialogue between the two
countries' coast guards regardless of fluctuating international
relations is crucial. So is establishing and re-developing cooperative
mechanisms such as the Joint Fisheries Commission, as the resource
situation in Arctic waters might change.

### No Escalation---Moral Hazard

#### No impact to moral hazard\-\--the [higher the hazard]{.underline}, the [less likely]{.underline} conflict occurs

**Benson 14**, Associate Professor of Political Science and Asian
Studies at Vanderbilt University (Brett, "Inducing Deterrence through
Moral Hazard in Alliance Contracts," *The Journal of Conflict
Resolution*, 58.2)

**[Do]{.underline}** military **[alliances cause allies to
act]{.underline}** so **[aggressively]{.underline}** that their behavior
undermines the security goal of the alliance? If so, then leaders may be
cautious about joining an alliance, doing so only if they can select
safe alliance partners or design the terms of the treaty in a way that
captures the deterrence benefits while managing the dangers of
overaggression. We show that **[while alliance commitments may cause
alliance partners to behave aggressively]{.underline}**, under some
conditions the **[added aggressiveness actually enhances
deterrence]{.underline}**. From this perspective, the effectiveness of
an alliance is related both to the structure and to the content of the
treaty.

This view stands in contrast to the standard explanation that the
content of an alliance agreement is designed to balance the benefit of
deterring an enemy against the risk of emboldening an ally (Fearon 1997;
Snyder 1997; Yuen 2009). Our approach builds on existing models of
alliance formation (Morrow 1994; Smith 1995) but adds intra-alliance
contracting over the benefits from successful deterrence. Specifically,
avoiding a conflict that they otherwise might expect creates a surplus
equal to the foregone cost of war, which may be divided among alliance
partners.

To facilitate an understanding of the intuition, we suggest that
military alliances share many similarities with standard insurance
contracts. Much as an auto insurance policy stipulates how much a policy
holder will receive if he or she is in an accident, an alliance
agreement likewise often describes how much aid an ally will provide to
the attacked party if there is a war. For example, the 1656 Treaty of
Defensive Alliance between Brandenburg and France enumerates precisely
the amount and form of aid each ally would provide to the other if it
was attacked: Brandenburg pledged 2,400 men and 600 horses to France
while France promised 5,000 men, 1,200 horses, and artillery to
Brandenburg. In the 1893 Franco-Russian alliance, France promised to
supply 1.3 million troops and Russia pledged to contribute 700,000 to
800,000 troops in a conflict against Germany.1

Furthermore, in an insurance contract, the size of the insurance premium
the insured pays usually depends on the amount of risk being indemnified
by the insurance provider: the more risk for the insurer, the higher the
premium. Our explanation of the content of alliance commitments likewise
ties the level of support to the amount of security risk alliance
partners face. That is, leaders of threatened countries may look to team
up with each other, and the amount of support they promise one another
may depend on the amount of threat each faces. However, insurance
against risk carries with it the potential problem of moral hazard,
which occurs when the guarantee of indemnity distorts the insured\'s
behavior because the insurance policy insulates her from the risks of
her actions (Pauly 1968, 1974; Shavell 1979). Just as insured motorists
may exercise less caution in their driving, states insured by alliance
treaties have an incentive to behave more aggressively in negotiating
with other states.

Generally, scholars of alliances take the position that moral hazard
creates potentially harmful effects. Most notably, Snyder (1984, 1997)
and Christensen and Snyder (1990) claim that alliances "embolden" state
leaders to "entrap" unwilling allies in wars that they would prefer to
avoid. Yuen (2009) shows that moral hazard increases allied states'
level of aggression in crisis bargaining, and this added aggression may
heighten the risk of war or affect the bargaining settlements. **[As a
result of the potential harmful effects of moral hazard, scholars argue
that leaders may]{.underline}** either **[avoid]{.underline}**
**[alliances]{.underline}**, screen alliance partners based on their
likelihood of behaving recklessly, or attempt to design treaties
carefully so as to balance their dueling goals of deterring external
threats while restraining alliance partners (Snyder 1984, 1997; Jervis
1994; Zagare and Kilgour 2003, 2006; Yuen 2009).

A more subtle side effect of moral hazard, however, is that states may
be attracted to alliances because the tendency of an ally to behave
aggressively actually enhances deterrence. The possibility that an
allied state will negotiate aggressively may cause third-party
adversaries to refrain from initiating a crisis. Likewise, a defensive
alliance might make an alliance partner more willing to retaliate if
challenged because it benefits from its ally's support in war; this may
cause a prospective adversary to be reluctant to initiate a challenge
targeting the alliance partner (Smith 1995).

In cases where **[moral hazard advances the deterrence objective of an
alliance]{.underline}**, **[there is little cost to
entrapment]{.underline}**, **[because the]{.underline}** third-party
**[adversary calibrates its hostility toward the allies based
on]{.underline}** its **[expectation about its likelihood of winning a
conflict if the target of its challenge does not
capitulate]{.underline}**. **[The combination of added resources from an
ally and the increased willingness of the target to fight
back]{.underline}** **[encourages the third party to refrain from
initiating violence]{.underline}**. When encouraging an alliance partner
to fight back if it is attacked enhances deterrence, then the goal of
the contract is to induce a maximal amount of moral hazard so as to
deter potential aggressors to such an extent that the risk of conflict
is negligible. In this case, allies are not called upon to expend costly
resources in support of their partners, as **[no conflict
occurs]{.underline}**. **[Thus]{.underline}**, a priori, **[it seems
equally likely that moral hazard will deter]{.underline}** would-be
challenges or increase the likelihood of **[conflict]{.underline}**.
Therefore, an important challenge for a theory of alliances is to
identify the conditions under which moral hazard serves the deterrence
purpose of the alliance rather than causing harmful effects that
undermine the alliance's objective.

### No Escalation---Diplomacy

#### [Even if]{.underline} entrapment's true, it's [never]{.underline} driven escalation -- nuclear umbrella encourages [peaceful]{.underline} resolution

In this article, **[we explore the relationship between nuclear
umbrellas, militarized conflict, and crisis bargaining]{.underline}**.
**[Drawing on existing bargaining theories of war, we argue that,
because war is costly, both parties in a crisis have an incentive to
avoid fighting]{.underline}**. This implies that---**[in
equilibrium]{.underline}**---the **[impact of a nuclear umbrella on the
risk of war between a client state protected under a nuclear umbrella
and a potential target should generally be zero, assuming information is
complete, commitments are credible, and the stakes are
divisible]{.underline}**. However, this does not mean that such
commitments are benign, or that they pose no risk to potential targets
and nuclear patrons. Instead, **[we argue that a client state's
expectation that its power will be augmented in the event of war (by
that of its nuclear patron) will make it more likely to expand the scope
of its demands and seek to revise the status quo.]{.underline}** Because
war is generally ex post inefficient, leaders of target states are
likely to offer concessions in the amount that reflects the changed
balance of power, rather than fight a costly war. Thus, we argue that
**[the risk of moral hazard from nuclear umbrellas should be observable
in the bargaining outcomes short of war, if not in the observable
patterns of militarized conflict]{.underline}**.

**[We begin by investigating whether nuclear umbrellas generate a risk
of moral hazard by increasing the risk of]{.underline}** militarized
interstate disputes (**[MIDs]{.underline}**). **[We find evidence that
protection under a nuclear umbrella slightly increases the risk that a
client state protected under a nuclear umbrella will initiate an MID
compared to a state that lacks this protection]{.underline}**.
**[However]{.underline}**, **[we find that this overall effect is driven
entirely by one-sided use of force initiated by the client state
protected under a nuclear umbrella that never escalates to the
reciprocal use of force by the target state.]{.underline}** At the same
time that targets appear to avoid the reciprocal use of force, **[we
find strong evidence that a client state's protection under a nuclear
umbrella is positively associated with the likelihood that a crisis will
include a peaceful settlement attempt and an increased likelihood that a
target will offer policy concessions to the client state.]{.underline}**
Together, the results along both dimensions---conflict and bargaining
outcomes---are consistent with the observable implications of the
theory.

Conclusion

In this article, we address a long-standing question in the academic and
policy communities about the role of nuclear umbrellas in broader
interstate relations. Specifically, we examine how client states behave
under the protection of a nuclear patron by investigating two important
dimensions of behavior: the initiation of militarized disputes and
bargaining outcomes short of war. We find that, although **[client
states protected under a nuclear umbrella]{.underline}** are no more
likely to initiate MIDs against a target state that escalate to war or
the reciprocated use of force, these states, nevertheless,
**[appear]{.underline}** more **[emboldened to initiate crises.
However]{.underline}**, **[these crises tend not to escalate to higher
levels of militarized conflict because target states appear to act in
equilibrium: preferring to settle disputes peacefully rather than resist
militarily through costly fighting]{.underline}**. We find that
**[client states]{.underline}** protected **[under a nuclear umbrella
are]{.underline}** more **[often]{.underline}** the **[recipients of
policy concessions from]{.underline}** their **[targets compared to
states that lack protection]{.underline}** under a nuclear umbrella.
Together, these results provide comprehensive support for our argument
that there is some risk of moral hazard in a client state protected
under a nuclear umbrella, as clients appear more emboldened and more
successful at revising the status quo in expectation of a patron coming
to their aid. The urgency to understand the strategic consequences of
nuclear umbrellas is perhaps most real today, as the United States seeks
to rebalance its overall security portfolio to the Asia-Pacific in
anticipation of a rising China and to provide additional assurances to
its allies in the Middle East in light of potential proliferation
challenges. And yet, we have surprisingly little evidence that such
commitments are effective at reducing the risk of conflict on net, given
the widely presumed, but still untested, risk for moral hazard in the
client state. Meanwhile, policymakers in the United States and abroad
continue to propose expanding the US nuclear umbrella while further
reassuring allies covered within it. Our research suggests that the
expansion of the nuclear umbrella may perversely exacerbate the concerns
of potential targets and inadvertently destabilize the status quo by
increasing the risk of a crisis and the opportunity for bargaining to
fail. If client states protected under a nuclear umbrella are encouraged
to pursue more aggressive military and diplomatic policies toward other
states, this may pose an increased risk of conflict to patrons,
particularly as nuclear patrons like the United States seek to
strengthen and reaffirm their commitments to their allies. Of course,
this risk must be balanced against any risk of moral hazard that might
flow from a client state protected under a nuclear umbrella, or any
potential nonnuclear state, acquiring its own nuclear weapons in the
absence of such commitments (N. Narang 2015). **[It may very well be the
case that nuclear umbrellas cause]{.underline}** emboldenment/**[moral
hazard, but]{.underline}** that **[this is nonetheless preferable to the
nuclear emboldenment that would result if the state acquired nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** (Kapur 2007). In so far as the net effect is
unclear, it is possible that **[policymakers might want to persist in
offering nuclear umbrellas to states in order to prevent proliferation
despite their moral hazard inducing consequences]{.underline}** (Mehta
2017).16

### No Escalation---No Interest

#### No great power entrapment -- conflicts stay local 

Elizabeth **Calos 12** --- (Elizabeth Calos; Published: 2012; \"The
Weakest Link: Credible Deterrence Threats and Alliance Entrapment\";

This **[argument has been supported by the data gathered from the
Correlates of War Project]{.underline}**. The data showed that for
**[both weak and medium powered states, alliance membership with a
conflict originator had a significant impact on the decision of the
state to enter into a conflict]{.underline}** that it did not initiate.
However, the same level of significance was not found for high-powered
states. Thus, the first hypothesis, that a **[great power or strong
state will not necessarily feel compelled to join in conflicts initiated
by alliance partners because the state is stable enough that changes in
the strength of alliance member do not impact the security of the state,
has been supported by this study]{.underline}**. The second hypothesis,
that a weak or medium power state will be compelled to join in conflicts
initiated by alliance partners, even when the conflict may go against
the state\'s desires or the mandate of the alliance has also been
supported by the data. This indicates that the explanation of alliance
behavior backed by the logic of rational deterrence is more accurate
than the explanations provided by the grievance model, which predicts
that this joining behavior would not occur across all three groups, or
the Rubicon model, which predicts that it would occur uniformly across
the groups.
