[Given that the eastern Europeans perceive the threat from Russia as
existential, they are not going to compromise on their reliance on NATO
and United States in favor of a more (Western) European-centered
security arrangement]{.underline}. Current and future U.S
administrations may opt to deepen ties with them not only to counter
Russia, but also to keep in check any real moves towards strategic
autonomy by Europe's Western nations. That was, in essence, Trump's
policy. With its enhanced military deployments in eastern Europe, Biden
is continuiung it, even if cloaked in a more friendly language towards
the "allies." [France, Germany, and Italy, as a consequence, will be
incentivized to pull themselves more tightly together to preserve their
relevance and interests]{.underline}, particularly if, as expected, the
economic situation becomes more dire and calls for an end to war grow
more vocal. That also explains these countries' relative lack of
enthusiasm (except in the German Green Party) towards the prospects of
Ukraine's membership in both EU and NATO --- in their view, such moves
will further displace Europe's geopolitical center of gravity towards
the east, with the concomitant increase of American influence at their
expense. [The more prolonged the war in Ukraine, the more divergent
national perspectives within NATO]{.underline} and the EU **[will pull
its members in different directions]{.underline}**. [The talk of
transatlantic unity will do little to address the emerging
cleavages.]{.underline}

### Split Over Ukraine

#### Lack of unity and coherence on strategy \-\-- splits on Ukraine strategy

NATO and EU leaders have spoken warmly of the unity demonstrated by
member states, and across the continent, [European allies have set in
motion spending hikes that could reverse decades of]{.underline}
swingeing [cuts]{.underline} imposed since the end of the Cold War.
Traditionally nonmilitarily-aligned Finland and Sweden have submitted
requests to join NATO, and a Danish referendum has chosen to end the
country's long-standing opt-out to Europe's Common Security and Defense
Policy (CSDP). Many European countries, along with Australia, Canada and
the U.S., have supplied ever-increasing amounts of weapons and equipment
to Ukraine while backfilling equipment into those Eastern European
countries that are transferring Soviet-era gear eastward. [Yet as the
war approaches its 150th day**, fractures are appearing**]{.underline}.
[Nations appear divided over how the conflict should end]{.underline},
[either through negotiated settlement between Kyiv and Moscow or the
complete removal of Russian forces from Ukrainian soil.]{.underline}
[There is also disagreement over how to manage the social, political and
economic impact that the conflict and sanctions imposed on Russia are
having on everyday life in Europe]{.underline}, **[as energy prices
skyrocket]{.underline}** and propel inflation to historic highs.
Questions remain about the levels of military equipment to supply to
Ukraine, too, as well as where Europe's renewed defense spending should
be directed, where equipment will be sourced and whether---after years
of cuts---armed forces will have the resources to absorb the vast
amounts of equipment they are gearing up to buy. "European unity has
been much stronger than \[Russian President Vladimir\] Putin probably
would have expected," says Bastian Giegerich, the director of defense
and military analysis at the London-based International Institute for
Strategic Studies. "But [my worry is that we are past peak coherence on
this matter]{.underline} . . . [and beginning to see some splits
emerge]{.underline}." He [cites recent struggles among EU members to
agree on new sanctions packages]{.underline}. "This doesn't mean it will
all fall apart, but I think **[it'll be more difficult now to keep the
pressure on]{.underline}**," he adds.

#### Ukraine support low now

In addition, [the cost-of-living crisis, economic, and energy security
factors are likely to test European member states' support for
Ukraine]{.underline} as the autumn and winter loom. [This has already
divided NATO member states]{.underline} [between those who wish to see a
full Russian withdrawal]{.underline} and for Ukraine to regain control
of the entirety of its territory, [versus those who think Kyiv should
accept a peace settlement with Russia]{.underline} to avert further
bloodshed and economic pain in Europe. Poland, the Baltic states, the
US, and the UK fall into the first camp, whilst France, Germany,
Hungary, Italy, and several others fall into the second. The alliance
may now be formally united in recognizing the scale of the threat from
Russia, but [it is not united as to the degree that that threat should
trump individual member states' economic and security
needs]{.underline}. '[Ukraine fatigue' is already setting
in]{.underline} and it looks likely to increase as the months drag on[,
something that Moscow is all too eager to exploit.]{.underline}

#### NATO ununified and not set on plan

**Global Times 7/30** \[Global Times; "'Unity of NATO' a disguise of its
existential crisis"; June 30, 2022;

On the issue of the Russia-Ukraine conflict alone, there are different
demands among Western countries, as Germany, France and Italy want to
stop the war as soon as possible, and the US is calling on all NATO
countries to make a common cause against Russia. Wang Shuo, a professor
at the School of International Relations of Beijing Foreign Studies
University, believes that in this situation, **[many European countries
are questioning whether NATO can solve the crisis in
Ukraine.]{.underline}** If it cannot work, what\'s the point of NATO\'s
existence? At the moment when Europeans believe that [NATO needs to play
a role, it proved itself disunited and incompetent, another sign of
NATO\'s existential crisis.]{.underline}

#### Current strategy fails and no cohesion 

**Than 7/23** \[Krisztina, manager of Hungarian relations at Reuters;
"Orban urges new EU strategy on Ukraine, says sanctions have failed";
July 23, 2022;
<https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungarys-orban-calls-new-eu-strategy-ukraine-war-says-sanctions-failed-2022-07-23/>;
Accessed 7/25/22\]

\"A new strategy is needed which should focus peace talks and drafting a
good peace proposal\...instead of winning the war,\" Orban said in a
speech in Romania.

Orban, reelected for a fourth consecutive term in April, reiterated that
Hungary - a NATO member - would stay out of the war in neighbouring
Ukraine.

He is facing his toughest challenge since taking power in 2010, with
inflation in double digits, a weak forint and EU funds still held up
amid a dispute with Brussels over democratic standards.

[Orban has said before that Hungary is unwilling to support EU
embargoes]{.underline} or limitations on Russian gas imports as that
would undermine its economy, which is about 85% reliant on Russian gas
imports.

He said in his speech that the Western strategy on Ukraine has been
built on four pillars - that Ukraine can win a war against Russia with
NATO weapons, that sanctions would weaken Russia and destabilise its
leadership, that sanctions would hurt Russia more than Europe, and that
the world would line up in support of Europe.

Orban said [this strategy has failed as governments in Europe are
collapsing \"like dominoes\", energy prices have surged and a new
strategy was needed now]{.underline}.

\"We are sitting in a car that has a puncture in all four tyres: [it is
absolutely clear that the war cannot be won in this way,\"]{.underline}
Orban told his supporters.

He said [Ukraine will never win the war this way]{.underline} \"quite
simply because [the Russian army has assymetrical
dominance\".]{.underline}

Orban said there was no chance for peace talks between Russia and
Ukraine.

\"[As Russia wants security guarantees, this war can be ended only with
peace talks between Russia and America]{.underline},\" he said.

#### Fighting in squo 

**Pettypiece 6/29** \[Shannon, American print and broadcast journalist

The alliance will also make it clear in its so-called Strategic Concept
that it no longer views Russia as a "strategic partner" but as a "direct
threat to our security, to our values, to the rules-based international
order," he said at a news conference Monday.

But **[a number of questions remain this week, such as how to fund
efforts to build up NATO's defenses.]{.underline}** Just nine of the
member countries are meeting the NATO target of spending 2 percent of
their gross domestic product on defense, an amount that Stoltenberg said
is becoming the "floor and not the ceiling."

"This constitutes the biggest increase of our collective defense and
deterrence since the Cold War, and to do this we need to invest more,"
he said.

[Defense costs are rising as many countries feel the economic effects of
rising inflation]{.underline}, particularly soaring energy prices, and
German officials have warned that Germany could slip into a recession if
Russia were to further cut the amount of gas it is piping to the
country.

While the U.S. and Canada have already banned all Russian oil imports,
the European Union is taking a more gradual approach, aiming to stop
importing Russian oil by the end of the year. But the move has been
opposed by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has been an ally
of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

[China has been another area of differing approaches among NATO
members]{.underline}. The group is expected for the first time to
discuss the "challenges Beijing poses to our security interests and
values," Stoltenberg said. While [Biden has pushed for a hard line on
China, other member countries have been hesitant in how far to
go,]{.underline} given their economic dependence on China as a trading
partner.
