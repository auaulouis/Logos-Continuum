[While U.S. laws technically prohibit providing security assistance to
units found to violate human rights---the Leahy laws---the provisions
are riddled with loopholes and are too weak to effectively prioritize
human rights in U.S. security assistance]{.underline}.71 [Offices and
agencies responsible for elevating human rights in U.S. foreign policy,
such as the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor, are too often cut out of the decision-making process for security
assistance programs---especially those run out of the
Pentagon]{.underline}. At the same time, the [Pentagon]{.underline}
maintains its own [security assistance accounts,]{.underline} such as
Section 127e, that [are not required to conduct human rights vetting and
operate with little transparency---furthering opportunities to
militarize foreign policy]{.underline}.72 And often, such as in the case
of Egypt, security assistance is accompanied by paltry amounts of
democracy, human rights, and governance funding (DRG), or
[certifications on human rights are waived entirely, to make providing
arms more palatable.]{.underline}73 These small DRG funds or
certification stops do little to change the underlying political
challenges or are sometimes even hampered by the regime the United
States is funding.

#### The "credible information" standard of proof to substantiate violations is [vague]{.underline}, [inconsistent]{.underline}, AND [subjective]{.underline}, causing [overbreadth]{.underline} or [non-enforcement]{.underline} -- BOTH of which are [detrimental]{.underline} to the [effectiveness]{.underline} of [Leahy Law]{.underline} broadly -- shifting to probable cause is key

III\. Issue 1: Credibly Informed - Clarifying the Standard of Proof in
Leahy Cases

As a Leahy practitioner working in a U.S. embassy or military
headquarters, you are tasked with deciding whether a recent allegation
of a gross violation of human rights is sufficient to Leahy-bar the
security force unit that supposedly committed it. The at-issue unit is
critically important to both U.S. and the host-nation\'s defense
strategy and relies heavily on U.S. security assistance, funding, and
support. The allegation, made by a well-respected non-governmental
organization (\"NGO\"), consists of the vague statements of a handful of
undisclosed sources. You now have to decide; does this meet the Leahy
standard? Should the U.S. cease all support? The implications of this
decision are huge, but as you look at your existing guidance and
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), you find yourself in an incredibly
difficult position; how do you make the call?

Currently, [the **[standard of proof]{.mark}** necessary [to
substantiate]{.mark} a **Leahy [violation]{.mark}** [is \"**credible
info**]{.mark}**rmation**\"]{.underline} that a gross violation of human
rights occurred. However, [this wasn\'t always the case]{.underline}.
The current standard was created in 2011. [Before that, Leahy
laws]{.underline} used the standard created in the early
counter-narcotic days which [required \"**credible evidence**\"
instead]{.underline}. The change from \"evidence\" to \"information\"
was made to address confusion in the practitioner community.
[Practitioners were reading the term \"evidence\" and assuming that it
invoked the types of **evidentiary protections** afforded in a **court
proceeding**. This was never the intent of Leahy\'s
drafters.]{.underline} In a 1999 conference report for the Omnibus
Consolidated Emergency Supplemental, the conferees clarified that \"by
\"credible evidence\' \[we\] do not intend that the evidence must be
admissible in a court of law.\" 73The term [\"evidence\" was **never
intended** to be used in the same sense as the **F**ederal **R**ules of
**E**vidence, but that **intent was lost** on many
practitioners.]{.underline}

[Practitioners **continued to assume** evidentiary considerations
existed in the law]{.underline}. Perhaps due to the appearance of
evidence law in Leahy determinations, [Congress acted to **cure the
confusion**]{.underline}. In 2012 the term [\"evidence\" was removed and
replaced with the modern standard: \"credible
information.\"]{.underline} The rationale for this change was explicitly
stated in the conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act
of 2012: \"\[The Act\] substituted \"credible information\' for
\"credible evidence\' in order [to clarify that the information need not
be admissible in a court of law to be credible]{.underline} and to
conform to similar wording in a comparable provision 74in the Defense
Appropriations Act.\" 75

A. What is the Standard?

With the 2012 amendment, the problem of deciphering \"evidence\" was
solved. It is likely that those drafting the amendment [believed there
would no longer be any problem in deciphering the standard of
proof]{.underline} in Leahy cases. \"Credible information,\" the new
standard, would [make it easier for practitioners to make more uniform,
predictable determinations. Yet despite Congress\'s good intentions,
there remained a **glaring issue**, [**no one** has **any idea**
what]{.mark} \"**credible information**\" **[actually
means]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In a 2017 RAND Corporation study, a number of interviews were conducted
with DoD and DoS Leahy [practitioners]{.underline} to acquire a more
precise picture of how Leahy functions in the field. 76One of the
concerns documented in the report was that many of the interviewees were
[unsure how to determine the meaning of \"credible
information.\"]{.underline} 77There is [no official
**D**]{.underline}epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense definition for the term in law or in any
supplemental [guidance]{.underline} that has been released. 78The DoS
has recently released guidance which includes a definition of the term,
79but [[practitioners]{.mark} continually [express
**confusion**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the [DoD has expressly stated
that it will not use the same definition provided by DoS]{.underline}.
80The RAND study found that out of 16 DoS Leahy vetting Standard
Operating Procedures (\"SOPs\") they collected, only one included a
definition. 81One interviewee requested clarification from the
Department of State headquarters, and was told it was up to the post to
decide the meaning. 82Interviewees reported [significant differences
between]{.underline} their [interpretation]{.underline} of the standard,
and the interpretation used at the DoS headquarters. 83

The Department of Defense Inspector General (\"DODIG\"), found the same
thing; [there is **[no formal standard]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In a
November 2017 report, 84DODIG interviewed one official, who stated,
\"the [credibility of information is determined on a **case-by-case**
basis and]{.underline} the knowledge of doing so is gained through doing
the job and having experience.\" Another official called the standard
\"[[very **subjective**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" According to the DODIG
report, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy
(\"OUSD(P)\"), the office responsible for managing the [DoD\'s Leahy
portfolio, was \"**unable to articulate** the **methodology** used\...to
determine whether the information was credible.]{.underline} They simply
stated that \[representatives\] always reach a consensus and that it was
a judgement call decided on a case-by-case basis.\" 85DODIG concluded
that \"[there is **no record** of the **reasoning** behind any
**credible information** determinations, and there is **[no]{.mark}**
specific **[guidance]{.mark}** or **criteria** for making these
decisions\... As a result, there is a [risk]{.mark} of
**[inconsistency]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the OUSD(P)\'s process
could be deficient in identifying credible information to comply with
DoD Leahy Law.\" 86

In addition to issues defining the standard, there is also great concern
with the reliability of the information that is actually used. 87The
reliability of source information was an issue that came up multiple
times in the RAND study. 88One DoS official noted that the evidentiary
threshold for credible information was relatively low but that
information from questionable sources was weighed and valued differently
at different stages of the vetting process. 89One interviewee described
a \"hierarchy of information sources\" wherein he weighed \"official
reporting as \"reliable,\' other media as \"mixed,\' and social media as
\"very fuzzy 90.\'\" 91The RAND study concluded the discussion on the
topic by stating: \"stakeholders perceived final determinations on
information credibility to be opaque and inconsistent. This was
frustrating not only for DoD officials implementing assistance programs
but also for partners themselves. As one \[Combatant Command\] official
noted: \"Failure to apply appropriate rigor to adjudication prior to the
suspension of assistance may negatively impact bilateral relationships
and partner nation willingness to investigate and address legitimate
allegations.\" 92

Clearly, [the standard used in Leahy cases, \"credible information,\" is
**[vague]{.mark}**]{.underline}, often [**[misunderstood]{.mark}**, and
[subject to **disparate treatment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is an
[obvious [**impediment** to]{.mark} practitioner **confidence** and
**uniform [application]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a standard across the
Federal Government, but the problem extends even further.

B. Effects of Poor Interpretation

As detailed above, there are abundant difficulties in assessing what
information should be relied upon in making credibility determinations,
and how to properly weigh them. [[Without **clarity**]{.mark}, there is
a high probability that [determinations can be **overly narrow**
or]{.mark} **overly [broad]{.mark}**]{.underline} and ultimately affect
units that have done nothing wrong. The study conducted by the RAND
Corporation uncovered a number of cautionary tales that clearly
illustrate this concern. 93In one situation, a well-known human rights
advocacy organization made allegations that a partner nation security
force had committed gross violations of human rights. 94The local
Leahy-vetting officials at the embassy were able to work extensively
with the partner nation and other NGOs in the area to provide enough
background information to refute the allegations; but without extensive
efforts by the embassy staff, that unit could have been barred from U.S.
assistance based on false information. 95It is easy to see how this can
be a problem for U.S. bilateral relations; [just **one false report**
from an NGO and the U.S. completely shuts down security assistance.
Guilty until proven innocent]{.underline}.

It can also be difficult to explain the Leahy process to partner
nations. \"[Too often, partners see Leahy merely as a bureaucratic
impediment and have little understanding of their role in creating a
smooth process]{.underline}.\" 96This is [exasperated by the relatively
[**amorphous nature** of]{.mark} the \"**credible information**\"
[standard]{.mark}]{.underline}. To many partner nations, [this can
simply [look like]{.mark} a convoluted way of **disguising [capricious
intent]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the part of the United States. A
disgruntled partner nation may believe: \"The U.S. doesn\'t want to
support us so they came up with this nonsense to justify their
actions.\"

C. Difficulties of Interpretation

The previous section detailed an example of false information being
relied upon in Leahy vetting. This is a problem that has been documented
in multiple countries and with multiple partner nations. 97It is not,
however, the only example of over-breath in application. There have also
been allegations that some of the \"derogatory information\" relied upon
in Leahy-vetting credibility determinations had nothing to do with human
rights abuses. The RAND Corporation study found incidents of units being
Leahy-barred due to an individual having a driving under the influence
charge. 98These are all indicative of a larger issue, [the \"credible
information\" [standard is **hard to apply**]{.mark} to real
cases.]{.underline}

One example of this difficulty was experienced by the author during a
recent deployment to Afghanistan. In April of 2017, The United Nations
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (\"UNAMA\") released a report on the
treatment of conflict-related detainees. 99The report consists of
interviews conducted with 469 conflict-related detainees in 62 detention
facilities in 29 provinces across Afghanistan. 100It concluded that 39
percent of detainees gave \"credible and reliable accounts of having
experienced torture or other forms of inhuman or degrading treatment
whilst in the custody of \[the Afghan National Defense and Security
Forces (ANDSF)\].\" 101Clearly, this is unacceptable, and if true, it
constitutes the precise type of human rights abuses that Leahy aims to
address. This would have been a perfect time to invoke Leahy if not for
a single serious problem, the report didn\'t provide any information
about the actual incidents. In reading the report, there are broad
references to a number of torture-related incidents taking place by
organizations in certain areas, 102but the particulars of specific cases
were never released.

This [[creates]{.mark} a **[frustrating]{.mark} Leahy-[vetting
issue]{.mark}**: Did these reports constitute \"**credible
information**\" [of]{.mark} **gross [violations]{.mark}** of **h**uman
**r**ights committed by the units in these areas]{.underline}?
Potentially. There was enough information to identify the area and
organization that was responsible, but [there was no information about
the **specific incidents** of torture]{.underline}. In trusting the
highly-respected United Nations agency, [the U.S. could make a
credibility determination]{.underline} on the word of the UNAMA report
alone, [but [there would]{.mark} still [be an **overbreadth
problem**]{.mark}.]{.underline} If only one police station, military
unit, or other organization was at fault, it would be unnecessarily
damaging to the Afghan National Security and U.S.-Afghan relations to
Leahy-bar entire swaths of units based on the report. And [there
remained the issue of whether these incidents, if examined individually
by U.S. personnel, would meet the **Leahy standard**]{.underline}. It is
no wonder then, that [the DoD and DoS came to opposite conclusions in
this case]{.underline}. The DoS chose to believe UNAMA and find the
allegations credible while the DoD stated that \"in order to consider
that information credible, it would need a corroborating source or
additional evidence from UNAMA, beyond the statement in its report.\"
103

This issue is compounded when incidents receive national attention. In
July 2017, an article was released in The Washington Post entitled,
\"Afghan soldiers are using boys as sex slaves, and the U.S. is looking
the other way.\" 104The article details the author\'s experience with an
unnamed Afghan police commander showing off his prized Bacha Bazi boy.
Bacha Bazi is a terrible practice that exists in some parts of
Afghanistan involving wealthy men \"acquiring\" dancing slave boys and
forcing them to dance for their guests, and occasionally perform sexual
favors. 105The practice has been condemned by the United Nations 106and
is also clearly the type of behavior that should invoke Leahy. The
Washington Post article criticizes the U.S. for not doing enough to stop
the practice and even invokes the Leahy Law by name: \"\[ignoring\]
~~turning a blind eye to~~ crimes such as Bacha Bazi amounts to a
serious contravention of America\'s Leahy amendment, which bans U.S.
assistance or training to foreign military units that fail to honor
basic human rights.\" 107The article, which garnered hundreds of
comments and thousands of shares on social media, presented difficulties
for Leahy practitioners: despite the overwhelming pressure to respond to
the incident detailed in the article, how do you address it without more
specific information? And, if you don\'t invoke Leahy, what ground can
you stand on when responding to the public outcry?

[[Without]{.mark} a **[clear]{.mark}ly defined [standard]{.mark}** [of
**proof**, or **review**]{.mark}, it is difficult to provide a **clear
answer** about the \"correct\" actions in any of these cases. The
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} risks damaging relationships and tainting
innocent units if it applies the standard too broadly, and [[risks
**failing**]{.underline}]{.mark} the \"front page test\" in the
Washington Post [[for not applying]{.mark} the standard **[strictly
enough]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Further, in either instance, [[there is
not a lot of **legal ground**]{.mark} to stand on in **justifying the
position**.]{.underline} The [practitioners cannot point to the
\"credible information\" standard for explanation because the [standard
is **poorly understood** and too **inconsistently
applied**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [solution]{.underline}, then, [is to
change the standard to something that can more **easily** be
**understood** and **applied** by practitioners]{.underline}, and better
explain decisions to the press, partner nations, and the American
public. Which brings us to the first suggested change presented by this
Article: [[change]{.mark} \"[credible info]{.mark}rmation\" [to
\"**probable cause**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
often [claims to be a **beacon of freedom** and **democratic
government**]{.underline}. 263 [Much of its **moral
[legitimacy]{.mark}** [in **foreign affairs** is based]{.mark}
up[on]{.mark} its [efforts to ensure]{.mark} **freedom** and
**[democracy]{.mark}** around the world. When its **[allies]{.mark}**
are found to **commit** **[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
**[violations]{.mark}** - with the acquiescence or encouragement of U.S.
officials - it [**undermines** this]{.mark} **moral
legitimacy**]{.underline}. And, [where the **h**uman **r**ights
**violations** are **enabled** even in part by U.S. **funding** and
**training**, the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[**limits** its own **access** to the **moral high
ground**.]{.underline}

The [**[Leahy Law]{.mark}** is an **attempt** to **[enhance]{.mark}**
U.S. **moral [legitimacy]{.mark}** in **foreign affairs**. As the law
stands, however, [it does **a poor job**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Without
considerable changes in the language of the legislation, the Leahy Law
will still be [[vulnerable to]{.mark} executive **[pushback]{.mark}**
against **congressional influence**]{.underline}. Since history suggests
that pushback is inevitable, [it is up to Congress to create a
**stronger law**]{.underline}.

[[One way]{.mark} for Congress to strengthen the Leahy Law [would be to
make **larger segments** of]{.mark} the **recipient [military
ineligible]{.mark}** [for **military aid**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
[this would]{.underline} deprive the Executive of some operational
flexibility, it [sends a much stronger message in favor of **h**uman
**r**ights. To **deny** a **recipient country** all **military aid**
would **greatly [improve]{.mark}** the **[deterrence]{.mark} effect** of
the **Leahy Law**]{.underline}. It would also effectively counter the
problem of arms being a fungible commodity. Even if the law were to
define unit at the division or corps level, [it would more effectively
[**secure compliance** with]{.mark} **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights **norms**.]{.underline}

Congress should also eliminate the disparity in language between the
Defense and Foreign Aid Appropriations Bills. Without violating the
Leahy Law, the Executive can arm questionable units if Congress approves
the funding under the Defense Appropriations Bill. If the law is not
changed, the United States will continue to claim that it cannot arm
those who have committed human rights violations while doing just that.

The [[**Judiciary** needs a]{.mark} **defined [role]{.mark}** [in
enforcing]{.mark} the **Leahy Law**]{.underline}, and without
congressional action this is impossible. Given the courts\' reluctance
to become involved in foreign affairs, Congress should clearly
articulate the boundaries of any potential cause of action. [[If
those]{.mark} who have been **[victimized]{.mark}** by **units**
receiving U.S. funding [can **sue**]{.mark} **in federal court**, [it
is]{.mark} **much [less likely]{.mark}** that **[units]{.mark}** will
**[commit]{.mark}** **h**uman **r**ights [**violations** or that]{.mark}
the **[Exec]{.mark}utive** will [**fund units** that]{.mark} could
**[commit]{.mark}** **h**uman **r**ights
**[violations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Involving the Judiciary does raise the potential for a defendant to
force either the United States or the recipient government to disclose
damaging secrets in court. However, narrowing the scope of inquiry could
alleviate concerns with graymail: did the United States provide funding
to a unit that committed a human rights violation? [Either an
[**injunction** or]{.mark} a **[verdict]{.mark}** with **damages**
attached [would]{.mark} **substantially [disincentivize]{.mark}**
funding units that could conceivably commit **h**uman **r**ights
**violations**.]{.underline}

Lastly, foreign military financing should be more transparent. In
addition to seeing which country receives funding, the public should see
how and on whom that money is spent. End-use monitoring should be
required and publicized. After all, if the goal of the legislation is to
prevent U.S. tax dollars from funding those who commit human rights
violations, U.S. taxpayers should be able to see that the objective is
accomplished. And if [the **goal** of the **[Leahy Law]{.mark}** is to
show the world that the **U**nited **S**tates pays more than **lip
services** to **human rights**, the world should be able to see that the
**U**nited **S**tates is **willing** to **stand by** that
**commitment**]{.underline}.

The Leahy Law is a well-intentioned piece of legislation that could be
drastically improved. Instead of being the latest casualty in the
long-running dispute between the Executive and Congress in foreign
policy decision-making, or a sop to the consciences of concerned
citizens, [it [should be]{.mark} **strengthened** and
**[enforced]{.mark}**. It could be an **important tool** [to]{.mark}
**enforce** **h**uman **r**ights]{.underline}, direct congressional
influence in foreign policy, [and [**increase** U.S.]{.mark} **moral
[legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And it might save a few lives.

#### Democracy solves extinction

Institute, Oxford. Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, Cambridge.
\"Democratising Risk: In Search of a Methodology to Study Existential
Risk\" <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2201/2201.11214.pdf> //pipk

[[There is a]{.mark}n intimate]{.underline} and neglected [[relationship
between existential risk and democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Democracy must be central to]{.mark} efforts [to prevent]{.mark} and
mitigate [catastrophic risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It is also an
antidote to many of the problems manifest in the TUA. Do those who study
the future of humanity have good grounds to ignore the visions, desires,
and values of the very people whose future they are trying to protect?
[Choosing which risks to take must be a democratic
endeavour]{.underline}.

We [understand democracy]{.underline} here in accordance with Landemore
[as the rule of the]{.underline} cognitively [diverse many who are
entitled to equal decision-making power and partake in a democratic
procedure that includes both a deliberative element and one of
preference aggregation]{.underline} (such as majority voting)45,115.
Decision-making procedures are not either democratic or non- democratic,
but instead lie on a spectrum. They can be more or less democratic,
inclusive, and diverse.

We posit [three reasons]{.underline} for why we should democratise
research and decision-making in existential risk: [the nature of
collective decision-making about human futures, the superiority of
democratic reason, and democratic fail-safe mechanisms.]{.underline}

**[Avoiding human extinction]{.underline}**, or crafting a desirable
long-term future, **[is a communal project]{.underline}**. Scholars of
existential risk who take an interest in the future of Homo sapiens are
choosing to consider the species in its entirety. If certain views are
excluded, the arguments for doing so must be compelling.

**[[Democracy will improve]{.mark} our [judgments]{.mark} in both the
governance and the study of existential risks]{.underline}**. [Asking
how our actions today influence [the long-term]{.mark} future [is one of
the most difficult intellectual tasks]{.mark} to unravel, and if there
is a right path, **[democratic procedures]{.mark}** will **[have the
best shot]{.mark} at finding it**]{.underline}. Hong and Page116,117
demonstrate **[[both theoretically and computationally]{.mark} that [a
diverse group]{.mark} of problem-solving agents [will show greater
accuracy]{.mark} than a less diverse group, even if the individual
members of the diverse group were each less accurate.]{.underline}**
**[Accuracy gains from diversity trump gains from improving individual
accuracy]{.underline}**. Landemore115, builds on this work to advance a
probabilistic argument that **[inclusive democracies will, in
expectation, make epistemically superior choices to oligarchies or even
the wise few]{.underline}**. This is [supported by promising results in
inclusive, deliberative democratic experiments from around the
world]{.underline} 118. [In the long run, democracies should commit
fewer mistakes than alternative decision-making procedures]{.underline}.
If this is true, it should improve the accuracy of research efforts and
decision-making. We are more likely to make accurate predictions about
the mechanisms of extinction, probable futures, and risk prevention if
the field invites cognitive diversity, builds flat institutional
structures, and avoids conflicts of interest.

Thereare many ways to consider the interests of the many. Democratic
assemblies could allow global citizens to deliberate about the futures
they prefer, citizens could be surveyed, and the field of ERS itself
could be diversified. At the moment, the field is, as many academic
disciplines are, unrepresentative of humanity at large and variably
homogenous in respect to income, class, ideology, age, ethnicity,
gender, nationality, religion, and professional background. The latter
issue is particularly true of existential risk, which, despite being an
inherently interdisciplinary endeavour, is at the highest levels
dominated by analytic moral philosophers. We need to be vigilant to what
perspectives are not represented in the study of existential risk. An
awareness of bias will go some way towards mitigating its negative
effects. To get close to replicating the cognitive diversity found among
humans, we must begin by inviting different thinkers with different
values and beliefs into the field.

**[[Democracies]{.mark} can [limit harms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Any
approach to [mitigating]{.mark} existential threats [could create
response risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the TUA seems particularly
vulnerable to this. [Despite good intentions and curiosity-driven
research, it could justify violence, dangerous technological
developments, or drastically constrain freedom in favour of (perceived)
security]{.underline}. If we hope to explore ideas but minimise harms,
[democracies can]{.underline} be used to [moderate]{.underline} the
[measures taken in response to harmful ideas]{.underline}. It seems, for
example, vanishingly unlikely that a diverse group of thinkers or even
ordinary citizens would entertain the idea of sacrificing 1 billion
living, breathing beings for an infinitesimal improvement in reaching an
intergalactic techno-utopia. In contrast, the TUA could recommend this
trade-off.

[The democratic constraint of extreme measures may simply be a form of
collective selfinterest. Voters are unlikely to tolerate global
catastrophic risks (GCRs), which incur the death of a sizeable portion
of the electorate, if they know they themselves could be
affected]{.underline}. We expect that scholars who do not support
sacrificing current lives in the name of abstract calculations, but
would still like to explore the use of expected value theory in
existential risk, will be in support of [[democratic fail-safe
mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Empirically]{.underline}]{.mark}, this fail-safe mechanism [seems to
[work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even deeply imperfect democracies, like the
ones we inhabit now, often avert detrimental outcomes.]{.underline}
[[Democracies prevent famines]{.underline}]{.mark} 119 (although not
malnutrition)120. They [make [war]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a significant
driver of GCRs --- [less likely]{.underline} 121. The [inclusion of
diverse preferences in democracies]{.underline}, such as those achieved
through women's suffrage, further [decreases the likelihood of violent
conflict]{.underline} 122. [Citizens]{.underline} often
[show]{.underline} a [significant risk aversion in comparison to their
government]{.underline}. While surveys are notoriously difficult to
collect and interpret, existing **[data suggest that [the public has
little support for nuclear weapons use]{.mark}]{.underline}** 123--125,
**[[but]{.mark} strong [support]{.mark} for [action against
climate]{.mark} catastrophe]{.underline}** 126--128. We can further show
that **[[when citizens]{.mark} deliberately [engage]{.mark} with the
subject at hand, their [concern and readiness]{.mark} for action often
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline}** 118. For example, [citizen assemblies
on climate change have recommended widespread policy-changes across
sectors, amendments to incentive structures and laws against ecocide to
reach emissions targets]{.underline} 129. Indeed, many lament that when
it comes to genetically modified organisms and nuclear power, citizens
are far too riskaverse130 . The problem is not that the public is
riddled with cognitive biases that make them unconcerned about global
catastrophes.

**[[Democratic debate cannot be an afterthought.]{.mark} Navigating
humanity through [crises will involve]{.mark} many value-laden decisions
under deep [uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Democratic procedures
can deal with such hard choices. Greater cognitive diversity should be
represented amongst scholars of ERS. Recommendations on [[policies that
would reduce risk should]{.mark} be passed through deliberative
assemblies and [await]{.mark} the [approval of]{.mark} a wider pool of
ordinary [citizens]{.mark}, as they will be the ones who will bear this
risk]{.underline}. A homogenous group of experts attempting to directly
influence powerful decision-makers is not a fair or safe way of
traversing the precipice.

### 2nc -- solvency

#### Adjusting the standard to "probable cause" increases [uniformity]{.underline} of [application]{.underline} through [legal precedent]{.underline} based on [established case law]{.underline} -- increasing the [credibility]{.underline} of [Leahy law]{.underline} AND [legitimacy]{.underline} of the [vetting process]{.underline} broadly

D. Probable Cause

\"[Of the amounts made available to the **D**]{.underline}epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense, [none may be used
for]{.underline} any [training]{.underline}, [equipment]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} other [assistance for]{.underline} a unit of [a foreign
security force if the Secretary of Defense has **[probable
cause]{.mark}** to believe that the unit has committed a gross
**violation** of **human rights**.]{.underline}\"

The solution proposed by this Article is to [[change]{.mark} the
[standard of proof]{.mark} in Leahy [to]{.mark} mirror an
**[established]{.mark} legal [standard]{.mark}** from elsewhere in
American **jurisprudence**]{.underline}. There are [two primary
benefits]{.underline} to this approach. First, you [provide the
practitioner community, partner nations, and the American public, with a
**familiar requirement** that has been **analyzed** and **scrutinized**
in countless cases]{.underline} over the course of the last 200 years.
Second, you [[provide practitioners with]{.mark} the entirety of
American [**jurisprudence** to **assist**]{.mark} them when **difficult
cases emerge**]{.underline}.

The justification provided above could support the use of any
established legal standard from \"reasonable suspicion\" through
\"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The decision about which standard to
choose is subject to debate, and ultimately comes down to a policy
decision to be made by Congress. However, given what we know about the
original intent of Leahy, this Article believes that [\"probable cause\"
would be best]{.underline}. Upon first glance, it [appears to be the
**[closest]{.mark} in effect** [to \"**credible information**,\"
and]{.mark} it [is]{.mark} a standard that should be very
[familiar]{.mark} to **legal experts** and
\[**laypeople**\]]{.underline} ~~laymen~~ [alike]{.underline}. For the
sake of ease and demonstration, the following analysis will assume
probable cause is selected as the new standard and then better explain
why, although others may be viable, it is the proper choice.

1\. In Favor of an Established Standard

As stated above, there are [two primary reasons to support a
change]{.underline} from \"credible information\" [to a more
**established standard**]{.underline} of proof in Leahy cases. [The
first is the **[familiarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the standard,
[[and]{.mark} the second is the **[ease of
application]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Turning back to the study conducted
by the RAND Corporation, [practitioners repeatedly
expressed]{.underline} their [[concerns with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
actual **[degree of [scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}** being applied, the
degree of [**[credibility]{.mark}** and **[hierarchy]{.mark}** to assign
**information sources**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the
**[amount]{.mark}** of **information** necessary to substantiate an
allegation]{.underline}. 108[These issues all **[disappear]{.mark}**
when the law is changed from \"**credible information**\" to
\"**probable cause**.\"]{.underline} Probable cause has been defined in
a number of different ways, but for the sake of this Article, we will
use the [definition set forth by the **Supreme Court**]{.underline}
(with a few adjustments to better suit our subject matter): \"[where the
**facts** and **circumstances** within the \[deciding official\'s\]
knowledge, and of which they have reasonably **trustworthy
information**, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief by a
person of reasonable caution that a \[gross violation of human rights\]
has been committed]{.underline}.\" 109

**[[Familiarity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the first benefit, is something
that [can be realized **immediately**]{.underline} and [simply by the
**implementation** of the change. Knowing that there is **established
standard**]{.underline} will likely [[increase]{.mark} a practitioner\'s
[**faith** that]{.mark} the **[Leahy]{.mark}** standard [is]{.mark}
being **enforced [uniform]{.mark}ly**]{.underline}. This in turn will
[allow them to focus on a **fair application**, [rather than]{.mark}
feeling tempted to **[warp]{.mark} the [standard]{.mark}** to
fit]{.underline} what they believe to be a proper outcome as [determined
[by]{.mark} **political** or **public [demand]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This standard would also sound better when explained to the American
public or partner nations. [Without a **well-established standard** of
proof, it may appear to some that there is **no standard** at
all]{.underline}. \"Credible information\" as officially defined by
[Leahy vetting SOPs can very easily be confused with \"credible
information\" in the common sense]{.underline}: information that
someone, somewhere, found credible, for some reason. In contrast,
announcing that \"there was insufficient information to establish
probable cause that a unit engaged in violations of human rights\"
carries with it a weight that the public has ascribed to the well-known
standard of probable cause. 110

Far more importantly than appearances and familiarity, [it will actually
work better]{.underline}. This brings us to the [second reason
to]{.underline} support a [change to an established **legal standard**:
**ease of application**]{.underline}. Over the course of American
history, [there have been **hundreds** of **court cases** that have
**interpreted** the **probable cause** standard as it applies to
different situations. [Practitioners]{.mark}, armed
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} this [**expansive [jurisprudence]{.mark}**[,
will be]{.mark} far [**better equipped** to]{.mark} [make]{.mark}
**credibility [determinations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In order to
demonstrate how this could work, we will first need to indulge a brief
history lesson.

In the preeminent cases of [United States v. **Spinelli**]{.underline}
111[and **Aguilar** v. Texas]{.underline}, 112the U.S. [Supreme
Court]{.underline} was [tasked with determining]{.underline} whether
there was [probable cause when warrants were]{.underline} heavily [based
on]{.underline} the [statements of confidential informants]{.underline}.
113In Aguilar they held that there was no probable cause to search when
the only information supporting a warrant was an affidavit of police
officers who swore that they had \"received reliable information form a
credible person and do believe\" that narcotics were present. 114The
court held that there was insufficient information to allow the
magistrate who issued the warrant to determine the credibility of the
informants statements and that \"the magistrate must be informed of some
of the underlying circumstances relied on by the person providing the
information and some of the underlying circumstances from which the
affiant concluded that the informant, whose identity was not disclosed,
was credible or his information reliable.\" 115The Court in Spinelli
further clarified that the magistrate must be informed of the
\"underlying circumstances from which the informant had concluded\" that
a crime was committed. 116The result of these cases came to be known as
the Aguilar-Spinelli test, that probable cause cannot be established on
the basis of a confidential informant without facts showing that (1) the
informant is reliable and credible and (2) establishing some of the
underlying circumstances relied upon by the person providing the
information. 117

The two-prong test was later overruled in favor of a [totality-of-the
circumstances approach in Illinois v. **Gates**]{.underline}, 118but the
[\"**veracity**\" and \"**basis of knowledge**\" factors
are]{.underline} still [considered to be **relevant considerations** in
the **determination** of **probable cause**]{.underline}, 119and some
states still use the test for probable cause determinations under their
own constitutions. 120

Now, given the quick guidance from these cases and our new definition,
one can make a determination [in the Leahy context]{.underline}. Focus
on the UNAMA report from earlier that contained allegations that members
of the Afghan Local Police had been torturing detainees. Under the
totality of the circumstances, are the facts and circumstances, as known
to the deciding official, sufficient in themselves to warrant a belief
by a person of reasonable caution that a gross violation of human rights
has been committed? 121

On first thought, one may believe that there is obviously enough to meet
the standard. After all, UNAMA, an agent of the United Nations, said
that it happened. However, upon further reflection a practitioner may
ask: where did they get their information? In this case, the source of
the information was from undisclosed combat-related detainees; 122which
could just as easily be called confidential criminal informants. The
Leahy practitioner should not be attempting to determine UNAMA\'s
credibility any more than a court would focus on the credibility of a
police affiant. Instead, the practitioner should focus on the
credibility of the informants UNAMA interviewed. So, what is known about
them?

If one were to apply what he\'s learned of Aguilar and Spinelli, he may
ask: what can be said about the veracity of the source? In this case,
nothing. There is no information available about the individual
answering UNAMA\'s questions, their reliability, or their credibility.
UNAMA says they are credible, but that is no different than the police
officers in Aguilar and their warrant based on \"reliable information
from a credible person.\" 123

What about the second prong, the basis of knowledge for the information?
The practitioner knows that the detainees are experiencing what they
perceive to be torture, but nothing of the underlying circumstances,
what has been done to them, who is doing it, or in what fashion it was
done. This is almost identical to the situation in Aguilar, wherein the
magistrate had no information about the basis for the informant\'s
knowledge. As such, [a Leahy practitioner can]{.underline} come to the
conclusion that these incidents do not establish probable cause.

In doing so, \[they\] ~~he~~ [can demonstrate \[their\]]{.underline}
~~his~~ [reasoning [based on **established case law**]{.mark}, and
provide others a basis for challenging \[their\]]{.underline} ~~his~~
[decision [with]{.mark} further **[legal
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The rationale for
\[their\]]{.underline} ~~his~~ [determination can be held out to the
**public**, to **Congress**, and to the **partner nation**, [and
demonstrate **consistency in application**]{.mark} of the
law]{.underline}.

2\. In Favor of Probable Cause

Neither of the two reasons to move away from \"credible information\"
would be affected if the standard of proof applied was \"clear and
convincing evidence,\" \"reasonable suspicion,\" or any other
established standard of proof. The analysis and the case law would
change, the definitions would change, but the rationale would remain.
You\'d still provide practitioners, the public, and partner-nations with
a more easily understandable, and more familiar standard, and you\'d
still arm decision makers with a well-developed jurisprudence to inform
their decisions. Yet despite the fact that other standards may work, it
is the opinion of this Article that [probable cause works best, and most
**closely resembles** the **intent** of Leahy\'s existing \"credible
information\" standard]{.underline}.

One thing that has been made clear is that [the **original intent** for
the Leahy standard of proof was that the information it was based on
**did not have to be admissible** in **court**]{.underline}; 124that it
did not need to be admissible \"evidence.\" [**Probable cause meets**
this criterion. Information does not need to meet the requirements of
**admissibility** in a court in order to be used in a **probable cause
determination**]{.underline}. As discussed above, [information from
**confidential informants**, which would be barred from admission in
court due to the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation]{.underline},
125[is **permissible** when **determining probable cause**]{.underline}.
126[The same is true with **hearsay evidence**, which can be used as the
basis probable cause when obtaining a warrant.]{.underline} 127The
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure expressly state that at preliminary
hearings, in which magistrates determine probable cause, the defendant
is not allowed to \"object to evidence on the ground that it was
unlawfully acquired.\" 128Privileged evidence is also often relied upon
in Probable Cause hearings as evidenced by a number of cases where
probable cause was determined by the statements of a spouse, seemingly
in violation of spousal privileges. 129The law in this area is best
summed up by Justice Black in addressing whether the of rules of
evidence should apply in Grand Jury proceedings: \"It would run counter
to the whole history of the grand jury institution, in which
\[laypeople\] ~~laymen~~ conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical
rules. Neither justice nor the concept of a fair trial requires such a
change.\" 130[[**Probable cause** meets]{.mark} **Leahy\'s
[intent]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[quashes]{.mark}** the
**[fear]{.mark}** that the [U.S.]{.mark} would continue to **[fund
h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [abusers]{.mark}** [due to]{.mark} the
**tyranny** of such \"**[technical rules]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} As
such, it is the ideal choice. 131

E. Summation

The [**[current standard]{.mark}** of proof in **Leahy vetting** [is
**confusing**]{.mark}, [**poorly applied**, and]{.mark} subject to an
inappropriate degree of **[subjective]{.mark} interpretation**. This
causes great difficulties for the practitioner community, and risks U.S.
relations with partner nations]{.underline}. In order to improve
application of the Leahy laws, and to further its intent, [the standard
should be changed from \"**credible information**\" to \"**[probable
cause]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} Changing to [an **existing** and
**recognized** legal standard provides Leahy practitioners with the
benefit of **American [jurisprudence]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} the
**[guidance]{.mark}** that [it offers]{.mark}, and it **[lends]{.mark}**
more [**legitimacy** to]{.mark} the **[Leahy-vetting]{.mark}**
process.]{.underline} Once the decision to switch to an established
standard is made, [probable cause]{.underline} is the best choice. It
[**meets the intent** of Leahy\'s drafters and]{.underline} as such,
would likely [[strike]{.mark} the **desirable [balance]{.mark}**
[between **reliability** of **info**]{.mark}**rmation** [and
**protection** against **over-application**]{.mark} of Leahy
sanctions]{.underline}.

Despite its general rejection of full membership in human rights
treaties, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [played]{.mark} a
[**leading role** in]{.mark} **international** **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights **governance** [through]{.mark} **congressionally
mandated human rights diplomacy**]{.underline}. Since the adoption of
the first congressional human rights mandates (\"CHRMs\") in the
mid-1970s, [congressional [requirements to **monitor** and
**report**]{.mark} on global human rights practices have served to
**integrate** international **human rights** law and norms into U.S.
**foreign policy**.]{.underline} While these [CHRMs have drifted from
their original purpose to **[constrain]{.mark}** **executive** branch
**discretion** over the [**allocation** of **foreign
aid**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [mandates have effectively
**embedded**]{.underline} international [human rights norms and law into
**congressional decision-making** and the **operations** of the **State
Department** and other **executive** branch **agencies**.]{.underline}
The annual Country Reports on Human Rights (\"Country Reports\")
required by [the mandates have grown to become a **leading**
international **source** of **h**uman **r**ights **fact-finding**,
[influencing]{.mark} the [ways in which]{.mark} **domestic** and
**international [courts]{.mark}**, **NGOs**, and human rights
institutions [**interpret** and **apply**]{.mark} **[h]{.mark}uman
[r]{.mark}ights law**.]{.underline} In this respect, [congressional
human rights **reporting mandates**]{.underline} - not congressional
human rights treaty policy - [have evolved as a [**central driver**
of]{.mark} U.S. engagement with and interpretation of the
[**protections** of]{.mark} international **[human rights]{.mark}**
law]{.underline}. What was designed as unilateral policy to regulate the
human rights practices of aid-recipient states has [constructed the U.S.
human rights identity within the international system and **influenced**
the **operation** of the **international** **h**uman **r**ights
**system** itself.]{.underline} Together [with
**[congressional]{.mark}** and **executive sanctions**
[practices]{.mark}, the human rights reporting mandates [form]{.mark}
the [**legal basis** for]{.mark} the **active** and **influential**
participation of the United States in **[international]{.mark}**
**h**uman **r**ights **[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 1

Congress has been viewed by many scholars as the central obstacle to
full U.S. participation in the post-World War II international human
rights treaty system. 2And indeed, it is true that Congress has been
reluctant to subject U.S. domestic human rights behavior to
international oversight through treaty membership; Congress even
threatened a constitutional amendment to keep the United States out of
human rights treaties. 3Yet, since the 1970s, [Congress has been keenly
interested in the human rights behavior of **foreign states**,
particularly those which receive **financial** and **military aid** from
the **U**nited **S**tates. This interest in external human rights
behavior, coupled with a desire to constrain presidential foreign policy
prerogatives]{.underline} in the wake of the Vietnam War, [led
[Congress]{.mark} to **[condition]{.mark} foreign military** and
humanitarian [**appropriations** on respect for]{.mark} **[h]{.mark}uman
[r]{.mark}ights**.]{.underline} In the language of the original statute,
[assistance would be **prohibited** to countries that engaged \"in a
consistent pattern of **gross violations** of internationally recognized
**human rights**,\"]{.underline} unless the President requested a
waiver. 4[Congress sought to **[extend]{.mark} robust
[oversight]{.mark}** of this provision, which would claim for Congress a
more **direct role** in presidential human rights policy, by
[requiring]{.mark} the State Department to **[report annually]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} **h**uman **r**ights [**conditions** in **aid-recipient
states**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Preparation of the report required U.S.
diplomats around the world to gather information on whether and how
foreign state behavior meets international human rights standards.

The [CHRMs have **endured**]{.underline}. Through them, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continues to play an
important role in international **h**uman **r**ights **governance** in
ways that tends to **smooth differences** between **presidential
administrations**.]{.underline} 5Since the 1970s, [Congress]{.underline}
has expanded the breadth of the annual reporting requirements to include
reports on human rights conditions in all foreign states, not just those
receiving U.S. aid. 6And it [has expanded the **depth** and **scope** of
human rights practices covered by the **reports** to include a long list
of rights that reflect the **growth** of international **h**uman
**r**ights **law** over the past decades]{.underline}. 7In addition to
the annual Country Reports, the State Department is also now required to
prepare separate annual reports on religious freedom, sex trafficking,
and democracy promotion programs. 8Congress has [steadily added
**[reporting requirements]{.mark}**; it has never **eliminated** or
**reduced** them]{.underline}. 9Over a time period that witnessed the
broadening and deepening of the international human rights system,
[CHRMs have [**enmeshed** the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[within]{.mark} international **[h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights
[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} - even as the United States remains
formally outside the jurisdiction of the central human rights treaties.

#### Enhanced [compliance]{.underline} with Congressional [reporting requirements]{.underline} develops [cyclical coordination]{.underline} with NGOs -- CPs [unilateral policy]{.underline} expands the scope of [international HR law]{.underline} AND [shapes governance]{.underline} via *opinio juris* -- BUT, [retreating]{.underline} from [commitment]{.underline} to [human rights]{.underline} only decks [credibility]{.underline}

Perhaps more important than their effect on congressional-presidential
debates over the direction of foreign policy, the
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ongressional
**[[h]{.underline}]{.mark}**uman **[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**ights
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**andate[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} have
**[[entrenched]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[norms]{.mark}** and
institutions [of]{.mark} international **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights [law]{.mark} and governance within the executive
branch]{.underline}. International human rights governance is a series
of decentralized processes of norm creation, elaboration, and
enforcement. It is made up of interconnected political and legal
institutions, treaty bodies, courts, and commissions, which interact
with states, NGOs, corporations, and individuals in polycentric
processes. 20[The **polycentric nature** of human rights governance
[allows]{.mark} **multiple [entry]{.mark} points** [for]{.mark} official
U.S. federal government participation - through the
**[exec]{.mark}utive** branch, the **[courts]{.mark}**, and
**[Congress]{.mark}** - in the full range of international human rights
governance.]{.underline} The process of [**[compliance]{.mark}** with
**CHRMs** has **fundamentally altered** the methods through which the
executive branch carries out **diplomacy**, expanding the work of
diplomats to [include **coordination** and]{.mark} [**cooperation**
with]{.mark} human rights **[NGOs]{.mark}** and other members of [civil
society]{.mark}, and with **courts** and other consumers of human rights
reporting]{.underline}. The [CHRM process has, therefore,
[created]{.mark} a dynamic **[policy feedback cycle]{.mark}** among the
State Department, Congress, and civil society, which has informed the
continual **[expansion]{.mark}** of the **breadth** and **depth** of
**h**uman **r**ights **[reporting]{.mark} requirements**]{.underline}.
21This process serves as an alternative mechanism to treaty membership.
22Through the CHRM process, [the [U.S. **influences**, and is
**influenced by**]{.mark}, the development of [**international**
**h**]{.mark}uman **[r]{.mark}**ights **[law]{.mark}** in regional and
international human rights systems]{.underline}.

In more recent years, [international human rights
institutions]{.underline} - particularly the UN Human Rights Council -
[have expanded **self-reporting requirements** for member
states]{.underline}, including by those, like the United States, that
are not party to international human rights treaty adjudicatory
mechanisms. 23In these \"self-reports\" on domestic human rights
practices prepared by the executive branch, [we can see the
**[influence]{.mark}** of these [**embedded** **h**]{.mark}uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights [**norms**, as]{.mark} the [U.S. government
**mediates**]{.mark} between the language of American constitutional
human rights exceptionalism and international human rights]{.underline}.
24The internalization of human rights norms was evident even in the
Trump administration, whose policy was to de-emphasize human rights in
its foreign policy rhetoric and behavior. 25

Significantly, [the [**content** of]{.mark} the human rights
**[reports]{.mark}** has affected the ways in which [**agencies**,
**courts**]{.mark}, other human rights [**institutions**, and]{.mark}
members of [civil society]{.mark} have [**assessed** and
**adjudicated**]{.mark} human rights [claims and elaborated]{.mark} the
**[scope]{.mark}** and **subject matter** [of]{.mark} **international**
**[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights **[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
26Taken together, these trends demonstrate how the
[**[embedding]{.mark}** of international human rights **[norms]{.mark}**
in the federal government, [through]{.mark} **dynamic** **congressional
[control]{.mark}** [of **exec**]{.mark}**utive branch** human rights
**[reporting]{.mark}**, has brought the United States inside the
**cathedral** of human rights as a **major driver** of international
**h**uman **r**ights **governance**]{.underline}.

This Article provides a positive theory of U.S. participation in
international human rights governance through human rights diplomacy. It
focuses on the monitoring and reporting requirements of the CHRMs and
the dissemination of the annual Country Reports as the central processes
through which that diplomacy is carried out. The Article draws on
primary sources, including: diplomatic cables and discussions with
senior State Department officials; reported caselaw in U.S., foreign,
and international courts; opinions of international human rights treaty
bodies and institutions; and reporting of human rights NGOs. It draws on
these empirical data to illustrate the ways in which the mechanisms of
[[U.S. h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [diplomacy **influence legal
processes**]{.mark} and determinations of human rights claims in a
variety of adjudicatory and non-adjudicatory settings]{.underline}. In
this way, this Article seeks to contribute to the empirical turn in
international law scholarship, which is concerned with \"the conditions
under which international law is formed and has effects\" 27and examines
how international law is created by \"specific forces and factors\"
28and \"accomplishes its ends under particular conditions.\" 29

This examination of U.S. human rights reporting contributes to our
understandings of sources of international human rights law, both
treaties and customary international law. It illustrates the dynamic
process through which [human rights [monitoring and reporting]{.mark}
**[applies]{.mark}** and **[interprets]{.mark}** the foundational
[**non-binding declarations** and **treaties**]{.mark} that
**construct** **international human rights law**]{.underline}. It
further illustrates that [monitoring and reporting serve [as]{.mark} a
form of **state practice** and **expression** of **[opinio
juris]{.mark}** for purposes of determining **customary** international
**h**uman **r**ights **law**]{.underline}. The Article demonstrates
that, under certain institutional conditions, [what is frequently
dismissed as a state\'s **[unilateral]{.mark}** human rights [**policy**
operates as]{.mark} a form of **[international]{.mark}** human rights
**[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Therefore, this Article also
contributes to the burgeoning cross-disciplinary literature in political
science and law that seeks to understand how and under what
circumstances states engage or reject engagement with the international
human rights system. 30

This Article proceeds as follows: Part II describes the legislative
architecture of the human rights reporting mandates and explains the
ways in which Congress exercised its appropriations power to create U.S.
human rights diplomacy and incorporate emerging international human
rights standards into U.S. law. Part III draws on primary sources to
assess the effects of human rights reporting on human rights law and
governance. It argues that widespread citation to the Country Reports in
adjudication before domestic agencies and courts, before foreign courts,
and in UN and NGO reporting, demonstrates the [[**transformation** of
**internal**]{.mark} foreign policy [**oversight statutes** into

human rights treaties), unilateral and multilateral sanctions practices,
and engagement with international human rights norms integrated into
other areas of international law.

A. Monitoring and Reporting as Human Rights Fact-Finding

The [preparation of the **[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
[**reports** requires]{.mark} State Department officials]{.underline} -
both those in the field serving as embassy \"human rights officers\" and
those in the DRL Bureau - [to engage in year-long **[data
collection]{.mark}** of rights practices.]{.underline} The data
collection takes place in many different forms, and is [coordinated by
DRL through instructions to **overseas U.S. missions** that include
**categories** of **human rights**, **definitions**, and **advice** on
sources.]{.underline} 154[The process [includes: **close
scrutiny**]{.mark} of]{.underline} news and social media reporting on
[political, civil and social **rights**; [direct conversations]{.mark}
with]{.underline} members of the government engaged in [**law
enforcement** and **judicial administration**]{.underline};
[[meetings]{.mark} with political parties, dissidents, and members of
the opposition to government; conversations with members of civil
society groups]{.underline} (e.g. academics, rights activists, lawyers,
and journalists); [[review of]{.mark} **official** and **unofficial
reporting** of **international** and **regional** **h**uman **r**ights
**[institutions]{.mark}** and of **international** and **local**
**h**uman **r**ights **[NGOs]{.mark}**; meeting with
**[investigators]{.mark}** associated with international and local human
rights NGOs]{.underline}; and, in countries that restrict access to the
forgoing channels, [**[review of info]{.mark}**rmation available from
**NGOs** and **other sources**]{.underline} outside the state. 155

In gathering facts to prepare the reports, [executive branch
officials]{.underline} thus [communicate and cooperate with]{.underline}
particular groups and [institutions,]{.underline} many of which are
wholly [outside]{.underline} the [formal channels of traditional
bilateral diplomacy]{.underline} between foreign ministries and offices
of the heads of state. This [**process** of [**engagement**
places]{.mark} the [State Department within]{.mark} the **[h]{.mark}uman
[r]{.mark}ights [movement]{.mark}**, **reporting** on **conditions**
**side-by-side** [with **civil society**]{.mark} and **international**
[and]{.mark} **regional** **h**uman **r**ights
**[institutions]{.mark}**, which are also **monitoring** and
**reporting** on human rights **conditions**.]{.underline} One
consequence of the State Department working from inside the human rights
movement is its [reliance on human rights journalists, activists, and
NGOs to provide the information needed for the annual reports, and a
reciprocal reliance by those same journalists, activists, and NGOs on
the State Department reports for their own work]{.underline}. It
[[represents]{.mark} a **normative [feedback loop]{.mark}** between
these actors and also serves as an important **[coordinating]{.mark}
mechanism** and **focal point** for U.S. **[engagement]{.mark}** in
international **h**uman **r**ights **governance**]{.underline} outside
the formal treaty bodies.

Over the years, the institutionalization of human rights fact-finding
within the State Department has also proved quite useful to Congress.
While the general default statutory provisions of the FAA and ISA were
never invoked to cut off aid automatically, [the content of the
**reports** proved **useful** in **pushing** for the targeted
legislation that **conditioned aid** on specific
benchmarks]{.underline}. The reports [[highlight problems in]{.mark}
**particular [countries]{.mark}**, which Congress can then point to [as
**justification** for]{.mark} further [**restrictions** on]{.mark} the
**executive\'s prerogatives** to award **[aid]{.mark} packages** in
**targeted countries** and to crafting individual **sanctions
legislation**]{.underline}. 156The State Department may present the
reports as the considered and \"objective\" view of the U.S. government
of a particular state\'s rights practices for strategic purposes in
diplomatic negotiations.

In addition to this particular use in diplomacy, the [reports are relied
upon by many official and unofficial actors outside of Congress and have
come to serve as a **valuable reference guide** in many other policy
making contexts.]{.underline} 157For example, [human rights
NGOs]{.underline}, which in the early days of the Country Reports used
them as a foil for critiquing how U.S. reporting and policy fell short
of universal human rights ideals, use the reporting to corroborate their
own work. The [[**process** and **institutionalization** of
**h**]{.mark}**uman r[i]{.mark}ghts** within the State Department has
[provided]{.mark} an **institutional [focal point]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
**lobbying** in the executive branch]{.underline}, evidenced, perhaps,
by the fact that several assistant secretaries for Human Rights came
from careers in human rights advocacy. 158The multiplicity of ways in
which the [U.S. government takes part in [**norm elaboration** and
**interpretation** as it engages in]{.mark} the processes of
[**monitoring** and **reporting**]{.mark} form a kind of state
practice]{.underline}.

#### The counterplan sets *opinio juris* -- BOTH Supreme Court [jurisprudence]{.underline} AND [executive HR monitoring]{.underline} shapes norms for [development]{.underline} of [customary international human rights law]{.underline}

B. Human Rights Monitoring and Reporting as Opinio Juris

To understand how the reporting process affects U.S. actors and
institutions, we need to examine not just the costs of the reports as
shaming \"talk,\" but their value as \"legal talk\" as well. As Chimene
Keitner has explained [in the context of the [**jurisprudence**
of]{.mark} the U.S. **Supreme [Court]{.mark}**, any [practice in which
states describe]{.mark} **behavioral [expectations]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark} the content of **[h]{.mark}**uman [**r**i]{.mark}ghts
**[law]{.mark}** might, in fact, [represent **opinio juris**]{.mark} for
the purpose of **c**ustomary **i**nternational **l**aw.]{.underline}
159Similarly, Kate Shaw has explored how [presidential foreign policy
statements may represent **opinio juris**.]{.underline} 160Here, the
[statements about the **content** of international **h**uman **r**ights
**norms** are being made by the **[executive]{.mark}** branch, in a
process overseen by **Congress**, which supports a conclusion that these
**[reports]{.mark}** may **[constitute]{.mark}** U.S. **[opinio
juris]{.mark}** regarding the **content** of **customary** international
**human rights** law]{.underline}. 161

The reports themselves describe facts on the ground in particular
countries. They require framing these facts within a sub-heading or
category. Some categories reflect direct statutory mandates. 162For
example, in the early years of the mandates, Congress was concerned with
acts of \"torture or other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment.\"
163Under the category of \"torture, or other cruel, inhuman and
degrading treatment,\" the State Department would then be required to
place sections of its report dealing with the practices engaged in by
the state being examined. 164[By engaging in the **[factual
identification]{.mark}** of what constitutes \"torture,\" the State
Department [makes]{.mark} a [**categorical assessment** of what]{.mark}
kinds of behavior fall within the **international definition** of
torture in the [**ICCPR** and **CAT**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
\"talk\" of torture [becomes a **statement** of what the **U**nited
**S**tates believes the **standard** to be]{.underline} - even in areas
where it has, as a matter of treaty law, not consented to having its own
actions be bound by international standards. [This [**statement**
of]{.mark} what the State Department believes **[international
law]{.mark}** to require is **analogous** to the kinds of **statements**
made by **courts** and other government actors that have been
[**recognized** as constituting **opinio juris**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Elevate the role of human rights in security assistance decision-making
and policymaking

Currently, **[h]{.underline}**uman **[r]{.underline}**ights
[considerations are **rarely** given **significant weight** in decisions
about **who** to support and **when** with U.S. security
assistance.]{.underline} In moving resources to the State Department,
[officials should conduct a **full review** of a partner's
**capability**, **capacity**, and **political will** to **protect
civilians** and **abide** by **h**uman **r**ights **requirements**
before approving future U.S. assistance]{.underline}.92 These [reviews,
conducted at the outset of U.S. security relationships, could ensure
that a partner is **unlikely** to **abuse U.S. aid**]{.underline}.
Additionally, to counter the sizeable influence of regional bureaus, the
[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor should be **required to
review** and **concur** on **security assistance projects** that involve
countries found to have a history or pattern of **h**uman **r**ights
**abuses** in the conduct of its **security forces** or **security
policy**]{.underline}. This [determination should be informed by the
State Department's own **annual** **h**uman **r**ights **reporting** in
addition to **info**rmation from **civil society groups**]{.underline}.

[Human rights **vetting** should also be **reformed**]{.underline}.
Under the current system, [partners who purchase U.S. assistance and
equipment **circumvent Leahy law vetting**, and **aid** that **flows**
directly to **ministries** of defense, rather than **individual units**,
is **not subject** to the same **h**uman **r**ights
**restrictions**]{.underline}.93 [Closing these loopholes would not only
bring all U.S. assistance in accordance with existing U.S. law, but it
would also make for **smarter policy**]{.underline}. Researchers have
found that when partners commit human rights abuses with known U.S.
support, civilians on the ground are more likely to blame American
foreign policy.94 [Prioritizing partners that are willing to **abide**
by **international** human rights **standards** would protect **American
interests**]{.underline} and civilians on the ground. The Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, in collaboration with the Bureau of
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, [should **jointly increase** the
**h**uman **r**ights **vetting** of arms transfers]{.underline}.

Finally, [the State Department should develop a framework of
**triggers** and **indicators** on human rights and civilian protection
that would require a **reevaluation** or **termination** of a **security
partnership**]{.underline}. When partners commit abuses or refuse to
abide by international law, [the United States must be willing to **cut
off assistance**.]{.underline} This would [ensure that the United States
is **not complicit** in **abusive behavior** and could **incentivize
partners** to clean up **security force conduct**]{.underline}. This
internal trigger should also automatically alert Congress to ensure that
proper remediation is done by the executive branch.

V. The Effectiveness of the Leahy Law in Colombia

Like the Philippines, Colombia has a long history of U.S. military
involvement, and U.S. military aid increased dramatically after 2001.
170 Unlike the Philippines, the majority of funding for Colombia is
funneled through the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement/Andean
Counterdrug Initiative (INCLE). 171 For FY 2012, the Obama
Administration requested \$ 160 million for INCLE and \$ 44 million for
FMF. 172 Up until at least 2009, the State Department published a report
on the end-use of the funds provided through INCLE. 173 As for the
remainder of the funding, since at least 2011, lists of units vetted for
compliance with the Leahy Law are \"classified to protect the
operational capacity of Colombian military units.\" 174

Also like the Philippines, [**[NGOs]{.mark}** and the **State
Department** have **[accused]{.mark}** the **[Colombia]{.mark}n
military** [of]{.mark} committing a **myriad** of **h**uman **r**ights
**[violations]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 175 In its 2011 report on
Colombia, the State Department said that \"[**political** and **unlawful
[killings]{.mark}** remained an extremely serious problem, and there
were some reports that members of the security forces committed
**extrajudicial killings**]{.underline} ... .\" 176 A July 2010 report
by the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR) reported \"[[**alarming
links** between]{.mark} Colombian **military [units]{.mark}** [that
**receive**]{.mark} **U.S. [assistance]{.mark}** and **civilian
killings** committed by the army]{.underline}.\" 177

[The FOR study]{.underline}, \"Military Assistance and Human Rights,\"
[was **thorough** and **damning**]{.underline}. 178 Over a period of two
years, the FOR [examined more than **three thousand** extra-judicial
killings and the roughly **five hundred** Colombian **military units**
receiving U.S. **military aid** and **training**]{.underline}. 179 In
2007, [twenty-three out of twenty-five brigade jurisdictions were
accused of extra-judicial killings.]{.underline} 180 [One hundred
forty-two reported killings have been directly attributed to fourteen
different mobile brigades, eleven of which were **vetted** to **receive
assistance**.]{.underline} 181 Of the 3,014 killings reviewed by the
FOR, [more than 1,500 were under investigation by the Colombian Attorney
General\'s office, but only 43 had reached a verdict.]{.underline} 182
On average, the [FOR report found that \"extrajudicial [killings
**increased**]{.mark} **on average** in [areas]{.mark} **after** the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[increased
assistance]{.mark}** to units in those areas]{.underline}.\" 183 [In the
sixteen largest jurisdictions where military aid was increased, the
number of reported executions averaged an increase of
**56%**.]{.underline} 184 [The [**inverse** was **also true**]{.mark}:
in years when the United States most reduced the military assistance to
a region, the number of reported executions fell by 56%.]{.underline}
185 Even after November 2008, where the number of reported military
extra-judicial killings dropped significantly because of institutional
practices designed to reduce the frequency of murder by the military,
the drop was accompanied by a steep climb in the number of reported
civilian killings by paramilitary groups. 186 While there are several
explanations for these increases, including higher levels of violence in
some areas than others, 187 an increased number of soldiers in assisted
units, changes in population in jurisdiction of assigned units, possible
differences in reporting killings by assisted units, and differing
attitudes of U.S. officials, 188 [the [**data** suggests]{.mark} an
almost [**categorical failure** of the]{.mark} [**Leahy Law** in
**Colombia**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Another source of conflict between the human rights goals of the Leahy
Law and foreign military training is the Western Hemisphere Institute
for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC), formerly known as the School of the
Americas (SOA). Since its establishment in 1946, WHINSEC-SOA has trained
over 60,000 members of Central and South American armed forces, 189
including over 9,500 Colombian soldiers. 190 Colombia holds over 60% of
the seats available for students at WHINSEC-SOA. 191 Some of these
[troops are alleged to have **forced children** to **march** in front of
**military columns** to detonate landmines or spring
ambushes]{.underline}. 192 The [Colombian soldiers have also been
accused of **[mass-murder]{.mark}**, **[disappearances]{.mark}**,
**[torture]{.mark}**, and **[extrajudicial
killings]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including that of Archbishop Isaias
Duarte. 193 In addition to Colombia, [soldiers trained at the SOA have
committed human rights violations in **Bolivia**, **Chile**, **El
Salvador**, **Guatemala**, **Honduras**, and **Paraguay**]{.underline}.
194

Many of these [human rights [abuses were part of]{.mark} the **SOA\'s
[curriculum]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 1996, the Pentagon admitted that
seven training manuals used at the SOA were [[designed to
advocate]{.mark} the [systemic use of **torture**]{.mark},
**[blackmail]{.mark}**, and **[executions]{.mark}** to neutralize
dissidents]{.underline}. 195 The manuals identified [potential targets
as \"**\'religious workers**, **labor organizers**, **student groups**
and others in sympathy with the cause of the **poor**]{.underline}.\"
196

In 2000, the House of Representatives narrowly voted down an attempt to
close the SOA. 197 Instead, the SOA was renamed WHINSEC. 198 In 2007,
WHINSEC survived another vote to close the school by six votes in the
House of Representatives. 199 A month before the vote, Salvatore
Mancuso, the former commander of the paramilitary organization United
Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, testified in a closed hearing in
Medellin, Colombia. 200 In his testimony, he said that he and other
paramilitaries, which the U.S. State Department labeled \"foreign
terrorist organizations,\" were a creation of state policy and
collaborated with Colombian military and government officials who had
been trained and served as instructors at WHINSEC-SOA. 201

The FOR posits two reasons for the failure of the Leahy Law in Colombia:
the first is the inadequate information and a difference in bureaucratic
priorities between the State Department, which had knowledge of human
rights abuse; and the second is the other branches of the [Executive,
which **prioritized arming Colombian allies**]{.underline}. 202 While
both reasons are plausible, the relatively high levels of human rights
abuse documentation in Colombia and the relatively low
[**[threshold]{.mark}** of \"**[credible infor]{.mark}mation**\"
[suggests]{.mark} [that]{.mark}]{.underline} the latter, rather than the
former, [[is **more likely**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

U.S. aid to Colombia has declined considerably since 2008.
Counternarcotics and counterinsurgency activities, in which Washington
has been heavily involved since Plan Colombia's inception in 2000, have
been steadily "Colombianized." Now, [[Colombia]{.mark} is **stepping up
efforts** to **[export]{.mark}** its "**[know-how]{.mark}**" to
countries in **Central America**, the **Caribbean**, and beyond the
**Western Hemisphere** affected by **drug-related crime** and
**violence**, largely [via **South-South coop**]{.mark}eration and
triangulated efforts **[with U.S. support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
report explores what seems to be an [emerging international security
cooperation model in which both **Colombia** and the **U**nited
**S**tates play **key roles**]{.underline}. \[2\]

Although Colombian training of security personnel in third countries is
an established and growing practice, [[we **know little** about]{.mark}
who is being **trained**, by **whom**, what is being **taught**, and who
is providing the **funding**. The lack of publicly available information
raises]{.underline} a number of important [concerns]{.underline}:

Is this security cooperation model truly replicating Colombia's
successes without also copying its failures, especially [in the realm of
[**corruption**, **h**]{.mark}uman **[r]{.mark}**ights, and
**impunity**]{.underline}?

Why is it so difficult to obtain information about Colombia's specific
activities---far more so than in the case of regular U.S. security
assistance---beyond the optimistic but vague language of official press
releases?

[How strong is]{.underline} civilian control and oversight of these
programs, including **[human rights [vetting]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
both trainers and trainees?

To what extent is Colombian training based on an outdated and largely
discredited "drug war" logic that prioritizes numbers arrested, acres
eradicated, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} tons interdicted over **[good
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}** and economic prosperity?

Exporting Colombian security: How we got here

As the twentieth century came to a close, [the chronic **weakness** of
the **Colombia**]{.underline}n state [had brought the country to what
many analysts feared was the **brink** of **collapse**]{.underline}.
Presidents Andrés Pastrana (1998-2002) and Alvaro Uribe (2002-2010)
actively courted their American counterparts, encouraging them to move
beyond a narrow focus on counternarcotics to become more involved in the
internal conflict. This "intervention by invitation" strategy (Tickner
2007) entailed acceptance of the U.S. counternarcotics agenda in
exchange for sorely needed military, technical, and socio-economic
support from Washington. Foreign aid sought to expand, professionalize,
and modernize the armed forces, combat armed insurgents, increase
territorial control, and later, during the Plan Colombia Consolidation
Phase (2007-2013), extend the rule of law and pursue economic and social
development.

Between 2000 and 2008, [U.S. military and economic aid to
Colombia]{.underline} exceeded \$6 billion, making it the largest
recipient of American assistance in Latin America and one of the top ten
worldwide. In what [has been described invariably as an "**extraordinary
transformation**," Colombia's security situation improved]{.underline}
during the second term of President Álvaro Uribe's government
(2006-2010), and has continued to do so during that of Juan Manuel
Santos (2010-2014). The [state has achieved **greater control** over the
countryside, thousands of **paramilitary fighters** have
**demobilized**, punishing defeats have been **delivered** to the
**guerrillas**, and large numbers of **rebels** have **voluntarily
surrendered**. Key indicators of violence, including **kidnappings**,
**homicides**, **disappearances**, and forced **displacement**, have
also **declined**. Arguably, the "**war on drugs**" too has resulted in
**relative gains** as measured by **illicit crop acreage** and total
**cocaine production** in Colombia, although these are largely offset by
the migration of drug cultivation, production, trafficking and
violence]{.underline} elsewhere [in]{.underline} the region, most
notably [Peru]{.underline}, [Mexico]{.underline}, [Central
America]{.underline}, and the [Caribbean]{.underline}.

Such trends are the raw materials for a "success story" that the Santos
government has put to strategic use to reposition Colombia, both
regionally and internationally. One of the country's main exportable
assets is its security forces, widely considered to be among the world's
most seasoned in counternarcotics and counterinsurgency, in no small
measure due to prolonged U.S. training.

Since the mid-2000s [**[Colombia]{.mark}** has [received]{.mark}
**increasing** numbers of [**requests** for **security
coop**]{.mark}eration from governments of distinct ideological stripes
[throughout **Latin America**]{.mark} and beyond.]{.underline} The
International Affairs Office of the Colombian National Police (CNP)
reports that between 2009 and 2013, [it provided **[police]{.mark}** and
**[military training]{.mark}** to 21,949 individuals from 47 different
countries in such skills as **[ground]{.mark}**, **[air]{.mark}**,
**[maritime]{.mark}**, and **[river interdiction]{.mark}**, **police
testimony**, **explosives**, **[intel]{.mark}**ligence
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**, **[psy]{.mark}**chological
**[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} Comando JUNGLA,
the U.S.- designed signature elite
**[[counternarcotics]{.underline}]{.mark}** police program (Jenzen Jones
2011). 87 percent of this training was provided by the CNP.
Notwithstanding the range of nationalities trained, [Colombia has
focused largely on a cluster of countries where distinct **drug-related
problems** have **migrated**, including **Mexico**]{.underline} (which
accounts for nearly half of the total number of trainees),
**[Panama]{.underline}**, **[Honduras]{.underline}**,
**[Guatemala]{.underline}**, **[Peru]{.underline}**, **[El
Salvador]{.underline}**, and **[Costa Rica]{.underline}** (See Table 1).
Some of this [[training was **U.S. funded**]{.underline}]{.mark},
although Colombia carried out many activities using its own resources,
or that of other donors such as Canada.

**\[TABLE 2 OMITTED\]**

its eagerness to assure that diminishing U.S. assistance did not
translate into reduced bilateral ties and even less aid, the [Colombian
government set out to **convince [Washington]{.mark}** to
**[deepen]{.mark}** its [**commitment** to **cooperation**]{.mark}
**efforts** in **third countries**]{.underline}. Police training for
Afghanistan provided an initial testing ground in 2007, but it was not
deemed much of a success given the limited applicability of the
Colombian case, among other factors. In 2009, however, [**Colombia's
participation** in the Mérida Initiative aid package for Mexico, in
activities related to **law enforcement** and **judicial
strengthening**, changed perspectives in policymaking circles.
Colombia's role appeared to be, all at once, an **effective** way to
meet Mexico's security needs, to [**satisfy Colombia's desire** to
**expand**]{.mark} its **training [portfolio]{.mark}**, and to
**mitigate fiscal limitations** in the United States]{.underline}. In
this view [Colombia, with U.S. backing, could provide other countries
with **security cooperation** at a greatly **reduced economic expense**,
and without the **political costs** associated with an enlarged U.S.
military presence. This new reading of the **bilateral relation**
reflected the philosophy that "as we help Colombia, Colombia will help
us help others"]{.underline}, and largely paralleled changes in American
security and defense policy, in which "leading from behind" became a key
feature.

Leading from behind

In the post-Iraq, post-Afghanistan, post-financial crisis era, the
importance of "light footprint" approaches has grown in tandem with U.S.
public opinion's adversity to costly, direct military involvement in
contexts not perceived as directly threatening vital security interests.
In a 2010 Foreign Affairs article, former secretary of Defense Robert M.
Gates laid out the initial blueprint for this strategy by calling on the
United States to "help others help themselves" through institutional and
human capacity building, and through steady and long-term security
assistance (Gates 2010).

Increasingly, Colombia is portrayed as an emblematic case of this "light
footprint" (see, for example, Luján 2013; Robinson 2013; and Jayamaha,
Brady, Fitzgerald and Fritz 2010). However, equally important from the
vantage of current U.S. security and defense policy (U.S. Department of
Defense 2012), [Colombia is unique due to its **long-standing** and
**mature** **bilateral** military **partnership**]{.underline},
especially with Special Operations Forces, whose presence in the country
spans half a century (Thomas and Dougherty 2013; Special Warfare 2012).

As Robert D. Kaplan (2006) observes somewhat forebodingly, [[Colombia
became]{.mark} a [**test case** for]{.mark} tactics that the United
States would employ to manage messy global problems]{.underline}.
According to a retired Army general Kaplan interviewed, in order to
police the world, ["you produce a product and let him loose." What
emerged from Colombia was]{.underline} exactly this: [a **security
cooperation [model]{.mark}** [designed]{.mark} not only [to
**improve**]{.mark} that country's own [**internal security**, but
also]{.mark} **[applicable]{.mark}** to **changing** U.S. **security
objectives** [in the **Western Hemisphere** and
elsewhere]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indigenous partners are the "strategic linchpin" (Lujan 2013: 1) of this
"light footprint" model. Working "by, with and through" them (a saying
repeated often by U.S. officials and military analysts) allows for
results at a lesser material and political cost. Moreover, the use of
third-party "proxies" creates "plausible deniability" (Thomas and
Dougherty 2013: xiii): denial of knowledge of or responsibility for
unpopular or illegal activities. Cooperation by proxy rests upon an
esprit de corps cultivated through prolonged, iterated engagement with
foreign counterparts, the existence of personal, first-name relations,
the creation of liaison elements to ensure connectivity, and support for
host country objectives in order to develop commonality of purpose
(Luján 2013; Special Warfare 2012; Thomas and Dougherty 2013). [As
**capacity-building** proceeds]{.underline} and
[partnership]{.underline} matures the "cream of the crop" of local
militaries and police [can be graduated from **internal functions** to
**regional** or **global security providers**.]{.underline}

According (2013: 85) to Thomas and Dougherty, ["[Colombia is]{.mark} ...
[a]{.mark} 'net [**security exporter**', providing
**counternarcotics**]{.mark} training [to]{.mark} **numerous countries**
in **[Latin America]{.mark}**, the **[Caribbean]{.mark}** and **[West
Africa]{.mark}**"]{.underline}, [and thus a **key node** of an emerging
**global** **S**pecial **O**perations **F**orces
**network**]{.underline}. This view is echoed (Petraeus and O'Hanlon
2013) by former military commander and CIA director David Petraeus, who
considers Colombia to be one of Washington's strongest allies in the
world, one [better poised than the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to help **regions** such as **[Central
America]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Colombia helping others

Until the mid-2000s, [external requests for Colombian security
cooperation were dealt with in an **ad-hoc** and **piecemeal
fashion**]{.underline}. Although the final years of the Uribe government
saw attempts to make more systematic use of armed forces' security
know-how, few governments wanted to be seen working openly with the
Colombian President, given his hard-line anti-terrorist discourse. Juan
Manuel [Santos´ election in 2010]{.underline} provided a prime
opportunity to move this effort forward. Santos [set out to switch
prevalent narratives about Colombia as a failing state with a **weak
human rights** record and **deficient democratic
institutions**]{.underline}. In tandem with this shift in official
discourse, [Santos placed **security cooperation** at the center of
foreign policy.]{.underline}

The Santos administration christened this program the "International
Integral Security Cooperation Strategy," and tasked the [**Colombian**
**M**inistry of **F**oreign **R**elations]{.underline}
(**[MFR]{.underline}**) as its civilian spokesperson, responsible for
interacting with foreign governments and coordinating specific
cooperation efforts with the Ministry of Defense, the CNP, and the
Presidential Agency for International Cooperation (APC). According to
the MFR's brochure, the program [offers]{.underline} a portfolio of a la
carte services in seven areas: [**organizational development**,
**[counternarcotics]{.mark}**, **[o]{.mark}rganized [crime]{.mark}**,
**citizen security**, **[anti-corruption]{.mark}**, **[human
rights]{.mark}** and **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[h]{.mark}**umanitarian **[l]{.mark}**aw, and **[operational
capacities]{.mark}**. It **tailors cooperation** to each country's needs
through a **four-stage process**, consisting of an initial security and
institutional capacity diagnosis; planning and fund-raising;
implementation; and follow-up and evaluation.]{.underline} Specific
information on individual cooperation initiatives is not publicly
available.

With the onset of peace negotiations between the Colombian government
and the FARC guerrillas in November 2012, the country's "security
diplomacy", as the Defense Ministry calls it (2013a), acquired
additional urgency. As Colombia has the second largest military and
police force in Latin America (after Brazil), numbering over 450,000
personnel, some downsizing is inevitable under most post-conflict
scenarios. The 2013 Ministry of Defense report to Congress lays out the
Santos government's game plan for putting this surplus capacity to
effective use abroad. In addition to upping international security
cooperation, in June 2013 Colombia signed an agreement with NATO, the
first of its kind with a Latin American country, with an eye to
increasing its participation in peacekeeping operations.

Parallel to Colombia's own efforts to become a security exporter, in
February 2012 it began a Strategic High Level Security Dialogue (HLSSD)
with the United States. Several months later, at the Summit of the
Americas meeting in Cartagena, presidents Santos and Obama announced an
Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation to support
capacity-building in Central America, the Caribbean, and eventually West
Africa. A Coordination Group on Security Cooperation (SCCG) was
subsequently tasked to develop specific aspects of the Action Plan.

The recent creation of an International Cooperation Division at the U.S.
Embassy in Bogotá, a line item of US\$15 million in the Narcotics
Affairs Section's (NAS) 2014 budget, strongly suggests that triangulated
security cooperation is not a passing fad. This Division is charged with
liaison between American diplomatic missions in third countries, third
country state representatives (civilian and military), and Colombian
actors, mainly the Ministry of Defense and CNP. The fact that its staff
includes a retired Colombian police colonel, an active Colombian police
sergeant, and two Colombian civilians also points to an unprecedented
degree of bilateral embeddedness and trust.

Officials from both countries maintain that [joint security efforts
abroad play a key role in achieving]{.underline} their [respective
objectives: for [**Colombia**, projecting **leadership** regionally and
globally]{.mark}]{.underline} and planning for the post-conflict,
[[and]{.mark} for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[[interrupting]{.mark} the [flow of **illegal drugs**]{.mark} across its
borders and [**combating violence** and **state weakness**]{.mark} in
**Central America** and the **Caribbean**]{.underline}. However, they
also recognize Colombia's political and strategic value as a U.S. proxy,
and that the use of Colombian facilities and trainers can be up to four
times less expensive than the use of U.S. assets.

#### BUT, [ineffective vetting]{.underline} procedures and [lack of transparency]{.underline} prevent achieving [objectives]{.underline} of [cooperation]{.underline}

More questions than answers

Despite both governments' enthusiasm, which includes viewing
[**Colombia-U.S.** international **security cooperation** as
**deployable elsewhere**]{.underline}, this model [poses more
**questions** than **answers**]{.underline}.

a\. Is Colombia truly a success story?

Colombian Ministry of Defense (2013b) figures indicate that between 2000
and 2013, homicides in Colombia dropped 43 percent, kidnappings 95
percent and terrorist attacks 47 percent. No less impressive,
unemployment was reduced by half and poverty levels dropped from 50
percent to 34 percent. Notwithstanding such improvements, the jury is
still out in terms of how to weight Colombia's success and failures. As
WOLA's Adam Isacson warned in 2010, security gains are "partial...and
weighed down by 'collateral damage.'"

While Colombia's progress is encouraging, its homicide rate remains
above 30 per 100,000, worse than Mexico and about the same as Guatemala.
Other indicators of violence, including members of the security forces
killed in combat, extortion of businesses, and attacks on
infrastructure, remain stubbornly high or have even increased. And both
guerrillas and "new" paramilitary groups, while weaker than a decade
ago, continue to be some of the largest insurgent and illegal groupings
in the history of Latin America.

According to the National Center for Historical Memory (2013), the
number of displaced persons in Colombia is a horrific 5,700,000,
equivalent to 15 percent of the national population. The 2013 report of
the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights praises government policies
such as the 2011 Victims and Land Restitution Law, but highlights
significant deficiencies in their implementation, while identifying
other severe human rights problems. Among these, continued killings and
threats against human rights activists, journalists, and community
leaders, and low conviction rates for human rights abuses committed by
the security forces, most notably the "false positives" scandal,
involving over 3,000 armed forces extrajudicial killings. Judicial
sluggishness in investigating and sentencing approximately 700 elected
and appointed public officials accused of collusion with paramilitary
groups points more generally to the problem of impunity in Colombia.

While poverty has indeed decreased, National Administrative Department
of Statistics (DANE) data indicate that in the countryside it reached
46.8 percent in 2012, suggesting a rise in the gap between urban and
rural areas. Inequality, too, has remained stubbornly high during the
past decade; Colombia continues to be one of the most unequal countries
in the world with the 12th highest income GINI coefficient among 101
countries measured by the UN Development Program (UNDP 2013: 152-5). No
less significant, throughout the national territory bureaucratic
capacity and infrastructure, indispensable for the proper functioning of
state institutions, are still sorely lacking (García and Espinosa 2012).

b\. [What is being **exported**, by **whom**, to **whom** and with
**what effect**]{.underline}?

The [[**lack** of]{.mark} **public [knowledge]{.mark}** about both
Colombian unilateral and **Colombia-U.S. triangulated security
coop**eration in third countries severely **[constrains]{.mark}** the
possibility for independent **citizen [oversight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Beyond official advertisements of the strategy and occasional, anecdotal
press reports, little information is available about the extent and
nature of Colombia's training. While [[**foreign aid law**
requires]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
**report** to **Congress** in some detail about its own overseas
training, these reports include [**no mention** of **U.S.-funded
activities** carried out by **Colombian forces**]{.mark}. This distorts
U.S. reporting to congressional overseers.]{.underline} When training
performed by Colombians is removed from the picture, the training of
thousands of personnel within the Mérida Initiative and Central American
Regional Security [Initiative [frameworks becomes
**invisible**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the public.

During 2013, the U.S.-Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security
Cooperation identified a set of training priorities in Honduras, El
Salvador, Guatemala and Panama, including: [financial crimes and assets
forfeiture, intelligence activities, counter-drug laboratories, judicial
and prosecutor protection, basic riverine operations, small boat
operations, tactical response, polygraph administration, ground
interdiction, fixed and rotary wing pilots, management of informants,
air assault, police testimony, citizen security, and civil affairs
operations]{.underline}. \[3\] However, the names of the [**police**
(and **military**) [units]{.mark} **providing** and [**receiving**
**training**]{.mark} in each country]{.underline}, the title and
[**[contents]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} different
[[training]{.underline}]{.mark} courses, the [[sources
of]{.underline}]{.mark} trainee [[**funding**, and]{.mark} the total
[cost]{.mark}]{.underline} of training [[remain
**undisclosed**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Additionally, [**[evaluation mechanisms]{.mark}** for measuring this
security cooperation's impact [are **weak**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Colombian officials concede that few concrete indicators are in place
for evaluating their success or failure. The effectiveness of U.S.
security cooperation too has been the target of intense debate during
the past several years (see Ribando and Finklea 2013; Adams and Williams
2011; and Moroney et. al. 2009). In order to increase its efficiency and
sustainability, responsible officials have placed emphasis on improving
coordination between donors and recipients; aligning cooperation with
the recipient countries' objectives and capacities; enhancing local
capacity-building; involving citizens in cooperation efforts; and
improving evaluation mechanisms.

Although success is normally measured through quantitative indicators
such as price/purity of narcotics, number of drug arrests and drug
seizures, number of personnel trained, and homicide rates, such
[statistics are increasingly being acknowledged as **poor gauges** of
security cooperation's impact]{.underline}. Even worse, certain
**[[indicators]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as "enemy" casualties, [have
[prompted **illegal practices**]{.mark} such as "false positives" in
Colombia]{.underline} (and, to some extent, Honduras).

c\. Civilian control is weak

Although billed as a civilian-run security cooperation program, in
practice the Colombian Ministry of Defense, the Colombian National
Police, and to a lesser degree, other branches of the armed forces are
clearly at the helm. Beyond its formal role as a liaison between the
Colombian government and others, including the United States, the
Ministry of Foreign Relations lacks the bandwidth for direct involvement
in the planning and day-to-day operation of specific initiatives.
Although its key advisor is a former police chief, Gen (Ret.) Rosso José
Serrano, this official's long-standing, direct and close ties with
numerous U.S. and Latin American security agencies make it reasonable to
assume that the Ministry's own institutional voice is quite small.
Indeed, the CNP and the Defense Ministry, not Foreign Relations, are the
program's main interlocutors at NAS, at the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá.

As for human rights, Colombian officials assert that all of their
international training programs use the same protocols employed within
the Colombian armed forces. [[Colombia **lacks**]{.mark} the
[**wherewithal** to apply]{.mark} **h**uman **r**ights [**vetting**,
which **screens**]{.mark} potential **[recipients]{.mark}** of
assistance [to ensure]{.mark} that known [**abusers** will not
**benefit**]{.mark}. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[claims to carry this out for all received cooperation requests,
although the **[lack of transparency]{.mark}** surrounding the program
has [made this **impossible to verify**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While U.S.
officials interviewed claim that potential recipients of Colombian
training, funded either by the United States or others, are vetted, [it
is **less clear** whether the Colombian **trainers themselves** are
**subject to vetting**]{.underline}. Also, [**[few mechanisms]{.mark}**
other than **human rights vetting** seem to be in place to
[guarantee]{.mark} that "**worst**" **practices**, such as
[**corruption** and **impunity**, are **not transferred**]{.mark} by
Colombian trainers]{.underline} along with "best" ones.

d\. The nuts and bolts of the "drug war" are being reproduced

Calls to rethink the prohibitionist and militarist bent of current drug
policy have emerged from myriad corners of the Western Hemisphere,
including the United States (Isacson, et. al. 2013). It is no small
irony that Juan Manuel Santos, the first sitting president in the world
to make a public plea for an informed and sincere debate on the benefits
and shortcomings of existing strategies, is also exporting, hand in hand
with the United States, some of the very nuts and bolts of the policies
that he says deserve closer scrutiny. It remains debatable whether
existing counternarcotics training programs can be accommodated to the
citizen security needs of those countries receiving Colombian-U.S.
cooperation, without reproducing the discredited, and often destructive,
logic of the "drug war."

Policy Recommendations

Greater transparency. Regular and detailed reporting to Congress and the
public in the United States, Colombia, and third countries where
security training is being provided should be standard practice. In
addition to information on the sources and amounts of funding provided
by the United States and others (such as Canada) for third country
training, formal scrutiny of Colombian trainers, third country trainees,
and course curricula should be facilitated.

Stronger human rights controls. [There is some **risk** that
**international [cooperation]{.mark}** [by **proxy**]{.mark}, as
currently being [practiced by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Colombia]{.mark}, may
**[evade]{.mark}** existing **h**uman **r**ights **[vetting]{.mark}**
**procedures**]{.underline}. The Department of State must ensure that
the U.S. embassy in Colombia vets Colombian trainers, and that the U.S.
embassy in the recipient country vets training candidates, [in order to
ensure that members of units that stand credibly **accused** of gross
**human rights violations** are **excluded** from training.]{.underline}

Better evaluation and follow-up. Colombian security cooperation
currently lacks adequate procedures for evaluating the short, medium,
and long-term impact of the training provided in third countries.
Appropriate measures of success, rooted in local capacity-building and
citizen security, should be identified by distinct country participants
in coordination with civil society actors. Accountability and follow-up
mechanisms should also be created in order to reinforce transparency.

#### Latin American instability causes existential CBRN deployment

Lawrence James **King 19**, Service Academy Research Associate Program,
USAFA, 7-9-19, "The Radiological and WMD Threat Posed to National
Security By Hezbollah in Latin America,"
<https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-19-26442>

Non-State Acquisition of Nuclear Material and WMD Before the
developmental stage of radiological dispersal devices ([RDD), **a**lso
**k**nown **a**s '**[dirty bombs]{.mark}**]{.underline},' or other WMD,
acquisition of the necessary nuclear material proves the most daunting
part for any non-state entity, such as Hezbollah. Overall, RDDs [perform
**exactly** as the name suggests. They combine
**conventional**]{.underline} high [**explosives** with]{.underline}
some kind of [radioactive material to **contaminate an area** and
**[induce chaos]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12 [[WMDs]{.underline}]{.mark},
to [[include **bio**]{.mark}logical, [**chemical**, and **nuclear**
means]{.mark}, follow the same principle]{.underline} but [on a
**large**r scale]{.underline}. A simple threat analysis suggests that
global and regional [[black markets offer]{.mark} the **best chance**
at]{.underline} acquiring [restricted [nuclear
material]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hezbollah's monetary and international
standing as a recognized terrorist organization would provide ample
assurance to reserve restricted resources. While highly impractical, [a
nuclear]{.underline}-enabled [nation-state could]{.underline}
theoretically [supply a non-state actor with **material**]{.underline}
from its own facilities. [The most logical]{.underline} combination
[would be **[Iran]{.mark}** and **Hezbollah**]{.underline}. According to
the US State Department, [Iran]{.underline} holds the dubious label as a
state sponsor of terrorism, as it [[supplies]{.mark} [Hezbollah with
**money** and **arms**]{.mark}]{.underline} against its archrival
Israel. [Iran also maintains a **problematic nuclear
program**]{.underline}. Moreover, [[both]{.underline}]{.mark} actors
have publicly [[made known]{.mark} their **[contempt for the
U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. However, this
phenomenon is highly unlikely for several reasons: stockpiles are
heavily monitored, non-state actors are not trustworthy and could use
the material on a whim without fear of its powers, and nation-states
ultimately fear retribution from other nation-states for the transfer in
the first place. Simply put, the inherent risk is too big for any
nation-state to assume. As a result of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action of 2015 (JCPOA), commonly referred to as the Iran nuclear deal,
the Islamic Republic of Iran is not looking to tarnish its image and
open itself to retribution from Western powers. The avenues of
acquisition do not end with Iran. Black [markets provide **another way**
to obtain restricted **nuclear** and **WMD material**]{.underline}. In
the modern age, the international community has taken steps to ensure
the accountability of nuclear materials through numerous treaties and
bodies. Chief among these steps include the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and IAEA. The responsibility
that comes with state-ownership of nuclear material by itself is
enormous. For those that maintain weapons-grade nuclear material,
thermo-nuclear weapons, and other WMD, the responsibility is that much
greater. However, even with all these safeguards in place, material and
equipment fall into the wrong hands. Currently, [**Brazil**, **Mexico**,
and **Argentina** possess LatinAmerica's largest and **only** nuclear
energy programs]{.underline} for means of power production. 13 While
these facilities are closely monitored, [[the threat of material being
stolen]{.mark} still [exists]{.mark}. Infiltration by]{.underline} means
of [disguise or force stands as a **legitimate obstacle**]{.underline}
to safety and security. Incidents range from the temporary misplacement
of a gauge to a stolen piece of nuclear material or equipment. [[Latin
America]{.mark} **specifically** [has a **worrisome
history**]{.mark}]{.underline} involving these incidents. The CNS
database details that [between 2013 and 2018]{.underline} approximately
**[thirty-five]{.underline}** (35) **[incidents have been
reported]{.underline}**.14 [While this number may seem
**minute**]{.underline} in comparison to that of the United States with
over 600 incidents, the [descriptions]{.underline} of said events
[**raise concerns**. The United States also has stricter reporting
procedures than]{.underline} all [IAEA ITDB-abiding]{.underline}
(Incident and Trafficking Database) [nations in Latin America and houses
significantly **more material**]{.underline} in its borders, [resulting
in a higher margin of reports]{.underline}.15
[[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} the thirty-six [Latin American [cases
involve]{.mark} **lost**, **stolen** and **[unauthorized
possession]{.mark}**]{.underline} of nuclear material and equipment,
[with many **still unaccounted for**]{.underline} to this day. The
majority of incidents are not connected to nefarious intent. Take for
example a truck carrying radioactive sources in Mexico in 2004. A group
of men stole the truck, but shortly abandoned it a distance away, most
likely after noticing its contents. They had no intent of actually
stealing the restricted material. Although small in number, incidents of
nefarious intent have been recorded. [A quick glance at these past
events informs **future threats**]{.underline} and worries. In 2015, a
58 year-old male was arrested in Engativa, Colombia for illegally
stockpiling and selling nuclear material, such asIridium-192 and
depleted uranium.16 More recently on March 19, 2019, armed men attacked
a Brazilian nuclear plant uranium convoy in Rio de Janeiro.17 No
material was compromised. In the instance of a convoy being attacked,
nefarious and deliberate intent becomes likely. These are only two
instances of dangerous activity involving nuclear material in Latin
America. There very well could be other serious cases that have not been
documented. [While]{.underline} the aforementioned [cases
could]{.underline} very well [be anomalies, they still **occur**. After
a couple]{.underline} or few of these [seemingly isolated incidents,
**[terrorists]{.mark}** and other **non-state actors** [have the
capacity to]{.mark} begin [construct]{.mark}ing a **RDD** or
**[WMD]{.mark}**. Additional requirements, such as **subject matter
[experts]{.mark}**, **expert scientists**, [and **instructions**,
are]{.mark}]{.underline} relatively [[easy to acquire]{.mark}. Hezbollah
and]{.underline} its [regional partners could]{.underline} very well
[solicit help or **threaten malice** against private or public subject
matter experts]{.underline} in order to obtain talent. [Even then,
countless resources are available **online** and on the **dark
web**]{.underline} to aid its efforts. One phenomenon that has yet to be
explored is the involvement of regional cartels and paramilitary groups
in such operations. It is highly unlikely that Latin American cartels or
paramilitary factions would ever use RDDs or WMDs against their targets.
The very premise behind a cartel is stealth and to remain out of the
public limelight and away from law enforcement. The nature of
trafficking weapons, drugs, and persons demands isolation and secrecy.
Cartels will only strike if they feel threatened or attacked in the
first place. If prompted to lash out against an interrupting force,
cartels almost always use conventional weapons, such as small arms. It
makes perfect sense that an organization with such modus operandi would
shy away from using RDDs or WMDs. Likewise, paramilitary groups, such as
the ELN and PCC, also strive to operate in relative secrecy and with
surprise. However, different from cartels, their objective to strike out
against government targets unprompted. Take for example the actions of
the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) in Colombia.
Being a paramilitary group, it operated out of remote, crude bases in
the uninhabitable portions of the country, while assassinating and
kidnapping government officials. While the FARC utilized guerilla
tactics, paramilitary factions primarily espouse the use of conventional
weapons and explosives to achieve their desired objectives. [While it is
**unlikely** that [cartels]{.mark} and paramilitary organizations would
use RDDs or WMDs, the United States and]{.underline} its [regional
partners should recognize the]{.underline} potential [role of these
parties in **[traffick]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} nuclear and WMD
**[[material]{.underline}]{.mark}** and equipment [[for **financial
gain**]{.underline}]{.mark}. With their given skill in moving illicit
cargoes, [Latin American [non-state actors are **ideal outlets
for**]{.mark} **terrorist organizations**, such as
**[Hezbollah]{.mark}**, to acquire and move
**high-profile**]{.underline} restricted **[material]{.underline}**
across borders. [Since they are not **bound** to]{.underline} follow
[international laws]{.underline}, these [regional
partnerships]{.underline} would [provide **lucrative
deals**]{.underline} for both sides. The hefty payout of trafficking
dangerous materials could certainly attract attention from cartels and
other organizations looking to make a quick profit. Delivery of
Radiological Material and WMD [Provided that Hezbollah]{.underline} or
other non-state organizations [have the necessary material, the **most
feared stage**]{.underline} of the RDD and WMD process [is]{.underline}
the system's **[implementation]{.underline}**. The international
community would be correct not to expect a thermo-nuclear weapon on-par
with that of the United States or nuclear weapons states of the IAEA.
Dynamic and mobile terrorist cells do not have the resources, time or
capacity to manufacture and store a legitimate nuclear weapon. However,
this likelihood does not guarantee full security in light of '[**dirty
bombs**' or **biological**]{.underline} and chemical
**[systems]{.underline}**. While the size, mechanics, range and
lethality of radiological and WMD devices vary across a large spectrum
depending upon the target, the main problem is they still pose a threat.
With the right isotope, [RDDs can]{.underline} temporarily [contaminate
**large areas** for long amounts of time. Even with]{.underline} the
advent of more [stringent security measures]{.underline} at the
US-Mexican border, [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} concurrent
[[loopholes in **air**, **land**, **sea**, and
**cyber**]{.mark}space]{.underline} that leave the US vulnerable.
[[At]{.mark} more [porous borders]{.mark}]{.underline} been Latin
American countries, [the [possibility is
**quadrupled**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the prospect of trafficking
nuclear and radiological material across sovereign borders looms,
perhaps [the most readily available and effective means of
attack]{.underline} for an organization like Hezbollah [is
**biological**. [WMDs provide an **effective avenue**]{.mark} **of
attack** for]{.underline} an organization such as [Hezbollah.
The]{.underline} examples of the [Ghaddafi and Assad regimes in Libya
and Syria]{.underline} respectively [and their abilities to develop
covert **biological** and **chemical weapons**]{.underline} still [loom
in the Western psyche]{.underline}. With the right tools, [Hezbollah
**could do the same**]{.underline}, if they are not closely surveilled.
[The failed state of Venezuela provides Hezbollah with a
**sanctuary**]{.underline} to operate out of in Latin America. In fact,
[regular flights connect **Caracas** and **Teheran**, making it easy for
operatives to **transit**]{.underline} to and from South America.
Separately, over the past year, the Bolivarian republic has seen
millions of its citizens move to neighboring countries in one of our
time's greatest humanitarian crises. [The]{.underline} US [intelligence
community designated Venezuela a **displacement hotspot**]{.underline}
in 2019, [citing the strong probability of **infectious disease
outbreaks**]{.underline}.18 Many of these displaced persons settle in
Colombia, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. From there [they disperse around the
Western Hemisphere. [An infected]{.mark} operative
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} very well [[**blend in** as]{.mark} a
[refugee]{.mark} and spread a **deadly, infectious disease** around a
**densely-populated area**]{.underline} of a neighboring country. [By
the time authorities notice the epidemic, it is]{.underline} already
**[too late to contain]{.underline}** in light of the rudimentary
medical facilities available. Like human-borne suicide bombings,
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} form of biological attack
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively **[[inexpensive]{.mark} in
Hezbollah's view]{.underline}**, amounting to a follower's life, little
money, and biological agent capable of being harnessed. History teaches
us that most terrorist organizations prefer a variety of delivery
methods, from person-based suicide to car-based to pressure-cooker to
improvised explosive device (IED) bombings and so on. In other words,
[they are [very hard to **track** and **prevent**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Historically, Hezbollah has utilized suicide (body-based), rocket-based
and vehicle-based bombing tactics, as evident in Lebanon, Syria, Israel,
and Argentina. [As detection technology]{.underline} has
[advanced]{.underline} over the years to expose more threats, [so has
the adversary's ability to **disguise**]{.underline} their **[explosives
and products]{.underline}**. The simplest explosive device fueled by
fertilizer or nitrogenous compounds might not be detectable except by
the human eye. Today, gel-based explosives and more minute IEDs stand as
the foremost obstacle to detection and explosive ordinance disposal
(EOD) teams. Counterterrorism measures to prevent these catastrophes
from occurring include: cutting-edge airport and border monitoring
technology able to detect gel-like and composite explosives, new,
discrete systems for detecting radiation, special municipal and federal
law enforcement units dedicated to inspecting vehicles (within the shell
and under the carriage), and collaboration between national agencies and
departments. If Hezbollah or another terrorist organization were to
strike in Latin America, the next logical question to ask would be
'Where?' [There are hundreds of **eligible targets** in the Americas,
such as **embassies**, **consulates**, **shared operating
bases**]{.underline} for the US military, [**foreign nuclear plants**,
foreign **military bases**, the **Panama Canal**, and
**urban**]{.underline} and cultural **[centers]{.underline}**. Looking
at past [[Hezbollah]{.underline}]{.mark} activity in the Middle East, it
is reasonable to surmise [the organization [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
first [[target]{.mark} the Brazilian or Argentinian **Jewish
community**, **Israel**, and [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. Seeing as how Hezbollah has already
targeted the heart of the Jewish community in Buenos Aires, the next
closest and largest communities would be the ones in São Paulo and Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil (±500 and 700 miles away from the TBA respectively).
The closest Israeli consulates are in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
American consulates are located nearby in the same two Brazilian cities,
in addition to the US Embassy in Asunción, Paraguay. The group also
boasts an affinity for military targets. Any arrival of US forces into
South America could also prompt an attack.

Million in Aid for Egypt Over Rights Abuses,\" New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/us/politics/egypt-us-human-rights.html>,
nihara

WASHINGTON --- [Citing **h**uman **r**ights **concerns**, the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will not give
**Egypt** \$130 million in annual security assistance]{.underline},
officials said on Friday, even as the Biden administration continues to
approve billions of dollars in military sales to the Middle Eastern
ally.

The [financial aid was **temporarily frozen** in the fall as the State
Department demanded that Egypt do more to protect the rights of
political critics, journalists, women and members of civil
society]{.underline}. It was the first time that a secretary of state
did not issue a formal national security waiver to provide the aid, and
was aimed at pressuring officials in Cairo to release political
prisoners and stop persecuting critics.

Since then, [Egypt has **failed to convince** the **Biden**
administration that **steps** the country has taken **were enough** to
**protect** **h**uman **r**ights --- and, in turn, **preserve the
funding**]{.underline}.

"[It **sends** the **important message** abroad that we will **back up**
our **commitment** to **h**uman **r**ights with **action**, and **gone**
are the days where **dictators** receive **blank checks** from
America]{.underline}," Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of
Connecticut, said in a statement on Friday.

Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke by phone with Foreign
Minister Sameh Shoukry of Egypt on Thursday, but the State Department
had not made a final decision on whether to withhold the assistance as
of Friday afternoon, said Jalina Porter, a department spokeswoman. But
other department officials, who spoke to reporters on condition that
they not be named in keeping with department protocols, said Mr.
[**Blinken** was **expected** to **divert** the **funding** to other
national security priorities]{.underline} --- and away from Egypt.

The Egyptian government has not officially responded. President Donald
J. [**Trump** also **froze military aid** to Egypt in
**2017**]{.underline}, but released it the following year.

Mr. Murphy said the [Biden administration had outlined a "list of
**narrow** and **wholly achievable** human rights **conditions**" for
Egypt]{.underline} to meet to receive the financial assistance before a
Jan. 31 deadline. Other officials said the precise requirements were
classified but included the [overturning of guidelines that had allowed
for the unjust detention and harassment of Egyptian and foreign human
rights activists]{.underline}.

An annual State Department report on Egypt's human rights record,
released in March, cited numerous examples of abuse by government
security forces, including extrajudicial killings, abductions and
torture. It also found that free and political speech was inhibited,
including by restricting the news media, and that gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgender and intersex people were targeted with violence.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Egypt has
consistently ranked among the world's top jailers of journalists since
President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was elected in 2014.

Last fall, Mr. el-Sisi announced a new strategy to protect human rights
and in the months since has released some political prisoners.

But activists and American officials said it did not go far enough.

In November, five Egyptian activists and politicians, including a former
member of Parliament, were sentenced from three to five years in prison
on charges of spreading false news and using their social media accounts
to undermine national security.

In December, an Egyptian court sentenced three prominent human rights
figures to several years in prison, also on charges of spreading false
news.

"Of course the Egyptian government is saying things have improved, but
the reality on the ground is dark and vicious," said Gamal Eid, who ran
an independent human rights organization in Egypt for 18 years before
announcing this month that he would end its operations, citing security
threats and police intimidation.

Mr. Eid, who was the executive director of the Arabic Network for Human
Rights Information, is embroiled in a criminal case against a number of
nongovernmental organizations, and dozens of their members, that the
authorities have accused of receiving foreign funding illegally. He has
been banned from travel since 2016, and his assets have been frozen. Two
of his team members, a lawyer and a researcher, are in jail.

The [**blocked funding** is just a **fraction** of an **estimated \$1.3
billion in aid** the United States generally gives Egypt each year. Only
a **small amount** of the **assistance** is **conditioned** on the
country's human rights]{.underline} record, [under requirements set by
Congress]{.underline}, and officials at the State Department said \$130
million was the maximum they could withhold in a single fiscal year.

But [Egypt has **continued to buy billions** of dollars worth of
military **airplanes**, **ships** and other **equipment**]{.underline}
--- including \$2.5 billion in C-130 cargo jets and radar that was
announced this week alone.

The State Department officials described military sales as unrelated to
the financial assistance that the United States provides Egypt annually.
They also said the military equipment most recently sold to Cairo would
further American security interests; the jets, in particular, would
replace older planes Egypt had used to distribute humanitarian aid and
coronavirus relief supplies.

"Our relationship with Egypt is multifaceted, and Egypt is a valuable
partner across many fronts," said Ned Price, the State Department
spokesman. "The United States remains committed to engaging with Egypt
on human rights issues."

After taking office a year ago, the Biden administration issued a
statement promising to put "human rights at the center of U.S. foreign
policy." It has since sought to walk a line between enforcing American
standards of human rights and alienating strategically located foreign
partners who do not adhere to those standards.

Egypt is a key partner with the United States in negotiating peace
between Israel and Hamas, and providing stability in the Gaza Strip. But
it also was not invited to a meeting of more than 100 countries that
President Biden hosted in December to rally the world's democracies
against authoritarian governments.

Amr Magdi, a senior Middle East researcher at Human Rights Watch, said
the recent military sales showed that the Biden administration was still
willing to provide diplomatic and military support to Mr. el-Sisi,
despite the abuses.

"[That sends a signal to the Egyptian government that **they can
definitely get what they want** with time]{.underline}, and that they
don't really have to meet any concrete benchmarks, and that the release
of just a few activists can serve as the fig leaf to the Biden
administration and others who want to continue doing business as usual,"
Mr. Magdi said.

#### [Reprogramming]{.underline} of FMF [thumps]{.underline} the turn -- BUT, [doesn't solve]{.underline} the net benefit -- [credible enforcement]{.underline} of Leahy is [key]{.underline}

**Human Rights Watch 22**, 2-1-2022, \"Joint Statement -- Biden
Administration's Decision to Reprogram Military Aid to Egypt Is
Necessary but Insufficient,\"
<https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/02/01/joint-statement-biden-administrations-decision-reprogram-military-aid-egypt>,
\*\[signatories list condensed\], nihara

Following the January 30 deadline, the [Biden]{.underline}
administration [decided]{.underline} that [it will reprogram \$130
million in Fiscal Year]{.underline} (FY) [2020]{.underline} Foreign
Military Financing (**[FMF]{.underline}**) originally [intended for the
**brutal government** of **Egypt**ian President Abdel **Fattah
al-Sisi**.]{.underline} The United States had withheld this military aid
since mid-September of last year [pending the Egyptian government's
fulfillment of two **modest** **h**uman **r**ights
**conditions**]{.underline}: ending the unjust detentions of or dropping
the charges against 16 Egyptians politically targeted by al-Sisi's
government and completely closing the decade-old Case 173 targeting
independent civil society.

[In light of]{.underline} the [Egypt]{.underline}ian
government['s]{.underline} **[abject failure]{.underline}** [to
meet]{.underline} the minimal [conditions]{.underline} specified by the
administration, the undersigned organizations welcome the
[Biden]{.underline} administration's [decision to **reprogram** this
**assistance in full**. Upholding the conditions on the aid signals the
importance of human rights in the bilateral relationship. But by
**moving forward** with **billions** of dollars' worth of **security
assistance**]{.underline} just days before the decision, [the **strong
message** that could have been sent by reprogramming assistance has been
**undermined**]{.underline}.

Notably, since September, Egyptian authorities have released a few
prominent political prisoners, demonstrating that U.S. pressure can be
effective. Yet simultaneously, as [civil society forewarned, the
Egyptian government has **continued perpetrating** egregious **h**uman
**r**ights **violations**: relentlessly targeting independent media and
journalists, cracking down on civil society, repressing political
opponents, strong-arming private businesses, and prohibiting protests
and free expression]{.underline}. Despite ending the state of emergency
on October 25, [parliament]{.underline} quickly passed several
amendments [permanently consolidating the president's and military's
emergency powers.]{.underline} Trials in front of emergency courts
continued, most notably in the case of prominent activist and author
Alaa Abdel Fattah, [human rights lawyer]{.underline} Mohamed El-Baqer,
[and]{.underline} [blogger]{.underline} Mohamed "Oxygen" Ibrahim, who
[were handed lengthy, unappealable prison sentences]{.underline} on
bogus charges of spreading "fake news" in December.

Reprogramming the withheld funds could have built important leverage to
pressure the Egyptian government to meet basic human rights standards;
instead, the [Biden administration spectacularly **undercut** its
**decision** by **announcing**]{.underline}, just days earlier, [more
than **\$2.5 billion in arms sales** to **Egypt** and obligating \$1
billion in FY2021 FMF. **Denying** the **ruthless** government of
President al-Sisi \$130 million while **moving forward** with **weapons
deals** and military aid worth **nearly thirty times** as much
**undermines** the very **purpose** of **reprogramming** the
**funds**]{.underline}. In doing so, [the administration also
**squandered** what could have been a **meaningful step** toward
**fulfilling** its **promise** to "**center**" **h**uman **r**ights in
its relationship with Egypt.]{.underline}

[Congress had **placed conditions** on \$300 million in FY2020
FMF.]{.underline} The [Biden]{.underline} administration's [decision to
**bypass** those **conditions** and **withhold** only **\$130
million**]{.underline}, a move similar to one taken by the Trump
administration in 2017, has proved insufficient. [Unfortunately, the
administration's recent steps have again **failed** to **adequately
respond** to the **severity** of the **h**uman **r**ights **crisis** in
**Egypt**. It is therefore **imperative** for **Congress** to **step
up** and **make clear** that **continued** U.S. military **support** for
**Egypt's government** is **contingent** on drastic **improvements** to
their **h**uman **r**ights record.]{.underline}

### \-\-- at: suez canal !

#### No Suez Canal impact

Todd C. **Lopez 21**, 3-29-2021, \"Military Using Alternatives to Suez
Canal In Middle East,\" U.S. Department of Defense,
<https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2553768/military-using-alternatives-to-suez-canal-in-middle-east/>,
nihara

Last week, the container ship \"Ever Given\" became lodged in the [Suez
Canal]{.underline}, the 120-mile long man-made waterway that runs
through Egypt and connects the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea. The
waterway allows commercial vessels to travel more quickly between the
Far East and Europe. The route is also used by military ships, including
those of the United States Navy. The [**blockage** is **not a show
stopper** for the **U.S. military**]{.underline}, however.

\"Because [we\'ve **long recognized** the fact that **narrow waterways**
like this are maritime **chokepoints**, we always make sure that we have
**alternate capabilities** to meet **mission
requirements**,]{.underline}\" Pentagon Press Secretary John F. Kirby
said during a briefing Monday afternoon. \"We have recognized the fact
that [**chokepoints** like the Suez Canal could suffer
**blockages**]{.underline} like this, [and it\'s factored
into]{.underline} just [normal **operational planning**]{.underline}.\"

Beyond that, Kirby said, the [**temporary shutdown** of the Suez Canal
has not caused the U.S. military to **rethink its posture** in the
Middle East or its **mission requirements** there]{.underline}, because
[there are **already other plans** in place for such
situations.]{.underline}

\"In any circumstance around the world, [the U.S. military has \... at
its disposal **any number** of **alternate ways** of achieving **mission
success** and meeting our **mission requirement**]{.underline},\" he
said.

Kirby also commended the Egyptian government for its work so far in
getting the ship freed from the canal and its efforts to re-open the
canal to maritime traffic.

\"I would also say that we want to commend Egyptian authorities for ---
the only way to put it is --- a Herculean effort to get this ship
free,\" Kirby said. \"Clearly they have done just amazing work getting
that freighter off the \... canal bank, and back in the middle of it
again \... I think they deserve a lot of credit for that.\"

VIII\. Judicial Barriers to Enforcement

In a series of decisions, [the **Supreme [Court]{.mark}** has [made
it]{.mark} **virtually [impossible]{.mark}** for anyone [to **sue** to
**enforce**]{.mark} the **[Leahy Law]{.mark}**. Any challenge to the
Leahy Law is likely to **fail** because of **sovereign
immunity**]{.underline}, 249 [because **enforcement** is a **political
question**]{.underline}, 250 [or because any conceivable **plaintiffs**
would **lack standing**]{.underline}. 251

[[Iran-Contra]{.mark} presents a good indication of what would
happen]{.underline} if foreign citizens tried challenging the Leahy Law.
In Sanchez-Espinoza v. Reagan, when twelve citizens of Nicaragua sued
for redress of injuries to themselves by the Contras, then-Circuit Judge
Antonin [Scalia **[barred]{.mark} the complaint** [on **sovereign
immunity**]{.mark} grounds.]{.underline} 252 Scalia said:

[It would make a **mockery** of the **doctrine** of **sovereign
immunity** if **federal courts** were **authorized** to **sanction** or
**enjoin**, by judgments nominally against **present** or **former**
**Exec**utive **officers**]{.underline}, actions that are, concededly
and as a jurisdictional necessity, official actions of the United
States. Such judgments would necessarily \"interfere with the public
administration,\" or \"restrain the government from acting, or ...
compel it to act.\" These consequences are tolerated when the officer\'s
action is unauthorized because contrary to statutory or constitutional
prescription, but we think that exception can have no application when
the basis for jurisdiction requires action authorized by the sovereign
as opposed to private wrongdoing... .

... The support for military operations that we are asked to terminate
has, if the allegations in the complaint are accepted as true, received
the attention and approval of the President, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of Defense, and the Director of the CIA, and involves the
conduct of our diplomatic relations with at least four foreign states
... . 253

More recently, [in **Arar v. [Ashcroft]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
**[Second Circuit]{.underline}** said that it \"has [[recognized]{.mark}
\'the generally accepted view that [foreign policy was]{.mark} the
province and [responsibility of]{.mark} the
**[Exec]{.mark}utive**]{.underline} ... . [Thus, **unless Congress**
specifically has **provided otherwise**, courts traditionally have been
**reluctant** to **intrude** upon the **authority** of the **Executive**
in **military** and national security **affairs**]{.underline}.\'\" 254

Moreover, [in [Goldwater]{.mark} v. Carter, the Supreme [Court
ruled]{.mark} that the [**authority** to **terminate treaties**
is]{.mark} a [**political question** and]{.mark} therefore
**[non-justiciable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 255 In his concurrence,
Justice Powell said \"[the Judicial Branch **should not decide** issues
affecting the allocation of power between the President and Congress
until the political branches reach a constitutional
impasse]{.underline}.\" 256 [While there have been **[systemic
flaws]{.mark}** that [lead to]{.mark} the **[lack of
enforcement]{.mark}** of the **Leahy Law**, given [the **deference** to
the **Exec**]{.mark}**utive** on matters of **foreign policy**, it is
**highly unlikely** to lead to a **constitutional
impasse**]{.underline}.

[[Nor do]{.mark} Members of [Congress have **standing**]{.mark} to
**sue**. In **[Raines]{.mark} v. Byrd**, the **Supreme Court
[denied]{.mark}** Members of **[Congress]{.mark}** the [**ability**
to]{.mark} **challenge laws** based upon a **diminution** of
**congressional power**]{.underline}. 257 The Court said that,
\"appellees have alleged no injury to themselves as individuals, the
[institutional injury they allege is wholly **abstract** and **widely
dispersed**, and their attempt to **[litigate]{.mark} this dispute** at
this time and in this form is contrary to historical
experience]{.underline}.\" 258

[With respect to the Leahy Law itself, a **[District
Court]{.mark}**]{.underline} gave two reasons in
**[[deny]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing Representative Kucinich\'s
**[[suit]{.underline}]{.mark}** to stop U.S. military action in Libya
[that **cut against** any **congressional suits** [to]{.mark} enforce
the **[Leahy Law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The first was the ability of
the legislators to seek a **legislative remedy**,]{.underline} 259 [and
the second was **congressional action**]{.underline}, 260 in this case
voting against de-funding the Libyan intervention. [Since a
**legislative remedy** to a **lack** of **enforcement** of the **Leahy
Law** is **theoretically available** and there have been **successive
appropriations bills** passed that have had the effect of funding the
military units at issue, it is **[highly]{.mark} [unlikely]{.mark}**
that a [suit brought by]{.mark} Members of [**Congress** will
**survive** a **challenge**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Due to the **difficulty** in **tracking FMF**]{.underline} to a
particular unit, [and]{.underline} therefore the [[impossibility of
demonstrating]{.mark} that the U.S. arms and training were the cause of
a **[specific injury]{.mark}**, it is similarly **[unlikely]{.mark}**
that **[other]{.mark}** groups of [**plaintiffs** will have
**standing**]{.mark} **to sue**]{.underline}. The [Supreme Court ruled,
in **Schlesinger** v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, that unless
a citizen has been personally injured \"**standing** to sue may not be
predicated upon an interest ... which is held in common by all members
of the public, because of the **necessarily abstract** nature of the
injury all citizens share]{.underline}.\" 261 Further, in United States
v. Richardson, the Supreme Court ruled that taxpayers did not have
standing to sue because \"[to **invoke judicial power** the claimant
must have a **\'personal stake** in the outcome,\' or a
**\'particular**, **concrete injury**,\' or \'a **direct injury**,\' in
short, something more than \'generalized grievances]{.underline}.\'\"
262 However, [the [**possibility** of]{.mark} any [**plaintiff**
meeting]{.mark} these [**requirements** is **de
minimis**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Due to sovereign immunity and the political question and standing
doctrines, the [[Judiciary **cannot check**]{.mark} presidential
[**violations** of the **Leahy Law**]{.mark}. Without
**Congress**]{.underline} clearly articulating a cause of action, the
[courts will [continue to **bar**]{.mark} any potential
**[plaintiffs]{.mark}** from **seeking** a **judicial
remedy**]{.underline}. It is up to Congress, not the courts, to give
strength to the Leahy Law.

**[CHRIS]{.underline}** VAN HOLLEN (D-Md.) [have introduced the
"Upholding Human Rights Abroad Act" to **close a gap** in the **Leahy
Law** --- which **prohibits** the Defense Department and the State
Department from providing military **assistance** to foreign **security
forces** that **violate** **h**uman **r**ights]{.underline}.

Specifically, [the bill]{.underline} by Jacobs and Van Hollen [would
**require** human rights **vetting** for a pair of the **Pentagon's**
**security cooperation** programs]{.underline} --- "Section 127e" and
"Section 1202" --- that have drawn scrutiny in open-source reporting by
the Intercept and other media outlets.

"[**H**uman **r**ights **vetting** is an **essential part** of how we
**engage** with **other countries**]{.underline}, but [over the last two
decades Section 127e and Section 1202 have skirted these vetting
requirements and]{.underline}, in some cases, [been **used with
partners** who have **consistently violated** **h**uman
**r**ights]{.underline}," Jacobs said in a statement.
"**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [support for
**unvetted** human rights **abusers** is not only deeply immoral and
irresponsible, it is also **counterproductive**, leading to more unrest,
instability, and terrorist activity]{.underline}."

Van Hollen added in his own statement: "\[F\]or too long, [**legal
loopholes** have allowed the **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense to
**bypass** proper **vetting**, **reporting**, and **oversight
protocols** when providing **other nations** or **groups** with certain
types of **military assistance**]{.underline}."

Sen. PATRICK **[LEAHY]{.underline}** (D-Vt.), for whom the Leahy Law is
named, [said]{.underline} in a statement that the [Pentagon "should have
closed this loophole on its own initiative. The Upholding Human Rights
Abroad Act will **ensure** that the **Leahy Law** is **applied
uniformly**, so foreign partners are **vetted** and those who
**violate** **h**uman **r**ights are **excluded** from these
**programs**]{.underline}."

A. Egypt

[[Despite]{.mark} its **[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
[**record**, **Egypt** is]{.mark} one of the [**biggest recipients**
of]{.mark} **U.S. [aid]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A lower middle-income
country, Egypt received \$ 1.25 billion in U.S. foreign assistance in
FY2018. 40Of that amount, \$ 1 billion went towards foreign military
financing. 41Over the last 70 years, it has received over \$ 80 billion
in U.S. foreign assistance, 42and it has requested \$ 1.38 billion for
FY 2020. 43[While it remains a key foreign aid recipient, Egypt\'s
**h**uman **r**ights **record** is **disturbing**]{.underline}. 44

The [Egyptian state has **[tortured suspects]{.mark}**, implemented
**[mass trials]{.mark}** against **children**, and **[executed
detainees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In January 2002, Mr. Ahmad El-Maati, a
falsely accused terrorist suspect, was tortured by Egyptian security
officials:

\[a\]n electric prod was used on \[El-Maati\'s\] hands, legs and
genitals during interrogations. His hands were cuffed so tightly that
his wrists bled. . . . He was kept blindfolded and handcuffed in a
hallway with other prisoners for what he estimates was about two weeks.
It was during this time, Mr. El-Maati says, that he developed anal
bleeding. Canadian doctors later diagnosed an anal fissure requiring
surgery. 45

Since 2013, the [Egyptian government\'s use of mass trials and death
sentences against children have skyrocketed;]{.underline} these include
death sentences [issued by military courts]{.underline} 46\-- the same
military [that has received **[billions of dollars]{.mark}** in
**assistance** from the U.S. government.]{.underline} 47The
[**U.S.-based** **h**uman **r**ights **organization**]{.underline},
Belady, [puts the number of [children arrested]{.mark} by the current
regime for political reasons at over 2,000]{.underline}. 48Since former
General el-Sisi assumed office, [Egypt has been among the ten countries
with the [**highest numbers** of **executions**]{.mark} per
year.]{.underline} 49At an Arab-EU summit in 2019, [el-[Sisi **stood
by**]{.mark} his government\'s [actions]{.mark}, arguing that executing
detainees is part of \"our humanity,\" distinguishing it from \"your
\[European\] humanity]{.underline}.\" 50Yet, Article 2 of the Egyptian
Constitution states that Islam is the official state religion and that
the primary source of legislation is Sharia law. 51The Quran forbids
unjust killing, including judicially mandated death sentences that lack
due process. 52El-Sisi\'s use of \"our humanity\" [as justification for
mass trials, death sentences in absentia, and sham military trials
should [**sound the alarms** for]{.mark} a [White House that]{.mark}
claims to be **[send]{.mark}ing [aid]{.mark}** to \"those who respect
us.\"]{.underline} 53

In April 2019, the [Egyptian Constitution was amended to lengthen
el-[Sisi\'s]{.mark} term from four to six years and to allow him to run
for an additional term, **[solidifying]{.mark}** his [**ability** to
**remain in power**]{.mark} until 2030; it also gave him far [**greater
control** over the **judicial branch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 54The
[fairness of the referendum on these amendments was widely
**criticized**]{.underline}. Websites that encouraged people to vote
\"no\" were blocked by the government, and Egyptian citizens living
abroad were given very little notice to travel to a consulate to vote.
55

Between 2017 and 2019, [the Egyptian government blocked over 600 news,
political, and human rights websites without judicial
authorization]{.underline}. 56It was also [among the four worst
countries for journalists in 2018]{.underline}, with twenty-five
journalists arrested that year, nineteen of which detained for
\"spreading false news.\" 57In August 2020, [Egypt\'s \"special
counterterrorism courts\" sentenced in absentia Bahey eldin Hassan, a
prominent human rights activist, to fifteen years in prison for
criticizing President Sissi\'s]{.underline} regime on Twitter. 58

In May 2015, the [[State Department]{.mark} informed Congress that it
was in the national interest to **[continue assisting]{.mark}
[Egypt]{.mark}**, but it also highlighted many of the country\'s
violations that year]{.underline}, writing: \"Government forces have
committed [**arbitrary** or otherwise **unlawful killings** during
dispersal of demonstrators]{.underline}, of persons in custody, and
during military operations in the northern Sinai Peninsula.\" 59[This
was not an isolated incident.]{.underline} Public Law 115-141 states
that of the \$ 1.3 billion in assistance to Egypt, \$ 300 million must
be withheld until the Secretary of State certifies that Egypt is taking
effective steps on various human rights. 60However, it also states that
the Secretary may waive the certification requirement if he or she
determines that doing so is important to the national security interest
of the U.S. 61In August 2019, a year full of gross violations of human
rights by the Egyptian government, Secretary Pompeo invoked the national
security interest waiver. 62[Judging by the [**broad power** vested in
the Secretary of State]{.mark} by the statute, it is fairly
**[straightforward]{.mark}** for the Secretary [to **override**]{.mark}
the **[recommendations]{.mark}** of **DRL officials** and
**investigators** on the ground at U.S. embassies abroad]{.underline};
he or she merely has to declare that it is in the national security
interest of the U.S. to do so. 63

Despite Egypt\'s troubling track record (these are only a few examples),
the Trump administration has been outspoken in its support of the
Egyptian dictatorship. 64On April 3, 2017, President Trump welcomed
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the White House. 65During an
interview in the Oval Office, President Trump spoke highly of his
Egyptian counterpart: \"We are very much behind President el-Sisi. He\'s
done a fantastic job . . . And I just want to say to you, Mr. President,
that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me.\"
66Just eighteen days later, on April 21, 2017, President Trump welcomed
to the White House Ms. Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American humanitarian
worker who was incarcerated by el-Sisi\'s regime for three years without
a trial. 67During the televised meeting, no mention was made of the
Egyptian government\'s treatment of Ms. Hijazi, and the President
refused to take any questions. 68Ironically, while in the Oval Office,
she sat in the same chair that was occupied by her authoritarian
persecutor eighteen days earlier. 69Furthermore, at the G7 Summit in
France in September 2019, President Trump notoriously called out,
\"Where\'s my favorite dictator?\" while awaiting a meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart. 70\"Egypt has a great leader, he\'s highly
respected, he\'s brought order,\" President Trump said at a meeting with
el-Sisi during the UN General Assembly in September 2019. 71That same
week, el-Sisi\'s regime arrested more than 2,000 peaceful protesters
throughout the country. 72

#### US-Egypt cooperation and funding of Suez canal [maritime chokepoint operations]{.underline} is key to [naval power projection]{.underline} AND [crises response]{.underline} -- AND, trade -- collapses [European]{.underline}, [Asian]{.underline}, AND [US economy]{.underline} -- empowers China to [imperil war reserves]{.underline} and cause [naval crises]{.underline}

Warfare and Advanced Technology in The Heritage Foundation's Center for

About U.S. Maritime Security,\" National Interest,
<https://nationalinterest.org/feature/what-closing-suez-canal-says-about-us-maritime-security-182571>,
nihara

The Ever Given wasn't the first ship to block the Suez Canal. A
multi-ship pile-up in 2018 snarled maritime traffic there for two days.
But the sheer size and bulk of the Ever Given was a much greater
challenge---one that took 11 days to solve.

[As **container ships** grow ever more **massive**, it becomes
**increasingly difficult** to **clear accidents** quickly in **strategic
waterways**. This]{.underline} simple reality [has troubling
**economic** and **military implications**]{.underline}.

[[If]{.mark} a **[strategic]{.mark}** maritime [**chokepoint** such
as]{.mark} the **[Suez]{.mark} Canal** [is
**closed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, then [how long can this be **endured**
before the [U.S. **economy** suffers]{.mark} **serious
[damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}? And is the Navy appropriately positioned
and sized to contend with such closures?

When the Ever Given grounded on March 23, [**regional
[tensions]{.mark}** had been **[high]{.mark}** for months due to an
undeclared **tanker war** [between **Iran** and **Israel**]{.mark}.
There were also **mounting concerns** over **[Russian]{.mark} military
[forces]{.mark}** massing in **Crimea** and on **Ukraine's** Eastern
**borders**. To **move forces quickly** between the **Arabian Gulf** and
the **Mediterranean**, the U.S. [**Navy** must have **access** to the
**Suez Canal**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without it, [naval forces must
circumnavigate Africa, taking **over a week** to arrive at a
**flashpoint**]{.underline}.

On the day before Ever Given's grounding, the [Eisenhower **carrier
strike group** (CSG) was in the Eastern Mediterranean conducting
**operations** against **ISIS**]{.underline} (Islamic State in Syria and
Iraq), [while the **Makin Island** amphibious ready group was in the
**Arabian Sea**. Had **tensions** turned to **conflict** in **Ukraine**
while the **canal was blocked**, the [nearest]{.mark} significant [naval
carrier]{.mark} strike force]{.underline} (the Theodore Roosevelt CSG)
[[would]{.mark} [have had to make]{.mark} a **[circuitous
transit]{.mark}** from the **Indian Ocean**]{.underline}---a danger
acknowledged publicly by the Pentagon.

The [Suez Canal **[closure]{.mark}** created a 360-ship traffic jam and
**[disrupted]{.mark}** almost **[13 percent]{.mark}** of **global
maritime [trade]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to creating added
costs for shippers, [the **[blockage]{.mark}** is **anticipated** to
[cause]{.mark} downstream **[backlogs]{.mark}** as delayed ships surge
into and **overwhelm ports** and **losses** in **global trade** of up to
\$10 billion.]{.underline} The United States is less reliant on the Suez
Canal than [[European]{.mark} and [Asian economies]{.mark}]{.underline},
but [had the Panama Canal been similarly blocked[, it could **severely
impact** the U.S.]{.mark} economy]{.underline}, according to a 2010 U.S
government study.

The Ever Given episode proves that [ever-larger container ships
transiting strategic chokepoints pose a challenge for modern tugs and
salvage ships to quickly clear. It would take **weeks** for **global
supply chains** to adjust to a **prolonged disruption** of the Panama or
**Suez Canals**]{.underline}. Consider that, had this disruption
occurred during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic, medical
supplies would have been delayed with high human costs.

[To **mitigate** such **disruptions**, the [Navy must ensure]{.mark} a
**distributed [forward naval presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On April 2
the [Eisenhower CSG exited the Suez Canal heading south, leaving no
**naval strike group** supporting operations in the
Mediterranean]{.underline}.

Additionally, [the Navy---in [cooperation with]{.mark} the [State
Department]{.mark}---[should]{.mark} seek to [ensure]{.mark} that
**canal [operators]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} **adequate
[resources]{.mark}** to clear the largest of vessels, grounded or
intentionally sunk. [This would be in **Cairo's**]{.mark} **financial
[interest]{.mark}** as well as ours]{.underline}. The [Suez Canal
generates annual revenues of \$5.6 billion, [providing Egypt
with]{.mark} critical **[foreign currency]{.mark}** and [making
up]{.mark} almost **two percent** of its **economy**.]{.underline}
Similarly, [the Panama Canal generates \$3.4 billion in annual revenues
and accounts for **40 percent** of that nation's
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, [the [nation needs to]{.mark} look to procuring the
capacity to **unilaterally [re-open]{.mark}** strategic [**chokepoints**
should]{.mark} the [need **arise**]{.mark} in a
**conflict**]{.underline}. In the case of Ever Given, it required a
special suction dredger able to remove two thousand cubic meters of soil
an hour and special heavy capacity salvage tugs, like the Dutch ALP
Guard which took five days to arrive.

Additionally, a third party with controlling stock of chokepoints,
notably [**[China]{.mark}** in the **Panama Canal**, [can **imperil
transit** of]{.mark} **critical [war reserves]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
**naval [vessels]{.mark}** [in **crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On this
more action is needed.

With the Biden administration seeking a multi-trillion dollar
"infrastructure" bill, it would be wise to consider investments that
harden the U.S. economy to such disruptions. After all, in 2011, [the
U.S. relied on maritime shipping to receive 53 percent of its imports
and send 38 percent of its exports]{.underline} and remains much the
same today.

Ever Given's grounding comes at a time when more and more political
leaders and naval thinkers are turning to the precepts of America's
revered maritime visionary---Alfred Thayer Mahan---to answer the core
question: "What is a Navy for?" The sight of hundreds of ships backed up
around the Suez Canal as tensions rose from the Taiwan Straits to the
Black Sea should be instructive.

#### Trade solves global crises

Ian **Bremmer 19**, PhD, Professor, Applied Geopolitics, Columbia
University\'s School of International and Public Affairs, President,
Eurasia Group, , editor-at-large at Time, 11/18/19, \"The End of the
American International Order: What Comes Next?\", Time,
https://time.com/5730849/end-american-order-what-next/

China has made its decision. Beijing is building [[a **separate system**
of **Chinese tech**]{.mark}nology---its own standards, infrastructure,
and supply chains]{.underline}---to compete with the West. Make no
mistake: this [is the single most consequential geopolitical decision
taken in the last three decades. It's also [the **greatest threat** to
**globalization** since]{.mark} the end of **[World War
II.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It wasn't supposed to be like this.
[Globalization has [lifted **billions**]{.mark} of people [from
**poverty**]{.mark} around the world. We now live longer, healthier, and
more productive lives than ever before]{.underline}. We are better
educated and better informed than at any time in history. [There has
never been a better place and a better time to be alive]{.underline}
than right here, right now. [So why are so many people so angry, and why
is globalization under unprecedented threat?]{.underline} Why are
citizens in country after country bitterly casting aside both governing
and opposition parties in favor of political disruptors? At this moment
in history, why is there so much alarm? [Because this IS a moment of
transformation, and uncertainty. In much of the world, the
**[lightning-fast, cross-border flows]{.mark}** of ideas, information,
people, money, goods and services---the same forces that have created so
much opportunity and prosperity---also [generate **fear**.]{.mark} Fear
that [the world]{.mark} now [becomes **more complicated** and]{.mark}
more **[dangerous]{.mark}** in real time]{.underline}. Fear that the
world we knew is gone for good, and fear that no one is willing and able
to do anything about it. I want to talk with you today about why all
this is happening, and why it's so vitally important that we're having
this conversation at this moment---and in the heart of this great
country. Japan is both blessed and burdened by its unique place in this
G-Zero world. Japan has the political stability, the foresight, and the
technological talent to help lead the world into a brighter future than
the one we currently face. We all have reason to hope that Japan's
leaders, its companies, its political will, and its people will help
lead the transition toward a new order, one in which human ingenuity,
moral imagination, and courage can help all of us meet the challenges to
come. The Geopolitical Recession When I started Eurasia Group in 1998,
our clients were interested almost exclusively in the so-called
emerging-markets countries, those that presented both big growth
opportunities and unfamiliar political challenges. I defined an emerging
market as "any country where politics matters at least as much as
economic fundamentals for market outcomes." Countries like Japan, the
United States, Canada, and the leading nations of Western Europe offered
a much more stable and predictable political landscape, but more modest
opportunities for growth. Those days are gone. The financial crisis of
2008 and the turmoil that followed have brought politics directly into
the performance of economies and markets in even the world's richest
countries. [We]{.underline} also [face a growing number of
**[transnational threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S.-led global
order is finished. So many of the [dark clouds]{.underline} now hanging
over us---from **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
[**[cyber]{.mark}**-conflict]{.underline}, from
[**[terror]{.mark}**ism]{.underline} to [the post-industrial
revolution---move unchecked across borders, leaving national governments
much less able to meet the needs of their citizens.]{.underline} Today,
[it is not economics but geopolitics that has become the main driver of
global economic uncertainty. The world has entered [a **"geopolitical
recession,"**]{.mark} a [**bust**]{.mark} cycle for [the **international
system**]{.mark} and **[relations]{.mark}** among
governments]{.underline}. It's a time when [**[alliances]{.mark}**,
institutions, and the values that bind them]{.underline} together are
all [coming apart.]{.underline} From an historical perspective,
geopolitical recessions are both rarer than economic recessions and
longer-lasting. We'll be living in this geopolitical recession for at
least a decade to come. How did we get here? Economists tell us that the
process of "creative destruction" fuels the engine of growth that builds
the future, and history says that's true. But lives and livelihoods are
destroyed in the process, and growing numbers of people say their
government is either powerless to help them manage or doesn't care what
happens to them. Resentment of elites is on the rise in every region of
the world. [The system is rigged]{.underline} against them, they
believe; it's increasingly hard to argue they're wrong. This [[creates
opportunities for]{.mark} a new breed of **[populist]{.mark}** who
offers [scapegoats]{.mark} and promises of protection]{.underline}.
These politicians did not invent this problem. They're just profiting
from it. And the greatest worry is this: [**All [this]{.mark} anger
[is]{.mark} building [in good economic times]{.mark}. What happens [when
economies start to slow]{.mark}?**]{.underline} History shows that
[[governments]{.mark} that are **[unpopular at home]{.mark}** are more
likely to **[make trouble abroad]{.mark}**, especially with their
neighbors, [to]{.mark} rally public support and **[divert
attention]{.mark}** from domestic troubles. That breeds less trust among
governments. The risk of misunderstanding rises. [**Accidents** are
**more likely**]{.mark}---and more likely [to **escalate**]{.mark}
toward conflict.]{.underline} There are three implications to
consider... The first centers on "tail risks," the
low-likelihood-but-high-impact events that have become commonplace in a
world reshaped by China's rise, Middle East turmoil, populist Europe,
revanchist Russia, divided America, a world-record 71 million displaced
people, and the destabilizing effects of technological and climate
changes. [Imagine a military accident in [the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}, at a time [when the
U.S. and Chinese presidents are locked in a war of wills over trade and
technology]{.underline}, and determined to project strength at home,
[that spirals out of control. Turn to the **[Middle
East]{.mark}**]{.underline}---the U.S. has confronted
[Iran]{.underline}. Since President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the
Iran nuclear deal and then re-imposed sanctions, Iran has taken bold
military action---including a strike on the heart of [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}'s oil infrastructure. Washington responded by
sending troops to Saudi Arabia, a move which, you might recall, sharply
increased the risk of terrorism in the U.S. a generation ago. What if
President Trump is defeated for re-election next year, and **[[North
Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Kim Jong-un discovers the next U.S.
president won't accept his phone calls? What provocative action might he
take? What accidents might he risk? What if a debt crisis hits Italy,
created when a future Italian government defies
**[[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}** budget rules and inadvertently creates a
[financial crisis]{.underline} too large for lenders to manage? Or a
miscalculation in [Ukraine]{.underline} pulls
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** into a [shooting war]{.underline}? Or
a [US-Russia cyber confrontation]{.underline} hits critical
infrastructure, creating a humanitarian crisis inside an American city?
[The lack of coordinated leadership in today's world, our
**[G-zero]{.mark}** world, [makes]{.mark} all of these [crises]{.mark}
both more likely to happen and [**more difficult** to manage]{.mark}
when they do]{.underline}. Individually, they are long-shots.
Collectively, [they pose unprecedented danger]{.underline}. The second
implication of the geopolitical recession is the breakdown of
international institutions. The [tens of [millions of
**displaced**]{.mark} people]{.underline} around the world today
[[create]{.mark} one of the most **[urgent]{.mark}** and expensive
**[problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the United Nations has to cope
with. Yet, even as national governments are less willing to welcome big
numbers of refugees, even fewer are willing to invest more to support
the UN Refugee Agency. We also see fragmentation of European
institutions as voters send growing numbers of anti-EU politicians to
serve in the European parliament. There is no longer consensus among
Europeans on the free movement of EU citizens across borders, on how to
manage immigrants from outside the EU, or on important questions like
how best to manage relations with Russia. The Trump administration has
threatened the coherence of NATO, the most successful military alliance
in history (French President Macron certainly seems to agree), and has
withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty with Russia, the UN Human
Rights Council, and the Paris Climate Accord, to name only a few. [The
inevitable consequence of all this is a world that has become more
unpredictable and much less safe. There is little chance in this
environment to establish new agreements and new institutions to help
manage tomorrow's crises.]{.underline} Instead, [individual [governments
will adopt their **own rules**]{.mark} in an attempt to contain
challenges that don't respect borders. They will [threaten **economic
penalties**]{.mark} and **[military retaliation]{.mark}** in a world
[with fewer]{.mark} institutions able to enforce **[generally accepted
rules and practices]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The last implication of the
geopolitical recession: The weakness of today's international system
[not only]{.underline} leaves the world [more vulnerable to crisis, but
less resilient when crisis comes. In recent years, [we've avoided a
major international crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. We've seen Brexit, the
election of Donald Trump, the growth of populism across Europe, Russia's
bid to undermine Ukraine's independence, Xi Jinping's consolidation of
power in China, a meltdown in Venezuela, and plenty of individual fires
in the Middle East and in democracies across the world.
[**[But]{.mark}** we have not yet experienced anything during this
period that poses a challenge to the entire international system, and
[the]{.mark} global [**economy** has remained]{.mark} relatively
[**strong**.]{.mark} Our luck can't last.]{.underline}

#### Naval power solves nuclear war

**Cropsey and McGrath, 18**---Director AND Deputy Director, Center for
American Seapower (Seth and Bryan, "Maritime Strategy in a New Era of
Great Power Competition,"
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.hudson.org/files/publications/HudsonMaritimeStrategy.pdf>,
dml)

As a maritime nation, [[naval power is the U.S.'s **most useful means**
of **responding to**]{.mark} **distant [crises]{.mark}**[, preventing
them]{.mark} from **harming our security** or that of our allies and
partners, and keeping geographically remote threats from
[**metastasizing into conflicts** that could **approach our
borders**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A maritime defense demands a maritime
strategy. As national resources are increasingly strained the need
exists for a strategy that makes deliberate choices to connect ends
(security) with means (money and the fleet it builds). This paper
examines the need for a maritime strategy, discusses options, and offers
recommendations for policy makers.

[After several decades of unchallenged world leadership, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates once again [faces **great power
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this time featuring two other world
powers. China and Russia increasingly bristle under the constraints of
the post-World War II systems of global trade, finance, and governance
largely created by the United States and its allies, systems that the
United States has protected and sustained to the economic and security
benefit of its citizens and the citizens of other nations. [Both
[**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} are **demonstrably improving the
quality** of their armed forces while **simultaneously acting
aggressively** toward neighboring countries]{.underline}, some of which
are US treaty allies. Additionally, [both nations [are **turning their
attention to naval operations**]{.mark} far from their own
coasts]{.underline}, operations designed to advance national interests
that are often in tension with those of the United States.1

For the past several decades, US national security strategy has not had
to contend with great powers. Instead, it has concerned itself primarily
with building alliances designed to manage regional security more
efficiently by proxy, while devoting increasingly more resources to
homeland defense and intelligence aimed at stemming acts of terror by
Islamic radical organizations and their followers. To the extent that
the US position of leadership in the world was not threatened, this
strategy was reasonable, if imperfectly pursued. Such a strategy will no
longer suffice in a world of great power competition, especially one in
which powers of considerable---but unequal---strength are opposed.
Unbalanced multi-polarity is an especially unstable condition, and the
United States is not effectively postured to manage that instability.
Henry Kissinger divides the concept of world order into two parts: a
normative system that defines acceptable action, and a 'balance of
power' arrangement that punishes the breach of such conventions2. As the
underlying balance of forces shifts, states with different ideas of
international order gain the power to reshape the system. Thucydides'
ancient insight holds true -- the rise in power of one actor threatens
all others. Where such threat exists and if the balance of power between
states or coalitions approaches equilibrium, a "Cold War" between
competing ideological camps occurs. In an unbalanced system, the
stronger side is tempted to strike its weaker opponent while the balance
of forces is favorable. Unbridled competition for supremacy defined
Europe during its bloodiest periods. Europe's 16th and 17th century
religious wars between Catholics and Protestants and the global 20th
century struggles between totalitarian ideologies and democracy both
represent the natural end-state of unbalanced multipolar systems.
Without norms to restrain states and force to uphold these norms,
violence is very likely.

[Today's international system is moving toward **unbalanced
multi-polarity**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [the United States is
**not currently prepared** to manage such an international environment.
If Americans want to preserve their nation's secure and prosperous
position as the world's great power, the United States **must begin now
to prepare strategically** for what it will inevitably
face]{.underline}. Otherwise, it will ultimately be forced into an
increasingly limited number of unattractive options to sustain its
position of leadership.

[There is **little evidence** that the people of the United States wish
to **see our position in the world diminished**]{.underline}. The 2016
Presidential Election raised important questions about the degree to
which globalization has served the interests of everyday Americans (and
their perceptions thereof), while the two dominant US political parties
have moved toward more protectionist policies, at least as articulated
by their nominees. Opinion polling indicates the divided nature of the
American public on issues like free trade and sustained foreign
commitments.3 However, [Americans **remain cognizant of threats** to the
United States, and **favor maintaining America's position** as a great
power by sustaining a strong military]{.underline}.4 Moreover, it would
be difficult to identify meaningful numbers of Americans who would
sacrifice national security in favor of increased social spending,
despite the continuing rise in non-discretionary spending in the federal
budget. [Americans understand that the US position of world leadership
benefits]{.underline} the nation's economy, its security, its allies,
and [the international order]{.underline} that has been the object of US
foreign and defense policy for over a century. They know that their
lives would be diminished if this position of global leadership were
surrendered to an adversary or group of them. The paradox of the
American experience is that the US is not simply a great power -- it is
an exceptional power, for which ideals count as much as strength.
[[The]{.mark} American [public, **despite its aversion** to foreign
commitments, **can rise to the occasion** and **respond to**]{.mark}
**clear [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it has in both World Wars,
the Cold War, and after September 11th. [The **job of the
policymaker**]{.underline}, therefore, [is to **ensure America remains a
great power**]{.underline}, so that when the occasion arises, it can act
as an exceptional power.

It is critical then, for US political leaders to begin thinking more
strategically about protecting and advancing America\'s position in the
face of growing great power competition. This monograph asserts that a
strategy to support such a goal would necessarily be maritime in nature,
leveraging this nation's great geographical advantages in the service of
its national power. Sharing land borders with only two nations---both of
whom are friendly to the United States---and separated from other great
powers by vast oceans, the United States enjoys a security position
quite unlike that of any other nation. For over a century, it has been
the unspoken (but doggedly pursued) national security aim of the United
States to ensure that no power rise to prominence in Asia or Europe so
as to occupy a position there as dominant as the United States' position
in the Western Hemisphere. Were this to occur, not only could that
nation then lock the United States out of the resources and activity of
that region, but it could also then eventually turn its attention to
challenging our position in the Western Hemisphere.5

Underlying this approach is the reality that [[most the world's activity
**does not occur in our**]{.mark} **own [hemisphere]{.mark}**[, but in
**Asia** and **Europe**]{.mark}. [American interests]{.mark} in these
regions]{.underline}--- political, diplomatic, economic, and
military---[[are **considerable** and **growing**. **Protecting** and
**sustaining** those]{.mark} interests **[must remain a
priority]{.mark}**]{.underline} of American policy, [[and **maritime
strategy** is an **effective tool**]{.underline}]{.mark} in doing so.

Maritime strategy is a subset of grand strategy, and the relationship
between the two is ably defined by Professor John B. Hattendorf of the
Naval War College: "In its broadest sense, grand strategy is the
comprehensive direction of power to achieve particular national goals.
Within those terms, maritime strategy is the direction of all aspects of
national power that relate to a nation's interests at sea. The navy
serves this purpose, but maritime strategy is not purely a naval
preserve. Maritime strategy involves the other functions of state power
that include diplomacy; the safety and defence of merchant trade at sea;
fishing; the exploitation, conservation, regulation and defence of the
exclusive economic zone at sea; coastal defence; security of national
borders; the protection of offshore islands; as well as participation in
regional and world-wide concerns relating to the use of oceans, the
skies over the oceans and the land under the seas.6 It is wholly
appropriate for the world's dominant naval power---separated from its
widely-flung interests by thousands of miles of open ocean---to develop
and execute coherent maritime strategy. In a time of re-emerging great
power competition, it is essential. The nation's current maritime
strategy7 is, unfortunately, not up to the task. It focuses
insufficiently on great power competition; it does not recognize the
rise in importance of conventional forces in deterring great power war;
it does not provide a theory of conventional deterrence appropriate to
great powers and their likely objectives; it does not suggest a posture
for naval forces that acts as an effective deterrent; its derived force
structure is too small and short on effective logistic support; it does
not place sufficient value on naval partnerships with geographically
important nations which may not be traditional partners; and it is
silent on the need for the nation to invest in a maritime industrial
base that can enable an appropriate strategy. This monograph urges new
thinking about maritime strategy, a strategy compatible with the United
States' responsibilities as the leader of the free world, as well as the
world's premier political, military, economic, and diplomatic power.
Such a strategy would seek to protect and sustain those leadership
positions in the face of renewed great power competition, competition
that largely subsumes other, lesser security concerns. There will be
those who view this approach as a return to "Cold War" strategic
thinking, and we do not shy from this comparison. The United States
acted for decades as a coherent strategic actor when faced with
expansionist Soviet totalitarianism, and it must act with equal
coherence and resolve to contest China and Russia's brands of aggressive
mercantilism, regional expansion, and contempt for established global
order. There will be those who evaluate our suggestions in this paper
and conclude that the nation cannot afford it, that the expense
associated with moving to a maritime grand strategy would imbalance the
traditional "ends, ways, means" approach to the making of strategy. And
while the ends, ways, means approach is generally relevant to military
and operational strategy, it is unsuited to the making of grand strategy
for one very important reason. Unlike subordinate levels of strategy,
grand strategy re-allocates, realigns, and re-orients a nation's "means"
to serve strategic "ends". Military strategy starts with the proposition
that there is a certain resource level available to pursue its ends.
Grand strategy starts with the sum of the nation's output capacity, and
then determines how it can most effectively be allocated to the
achievement of strategic goals.

Short of war itself, there is nothing in American history that causes
strategic realignment more reliably than a change in Administration, and
we wish to be part of that dialogue. [We argue]{.underline} here [for a
**new theory of deterrence**]{.underline}, one that revises the Cold War
approach in which the Soviet Union was deterred from large-scale
conventional attack by the threat of nuclear escalation. Under that
rubric, one could justifiably say that America's conventional deterrent
was dependent on its strategic deterrent. [Today, the decapitating
"**bolt from the blue**" strike is **even more remote** than it was in
the Cold War, and to the extent that **[nuclear exchange between great
powers]{.mark}** is conceivable, it [is **far more likely** to flow from
**conventional conflict that has gone awry**]{.mark}. Therefore, [to
**deter nuclear war**, we **must deter conventional war**. **No aspect**
of]{.mark} American [military power will be **more critical to deterring
either nuclear** or **conventional super-power war** than
**seapower**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Egyptian businessmen ordered more than 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades
from US rival North Korea in a secret deal last year, the Washington
Post reported on Sunday. The United Nations described it as the "largest
seizure of ammunition in the history of sanctions against the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea".

The UN revealed that the business executives sought to buy weapons for
the Egyptian military. The report prompted US criticism, while the
Egyptian embassy in Washington pointed to Egypt's willingness to
cooperate with UN officials in "finding and destroying the contraband".

The Post reported that the North Korea incident was among a number of
factors that led US President Donald Trump's administration to freeze
nearly \$300m in military aid to Egypt in August.

[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[remains **unaccountable** for
**h**]{.mark}uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
**[violations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Over the past several years, [there have been many concerns
over]{.underline} human rights abuses, including [**suppressing**
**freedom of speech** and the **implementation** of **laws** that
**limit** the operations of **civil society groups**.]{.underline}

Does Egypt's human rights record really matter?

The [[US has not taken]{.mark} any **substantial [punitive
measures]{.mark}** against Egypt, even as organisations]{.underline}
such as Human Rights Watch [describe Egypt's current human rights crisis
as **the worst** "in the country's modern history".]{.underline}

[[Egypt will]{.mark} likely **[continue to receive assistance]{.mark}
regardless of legal provisions it might be violating**]{.underline},
said James Gelvin, a professor of Middle East history at the University
of California, noting that [human rights-based **[restrictions]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} almost "**[routinely ignored]{.mark}** when committed by a
government the **US wishes to support**".]{.underline}

Along with Israel and Afghanistan, [Egypt is one of the **three biggest
recipients** of US funding and weapons]{.underline}.

How much aid does the US provide to Egypt?

Since 1979, [Egypt has been [receiving **uninterrupted aid**]{.mark} at
an average of **\$1.6bn** a year, the bulk of which goes to the
**military**]{.underline}.

[Military support has come in the form of **arms distribution** and
**military training** services]{.underline}. A biennial series of joint
military exercises led by Egyptian and US troops in Egypt commenced in
1980.

Referred to as Operation Bright Star, the [coalition training is
designed to strengthen ties between the two country's forces and to
assist the United States in solidifying its strategic alliances in the
Middle East]{.underline}.

In August, the US cut tens of millions in aid from Egypt, citing the
country's failure to make progress on human rights and democratic norms
-- but [experts described these [cuts]{.mark} as **[largely
symbolic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Why does Egypt get US aid?

For a country to become an eligible recipient of US aid, it must align
itself with American interests and foreign policy, analysts say.

[In the case of Egypt, US aid]{.underline} granted since the signing of
the 1978 Camp David Accords [was "**[untouchable]{.mark}
[compensation]{.mark}**[" for maintaining **peace with Israel**]{.mark}.
This deal is considered a **cornerstone** of **US-Egyptian
relations**.]{.underline}

Robert Springborg, a Middle East expert and non-resident fellow at the
Italian Institute of International Affairs, told Al Jazeera that US
economic support was intended to stabilise Anwar Sadat's \[former
Egyptian president\] government and succeeding ones.

How does the US benefit?

The [primary [benefit is]{.mark} the "[**cessation of hostilities
against Israel**" by **Egypt**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and "other Arab
states that could not wage war against Israel in the **absence** of
**Egyptian participation**"]{.underline}, Springborg said.

In addition to Egyptian support for American "counterterrorism and
counterinsurgency" campaigns, Springborg says the US also enjoys
marginal benefits, including access to Egyptian airspace and the
prioritisation of US naval vessels through the Suez Canal.

The high amount of military aid, in particular, has also helped to
create jobs and to reduce unemployment in the US. More than 1.3 million
Americans work in manufacturing weaponry for defence companies, and more
than three million others support the industry indirectly.

The US is among the world's top five arms producers and distributors,
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

"The United States does not give money to Egypt for military equipment;
it gives the Egyptian military a list of equipment the American
government will purchase on its behalf in the United States," Gelvin
told Al Jazeera.

What about economic aid?

Economic assistance, or American "investments" in Egypt, are a
relatively small part of the package, analysts say.

Economic aid now stands at less than \$200m annually, compared with more
than \$1bn from the early 1980s through the early 2000s, Springborg
said.

Egypt's domestic stability is important to the US, and so there is a
sustained interest in its local economy. If the Egyptian economy
collapses, it will render the region unstable, Gelvin said. And since
the Egyptian military controls up to 60 percent of the Egyptian economy,
it is unlikely that it will relinquish economic control to other
institutions or factions in Egypt.

According to Gelvin, this was part of the Camp David package: "Since the
army was not going to fight its main enemy of 30 years, it had to have
some reason for being, and being so large."

Aid stream for Egypt continuing despite violations

There are both political and legal conditions that must be met by
countries on the US foreign aid list.

In 2012, US Congress made aid to Egypt conditional on the secretary of
state certifying that the country was supporting human rights and
democratic values. This came in response to an Egyptian crackdown on
American NGO workers.

The amendment also required the secretary of state to ensure that Egypt
was upholding its commitments to the Egypt-Israel peace treaty.

Yet these [[provisions **have not affected** the **aid stream** to
**Egypt**]{.mark}, a country **infamous** for its **human rights
abuses**.]{.underline}

In 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton waived the
certification requirements after the Obama administration claimed that
there was no way of ensuring such provisions were met.

In 2013, a military takeover that led to the removal of Egypt's first
democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi, struck "concern" among
top White House officials, but they fell short of calling it a coup,
which would have prohibited them from providing Egypt with military
equipment.

A. Egypt

[[Despite]{.mark} its **[h]{.mark}**uman **[r]{.mark}**ights
[**record**, **Egypt** is]{.mark} one of the [**biggest recipients**
of]{.mark} **U.S. [aid]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A lower middle-income
country, Egypt received \$ 1.25 billion in U.S. foreign assistance in
FY2018. 40Of that amount, \$ 1 billion went towards foreign military
financing. 41Over the last 70 years, it has received over \$ 80 billion
in U.S. foreign assistance, 42and it has requested \$ 1.38 billion for
FY 2020. 43[While it remains a key foreign aid recipient, Egypt\'s
**h**uman **r**ights **record** is **disturbing**]{.underline}. 44

The [Egyptian state has **[tortured suspects]{.mark}**, implemented
**[mass trials]{.mark}** against **children**, and **[executed
detainees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In January 2002, Mr. Ahmad El-Maati, a
falsely accused terrorist suspect, was tortured by Egyptian security
officials:

\[a\]n electric prod was used on \[El-Maati\'s\] hands, legs and
genitals during interrogations. His hands were cuffed so tightly that
his wrists bled. . . . He was kept blindfolded and handcuffed in a
hallway with other prisoners for what he estimates was about two weeks.
It was during this time, Mr. El-Maati says, that he developed anal
bleeding. Canadian doctors later diagnosed an anal fissure requiring
surgery. 45

Since 2013, the [Egyptian government\'s use of mass trials and death
sentences against children have skyrocketed;]{.underline} these include
death sentences [issued by military courts]{.underline} 46\-- the same
military [that has received **[billions of dollars]{.mark}** in
**assistance** from the U.S. government.]{.underline} 47The
[**U.S.-based** **h**uman **r**ights **organization**]{.underline},
Belady, [puts the number of [children arrested]{.mark} by the current
regime for political reasons at over 2,000]{.underline}. 48Since former
General el-Sisi assumed office, [Egypt has been among the ten countries
with the [**highest numbers** of **executions**]{.mark} per
year.]{.underline} 49At an Arab-EU summit in 2019, [el-[Sisi **stood
by**]{.mark} his government\'s [actions]{.mark}, arguing that executing
detainees is part of \"our humanity,\" distinguishing it from \"your
\[European\] humanity]{.underline}.\" 50Yet, Article 2 of the Egyptian
Constitution states that Islam is the official state religion and that
the primary source of legislation is Sharia law. 51The Quran forbids
unjust killing, including judicially mandated death sentences that lack
due process. 52El-Sisi\'s use of \"our humanity\" [as justification for
mass trials, death sentences in absentia, and sham military trials
should [**sound the alarms** for]{.mark} a [White House that]{.mark}
claims to be **[send]{.mark}ing [aid]{.mark}** to \"those who respect
us.\"]{.underline} 53

In April 2019, the [Egyptian Constitution was amended to lengthen
el-[Sisi\'s]{.mark} term from four to six years and to allow him to run
for an additional term, **[solidifying]{.mark}** his [**ability** to
**remain in power**]{.mark} until 2030; it also gave him far [**greater
control** over the **judicial branch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 54The
[fairness of the referendum on these amendments was widely
**criticized**]{.underline}. Websites that encouraged people to vote
\"no\" were blocked by the government, and Egyptian citizens living
abroad were given very little notice to travel to a consulate to vote.
55

Between 2017 and 2019, [the Egyptian government blocked over 600 news,
political, and human rights websites without judicial
authorization]{.underline}. 56It was also [among the four worst
countries for journalists in 2018]{.underline}, with twenty-five
journalists arrested that year, nineteen of which detained for
\"spreading false news.\" 57In August 2020, [Egypt\'s \"special
counterterrorism courts\" sentenced in absentia Bahey eldin Hassan, a
prominent human rights activist, to fifteen years in prison for
criticizing President Sissi\'s]{.underline} regime on Twitter. 58

In May 2015, the [[State Department]{.mark} informed Congress that it
was in the national interest to **[continue assisting]{.mark}
[Egypt]{.mark}**, but it also highlighted many of the country\'s
violations that year]{.underline}, writing: \"Government forces have
committed [**arbitrary** or otherwise **unlawful killings** during
dispersal of demonstrators]{.underline}, of persons in custody, and
during military operations in the northern Sinai Peninsula.\" 59[This
was not an isolated incident.]{.underline} Public Law 115-141 states
that of the \$ 1.3 billion in assistance to Egypt, \$ 300 million must
be withheld until the Secretary of State certifies that Egypt is taking
effective steps on various human rights. 60However, it also states that
the Secretary may waive the certification requirement if he or she
determines that doing so is important to the national security interest
of the U.S. 61In August 2019, a year full of gross violations of human
rights by the Egyptian government, Secretary Pompeo invoked the national
security interest waiver. 62[Judging by the [**broad power** vested in
the Secretary of State]{.mark} by the statute, it is fairly
**[straightforward]{.mark}** for the Secretary [to **override**]{.mark}
the **[recommendations]{.mark}** of **DRL officials** and
**investigators** on the ground at U.S. embassies abroad]{.underline};
he or she merely has to declare that it is in the national security
interest of the U.S. to do so. 63

Despite Egypt\'s troubling track record (these are only a few examples),
the Trump administration has been outspoken in its support of the
Egyptian dictatorship. 64On April 3, 2017, President Trump welcomed
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to the White House. 65During an
interview in the Oval Office, President Trump spoke highly of his
Egyptian counterpart: \"We are very much behind President el-Sisi. He\'s
done a fantastic job . . . And I just want to say to you, Mr. President,
that you have a great friend and ally in the United States and in me.\"
66Just eighteen days later, on April 21, 2017, President Trump welcomed
to the White House Ms. Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American humanitarian
worker who was incarcerated by el-Sisi\'s regime for three years without
a trial. 67During the televised meeting, no mention was made of the
Egyptian government\'s treatment of Ms. Hijazi, and the President
refused to take any questions. 68Ironically, while in the Oval Office,
she sat in the same chair that was occupied by her authoritarian
persecutor eighteen days earlier. 69Furthermore, at the G7 Summit in
France in September 2019, President Trump notoriously called out,
\"Where\'s my favorite dictator?\" while awaiting a meeting with his
Egyptian counterpart. 70\"Egypt has a great leader, he\'s highly
respected, he\'s brought order,\" President Trump said at a meeting with
el-Sisi during the UN General Assembly in September 2019. 71That same
week, el-Sisi\'s regime arrested more than 2,000 peaceful protesters
throughout the country. 72

Conventional Defeat

The [idea that Israel might lose a conventional war seems ridiculous

would [develop]{.mark} a **decisive [military advantage]{.mark}** that

came close to happening during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, as the [Egyptian

advanced into the Golan Heights. [Accounts on how seriously Israel

The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [recently
[authorized]{.mark} **\$2.5 billion** in **[arms sales]{.mark}** to
**Egypt**]{.underline}. The [weapons were **military planes** and air
defense **radar systems**.]{.underline} This follows a \$170 million
military aid authorization in September. [It also **[precedes]{.mark}**
the **[suspension]{.mark}** of \$130 million of **military
aid**]{.underline}. This suspension occurred [because Cairo **did not
meet standards** [about]{.mark} **basic** **[h]{.mark}**uman
**[r]{.mark}**ights **[conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Egypt]{.mark} has been the [**second highest recipient** of]{.mark}
**U.S. military [aid]{.mark}** worldwide]{.underline}. They receive
\$1.3 billion per year, most of which is foreign military financing.
This aid is [earmarked to buy U.S. weapons, equipment, and
training.]{.underline} The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration
[[notes]{.mark} that this **aid** is going to a [**country**]{.mark}
that **[violates]{.mark}** U.S. **[Leahy]{.mark} Law** practices. These
are the rules that intend to **prevent** **h**uman **r**ights **abuses**
from **U.S. security aid**.]{.underline} This acknowledgement happened
both in 2020 and when it canceled the most recent suspended aid

Thus, the \$2.5 billion sale is an example of a risky sale that the
administration should avoid. According to the recently released 2021
Arms Sales Risk Index, Egypt ranks as the eighteenth most risky
recipient of arms sales. The government is corrupt, undemocratic,
commits human rights abuses, and inspires terrorism. Sending Egypt
billions of dollars of U.S. weapons may seem like aiding an ally.
Instead, this means that the U.S. needs to choose better allies.

Before, U.S. weapons have financed the Egyptian military. Between 2009
and 2020, the U.S. has sent Egypt \$3.2 billion in fighter aircrafts,
\$2.3 billion in rotary aircrafts, \$1.58 billion in support, \$1.3
billion in tanks and armored vehicles, \$240 million in naval craft, and
over \$1.4 billion in missiles, munitions, and radar.

The history and current administration's policy on arms sales to Egypt
make little sense. These weapons are not going to causes like improving
human rights. From a data perspective, its score in the human rights
components of the Cato Institute's Arms Sales Risk Index have worsened
every year.

Beyond the data, over the last five years, Egypt has waged a proxy
conflict against Turkey in Libya, is home to around 1,000 ISIS
militants, has forced human rights groups to shut down, uses advanced
technology to track and target citizens, institutes a prison system that
has led to increasing recruits for ISIS and al-​Qaeda, and used a
draconian counterterrorism campaign to murder 755 people -- many of whom
are simple political opposition, not terrorists. The military-​led
government and military itself commit these crimes.

Overall, U.S. weapons in Egypt fund a government whose draconian
policies lead to arguments with other Middle Eastern countries and
inspire and enable terrorist groups. These weapons help the Egyptian
government commit some of the worst human rights abuses occurring in the
world.

By definition, [transferring weapons to human rights abusers **does not
help fight** human rights **abuse**]{.underline}. Yet, the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [[continues to **tout**]{.mark} a
[**foreign policy**]{.mark} supposedly [based on **h**]{.mark}**uman

tried to promote private investment by U.S. multinational corporations.

A. Geopolitical Considerations with Respect to Egypt

[A **key consideration** that makes **[Egypt]{.mark}** a **crucial
player** in world politics is **geography**]{.underline}. Stretching 120
miles, [the [**Suez Canal** is]{.mark} an **[essential]{.mark} link**
[between **Europe** and **Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 135It [connects
the **Mediterranean** and the **Red Seas**, separating **Africa** from
**Asia**, making it one of the **most [frequented]{.mark}** [shipping
lanes]{.mark} in the world.]{.underline} 136For decades, [Egypt has been
[**crucial** for moving]{.mark} American **military [assets]{.mark}**
through the region, as it gives the U.S. preferential passage through
the canal]{.underline}. 137Geography also [[empowers Egypt with]{.mark}
respect to its **[proximity to Israel]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 138The
eastern border of the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula borders Israel. One city
in particular, Rafah, borders the Gaza Strip, [making it the only
**operational border** crossing between **Egypt** and the **Palestinian
territories**.]{.underline} 139Because of the longstanding relationship
between the U.S., Egypt, and Israel, the three countries have
historically come to agreement on how \"operational\" that border
crossing is. 140For example, [the Agreement on Movement and Access
(AMA): Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing [allows **EU monitors** to
be **present**]{.mark} and Israeli officials to oversee the crossing via
video surveillance]{.underline}. 141Moreover, [[**Egypt** and **Israel
cooperate** in **fighting terrorism**]{.mark} in the Sinai Peninsula,
which **benefits U.S. counterterrorism** efforts in the **Mid**dle
**East**.]{.underline} 142Finally, [Egypt\'s deployment of troops to
Kuwait during the First Gulf War served as a \"pan-Arab blessing for the
\[U.S.-led\] operation]{.underline},\" which did not go unnoticed by the
Bush administration (41), marking one of the high points of the two
countries\' relationship. 143These [considerations would certainly [make
it **challenging** for]{.mark} any [U.S.]{.mark} **administration** [to

That's Now Making Joe Biden Look Like a Hypocrite,\" Slate Magazine,

nihara

Americans are not enthusiastic about President [Biden's upcoming trip to
the Middle East]{.underline}, his first since winning the White House.
In a recent poll, just a quarter of those surveyed liked the idea of the
visit; a third disliked it. (Presumably the other 40 percent or so don't
care one way or the other.) The main reason for the high negatives: His
[**stop-off** in **Saudi Arabia**]{.underline}.

During the 2020 election, [[Biden]{.mark} promised to regard Saudi as a
"**pariah**" nation in stark contrast to]{.underline} President
[Trump]{.underline}, who treated the royal family as beloved relatives
and waved away its assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, an American
resident, as an irrelevancy in the face of lucrative arms purchases.
Secretary of State Antony [Blinken]{.underline}, in his first major
speech, one month into Biden's term, [**[pledged]{.mark}** that the
administration's **[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy** would be
"[**centered** on]{.mark} the **defense** of **democracy** and the
**protection** of **[h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights**.]{.underline}"

Yet [Biden [flies off to Riyadh]{.mark} this month]{.underline}, and,
whatever nobler reasons have been conjured for the visit, the real one
is to ask the Royals [to [open]{.mark} their **[oil]{.mark} spigots**,
in order [to **reduce gas prices**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and thus reduce
inflation) [while allowing the West to maintain its ban on crude from
Russia]{.underline}.

The situation is [**reminiscent** of Biden's **relationship** with
**China**]{.underline}. Early in his term, [the president said he would
hold Beijing "**accountable**" for its gross **h**uman-**r**ights
**violations**. Yet]{.underline} last week, in a five-hour meeting,
[Blinken [urged China]{.mark}'s foreign minister [to join
America]{.mark}'s side [in defending Ukraine]{.mark} from Russia's
aggression.]{.underline}

The point here is not to play gotcha games. Nor is it to argue that the
U.S. foreign policy should be based on lofty ideals or hard-headed
interests but not both. However, [Biden and Blinken [**erred** in
**declaring**]{.mark} that their **[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy**
[would be]{.mark} "**[centered]{.mark}**" [on **democracy** and
**h**]{.mark}**uman [r]{.mark}ights**]{.underline}---[a choice that was
bound to make life more difficult as they [**inevitably** sought
**coop**]{.mark}**eration** [with **authoritarian
regimes**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are four reasons why indulging in that rhetoric was a mistake.

First, they must have known that, [at some point, they would **have to
saddle up** with **disreputable leaders**]{.underline}---[if just to
choose the **lesser** of **two evils**]{.underline}---and that, by doing
so, [they would be [accused of **hypocrisy**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There are often very good reasons for allying with bad people. During
World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill formed a
powerful alliance with Josef Stalin in order to beat Adolf Hitler; if
they hadn't, on the grounds that Stalin was also evil, then Nazi Germany
would have conquered all of Europe.

In less extreme circumstances, [world leaders have often **contained
rivals** while cooperating with them where their **interests
converge**]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet
Union engaged in an arms race and proxy wars while also negotiating
arms-control treaties, keeping nuclear weapons out of other countries'
hands, and jointly developing a smallpox vaccine, among other good
deeds. Questions of democracy and anti-democracy had nothing to do with
any of it.

Second, [[highlighting]{.mark} our **[differences]{.mark}** with
**authoritarian countries**, much less **[underlining]{.mark}** those
**[differences]{.mark}** as the core of our foreign policy, may have
[made **cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}---when it's possible and
where it matters---[**[harder]{.mark}** to **achieve**]{.underline}.
[Would]{.underline} China's [Xi]{.underline} Jinping be more [amenable
to ditching Russia and helping Ukraine if he didn't think that sticking
by Vladimir Putin would hurt the U.S.? And would he be less keen on
hurting the U.S. if Biden hadn't declared the very nature of China's
government to be a threat?]{.underline} I don't know the answers---but
these seem like a reasonable questions.

Meanwhile, by denouncing Saudi Arabia as "pariah" state (however
justifiably), has [Biden [made it harder]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
royal family [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[supply more
oil]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Has he [given the Saudis **more leverage**
in demanding returns for the favor?]{.underline}

The third problem with declaring that human rights will be the
centerpiece of your foreign policy is that, [[once we **side**
with]{.mark} an [**authoritarian** who **violates**]{.mark} them on some
**[issue]{.mark}**, our **criticisms** [of]{.mark} some [**other
violator** **won't be taken**]{.mark}
**[seriously]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And after that, much of what we say
about foreign policy will be regarded with suspicion, if not cynicism.
[Biden has said he plans to talk sternly to his Saudi hosts about human
rights]{.underline}. He will no doubt be sincere, but [it's **unlikely**
that his **hosts** will **take a word** of it
**seriously**]{.underline}.

Finally, [centering our foreign policy---staking our global
standing---on the triumph of democracy and human rights may not be a
winning strategy]{.underline} these days. According to Freedom House,
[just 20 percent of the world's population is living in a "free
country." Can we form an effective alliance against the other 80
percent?]{.underline}

Besides, [the U.S. isn't quite the beacon of democracy that it once
was]{.underline}. Several times since entering office, Biden has
declared that, in its competition with authoritarianism (especially
China), the U.S. has to show that democratic governments can "do big
things." Yet [[**Congress** is]{.mark} so **[deadlocked]{.mark}**, the
**Supreme [Court]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} so [**at odds** with
**public**]{.mark} **opinion**, and **politics** and **society** are so
**out of alignment** on so many issues that we're on the verge of
showing that we can't do much after all.]{.underline} To the extent that
democracy is still valued in the world, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
no longer]{.mark} widely seen as [a model]{.mark} to
emulate]{.underline}.

This is key. In 1994, on his 90th birthday, George Kennan, the architect
of America's Cold War containment policy, said in a speech looking back
on his life and career, "It is primarily by example, never by precept,
that a country such as ours exerts its most useful influence beyond its
borders." As if on cue, late last year, after Biden assembled a fairly
useless Summit for Democracy, the editors of [Politico asked 18
activists in endangered democracies, from Iraq to Poland to India, what
Biden should do to help democracy in their countries. The [majority
replied,]{.mark} essentially: **[Don't lecture us]{.mark}; clean up your
own problems; become a role model again**]{.underline}.

So, should Biden be traveling to Saudi Arabia? Trump made a huge mistake
in dismissing Khashoggi's murder as a trifle---not just as a moral
matter but for reasons that any viewer of The Godfather would
understand: No prince in a foreign family can be allowed to get away
with killing one of our own. Trump should have turned on the pressure,
cut off oil imports (when we were in a position to do so), stepped up
intel ops against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (who, according to a
U.S. intelligence report, personally approved the murder)---everything
possible to make sure that everyone saw this as unacceptable.

Alas, it's a bit late for that now. MBS is more deeply ensconced in
Riyadh's power structure, our leverage on energy supplies is diminished,
and so is our leverage in the new Middle Eastern politics, where the
Sunni nations---Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain,
and Kuwait---have formed a coalition with Israel, for the common
containment of Iran, quite apart from any involvement, much less
leadership, from Washington.

None of this should be read as a defense of ultra-Realpolitik thinking.
Our interests mean little without the underlying strength of our values.
Our foreign policy should focus, whenever possible, on making the world
safer for democracy. It should stand with democratic countries in every
forum and conflict. It should speak out on behalf of democratic causes
around the world. However, [[it is **impractical**]{.mark}---in some
instances, it has been and would be **counterproductive**---[to place
**democratic values** at]{.mark} the [**center** of **foreign
policy**]{.mark}, to make a country's democratic practices the measure
of whether we should side with that country on any issue.]{.underline}

[Sometimes **we don't have the power** to **insist** that a **country
follow** our **example**]{.underline}. And [sometimes, these days, [our
example **doesn't**]{.mark} **have the power to [inspire]{.mark}**
anyone to follow us]{.underline}. That's what we truly need to focus on.

[The democratic peace]{.underline}---the observation that democracies
are less likely to fight each other than are other pairings of
states---[is one of the most widely acknowledged empirical regularities
in international relations. Prominent scholars have even characterized
the relationship as an empirical law]{.underline} (Levy 1988; Gleditsch
1992). The discovery of a special peace in liberal dyads stimulated
enormous scholarly debate and led to, or reinforced, a number of policy
initiatives by various governments and international organizations.
Although a broad consensus has emerged among researchers regarding the
empirical correlation between joint democracy and peace, disagreement
remains as to its logical foundations. Numerous theories have been
proposed to account for how democracy produces peace, if only dyadically
(e.g., Russett 1993; Rummel 1996; Doyle 1997; Schultz 2001).

[At the **same time**, peace appears likely to foster or maintain
democracy]{.underline} (Thompson 1996; James, Solberg, andWolfson 1999).
A vast swath of research in political science and economics proposes
explanations for the origins of liberal government involving variables
such as economic development (Lipset 1959; Burkhart and Lewis-Beck 1994;
Przeworski et al. 2000; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Epstein et al. 2006)
and inequality (Boix 2003), political interests (Downs 1957; Bueno de
Mesquita et al. 2003), power hierarchies (Moore 1966; Lake 2009), third
party inducements (Pevehouse 2005) or impositions (Peceny 1995; Meernik
1996), geography (Gleditsch 2002b), and natural resource endowments
(Ross 2001), to list just a few examples. [Each]{.underline} of these
putative **[cause]{.underline}**s [of democracy is **also** associated
with various explanations for international conflict]{.underline}.
Indeed, some as yet poorly defined set of canonical factors may
contribute both to democracy and to peace, [making it **look** as if the
two variables are **directly related**, **even if possibly they are
not**]{.underline}.

We seek to contribute to this literature, not by proposing yet another
theory to explain how democracy vanquishes war, but by estimating the
causal effect of joint democracy on the probability of militarized
disputes using a quasi-experimental research design. We begin by noting
that [some of the **common causes** of democracy and peace may be
**unobservable**, generating an **endogenous relations**hip between the
two. Theories of democracy and explanations for peace are at a
**formative state**; it is **not possible** to utilize detailed,
validated and widely accepted models of each of these processes to
assess their interaction]{.underline}. Indeed, [to a **remarkable
degree** democracy and peace each remain **poorly understood** and
**weakly accounted** for **empirically**, despite their central roles in
international politics. We address the risk of spurious correlation by
applying an **instrumental variables approach**. Having **taken into
account possible endogeneity** between democracy and peace, we find that
joint democracy does **not** have **a**n **independent** pacifying
effect on interstate conflict. Instead]{.underline}, our [findings show
that democratic countries are **more likely** to attack other
democracies than are non-democracies]{.underline}. Our [results **call
into question** the]{.underline} large body of [theory that]{.underline}
has been proposed to [account for]{.underline} the [**apparent**
pacifism of democratic dyads]{.underline}.

http://logosjournal.com/2019/liberal-democracy-is-a-threat-to-nigerias-stability/

[In]{.underline} 20[**15**, Nigeria]{.underline}, a country of about 190
million, [spent \$625 million to conduct]{.underline} federal and local
[elections. By comparison, India]{.underline}, with a population of 1.2
billion, [spent \$600 million]{.underline} on its 2015 election,
according to figures released by the Electoral Commission of India
(ECI).\[1\]

In 2019, the election budget of Nigeria's Independent Electoral
Commission (INEC) rose to \$670 million. [This represents about **2.5
percent** of Nigeria's]{.underline} \$28.8 billion [budget]{.underline}
for 2019, a portion of which is being financed through borrowing. To put
the electoral spending in context, [more than half of the country
subsists on about a **dollar a day**]{.underline}, and the country
recently acquired the dubious distinction of being named [the **poverty
capital of the world**]{.underline}, with more people living in extreme
poverty there than in any other country.\[2\] [Key infrastructures and
services]{.underline} such as roads, railway, electricity, water supply,
healthcare, and education [are **severely inadequate**, requiring
**urgent investments**]{.underline} and interventions.

[Election-related expenditure is **expected to rise**]{.underline} in
the near future as INEC implements a wider slate of digital technologies
to combat manipulation and improve the integrity of the electoral
process. For comparison, Nigeria typically devotes about 7 percent of
its budget to education. And yet Nigeria continues to maintain a
four-year election cycle, with smaller by-elections occurring in
between. This electoral calendar guarantees that about \$1 billion is
spent on elections every four years. As the electoral price tag has
grown, democratic dividends have plummeted.

Nigeria's predicament is a microcosm of the phenomenon of rising
financial costs of elections in Africa and diminishing returns on
democracy. Across the continent, [the cost of electoral democracy is
**increasing** and **threatens the delivery of social
goods**]{.underline}. As [African countries battle **myriad
socioeconomic challenges**]{.underline}, the question needs to posed: is
it wise for these countries to continue to spend a large percentage of
their revenue every four or five years on a political ritual with fewer
and fewer positive socioeconomic consequences for their populations? Is
this expensive, periodic democratic ritual called election worth its
price?

[It is not only the monetary cost of elections that now threatens to
**defeat their purpose** and **engender disillusionment** and, along
with disillusionment, the **erosion of trust** in the state and its
ability to **produce** and **distribute** public goods. The **social
cost** of]{.underline} periodic [elections has been]{.underline}
arguably [**great**er, **depleting**, with each election cycle, the
**residual stability** of the state and the **credibility** of its
**institutions**]{.underline}.

[Elections conducted in Nigeria]{.underline} since the return of
civilian rule in 1999 [have brought with them]{.underline} anxiety,
tension, death, **[violence]{.underline}**, and dangerous rhetoric
[that]{.underline}, taken together, have [**frayed** the **national
political and social fabric**. Elections have **widened fissures** and
intensified preexisting **primordial cleavages**]{.underline}.

I can recall no electoral cycle since at least 2003 that was not been
accompanied by fears of Nigeria's disintegration or at the very least
the acceleration of its demise. In 2007 and 2011, post-election violence
claimed hundreds of lives in Northern Nigeria as supporters of then
candidate Muhammadu Buhari rioted after his loss. In the 2019
presidential and national assembly elections, at least 46 people were
reported to have died from election-related violence. In the state
assembly and governorship elections two weeks later on March 9, 2019,
another 10 people died across five states in what the Sunday Tribune
newspaper described in its headline as "another bloody election."\[3\]

Two riders below the same Sunday Tribune headline encapsulate the
turbulent character of Nigerian elections. One was "Thugs, vote buyers,
arsonists take over on election day"; the other was "Nigerians condemn
militarization of elections in Rivers, Bayelsa, Kwara, Akwa Ibom,
Benue," a reference to the government's deployment of soldiers and other
military assets to opposition strongholds before and during the
election. The involvement of soldiers and other military personnel in
the election was a brazen violation of Nigeria's Electoral Act, an
action which many observers interpreted as the incumbent
administration's effort to use its might to manipulate the election in
states held by the opposition.

Every election cycle in Nigeria sees massive, fear-induced demographic
mobility as members of different ethnic groups and religions relocate to
areas considered dominated by their kinsmen and co-religionists to await
[the conclusion of elections]{.underline} that [often degenerate into
**communal clashes** especially in the **volatile north** of the
country]{.underline}.

Periodic [national elections have]{.underline} thus [**worsened**
Nigeria's notoriously **frail union** and caused **apathy** and
**discontent**]{.underline}. The Nigerian people, the major stakeholders
in Nigeria's democracy, have grown weary of being periodically
endangered and rendered pawns in an elaborate elite ritual with little
or no consequence for their lives.

Electoral aftermaths have not improved economic conditions or
strengthened the capacity of citizens to hold elected leaders
accountable. Moreover, as I shall discuss shortly, the familiar abstract
freedoms that democracy, lubricated by periodic elections, can confer on
citizens who participate in such exercises, have eluded Nigerians.

The result has been noticeable apathy represented most poignantly by
voter turnout, which declined from a peak of 69.1 percent in 2003 to
46.3 percent in 2015 and to about 35 percent in 2019. In the same 2019
election cycle, turnout declined to less than 20 percent in the
governorship and state assembly elections, with many Nigerians on social
media stating that they had lost faith in the electoral process and that
the official results of the presidential elections two weeks earlier had
shown that their votes would not count towards the declared outcome.

Voter apathy alone is not an indication of democratic disillusionment
but it can portend or indicate something more devastating: diminishing
trust in the state, its institutions, and its processes.

Such a trust deficit exists already and it predated the return of
civilian rule in 1999 after about two decades of military dictatorship.
However, by all theoretical formulations, such a cumulative loss of
confidence in the transactional sociopolitical contract between the
state and citizens should be corrected by the democratic ideals of
voting, representation, and accountability. This has not happened in
Nigeria. In fact, the opposite scenario is visible: a negative
correlation between successive electoral cycles and citizens' trust in
the Nigerian state. Therein lay the paradoxical consequences of
democratic practice in Nigeria.

[If elections are **increasingly** burdensome as they have become in
Nigeria, the corrective potential of democracy]{.underline}, broadly
speaking, [is lost. Citizens]{.underline} consequently [**lose faith**
in the state and resort to **self-help**]{.underline}, including
criminal self-help. [That is how **states collapse**. Nigeria is **not
far off** this possibility]{.underline}.

In Nigeria, recent political realities reveal a blind spot of
pro-democracy advocacy: without the modulating effect of
decentralization, sustained economic growth, a growing, secure middle
class, and a literate, hopeful poor, liberal democracy can do and has
done more damage than good. [Liberal democracy has ironically become
both an incubator and protector of mediocrity, corruption, and bad
governance. The **overarching casualty** has been Nigeria's **very
stability**]{.underline}.

[**Africa matters** in terms of **size**, **population**, and rate of
**population growth**. It]{.underline} is the continent currently most
affected by climate change but [is]{.underline} also [a continent that
can have a **devastating impact** on **climate change globally** because
of the importance of the **Congo Basin** rainforest, which is the
second-largest absorber of heat after the Amazon rainforest. The
destruction of this important ecosystem could further accelerate
**global warming**]{.underline}. As residents of the region come into
increasing contact with the animals of the rainforest, [this region
could be the origin of the world's next **viral pandemic**. Violent
extremism and terrorism are increasing in Africa, and while now mostly
localized, the danger has the potential to **spread beyond the
continent**. **Crises**]{.underline}---natural and man-made---cause
massive relocations of populations, both on the continent and abroad,
which [can have **negative economic, social, and political
impacts**]{.underline}.

Why Africa Matters

The African continent is the world's second-largest, with the
second-fastest growth rate after Asia. With 54 sovereign countries, four
territories, and two de facto independent states with little
international recognition, the continent has a current population of 1.3
billion. By 2050, the continent's population is predicted to rise to 2.4
billion. By 2100, [**Nigeria**, Africa's most populous country, will
have a population of **one billion**]{.underline}, and half the world's
population growth will be in Africa by then.

The population of African countries is also overwhelmingly young.
Approximately 40% of Africans are under 15, and, in some countries, over
50% is under 25. By 2050, two of every five children born in the world
will be in Africa, and the continent's population is expected to triple.
These developments have positive and negative potential impacts on the
United States and the rest of the world. Young Africans have, for the
most part, completely skipped the analog age and gone directly digital.
Comfortable with technology, they form a huge potential consumer and
labor market. [If]{.underline}, on the other hand, the [countries of
Africa fail to develop economically]{.underline} and do not create
gainful employment for this young population, then there is the risk
that [they will become a huge potential source of recruits to extremist
and terrorist movements]{.underline}, which currently target
disadvantaged and disenchanted youth.

Lack of economic opportunity, increased urbanization, and climate-fueled
disasters will also contribute to movement of people seeking better
lives, which will impact economies and security not only on the
continent of Africa, but also the economic and security situations
around the world. [Nations, lacking]{.underline} adequate critical
infrastructure, education, and [**job opportunities** are ripe for
**internal unrest** and **radicalization**]{.underline}. In particular,
inadequate health delivery systems, when coupled with natural disasters,
such as droughts or floods that limit food production, cause famine and
mass movements of populations.

The Challenges for U.S. Policy

Prior to World War II, the U.S. policy towards Africa was not as active
as it was toward Europe, Asia, or Latin America. During the Cold War,
Africa policy was primarily viewed from a perspective of super-power
competition. The end of the Cold War and the rise of international
terrorism introduced this as a major component in U.S. Africa policy
along with competition with a rising China and increased Chinese
engagement in Africa.

Before his first official trip to Kenya, U.S. President Barack Obama
said, "Africa had become an idea more than an actual place . . . with
the benefit of distance, we engaged Africa in a selective embrace." This
is probably an apt description of U.S. policy towards African nations
despite the bipartisan nature of that policy. The United States, with
the many domestic and international issues it has to cope with, can ill
afford to continue to ignore Africa. Going forward, U.S. policy must
include a hard-headed look at where Africa fits in policy priorities.

The incoming Biden administration will face a number of important issues
and challenges as it develops its Africa policy. The most pressing
issues are the following:

Climate Change: Climate change is an existential problem that affects
the entire globe, but Africa has probably suffered more from the effects
of climate change than other continents---and the problem will only get
worse with time. In an October 2020 article, World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said,

Climate change is having a growing impact on the African continent,
hitting the most vulnerable hardest, and contributing to food
insecurity, population displacement and stress on water resources. In
recent months we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert
locusts and now face the looming specter of drought because of a La Nina
event. The human and economic toll has been aggravated by the COVID-19
pandemic.

Climate change impacts water quality and availability, and millions in
Africa will likely face persistent increased water stress due to these
impacts. A multi-year drought in parts of South Africa, for instance,
threatened total water failure in several small towns and had livestock
farmers facing financial ruin. Another pressing climate-change issue is
the need for protection of the Congo Basin rainforest. This
178-million-hectare rainforest is the world's second largest after the
Amazon and is currently threatened by agricultural activities in
Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon. Countries in the
Congo Basin need to address the preservation issue, while also enabling
sustainable agricultural activities to ensure food security for the
region's population. In addition to the impact on global climate caused
by destruction of the rainforest, such destruction also brings human
populations into closer contact with the region's animals, creating the
risk of future animal-to-human transmission of new and possibly more
virulent viruses similar to COVID-19, which will have a global impact.
In a January 2021 CNN report, Dr. Jean-Jacques Muyembe Tamfum, who as a
researcher helped discover the Ebola virus in 1976, warned of possible
new pathogens that could be as infectious as COVID-19 and as virulent as
Ebola.

Rule of Law/Mitigation of Corruption: A key to African development,
given the increasing urbanization, population increases, and
youthfulness of the continent's population, will be an increase in
domestic and international investment to build the industries that can
provide meaningful employment and improved standards of living. In order
for this to be successful, African nations will need to address the
issues of rule of law and corruption. Investors will not risk money if
the business climate comes with a level of political risk that is too
high. Government leaders throughout Africa need to establish legislation
that provides an acceptable level of security for investments and take
action to curb the endemic corruption that currently discourages
investment. Corruption in Africa ranges from wholesale political
corruption on the scale of General Sani Abachi's looting of \$3-5
billion of state money during his five years as Nigeria's military ruler
to the bribes paid by businessmen to police and customs officials. The
"tradition" of having to pay bribes, or "sweeteners," drives away
domestic investment and scares away foreign investment, leaving many
countries mired in poverty.

Violent Extremism and Terrorism: A number of African nations are
currently plagued with rising extremist movements. While primarily a
domestic issue, the mass movement of people fleeing violence and the
disruption of economic activity have the potential to negatively impact
the rest of the world. African nations need regional responses to curb
extremist and terrorist organizations, many of which are supported by
international terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and al Qaeda. In
addition, the underlying conditions that helped to create these
movements must be addressed. [Terrorist groups in Africa range from
relatively large and dangerous groups, such as Boko Haram]{.underline},
a group [in **Nigeria**]{.underline} that has received support from al
Qaeda and that aims to implement sharia law in the country; Al-Shabab,
an al Qaeda affiliate aiming to overthrow the government in Somalia and
to punish neighboring countries for their support of the Somali regime;
and Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army, a fundamentalist Christian group.
Terrorist groups in the fragile political climate of Libya also pose a
threat to sub-Saharan Africa.

**[Great Power Competition]{.underline}**: As the world's second-largest
economy, and with its increasing participation in international
activities, [**China** will continue to be a factor in Africa for the
foreseeable future]{.underline}. This, however, is more a problem for
the nations of Africa than it is for the rest of the world. The West can
compete best by outperforming China in areas of strength by providing
those goods and services that are unquestionably superior, and let
African governments decide how to deal with China and its
often-predatory lending practices and the Chinese tendency to import
Chinese workers for its projects and investments rather than hiring
locals. At the same time, Russia, which did not completely turn away
from Africa at the end of the Cold War as many in the West sometimes
believe, must still be considered a significant factor on the African
landscape. In an effort to compensate for Western sanctions and to
counter U.S. and Western influence, [**Russia** is once again increasing
its presence on the continent]{.underline}. Russian mercenaries, in
exchange for diamond mining rights, have trained military forces in the
Central African Republic, raising concerns about human rights abuses. Of
particular concern is the presence of the Wagner Group, a private
military company associated with Yevgeny Progozhin, a Russian oligarch
with close ties to Vladimir Putin, who was indicted in the United States
for trying to disrupt the 2016 U.S. elections. To date, Russia has, in
addition to seeking basing rights, signed military cooperation
agreements with 28 African nations. Russian activity is a combination of
military and commercial, with Progozhin at the center of both. From 2010
to 2018, Russia nearly tripled its trade with African countries. While
the activities of both Russia and China in Africa are of concern, and
should be closely monitored, neither is of critical importance to U.S.
national security.

With climate change, disease outbreaks, famine, extremism, and
inter-ethnic violence, Africa will still experience crises in the
foreseeable future that will be beyond the capacity of most nations on
the continent to deal with. Climate change is probably the greatest
cause of humanitarian crises in Africa, but mainstream media outside the
continent either fail to notice or under-report them. Some of the
[crises]{.underline}, like Ebola or the next viral infection, [can
**impact** the **rest of the world**]{.underline}. These crises will
cause starvation, mass movement of people, and increase internal and
regional instability. [Africa matters to the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and the **rest of the world**. Its impacts can
be felt **far beyond the continent's borders**]{.underline}, but if
approached as a partner rather than as a patron---with a focus on
assisting African nations to improve governance, build critical
infrastructure, boost domestic economies, and provide essential services
to all---then Africa can be a positive contributor on the global stage.

### 2ac -- democracy bad -- disease

#### Democracy makes [disease control]{.underline} impossible

Introduction

Whether [liberal **democracy** contributed to]{.underline} the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 [governance]{.underline} was a hot topic in
2020 ("Democracy and Rise of Authoritarianism in COVID-19 World", 2020).
At the end of January, 2020, [when **COVID**]{.underline}-19 [witnessed
the lockdown of Wuhan]{.underline} City, [the West]{.underline}
generally [agreed that China lacked **freedom**]{.underline} of speech
and the inertia of a rigid bureaucratic structure, and the national
censorship system kept the whistle blower Dr. Wenliang Li silent, which
led to the disease out of control (Mérieau, 2020). Democracies'
confidence mainly came from Amartya Sen's research on the famine.
[Sen]{.underline} (1999) has [claimed]{.underline} that no substantial
famine has ever occurred in any independent and democratic country with
a relatively free press and there is no exception to this rule. Citizens
in [democracies]{.underline} can [expect governments to be]{.underline}
more [**candid**, transparent, and **responsible**]{.underline} in
dealing with all kinds of crises, which authoritarian countries usually
cannot (Berengaut, 2020; Bollyky & Kickbusch, 2020). So Steve
[Bloomfield]{.underline} (2020) has [regarded that if China had a free
press and transparent government, the pandemic could be brought under
control before the outbreak. In conclusion,]{.underline} freedom plus
[democracy equals the **COVID**]{.underline}-19
**[antidote]{.underline}** according to Western standards, although
Wilson and Wisongye have found that social media rumors can exploit the
right to freedom of speech and erode people's health benefits (New York
Times, 2021; Bollyky & Kickbusch, 2020). [However]{.underline}, since
March, 2020, [with Western democracies]{.underline} seriously [affected
by **COVID**]{.underline}-19, [their superiority of the political system
has begun to **expose** its untrue and **fatal defects**]{.underline}.
Especially when Wuhan began to lift its blockade on April 8, 2020
(People.cn, 2020), [scholars]{.underline} and journalists [began to
question whether democracies had the **ability** to **deal with the
crisis**]{.underline} better than China (Mérieau, 2020). [Liberal
democracy]{.underline} in the United States [has not proved]{.underline}
that it is [more conducive]{.underline} to the COVID-19 governance [than
authoritarianism]{.underline} since 2020. [From a global perspective,
not only do **most democracies fail to contain**]{.underline} the
**[spread]{.underline}** of COVID-19, but almost [**all of the 10 most
affected** countries are **liberal democracies**]{.underline}
(Coronavirus Resource Center, 2021). [Their **policy responses** have a
**poor effect** in reducing the **death toll** in **early stages** of
the crisis, as shown that democratic political institutions may be at a
**disadvantage** in **responding quickly**]{.underline} to COVID-19
(Cepaluni, Dorsch, & Branyiczki, 2020). More surprising is that the
COVID-19 pandemic is so serious in the United States, yet no government
officials have been removed from office because of their inactivity in
fighting against the corona-virus. People doubt whether American
accountability mechanism is still working. However, two impeachments
against President Trump indicate that it seems to function quite well
(Valenta & Valenta, 2017; Herb, Raju, Fox, & Mattingly, 2021). The
direct loss to the United States caused by Russiagate and incitement of
insurrection is far less than the pain caused by the failure of the
COVID-19 governance, but no any official in the United States is
responsible for it. [If it **again** faces infectious diseases
**similar** to **COVID**]{.underline}-19, [will it **repeat** this
**unprecedented tragedy**]{.underline}? Can liberal democracy and the
separation and balance of powers push American president to act more
aggressively? [Error-tolerantism explains that the fundamental reason
for the failure of]{.underline} American [COVID]{.underline}-19
[governance is a **serious misunderstanding** of the concept of
**freedom**]{.underline} (Zhou, 2018; 2019; Zhou, Tan, & Liu, 2020).
Liberalism has witnessed a rare scene: In the context of COVID-19, the
president, governors, magistrates, and the public (Emery, Schwebke, &
Park, 2020; Sullum, 2020; Behrmann, 2020; Kenton, 2020; Strano, 2020)
have severe misunderstanding of freedom [that cost **more
than**]{.underline} American **[600,000 lives]{.underline}**
(Coronavirus Resource Center, 2021).

In response to the above phenomenon, error-tolerantism as the
development of liberalism defines liberty from a new perspective and
shows a stronger explanatory power than liberalism (Zhou et al., 2020).
The right paradigm of error-tolerantism, the right to be wrong (right to
trial and error) as an original right and mutual empowerment theory,
instead of natural rights theory and social contract theory, divides
liberty into the right to liberty in innovative fields, right to be
wrong as an original right, and the right to be right in non-innovative
fields as sub-rights. The lockdown of Wuhan means that Chinese
government has excised the power to be wrong as an original power, but
the West criticized it with the right to liberty at the level of
sub-rights, which is the first error in understanding liberty during
American COVID-19 governance; after Wuhan effectively controlled
COVID-19, its governance has transformed from an innovative field to a
non-innovative one. Then, liberties in non-innovative fields as the
sub-rights level, such as wearing face masks, keeping social distancing,
showing health codes, are formed definitely (Zhou et al., 2020).
However, [**wearing masks** has been regarded as a sign of **political
oppression** rather than a simple hygienic measure by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates (Kahanel, 2021). Since
liberalism has a major misunderstanding of the concept of liberty,
[liberal democracy]{.underline} based on the philosophy of liberalism
[should be]{.underline} deeply reflected or even
**[reconstructed]{.underline}**, and it is very reasonable for
error-tolerant democracy constructed based on error-tolerantism [to
explore the defects]{.underline} of liberal democracy [in]{.underline}
American [COVID]{.underline}-19 [governance]{.underline}. Therefore, we
first review scholars' relevant research on American democracy and the
COVID-19 governance, and then based on the theory of error-tolerant
democracy, discuss [the **defects** of]{.underline} liberal
**[democracy]{.underline}** and American political system that [are
**unable to cope** with the **crisis of the century**]{.underline}.

1 INTRODUCTION

[Our world is vulnerable to global catastrophic risks]{.underline}
(GCRs) [or existential risks]{.underline} (Bostrom, 2019; Ord, 2020).
[**GCRs** are so disastrous because they affect one or more systems
**critical to humanity**, and **spread** to affect the **entire
planet**]{.underline} (Avin et al., 2018). Existential risks threaten to
eliminate humanity or permanently curtail its potential (Ord, 2020).
Some of these [risks are **natural**, for example]{.underline} asteroid
or comet impact, supervolcanic eruption, [naturally occurring
**pandemic**]{.underline}, or various cosmic events (Bostrom & Cirkovic,
2008; Ord, 2020). Many others are the result of human activities, for
example nuclear war, anthropogenic climate change, nonaligned artificial
intelligence, engineered biological threats, geoengineering, or
inescapable totalitarianism (Bostrom & Cirkovic, 2008; Ord, 2020).

There are three phases to an existential catastrophe: origin, scale up,
and reaching every last human (Cotton-Barratt, Daniel, & Sandberg,
2020). Following any near miss, there would be a period where recovery
of humanity\'s long-term potential may or may not be realized (Baum et
al., 2019). [Failure to]{.underline} anticipate or [**mitigate** these
threats risks **undesirable trajectories** for **human
civilization**]{.underline} (Baum et al., 2019).

In addition to the present generation\'s obvious self-interest in
continuing to exist, the perspective of long-termism suggests that
humanity ought to mitigate these risks due to the potential immense
value of future human generations (Beckstead, 2013), a desire to see
aspects of the human project continue across time and perhaps the
universe (Bostrom, 2003; Scheffler, 2013), and the potential cosmic
significance of preserving intelligent life on Earth (Ord, 2020). A
number of philosophical defenses of long-termism have been published
(Beckstead, 2013; Greaves & MacAskill, 2019). Importantly, these
long-term outcomes are largely under human control because most of the
risk is probably anthropogenic (Beard & Torres, 2020; Ord, 2020).

1.1 Mitigating Existential Threats

It is too simplistic to think of existential risks as mere causes that
are followed by a sequence of effects. We should think of risks as the
product of hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures (Liu, Lauta, & Maas,
2018). [Hazards are the **precipitating cause** of a
**catastrophe**]{.underline}, vulnerabilities are the inability of
critical systems to withstand hazards, and exposures are the features of
human society that turn this system damage into harm to populations
(Beard & Torres, 2020). [Mitigation of existential threats involves
preventing their emergence, **responding** if the threat spreads, and
building **resilience** so the threat does **not** lead to the death of
**every last human** or leave humanity with **permanently curtailed**
prospects]{.underline} (Cotton-Barratt et al., 2020). After a threat has
passed, there may also be a series of limiters that might prevent the
reemergence of a flourishing humanity (Baum et al., 2019). One such
limiting factor could be the loss of technological society and know-how.

In order to achieve immunity from existential threat, humanity will need
a period where it preserves its potential and protects itself from risks
(Ord, 2020). Various methods have been proposed to address
vulnerabilities and hence shift the probability of existential risk.
These suggestions include: improved international focus, governance, and
cooperation such as through the United Nations (Boyd & Wilson, 2020),
imitating existing frameworks such as the Sendai framework for disaster
risk reduction (Avin et al., 2018), achieving the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals (Cernev & Fenner, 2020), or extreme
surveillance for threats (Bostrom, 2019). Toby Ord lists 38 specific
measures across eight existential threats, and an additional 12 avenues
to explore that address risks in general terms (Ord, 2020).

1.2 Biological Threats

[**Pandemic viruses** with **high case fatality** could potentially
infect a **majority** of the population. Deliberate biological events
(DBEs) have occurred before]{.underline} (Millet & Snyder-Beattie,
2017a), [will **likely occur again**, and could pose a **threat** to
humans as great as **nuclear war**]{.underline} (Kosal, 2020). [New
**tech**]{.underline}nologies [such as **a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [could **amplify biothreats** in a number
of ways]{.underline} (O\'Brien & Nelson, 2020). [These risks are
**increased** because the]{.underline} Biological Weapons Convention
[(BWC) has no verification system]{.underline} (Dando, 2016), [and has
been violated in the past]{.underline} (Gronvall, 2018). [It would
**only** take **one** unanticipated or **accidental event** for a
**bioweapon** (or **lab**]{.underline}oratory [accident) to **be**come a
**catastrophic threat**]{.underline}. The U.S. National Academies of
Sciences specifically warns against synthetic biology and xenobiology
(Gomez-Tatay & Hernandez-Andreu, 2019) and it is argued that [a
state-sponsored bioweapon attack is the **greatest current
threat**]{.underline} (Sandberg & Nelson, 2020). See the Supporting
Information for further details on biological threats. Global
preparedness through the One Health approach, global health security
projects, and the need to integrate health and the GCR field (Millet &
Snyder-Beattie, 2017b) are important. But as the COVID-19 pandemic has
shown, there may be important overlooked aspects or misunderstood risks
that could make any suite of general preparation inadequate. Therefore,
last lines of defense may be required, such as refuges.

### 2ac -- democracy bad -- warming

#### [Existential]{.underline} warming is [inevitable]{.underline} AND causes a [collapse]{.underline} into [extreme]{.underline} authoritarianism\-\--[only]{.underline} transitioning from democracy solves

Dr. Chien-Yi **Lu 21**, PhD and MA in Government from the University of
Texas, Austin, Visiting Scholar at Harvard University, Associate
Research Fellow at the Institute of European and American Studies of
Academia Sinica, Surviving Democracy: Mitigating Climate Change in a
Neoliberalized World, Paperback Edition, 12/13/2021, p. 1-2

The fact [that]{.underline} the [scientific knowledge on the human
contribution to climate change entered human society
through]{.underline} the most advanced [democratic societies **should
have been** a cause for celebration. Given the **congruence** of climate
mitigation and public interests]{.underline}, the problem of [climate
change should have been considered solved decades ago. **Several decades
of inaction** later, however, arguments are proliferating that
**democracy** is **exactly the reason** for **inaction**]{.underline}.

In The Collapse of Western Civilization, historians Naomi Oreskes and
Erik Conway travel to the future to look back and offer a forensic
analysis on the climate-induced Great Collapse of Western Civilization
of 2074 (2014: 63). The future historians' forensic report states that
["\[a\]s the **devastating effects** of the **Great
Collapse**]{.underline} began to [appear]{.underline}, the
nation-[states with democratic governments... were]{.underline} at first
[**unwilling** and then **unable**" to **deal** with the
crisis]{.underline}. These [democratic governments]{.underline} realized
that they [had no "**infrastructure** and **organization**al ability to
**quarantine** and **relocate**]{.underline} people" [as "**food
shortages** and **disease outbreaks** spread and **sea level\[s\]
rose**."]{.underline} In China, [where there was **centralized**
government, the crisis was handled **much more adequately**, leading to
**survival**]{.underline} rates exceeding 80%, a development [that
"**vindicated** the **necessity** of **centralized**
government"]{.underline} (2014: 51--2). The gist of The Collapse of
Western Civilization is not about critiquing democracy per se but a
warning against the [stubborn inaction]{.underline} mandated by market
fundamentalism that [has **hijacked** Western democracies]{.underline}.1
In their previous book, Merchants of Doubt, Oreskes and Conway
documented the way that [climate deniers **sow**]{.underline}ed the
[seeds of doubt about climate]{.underline} change [and]{.underline}
successfully **[stave]{.underline}**d [off implementations of mitigation
measures]{.underline}. For the authors, the anticommunist ideology that
had kept actors vigilant about government encroachment in the
marketplace occupied a central place in climate denial (2014: 69).
Ironically, [this]{.underline} sort of ideology-informed calculation
meant [that preventative action was **blocked**, increasing the risk
that **disruptive climate disasters** would **eventually necessitate the
suspension of democracy** and **legitimating the sort of heavy-handed
authoritarian interventions that the conservatives most
abhorred**]{.underline} (2014: 52; 69).

[An appeal to **suspend democracy for the sake of
survival**]{.underline} can be found in The Climate Change Challenge and
the Failure of Democracy, where Shearman and Smith argue that [liberal
democracy is **incompatible** with the **urgent necessity** to prevent
**catastrophic climate change**]{.underline}. The vested interests of
politicians, corporations, and media lie in continuing with business as
usual and in keeping the public ignorant. Instead of bottom-up reforms
to improve democracy and bring about sensible climate policies,
[Shearman and Smith see a **transformation** in**to** **authoritarian
regimes** as the **only responsible way forward** when faced with the
**extreme ecological stress** of climate change]{.underline}. They point
out that, as Plato foresaw, [those in power in a democracy are seldom
able to **resist the demands of the populace** for long, but as a mass,
the populace is **seldom able to focus** on **complex problems** and to
perceive threats that lie **over the horizon**]{.underline}. Hence,
[those able to see **further**]{.underline}---scientists, experts, and
the knowledgeable--- [should be entrusted with steering the course while
there is **still time** to **avoid disaster**]{.underline}. It is only
under a benign authoritarian rule of the knowledgeable that a saner,
fairer, and more rational means of weighing social goods against evils
can be introduced (Shearman and Smith, 2007).

#### The public is an idiocracy. 'Pressure' cannot be productive.

Dr. Stuart **Parker 20**, Philosopher and Former Teacher who Lectured on
Philosophy and Education at London\'s Institute of Education, South Bank
University, Author of Reflective Teaching in the Postmodern World, "The
Problem With Democracy --- It\'s You", The Article, 10/5/2020,
https://www.thearticle.com/the-problem-with-democracy-its-you

So [why is]{.underline} our [democracy **so unfit** for purpose? Why is
it that we can elect leaders who are **little more** than **self-serving
schemers**, whose **contempt** for the electorate renders them
**incapable** of giving **straight, honest answers** to even the **most
straightforward**, reasonable questions? It's not as if any of these
qualities have been smuggled in under our noses. They are
**paraded**]{.underline} before our eyes every single day. [Nobody
voting for]{.underline} Johnson or [**Trump** could]{.underline} ~~be
blind to the fact~~ [\[ignore\] that they are **serial liars**. And yet
they **voted all the same**. Why?]{.underline}

\*\*\*

Mencken was on to something when suggesting that [the leaders we get,
the leaders we deserve, closely **represent something dark** in the
**inner soul** of the people. There's no easy way to put this --- **the
problem with democracy is the voters**. The voters simply aren't good
enough to support a healthy democracy]{.underline}. They're not up to
the job. Now I know some will think: a snowflake-remainer-lefty-loser
will always blame the voters just as a bad workman always blames his
tools. But these tools are shot.

[Consider this: a poll]{.underline} in 2005 [found that 21 per cent of
Americans believe in **witches** and 9 per cent that spirits can take

Britain has nothing to be proud of. While 33 per cent of us believe in

[We]{.underline} now [turn to]{.underline} the [results from the outcome
stage, where]{.underline} militarized [conflict]{.underline} initiation
[is regressed on democracy]{.underline} measures and other covariates.
[The **univariate** clog-log model]{.underline} 32 [that **ignores the
endogeneity**]{.underline}, shown in column (1) in Table 1,
[successfully replicates the standard]{.underline}, dyadic [**democratic
peace** finding]{.underline} that democracies are peaceful, though only
toward other democracies. Note that, while individual democracy measures
have either a positive or insignificant coefficient, joint democracy has
a negative coefficient that overwhelms the positive coefficients of
individual democracy measures in the univariate model. As a result, the
univariate model produces a result that, while democracy may increase
conflict against a non-democracy, it decreases conflict against a
democracy.

To illustrate this, we calculate the average treatment effect of joint
democracy for the challenger and for the target based on the univariate
model. These effects are calculated by comparing the predicted
probabilities of conflict initiation when changing the regime type of
self (challenger or target) from non-democracy to democracy, holding
constant the regime type of the other (target or challenger) as
democracy. 33 Gray, hollow circles in Figure 4 show the treatment
effects of challenger's and target's democracy. We can see that both
effects are negative and statistically significant at the 95% confidence
level.

[Once we **correct** the endogeneity, **however**, the data **no longer
support** such conclusions]{.underline}. In column (2) in Table 1, [the
negative coefficient for joint democracy **no longer overwhelms** the
positive coefficient of challenger's democracy. Challenger's democracy
now appears to **increase conflict** even against a **democratic**
target]{.underline}. Red, solid circles in Figure 4 show the average
treatment effects of challenger's and target's democracy, calculated
from the trivariate model. [The effect is **positive** and
**statistically significant** for challenger's democracy]{.underline},
although the effect is indistinguishable from zero for target's
democracy.

[Whether we **correct for endogeneity**]{.underline} thus [makes a
**significant difference** in our estimates of the effect of joint
democracy on conflict]{.underline}. The key to understanding why these
changes occur lies in the estimated correlations between the error terms
for different equations. The estimated error correlation between
equations for conflict and challenger's democracy, 12, is negative and
statistically significant. This suggests that unobservable or
[unmeasured determinants of]{.underline} a country's [democracy make it
less likely for that country to attack another country. A failure to
control for]{.underline} such [factors]{.underline} would [generate a
**negative omitted variable bias**, making it **look** as
if]{.underline} challenger's [democracy has a **pacify**ing effect on
conflict behavior]{.underline}. On the other hand, the estimated error
correlation between conflict and target's democracy equations, 13, is
indistinguishable from zero, suggesting that the endogeneity problem
does not seem to operate for target's regime type.

Before we review our approach in detail, it may be useful to explain why
[this type of analysis has **not** been pursued **successfully** in the
past]{.underline} and [what makes our effort **different** from
other]{.underline}, broadly related [projects. We are not the first to
apply an IV framework]{.underline} (more specifically) [or
multi-equation models]{.underline} (more broadly) [to the democratic
peace. However, **previous attempts** suffer from two **major
problems**. First, previous studies have typically used a
**dyad**]{.underline} (country pair) [as the **unit**]{.underline} of
observation in analyzing conflict, [which requires]{.underline} some
**[summary measure(s)]{.underline}** of democracy [for a
pair]{.underline} of countries [rather than the]{.underline} state-level
[**(monadic)** democracy measure]{.underline}. 6 [Use of a dyadic
aggregate to represent regime type creates a **discrepancy** between the
**first stage regression** (predicting democracy at the country level)
and the **outcome stage regression** (predicting conflict at the dyad
level).]{.underline} 7 [We **avoid this** problem by using the
**directed dyad** as the **unit** of observation in predicting conflict,
**distinguishing** between the potential challenger and target in a
dispute. This allows us to connect the first stage
equations]{.underline} (predicting the challenger's and target's regime
types) [and the outcome stage equation **seamlessly**]{.underline}.
Doing so has several benefits: the outcome stage model could directly
include country-level covariates (such as challenger's and target's
democracy) without having to convert them to a dyadic summary.
[This]{.underline} also [allows us to estimate the system of equations
jointly rather than relying on the **"forbidden
regression."**]{.underline} 8

[Second, a more daunting challenge]{.underline} in applying an IV
approach to democratic peace research [is the difficulty of finding a
**plausible instrument** for **regime type**]{.underline} [--- a
variable that is **strongly correlated** with **regime type** but is
**unrelated to war**. This is the challenge that has **plagued**
empirical researchers in many fields. For example, a recent
study]{.underline} of the effect of regime type on economic growth [uses
a **diffusion-based** measure]{.underline} of democracy (i.e., average
value of democracies in a given region) as an instrument for democracy
(Acemoglu et al. 2019). [However]{.underline}, diffusion-based
[instruments]{.underline} such as this [are unlikely to be]{.underline}
a **[valid]{.underline}** instrument, [due to **spatial spill-over**,
**interdependence**, and]{.underline}, most importantly,
**[simultaneity]{.underline}** (Betz, Cook, and Hollenbach 2018).
Recognizing problems with spatial instruments, McDonald (2015) seeks to
exploit the very discrepancy between country-level and dyad-level
designs as the source of identification. His discussion, however, lacks
a clear explanation as to why some determinants of regime type do not
influence conflict. 9

[We turn to a **demographic** variable]{.underline} --- average female
**[fertility rate]{.underline}** in a given country --- [as a source of
**variation in regime type** that is **exogenous** to international
conflict]{.underline}. As we will argue below, [a lower fertility rate
is a **strong driver** of democratization]{.underline}. We will
[also]{.underline} present theoretical arguments and a series of
falsification tests that support the claim that average national
**[fertility]{.underline}** rate [does **not**]{.underline} directly
[influence international **conflict**]{.underline}.

DANGERS OF TRANSITION

[The idea that democracies never fight wars]{.underline} against each
other [has become an axiom]{.underline} for many scholars. It is, as one
scholar puts it, "as close as anything we have to an empirical law in
international relations." This "law" is invoked by American statesmen
[to justify]{.underline} a foreign policy that encourages
[democratization abroad]{.underline}. In his 1994 State of the Union
address, President Clinton asserted that no two democracies had ever
gone to war with each other, thus explaining why promoting democracy
abroad was a pillar of his foreign policy.

It is probably true that a world in which more countries were mature,
stable democracies would be safer and preferable for the United States.
[**But** countries do **not** become mature democracies **overnight**.
They usually go through a **rocky transition**, where mass politics
mixes with authoritarian elite politics in a volatile way. **Statistical
ev**idence covering the past two centuries shows that in **this
transitional phase** of democratization, countries become **more
aggressive and war-prone, not less**, and they do **fight wars** with
democratic states. In fact, formerly authoritarian states where
democratic participation is on the rise are **more likely** to fight
wars than are stable democracies or **autocracies**. States that make
the biggest leap]{.underline}, from total autocracy to extensive mass
democracy---like contemporary Russia---[are]{.underline} about [**twice
as likely** to fight wars]{.underline} in the decade [after
democratization as are states that remain **autocracies**]{.underline}.

[This **historical pattern** of **democratization**, **belligerent
nationalism**, and **war** is]{.underline} already
[emerging]{.underline} in some of today's new or partial democracies,
especially some formerly communist states. Two pairs of states---Serbia
and Croatia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan---have found themselves at war
while experimenting with varying degrees of electoral democracy. The
electorate of Russia's partial democracy cast nearly a quarter of its
votes for the party of radical nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Even
mainstream Russian politicians have adopted an imperial tone in their
dealings with neighboring former Soviet republics, and military force
has been used ruthlessly in Chechnya.

The following evidence should raise questions about the Clinton
administration's policy of promoting peace by promoting democratization.
[The expectation that the spread of democracy will probably contribute
to peace in the **long run**]{.underline}, once new democracies mature,
[provides **little comfort** to those who might face a heightened risk
of war in the **short run**. Pushing **nuclear-armed** great powers like
Russia or China **to**ward democratization is like **spinning a roulette
wheel**: many of the outcomes are undesirable]{.underline}. Of course,
in most cases the initial steps on the road to democratization will not
be produced by any conscious policy of the United States. The roulette
wheel is already spinning for Russia and perhaps will be soon for China.
Washington and the international community need to think not so much
about encouraging or discouraging democratization as about helping to
smooth the transition in ways that minimize its risks.

PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT

The debate on the suitability of liberal democracy in supporting
economic development in post-colonial African states has unabatedly
continued to remain at the centre of current intellectual discourses and
conversations. Although scholars seem to be focused on the endogenous
constraints to the capacity of liberal democracy in generating the
expected development outcome, specific attention is yet to be paid on
how **[exorbitant spending on elections undermines human development in
Nigeria]{.underline}**. This study therefore argues that [the
**electoral** timetable]{.underline} of a 4-year tenure system renewable
only once, which [sustains **exorbitant** public
expenditure]{.underline} on elections [is **antithetical** to the
**human development** drive of the Nigerian state. It **diverts public
spending**, **incapacitates** the state from addressing the **economic
priority needs** of the people, and **deepens the gap** between the rich
and poor]{.underline}. Redesigning and retuning the content of liberal
democracy in line with the demands, peculiarities and realities of the
Nigerian state are highly recommended in the study.

The Real Cost of Democracy

Aside from the aforementioned financial cost of elections and patronage,
[other expenditures bring the recurring cost of]{.underline} the
[Nigeria's]{.underline} 20-year [democratic project into **tens of
billions** of dollars, an expense that will sooner or later]{.underline}
~~cripple~~ [**\[ruin\] the country** financially]{.underline}. Let me
expatiate. A recent report confirmed what many Nigerians have long
suspected about the remunerations of their elected executive and
legislative leaders: Nigerian [elected]{.underline} public [office
holders]{.underline} at all levels of government [are the highest paid
in the world]{.underline}.\[5\] Together with their string of assistants
and advisors (who sometimes have their own paid advisors), Nigeria's
[public officers gobble up]{.underline} at least [half of the nation's
revenue]{.underline} and budgetary appropriations in legitimate rewards.

[This prohibitive **democratic overhead** has left the country with a
**smaller pool of funds** than ever to **invest** in the things that
matter to Nigerians: roads, healthcare, schools, water, electricity, and
food production. This odd reality of low returns on democratic
investment is **unsustainable**. Something has to give]{.underline}.

[What is being eroded is the **very stability of the state**, along with
**any trust** that citizens still have in it. This is a proverbial
**ticking time bomb** that will implode or **explode** if the trend
continues, **if this democracy endures**]{.underline}. Twenty years
since the return of civilian rule, it is not an exaggeration to say that
not only has [democracy]{.underline} not paid off for Nigeria but that
it [is now a **threat** to its **stability** and
**survival**]{.underline}. This is a radical shift that has occurred
stealthily and has thus been missed by the Western governmental and
non-governmental actors that encouraged and funded democratic advocacy
in the 1990s.

#### The [two-party]{.underline} system creates [polarization]{.underline}, [social violence]{.underline}, and [instability]{.underline}

[The **hitches**]{.underline} and abnormalities [characterising
Nigeria's electoral democracy are]{.underline}, no doubt, [intrinsically
linked to the institutionalised two-tenure renewable
system]{.underline}. This tenure system was externally supported by the
purveyors of liberal democracy and domesticated by the local accomplices
solely for self-interest. [In Nigeria, the **winner-takes-all
mentality** as well as the **high stakes** usually associated with
political offices **heightens electoral contestations** among the
competing, **polarised** and distrusted **ethnic nationalities** who
perceive political power as a means of advancing their peculiar economic
interests]{.underline}. The struggle is usually intensified when it is
obvious that access to state power guarantees an unfettered gateway to
huge petro-dollar revenue. Indeed, [the incumbent's penchant for
re-**election** often reinforces the tendency for **divisiveness**,
**violence**, rancour and **instability**]{.underline}. For instance,
the re-election bid of the then President Goodluck Jonathan in 2015
accounted for the deaths of 106 people while the election-related
conflict in 2011 led to the deaths of 800 people and the displacement of
65,000 (Birch & Muchlinski, 2018; Harwood, 2019). The two-tenure system
affects governance and policy responses since incumbent officials
seeking re-election often devote a substantial part of their time and
energy in politicking and grandstanding for a favourable outcome. This
manifested in the 2015 and 2019 re-elections of Goodluck Jonathan and
Muhammadu Buhari, respectively, in Nigeria when both leaders abandoned
their jobs for campaigns. Also, given the monetised and winner-takes-all
approach of Nigerian politics, [incumbent candidates **ruthlessly divert
public funds** for re-election campaigns. It **drains the national
treasury** and **redirects public expenditure** to campaign funding
rather than to **human and capital development**]{.underline}. A classic
example is the ongoing investigation into the Office of the National
Security Adviser which, at the interim, has revealed that the sum of 2.1
USD billion appropriated for procurement of military equipments was
diverted and used to prosecute the 2015 general elections for the
Peoples Democratic Party.

[Liberal democracy's]{.underline} capstone ritual, [**zero-sum**
elections, endow winners with **all the rewards** of

earnings, local and international political visibility, and power. [The
loser]{.underline}, conversely, [gets **nothing**. The result is a
**high-stakes version of**]{.underline} what is called
**[FOMO]{.underline}**, or the fear of missing out, in American popular
lingo. [This fear of political exclusion in turn catalyzes
**desperation**, which consistently and predictably
produces]{.underline} messy, **[violent]{.underline}**, and compromised
**[elections]{.underline}**.

In addition, since its return to civilian rule in 1999, [liberal
democracy has been]{.underline} an [unacceptably costly]{.underline}
enterprise for Nigeria. In 2019, [the country spent]{.underline} about
[\$670 million on a]{.underline} general **[election]{.underline}**
widely condemned as a sham. With budget financing increasingly steeped
in external and internal debt, and [given the **fungibility** of state
funds]{.underline}, there is a depressing possibility that Nigeria is
borrowing to fund elections and to finance its fledgling democratic
institutions and processes. [It's a hefty price tag in a country where
most people subsist on less than \$2 a day]{.underline}. When this
financial outlay is added to Nigeria's notoriety for having some of the
highest paid legislators in the world and for spending the national
fortune to maintain a large army of elected and appointed civilian
officials, the unsustainability of this "democratic" trajectory emerges
in full relief.

It is not just [the **fiscal cost**]{.underline} of elections and
civilian administration that **[threatens to]{.underline}** ~~cripple~~
[**\[destroy\] Nigeria**. The **social cost** of this "democratic"
adventure poses the **most potent threat** to the country. Plural,
adversarial, and zero-sum elections have **frayed the social fabric**
and undermined the **cohesion** of a notoriously fragile
country]{.underline}. As mentioned previously, [elections have been
marked]{.underline}---and marred---[by]{.underline} killings,
displacement, [**scorched earth** violence]{.underline}, and malicious
manipulations. [Electoral contests are]{.underline} little more than
[**political warfare** between **factions**]{.underline} of Nigeria's
political elite for access to the country's resources.

[The result]{.underline} of this charade [has been a **steady trend** of
**voter apathy**]{.underline}, represented by declining voter turnout,
which stood at 35 percent in 2019. Nigerians are communicating their
disillusionment with this iteration of democracy. [Without
**urgent**]{.underline}, profound [**reforms**, the current path may
**destroy the country**]{.underline}. It is no longer enough to argue
that the current challenges are mere setbacks on the path to democratic
maturity, or that escalating "democratic" tyranny is an aberration.

#### Boko Haram will get CBRNs\-\--extinction

Dr. Bernard B. **Fyanka 20**, Ph.D. in History and Strategic Studies
from the University of Lagos, Akoka Lagos Nigeria, \"Chemical,
Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Terrorism: Rethinking
Nigeria's Counterterrorism Strategy\", African Security Review, Volume
28, Issue 3-4, 2/17/2020, Taylor & Francis Online

The end of the Cold War might have represented the end of mutually
assured destruction ([MAD]{.underline}), but it [did not]{.underline}
necessarily [dispel the dangers of the nuclear age]{.underline} -- in
fact, to some extent the globalised [proliferation of non-conventional
weapons has instead escalated the possibilities for a nuclear attack
being carried out]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the belligerents of
any nuclear conflict would have been easily identifiable; however, in
the post-Cold-War era, non-state actors and [**terrorist** groups like
**Boko Haram** have emerged as potential players in]{.underline} a new
variety of **[nuclear conflicts]{.underline}** that would entirely be
based on terrorist models. The ominous possibilities for this new kind
of warfare are indeed terrifying, and [the rise in terrorist
attacks]{.underline} around the globe [enhances the likelihood of such
an occurrence]{.underline}. Since 9/11, the body of academic literature
on the threat posed by terrorists regarding weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs) and chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) devices
has increased. In Gary Ackerman and Jeremy Tamsett's edited volume,
Jihadists and Weapons of Mass Destruction, there is disagreement as to
whether this threat is overestimated or underestimated.1 In recent
times, however, [ample ideological incentive for the use of **CBRN**
devices has been provided]{.underline} by the likes of Abu Mus'ab
al-Suri -- author of the 'Global Islamic Resistance Call' -- who has
stated that '\[t\]he aim of carrying out resistance missions and
individual jihad terrorism "jihad al-irhabi al-fardi" is to inflict the
largest human and material casualties possible on American interests and
its allied countries'.2 This echoes the previous call of Grand Ayatollah
Ahmad Husayni al-Baghdadi, who maintained:

> If the objective and subjective conditions materialize, and there are
> soldiers, weapons, and money -- even if this means using biological,
> chemical, and bacterial weapons -- we will conquer the world, so that
> 'There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Prophet' will be
> triumphant over the domes of Moscow, Washington, and Paris.3

For Boko Haram and other groups, there definitely exists a strong
motivation for the use of WMDs, and the global reach of this thinking is
not in doubt:

> The globalization of the jihadist struggle has also led to an
> increased emphasis on Islamic identity. In combination with the
> ideological theme of revenge, the global struggle for Islamic identity
> has the potential to create a new jihadist cultic worldview in which
> its endorsers seek out WMDs because they represent the only means to
> significantly transform reality.4

Contextual scenarios in Nigeria strongly suggest that Boko Haram is one
such group which has embraced the jihadist world view that endorses the
use of WMDs. In this regard, the strengthened affiliation of Boko
Haram's splinter group -- the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP)
-- with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) confirms their
ideological persuasions. The motivation for Boko Haram to use such
weapons is thus grounded in the recent use of chemical weapons by ISIS
in both Iraq and Syria against both military and civilian targets.5 If
ISIS is claiming ownership of a faction of Boko Haram as its West
African province, it is likely to extend its tactics to its African
allies.

In the light of the above, the use of WMDs by terrorists cannot be
explained within the framework of orthodox terrorism theories. With this
in mind, what Russell Worth Parker refers to as the 'Islamic just war
theory' suitably anchors a discourse on terrorism and advanced weapons
of war.6 Most theorists do not support a subjective theory of 'just
war', but rather the traditional version that relies on Western ideas of
morality and proportionality, as well as on motives for waging war.7 On
the other hand, jihadist traditions reinterpret just war's key tenet of
proportionality to suit Islamists' conflict rationale. According to the
Western form of just war theory, wherein discrimination proves
strategically impossible, any response should be proportionate to the
action that compels it -- hence, proportionality dictates that a
military operation should not cause greater harm than the act that it
was designed to counter or prevent.8 This proportionality argument is
exemplified in the use of nuclear weapons in the Second World War; since
casualty estimates for an invasion of Japan exceeded one million Allied
lives, with similar estimates for Japanese military and civilians, a
nuclear attack was preferable. Eventually, the actual casualties
suffered from the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached 200,000,
which represents 10% of the casualties that would likely have been
incurred if Japan had been invaded (see https://avalon.law.yale.edu/).
In the light of this argument, justification for the use of WMDs by
terrorist groups would rest on their interpretation of the extent of the
damage caused by the military aggression and long-term imperialism of
Western powers.

Fighting faceless enemies in a CBRN conflict, whether in West Africa or
the Middle East, is hard to imagine. Enemies who can easily blend into
the crowd and take on the face of ordinary civilians represent a
nightmare scenario for security strategists all around the world. The
risk of WMDs falling into the hands of terrorist groups is largely
dependent on their ability to obtain weapons-grade nuclear material like
uranium and plutonium, combined with gaining the capability to build and
deploy weapons which make use of them. The global proliferation of
nuclear material has made this possible today.

Global proliferation of fissile material

The collapse of the Soviet military-industrial complex ushered in a
period of uncertainty regarding the security of nuclear material.
Consequently, the risk of fissile material falling into the hands of
terrorist groups -- or into the hands of states that sympathise with or
harbour such groups -- increased considerably. Lax security at former
Soviet nuclear facilities was widespread, making the theft of nuclear
material possible. In the chaos that followed the Soviet collapse in the
early 1990s, radioactive material was frequently stolen from poorly
guarded reactors and nuclear facilities in Russia and its former
satellite states. Police operations have intercepted shipments of Soviet
nuclear material in cities as far away as Munich and Prague, and experts
believe that large batches are still unaccounted for and most likely
accessible to well-connected traders on the black market.9

Over 1800 metric tons of nuclear material is still stored in facilities
belonging to more than 25 countries all around the world.10 Not all of
this material is located in military stockpiles -- in fact, most
countries maintain civil stockpiles of plutonium for use in nuclear
power reactors. The civil stockpiles in the United Kingdom (UK), India,
Belgium, France, Germany, Japan and Russia add up to over 230 metric
tons of plutonium. In spite of these enormous quantities, the UK, India,
France, Japan and Russia have not yet reduced the reprocessing of
plutonium for civil use. Although civil plutonium is not weapons-grade,
it remains viable as a raw material that can be transformed through an
enrichment process for use in a bomb. The United States (US) on the
other hand has a comparatively small amount of civil plutonium because
of its 1970 policy to suspend the separation of plutonium from spent
nuclear fuel.11

About 25 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU) is required to build a bomb
-- an insignificant amount in comparison to the global stockpile, which
is in excess of 1.6 million kg. On the other hand, about 8 kg of
plutonium is needed to build a bomb -- a tiny fraction of the 500,000 kg
global stockpile.12 Nuclear facilities that are relics of the Cold War
era, especially those located in Eastern Europe, represent a high
security risk. More than 130 nuclear reactors powered by HEU are
operational in over 40 countries -- the fallout of an early Cold-War-era
programme in which the US and the Soviet Union helped their allies to
obtain nuclear technology. Several other reactors have been shut down
but may still contain nuclear fuel on site. In total, the world's
research reactors contain 22 tons of HEU -- enough to build hundreds of
nuclear bombs. The problem is that research reactor fuel tends to be
stored under notoriously light security, making it a very vulnerable
target for terrorists.13

In 2004, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a
report that details security lapses at civilian nuclear installations,
citing a case in which the fences surrounding an unnamed foreign
research reactor were in very poor condition and there were no guards
securing the reactor building itself. In this report, Harvard expert
Matthew Bunn explains that unlike the bulky and extremely radioactive
fuel rods used in commercial nuclear power plants, research reactor fuel
consists of small pellets that weigh only a few pounds each and moreover
are easier to handle --a simple backpack can conceal several pellets.14
Naturally, civilian stockpiles are at greater risk of theft than those
held in military installations. Consequently, the possibilities of such
dangerous material falling into the hands of terrorists groups have
become increasingly plausible.

Regarding military stockpiles, Russia and the US possess the largest
amounts of weapons-grade plutonium -- 100 and 150 metric tons,
respectively. Diplomatic attempts aimed at reducing these stockpiles
have resulted in an agreement for the two countries to dispose of 34
metric tons each via the method of turning the weapons-grade plutonium
into fuel for nuclear power reactors. Although this agreement has not
been effected yet, it is obvious given the above that the process may
expose the material to greater risk of theft rather than securing it.15
On the other hand, in 2005 the US Congress eliminated the long-standing
restrictions that were placed on the exporting of HEU to other countries
for the purpose of manufacturing medical isotopes, which has also
created new avenues for the proliferation of nuclear material through
civilian use.16

Although the civilian use of nuclear material has increased the risk of
its proliferation, the military facilities currently holding nuclear
material around the world -- especially in Russia -- are also not well
secured. Thousands of Cold-War-era tactical weapons are stored at very
poorly guarded military installations, and most of these weapons are
small and do not have electronic locks that prevent unauthorised
usage.17 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union there has been no viable
security strategy for securing the nuclear material contained in many of
the former empire's cities. During the Cold War era, the citizens of
these cities had access to these facilities -- and they still do, a
problem further compounded by the fact that a strict inventory of the
nuclear material contained in these facilities is not maintained.18

The likes of infamous arms dealer Leonid Minin (who was found guilty in
a court of law for supplying weapons to non-state actors in African
conflicts) are all too willing to do business with terrorists.19, 20
Arms dealers and smugglers all over the world are always seeking
lucrative opportunities, and it is almost certain that some nuclear
material has already been acquired by dangerous fanatics.

Several incidents in recent decades give every reason to believe that
this is the case. In 1993, Kazakhstani authorities discovered HEU
capable of arming 20 bombs in a building that was poorly secured.21 In
2006, Russian citizen Oleg Khinsagov was arrested in Georgia for
carrying 100 g of HEU and attempting to find a buyer for what he claimed
was many additional kilograms.22 In 2011, six men with 4 g of uranium
were arrested by security forces in Moldova. Upon questioning, they
claimed that the 4 g represented a sample of the product they were ready
to market. They claimed to possess an additional 9kg, which represents
one third of the quantity needed to create a nuclear weapon. The leader
of this group and the North African buyer escaped.23 Four years before
this incident, gunmen raided a facility in Pelindaba, South Africa; the
details of the event are still shrouded in mystery.24

[Efforts by **terrorist** organisation**s** to **purchase and use
nuclear weapons** continue unabated]{.underline}. The most high profile
of these known efforts is that of Osama bin Laden, who in 2001 attempted
to purchase a canister of uranium in Sudan for US\$1.5 million.
Intelligence reports claim that he also met with two Pakistani nuclear
scientists, and [sketches of nuclear weapons were found at an
**al-Qaeda** training camp.25]{.underline}

From the foregoing, it is clear that there exists a robust and thriving
black market in fissile material that seems to be tailor-made for use by
terrorists groups. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as at
December 2015 had recorded in its trafficking database a total of 2889
incidents involving losses, thefts and/or attempts to traffic fissile
material across international borders.26 This is an incredibly high rate
of security lapses considering the security priority that nuclear
facilities are supposed to possess. More pressing is the fact that the
agency does not inspect every nuclear facility globally, and as such is
not in a position to comprehensively enforce strict security and safety
regulations. As a consequence of this, fissile material often goes
missing and subsequently appears on the black market without being
reported to the agency. Furthermore, several nations which maintain
nuclear facilities do not possess the requisite resources to subject
employees to the kind of extensive background checks that can ensure
their trustworthiness for working at such high-security sites. In the
absence of this screening, the likelihood of people with terrorist ties
applying for jobs at nuclear facilities for the purpose of obtaining
nuclear material is very high.

There is mounting evidence worldwide that increasing amounts of fissile
material are being stolen and traded. Although the Russian government
refuses to admit that it has lost any nuclear weapons, at least four
Russian nuclear submarines have sunk, and it is believed that the
warheads on board are yet to be recovered. The US on the other hand has
admitted to losing a staggering 11 nuclear weapons.27

How can Boko Haram obtain nuclear material?

Boko Haram is one of the deadliest terrorist groups in the world. Since
2009, it has engaged with the Nigerian state in a lethal terrorism
campaign aimed at toppling the secular structure and replacing it with
an Islamist state. By May 2014 over 12,000 Nigerians had been killed in
the insurgency,28 while one in five persons from Borno, Yobe and Adamawa
states had been internally displaced. According to the 2017 Global
Terrorism Index, Boko Haram ranks as the second deadliest terrorist
group in the world, with an all-time high death toll of over 6000 in
2014 alone.29

[With known ties to al-Qaeda, Boko Haram has an estimated annual income
in excess of US\$25 million]{.underline}.30 By 2017, Boko Haram had been
forced to retreat from the large areas it had previously occupied in the
north-east of Nigeria, driven back by the joint international military
efforts of several countries in West and Central Africa. This created
the need for them to reassert themselves. The likelihood of this group
re-strategising and reconsolidating is high. Consequently, their
[acquisition of]{.underline} fissile material for the development and
deployment of radiological '[dirty bombs']{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline} in probability. The [availability of this
material]{.underline} on the continent and [within]{.underline} Nigeria
itself [presents **ominous opportunities**]{.underline} for the group.
Apart from large deposits of uranium ore found [in Africa]{.underline},
several countries including South Africa, Morocco, Libya, Ghana, Egypt,
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria itself presently
possess nuclear research reactors.31

The IAEA has reported no less than 12 incidents of natural uranium
smuggling between 1995 and 2005 in Africa alone. In fact, illegal
uranium mining at the Shinkolobwe mine in Katanga, DRC is presently a
source of great concern. More importantly, this is where the source
material for the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs was obtained.32 The
proliferation of fissile material across the continent heightens the
possibility of non-state actors like Boko Haram gaining access to it.
Although there has only been one recorded theft of eight uranium fuel
rods from a Kinshasa research reactor in 1997, the disturbing fact about
this is that seven of the rods were never recovered.33

Within Nigeria itself, opportunities abound for terrorist groups like
Boko Haram and other militant organisations to obtain fissile material
for use in nuclear devices or dirty bombs. In 2004, Nigeria commissioned
a 30-kW miniature neutron source reactor (NIRR-1) for the purpose of
nuclear energy research.34 This nuclear facility is located at the
Centre for Energy Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria
in the north of the country, where terrorist activities and Islamist
extremism have been going on for centuries. The possibility of Islamist
extremists infiltrating nuclear facilities and smuggling out fissile
material has been an ongoing security concern for a number of years. An
outright attack on a lightly secured facility is a second possibility
that actually played out in 2007, when a nuclear research facility in
Pelindaba, South Africa was raided by armed assailants, who breached its
security perimeter and gained entry.35 Another concern is unsecured
radioactive waste -- namely 234 legacy sources presently located at the
Ajaokuta Steel Company in Kogi State -- that has not been disposed of
and could easily be obtained by Boko Haram.36 To complicate matters
further, the construction of a low to medium radioactive waste
management facility at Nigeria's Nuclear Technology Centre has been
abandoned.37

Can Boko Haram build and use non-conventional weapons?

The poor state of nuclear security combined with the tenacity of Boko
Haram makes Nigeria a prime location for the advent of nuclear
terrorism. Knowhow on building a nuclear device is widely available, as
is the key component, HEU, which can be found all over the world in
dozens of military and civilian nuclear facilities -- like the one at
Ahmadu Bello University. Once Boko Haram has obtained enough HEU, a
choice can be made between two types of nuclear device. The first is the
gun-type mechanism, in which the HEU is smashed together to produce an
explosion. The second type, which is more advanced, requires a chamber
in which the HEU is compressed in a highly symmetrical manner in order
to create an implosion. The gun-type mechanism is the more likely option
for terrorist groups because it is simpler.38

In order to use the gun-type mechanism to activate a nuclear device,
Boko Haram operatives would need to assemble a crude cannon that can
smash HEU together -- and the more highly enriched the uranium, the less
advanced the weaponry that is needed. The viability of any terrorist
group accomplishing such a task has been tested by US senator Joe Biden.
In 2004 he asked scientists at three national laboratories to see if
they could assemble the mechanical components of a gun-type bomb with
commercially available equipment alone. A few months later, they
reported back that they had succeeded.39 With over US\$25 million in
annual income, Boko Haram has the resources to obtain both the
scientific knowhow and the materials needed to build and deploy a
gun-type nuclear weapon.

Radiological dirty bombs

The threat of non-conventional weapons proliferation and terrorism goes
beyond nuclear weapons -- it also encompasses radiological dirty bombs.
The raw materials used to create nuclear weapons are very dangerous;
they contain highly radioactive substances that would pose a serious
health hazard if dispersed in human populations using a detonation
device. Plutonium and uranium could thus be weaponised in the form of a
radiological dirty bomb, also known as a radiological dispersal device
(RDD), which would cause widespread fatalities and cost billions of
dollars in clean-up, evacuation and relocation operations.40

Terrorist groups like Boko Haram could easily build and use an RDD,
given the widespread proliferation of fissile material -- and more
importantly given the dual-use materials that can produce the same
radiological effects as fissile material from nuclear installations.
Radiological dual-use materials from smoke alarms and medical services
are among the most easily accessible; highly radioactive isotopes are in
fact used in life-saving blood transfusions and cancer treatments in
hospitals all around the world, including several in Nigeria. These
isotopes include cesium-137, cobalt-60 and iridium-192, which can easily
be used as base materials for a bomb or an RDD.41 The challenge is that
most of the medical, commercial and industrial groups that handle these
materials are not adequately equipped to provide the security needed to
prevent them from being stolen. On the other hand, the lack of
regulatory controls in many countries has led to thousands of instances
of missing or stolen radiological material that cannot be accounted for.
Recently, the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies found in
an alarming study that 170 incidents where nuclear or radiological
material was lost, stolen or outside regulatory control occurred in 2014
alone.42

RDDs are viable weapons for terrorist groups like Boko Haram to pursue
-- and terrorist states have also attempted to obtain them. On 28 March
2002, Abu Zubaydah -- a key al-Qaeda operative -- was captured in
Pakistan. He is widely believed to have told US investigators that
al-Qaeda was 'interested' in building or obtaining a dirty bomb. Further
evidence emerged on 8 May 2002, when Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) agents arrested Abdullah al Muhajir on charges of planning a
radiological attack in the US at the direction of al-Qaeda operatives.

States that sponsor and support terrorist groups are likely to pass on
fissile and radiological material to them. Iraq under Saddam Hussein is
known to have sought radiological material for this purpose. In 1987,
Iraq tested a bomb weighing 1400 kg that carried radioactive particles
derived from irradiated impurities in zirconium oxide. A further 100
prototypes were designed from the casings of Muthanna-3 aerial chemical
bombs, which were then modified to a 400-kg weight so that aircraft
could carry more of them. It is likely that only 25 of these prototypes
were destroyed, and that the other 75 were sent to the Al Qa Qaa State
Establishment, a massive Iraqi weapons facility; their current status
and whereabouts remain unknown.43

Chemical and biological weapons

The most commonly used non-conventional weapons are chemical or
biological in nature. The long history of chemical and biological
weapons usage dates as far back as 600 BC when, during a siege, Solon of
Athens poisoned the drinking water of the city of Kirrha.44 More
recently -- starting with the use of mustard gas during the First World
War -- nations have acquired chemical and biological weapons easily,
deploying them against enemies and their own citizens alike. For
terrorist groups like Boko Haram, chemical and biological weapons are
uniquely suited to their agenda and as such present very attractive
alternatives to nuclear; they are extremely difficult to detect, cost
effective and easy to deploy. Aerosols of biological agents are
invisible to the naked eye, silent, odourless, tasteless and relatively
easily dispersed. Most importantly they are 600 to 2000 times cheaper
than other WMDs. Recent estimates place the cost of biological weapons
at about 0.05% of the cost of a conventional weapon which could produce
similar numbers of mass casualties per square kilometre.45

The proliferation of chemical and biological weapons has proved to be
very fluid over the past century due to advancements in technology.
Production is comparatively easy via the commonplace technology that is
used in the manufacturing of antibiotics, vaccines, foods and beverages,
while delivery systems such as spray devices deployed from airplane,
boat or car are widely available. Another advantage of biological agents
is the natural lead time provided by the organism's incubation period
(three to seven days in most cases), allowing the terrorists to deploy
the agent and then escape before an investigation by law enforcement and
intelligence agencies can even begin. Furthermore, not only would the
use of an endemic infectious agent likely cause initial confusion
because of the difficulty of differentiating between a biological
warfare attack and a natural epidemic, but with some agents the
potential also exists for secondary or tertiary transmission from person
to person or via natural vectors.46

Unlike their nuclear and radiological counterparts, biological and
chemical weapons have been used for terrorism by both state and
non-state actors. The challenges faced in preventing the use of these
weapons through international control mechanisms include the increasing
availability of larger quantities of substances, ease of use and most
especially advanced technological deployment facilities that portend a
high risk factor to larger populations. Table 1 catalogues the use of
biochemical weapons in warfare and by terrorists and other groups or
individuals over the past century, offering concrete historical
precedent and empirical grounds for the potential future actions of Boko
Haram. The data shows consistent recourse to the use of these weapons,
in spite of the chemical and biological weapons conventions outlawing
them. It can be seen that from the 1970s onwards there has been an
increase in the use of biochemical weapons by religious cults and
terrorist groups in pursuit of their agendas. The rise of Boko Haram and
its ISIS affiliation could lead to a future where the use of biochemical
weapons is the norm rather than the exception.

As stated previously, the contextual scenarios in Nigeria that validate
this prognosis regarding Boko Haram's possible actions are strongly
supported by their ideological persuasions. The fact that Boko Haram
embraces a jihadist world view which endorses the use of WMDs is
strengthened not only by its affiliation to ISIS through ISWAP but also
by the similarities in its strategic modus operandi. Like ISIS, Boko
Haram both believes in the slaughter of other Muslims who are deemed to
be in cahoots with infidels, and advocates for the destruction of
civilian populations -- whether Muslim or otherwise -- that are regarded
as obstructing the advancement or creation of their caliphate.47 This
was practically demonstrated by ISIS in Syria and Iraq when they used
chemical weapons against both civilian and military populations, as
shown in Table 1.48

Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy

The central control measure for preventing nuclear terrorism is to
ensure at the international level that nuclear material does not fall
into the hands of terrorist groups like Boko Haram and other non-state
actors in the first place. This is very difficult to achieve, given the
lax security measures found at nuclear installations all over the world.
Recognising the danger, the US under the Obama administration committed
in 2010 at a nuclear security summit in Washington DC to securing all
nuclear material within four years in an effort to prevent nuclear
terrorism.49 Nigeria was a participant of this summit and is also
committed to implementing the agreements that were reached. These
attempts by the Obama administration followed up on the efforts embedded
in the landmark 1987 Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear
Material (CPPNM), which was meant to prevent nuclear material from being
obtained by terrorists. The provisions of this convention were amended
in 2005, and by 2010 the Washington summit had created the needed sense
of urgency regarding the security of fissile material.50 Negotiations
around the CPPNM started in 1979,51 and over the decades the growing
proliferation of fissile material has combined with the increase in
global terrorism to raise the profile of the issue of fissile material
security. As of 2016, a total of 93 states including Nigeria had
ratified the CPPNM, resulting in tighter security around the world at
nuclear installations and border controls.

Nigeria has been engaged for decades in international efforts to control
nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The country has ratified and
acceded to over a dozen international instruments since 1963, including
the Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board
Aircraft (1963), the CPPNM (1987), the Amendment to the CPPNM (2006) and
the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear
Terrorism (2007).52 At the level of global collective security, Nigeria
is involved in implementing the United Nations (UN) Global
Counter-Terrorism Strategy, which was adopted unanimously by the General
Assembly in Resolution 60/288.53 At the regional and subregional levels,
the counterterrorism strategies of the African Union (AU) and the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have been ratified
and are in the process of being implemented. In pursuance of effecting
these various international agreements, Nigeria has also instituted
their National Counterterrorism Strategy (NACTEST), which was revised in
2016. Presently the country is also working with the UN
Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force (CTITF) on projects designed
to build community resilience against terrorism, enhance cooperation
among law enforcement agencies and strengthen judicial institutions.54

Towards an integrated chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
(CBRN) counterterrorism protocol

[**The CBRN terrorism threat** in **Nigeria** is both **real and
present**. The country has one of the highest rates of terrorist
activities in the world]{.underline}; in fact, according to the 2016
Global Terrorism Index, [Nigeria ranked third among 163
countries]{.underline}, with a terrorism death rate of 16.8% of the
global total.55 Although attacks declined in 2017, [Nigeria still
retained third place on the Global Terrorism Index]{.underline}.56
Recently, Boko Haram has initiated a comeback that has seen renewed
attacks and the abduction of more girls from schools in the north-east
of the country. Security forces have continued to engage the group on
the frontlines in their forest bases; with the assistance of local and
international joint task forces, much of the conflict has been shifted
to more remote areas in the north-east. Although the government security
forces have gained the upper hand in their frontal clashes with Boko
Haram forces, by January 2018 the group had successfully carried out
several brutal assaults, including one on UN and Doctors Without Borders
staff, shifting their strategy back to traditional hit-and-run guerrilla
tactics. During Easter of the same year, a single attack utilising 5
suicide bombers resulted in over 29 dead and 84 wounded.57

The likelihood that Boko Haram may begin to use CBRN weapons is
increasing, and biological and chemical terrorism is potentially more
difficult to prevent than conventional terrorist attacks. Since the
latter part of the twentieth century, the Internet has contributed to
the spread of chemical and biological weapons knowhow, thereby
increasing the likelihood of Boko Haram being able to obtain not only
the ingredients needed to create biochemical weapons but also the
information needed to build and successfully deploy them. Some of the
base materials for such weapons even occur naturally, like castor beans,
which can be processed to produce the dangerous toxin ricin and deployed
against unsuspecting populations. Furthermore, live strains of very
dangerous viruses like Ebola can be found in high-tech research labs,
like those at the African Centre of Excellence for Genomics and
Infectious Diseases (ACEGID) at the Redeemer's University Ede in Osun
State. If Boko Haram were to secure this virus and weaponise it, the age
of biowarfare would arrive in Nigeria -- with deadly consequences. More
importantly, the materials that are needed to create most chemical
weapons exist in large quantities as dual-use materials that can be
purchased on the open market and ferried into the country via forged
end-user certificates.

The chemical and biological weapons conventions represent control
structures geared towards the containment of these non-conventional
weapons, and to a large extent state signatories like Nigeria have
implemented a good level of the instruments contained in them; however,
some nations still maintain secret stockpiles and have used them in
recent conflicts, like Iraq against Iran and Kurdish dissidents in the
1980s and 1990s, and the Syrian government, which is presently using
them against its civilian population.

On the whole, the counterterrorism measures put in place to deal with
the aftermath of a chemical or biological attack have gained more
credibility in the international community. Although there is no
dedicated international inter-agency mechanism for coordinating the
response to terrorism involving the release of toxic chemicals or
biological agents, there are mechanisms that have evolved in the context
of humanitarian assistance and emergency response after natural
catastrophes, such as earthquakes; these include the Global Outbreak
Alert and Response Network (GOARN), the World Health Organization (WHO),
the Global Early Warning System (GLEWS), the Global Framework for the
Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TAD) and the
International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN). The primary
inter-agency mechanism that coordinates responses to emergencies
involving the agencies mentioned above is the UN Disaster Assessment and
Coordination (UNDAC).58 To further strengthen inter-agency coordination
in the wake of a terrorist attack of catastrophic proportions, the UN
CTITF is also focusing on planning for such an eventuality.

At the local level, several key aspects of Nigeria's NACTEST are
presently being utilised. The strategy is divided into five work
streams:

- Forestall: Prevent terrorism in Nigeria by engaging the public through
  sustained enlightenment and sensitisation campaigns and
  deradicalisation programmes.

- Secure: Ensure the protection of life, property and key national
  infrastructure and public services, including Nigerian interests
  around the world.

- Identify: Ensure that all terrorist acts are properly investigated,
  and that terrorists and their sponsors are brought to justice.

- Prepare: Prepare the populace so that the consequences of terrorist
  incidents can be mitigated.

- Implement: Devise a framework to effectively mobilise and sustain a
  coordinated, cross-governmental, population-centred effort.59

Presently, the first three aspects of these work streams are receiving
full attention. However, in regard to WMDs, the counterterrorism
strategy is lacking a well-integrated CBRN protocol for engaging with
the work streams for preparation and implementation. Nigeria currently
handles issues relating to nuclear and radiological matters through two
institutions: the Nigerian Atomic Energy Agency (NAEC) and the Nigerian
Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA). It is therefore expected that,
given the growing CBRN threat level in the country, these agencies will
collaborate with the Office of the Security Adviser to the President in
order to initiate a proper CBRN counterterrorism protocol.

The NACTEST does not currently include a dedicated protocol for handling
CBRN threats; Nigeria is however involved in nuclear security at the
international level, which has primarily provided for capacity-building
and human resources development. Activities in these areas include the
gradual process of converting the miniature neutron source reactor in
Zaria from using HEU to low enriched uranium (LEU), partnerships for
nuclear and radiological security with the US Department of Defence
(DoD) and the IAEA, establishing a nuclear security support centre in
the country, reviewing the 2012 design basis threat (DBT) for protecting
nuclear and radiological material, the development of a programme for
locating and securing orphan legacy radioactive sources, training
security officers, the installation of a radiation portal monitor at the
Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos in 2008 and the
acquisition of three more monitors for other international airports in
the country.60

An integrated CBRN protocol would fall under the preparation and
implementation work streams of the NACTEST. The protocol should include
a strategy for detecting CBRN agents in the wake of terrorist events,
followed by disaster response and countermeasure initiatives to be
carried out by security, medical and disaster response teams. Given the
availability of advanced technology, the integrated CBRN
counterterrorism protocol should also include the deployment of handheld
radiological and biochemical detectors to high-risk areas, and security
forces and disaster response teams should be trained in their usage.
Embedding a standard protocol in the NACTEST on how to prepare for and
respond to CBRN events is essential for repositioning counterterrorist
activities in the country to meet the present threat level. The US and
Canada along with the UK and most other European countries facing CBRN
threats have already repositioned accordingly in order to accommodate
this new reality.

Conclusion

[Any terrorist attack involving WMDs is the **ultimate nightmare
scenario**]{.underline}. Fortunately, at least some of these potential
attacks are preventable. If and when the nuclear security summit
achieves its goals, the possibility of a nuclear terrorist attack in
Nigeria will be immensely reduced. Unfortunately, the likelihood of
radiological, chemical and biological attacks is more difficult to
regress, making it all the more vital to integrate a CBRN protocol into
Nigeria's counterterrorism strategy.

[Preventing such a tragic event]{.underline} from occurring [will
require very close ongoing monitoring]{.underline} of the strategic
manoeuvrings of Boko Haram. From its inception to the present day, the
organisation has depended on the looting of military armouries to source
most of its heavy weapons and equipment. It has built up an impressive
arsenal in this manner and there is no indication that the group will
stop using this highly profitable strategy, which could be further
employed to obtain advanced CBRN weaponry from facilities that are
vulnerable to being raided. The civilian facilities mentioned in this
paper are at high risk of being targeted in this fashion; hence, the
recalibration of Nigeria's CBRN counterterrorism protocols should
include a security framework that provides military security for
facilities like the ACEGID in Osun State and the Centre for Energy
Research and Training at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria. Lastly, although
the IAEA has assisted in the conversion of Nigeria's reactor from HEU to
LEU,61 the availability of fissile material at the facility means that
the risk of radioactive dirty bombs being created from looted material
is still present.

This pessimism stems from the unavoidable transition of capitalism from
its expanding form to a stationary one under severe scarcity of
resources, as "whether we are unable to sustain growth or unable to

will inevitably rise when scarcity-propelled stationary or even
slow-growing capitalism renders infeasible the usual method of appeasing

scarcity**, if individuals are allowed to pursue their **self-interest**
"**unrestrained** by a **common authority**," the result is **bound** to
be **"common environmental ruin"**]{.underline} (1977: 151).
Accordingly:

> [the **individualistic** basis of society, the concept of inalienable
> **rights**, the purely **self-defined** pursuit of happiness, liberty
> as **maximum freedom of action**, and **laissez faire itself** all
> become **problematic**, requiring]{.underline} major modification or
> perhaps even [**abandonment** if we wish to avert **inexorable
> environmental degradation** and eventual **extinction as a
> civilization**]{.underline}. (1977: 152)

To him, [the **only solution** is "a sufficient measure of
**coercion**;" and "**democracy** as we know it **cannot conceivably
survive**"]{.underline} (1977: 151--2).

In the same vein, Ophuls and Boyan (1992) talked about the crucial role
that "ecological mandarins" must play under resource scarcity.
Concurring with Robert Dahl'spoint that "a reasonable man will want the
most competent people to have authority over the matters on which they
are most competent" (Dahl, 1970: 58), Ophuls and Boyan emphasized that
"under certain circumstances [democracy *must* give way to **elite
rule**]{.underline}," and "the more closely one's situation resembles a
perilous sea voyage, the stronger the rationale for placing power and
authority in the hands of the few who know how to run the ship" (Ophuls
and Boyan, 1992: 209, original emphasis). Given that ecology is esoteric
and that only those with talents and training are qualified as
specialists, "a class of ecological mandarins who possess the esoteric
knowledge" is required to run the "ecologically complex steady-state
society" well. [Such a society]{.underline}

[The doubt about the ability of democracy to handle climate challenges
is **palpable**]{.underline} from the intellectual Left as well. Eric
Hobsbawm offered a threefold explanation for his pessimism. To begin
with, [many]{.underline} of the [strategies needed to avoid climate
change would be **extremely unpopular** and]{.underline} therefore
[**difficult to implement** in a democracy. As a result, even as "the
**impact**]{.underline} of human action on nature and the globe [has
become a **force**]{.underline} of geological proportions," "[no support
will be found by **counting votes**" for measures **required** for
**mitigating** these problems]{.underline}. Moreover, given that nature
is border-blind, [even if voters of **some** democratic states were
sensible, the political mechanisms available]{.underline} to human kind
in the 21th century [are "effectively **confined within**]{.underline}
the **[borders]{.underline}** of nation-states" [and **"dramatically
ill-suited"** to deal with problems lying **beyond** their range of
operation]{.underline} (2007: 113). Finally, democratic national
governments are not the only relevant organizational entities that can
have an effect on an increasingly globalized and transnational world. "A
growing part of human life now occurs beyond the influence of voters, in
transnational public and private entities that have no electorates, or
at least no democratic ones." Thus, "[\[d\]emocracy]{.underline},
however desirable, [is **not an effective device** for solving
**global** or **transnational** problems]{.underline}"(2007: 118).

This wave of academic literature that questions the compatibility of
democracy with timely and effective climate mitigation resonates with
works dating back to the 1970s that focused on the role of democracy in
environmental conservation. In An Inquiry into the Human Prospect,
Heilbroner set to answer, in a world plagued by problems such as rapid
environmental degradation, "is there hope for man?" Writing in 1974, he
highlighted that:

> [the amount of CO2]{.underline} in the air [is expected to
> **double**]{.underline} by the year 2020... [sufficient to raise
> surface temperatures on earth by]{.underline} some 1.5o to [3.0o ...

> [Florida]{.underline}. Long before that it is feared that the rise in
> temperature would have irreversibly altered rainfall patterns, [with
> **grave potential effects**]{.underline}. (1980 \[1974\]: 72)

With the approaching of the depletion of natural resources, Heilbroner
expressed deep doubt about the ability of the democratic form of
government in ensuring the survival of \[hu\]mankind.

[Climate change's negative impact on humans is hardly something up for
questioning]{.underline}. The World Health Organization believes that
between 2030 and 2050 [the effects of climate change will
be]{.underline} an additional of **[250 000 deaths every
year]{.underline}**; due to diarrhoea, malaria, heat stress and
malnutrition.1 Accordingly, [we can expect **millions** of deaths to
occur, and]{.underline} the [increased frequency of]{.underline} natural
[disasters will push the expected death toll **even
further**]{.underline}. Additionally, [the rising sea levels,
and]{.underline} other [environmental consequences, will cause an
**unprecedented flow** of **climate refugees**]{.underline} towards
areas that still are unaffected by the change. If we thought the impact
was huge from the people fleeing the Syrian civil war, or the present
corona pandemic, we should expect the climate disaster to be countless
times larger. [The pressure on **societies**]{.underline} and
intergovernmental organisations [will become **tremendous**,
and]{.underline} we would be naïve if we did not expect this pressure to
[create **additional** suffering and death]{.underline}. What is then
the cause of [climate change]{.underline}? It [is the result of
**anthropogenic acts**]{.underline}, i.e., it is our current way of
living that is causing the heating of the planet. Like a greenhouse, our
planet is becoming hotter by the way that carbon dioxide traps more heat
in the atmosphere, and by consequent increase the global average
temperature. Additionally, [it sets off other **reactions** that add
**positive feedback** to the warming]{.underline}, e.g., creation of
water vapour or the reduction of ice caps.

Now, this paper does not intend to demonstrate the truth of these
claims, and if the reader is still sceptical about climate change, and
its anthropogenic cause, numerous [sources]{.underline} can justify and
explain these facts better, for instance, rapports [from
**IPCC**]{.underline}. 2 Accordingly, I will [assume these facts to be
true, and that climate change will cause]{.underline} a state of affairs
that contains a great deal of suffering and death; besides the
possibility of [**civilisational destruction** or **human
extinction**]{.underline}. Thus, the circumstances are dire. So, let us
summarise these detrimental effects into a single claim. Here it is:

> State Of Affairs No Reduction: A state of affairs where climate change
> causes tens of millions of deaths, countless instances of additional
> human suffering, and the possibility of causing a collapse of human
> life as we know it.

This is what I will take as the effect of doing nothing to halt climate
change. This then begs the question: If our current behaviour has such
terrible consequences, why have we not implemented policies that prevent
climate change?

1.2 What is the nature of the problem?

There are two ways to answer this question: we can give a historical
description of how the issue has been misconstrued by interests that
have a lot to gain from the status quo or, that we are dealing with a
special type of problem that is particularly difficult for us to
confront.3 In this paper I will only deal with the second dimension.
Additionally, we can divide this dimension into two groups: first, we
can describe how humans, by their very nature, are poorly endowed to
deal with such problems as climate change, secondly, that the problem of
climate change is what sociologists call a "wicked problem". I will
discuss the first aspect later on when describing psychological
barriers. Now, I want to address characterising climate change as a
wicked problem.

During the ozone depletion, discovered in the late seventies, the
world's states quickly came together and implemented the Wien protocol
in 1985; a protocol that set down some policies for protecting the ozone
layer. Subsequently, in 1987 the Montreal Protocol was implemented, that
resulted in the complete removal of the chemical substances that created
the ozone depletion.4 Why have we not seen the same collective action
towards climate change? Well, first, we must clarify that in the case of
the ozone depletion, the solution was much easier to implement; it took
the removal of a few ozone-depleting substances. However, solving the
problem of climate change is much more wicked (supposedly) and is said
to fall under a specific type of problem posited by Horst Rittel in the
late 1960s; wicked problems.5 These are deep problems that do not
present you with a clear solution. Now, my initial definition of the
problem seems to fly against this deepness, i.e., I have claimed there
is a clear solution. However, those that see it as a wicked problem
would contend that my definition is only one way to conceptualise the
problem, and that there is a spectrum of definitions that seem more or
less correct. What does this mean? Dale Jameison describes this well:

> "There are many different ways of conceptualising the problem of
> climate change, each of which finds different resources relevant to
> its solution and counts different response as success and failures. If
> the problem is fundamentally one of global governance, then new
> agreements and institutions are what are needed. If the problem is
> market failure, then carbon taxes or a cap and trade system is what is
> required. If the problem is primarily a technological failure, then we
> need an Apollo program for clean energy or perhaps geoengineering. If
> climate change is just the latest way for the global rich to exploit
> the global poor, then the time has come for a global struggle for
> justice. This problem of multiple frames is characteristic of what are
> called "wicked problems." And wicked problems are extremely difficult
> for political systems to address successfully."6

I understand the appeal to find all these different ways to
conceptualise the problem of climate change. However, I do believe we
are doing ourselves a disfavour if we explain the lack of action in
preventing climate change, and by consequent justify this inaction, by
appealing to this problem of multiple frames. We should ask why it is of
benefit to consider all these multiple frames when trying to stop
climate change? I take it that the answer to this is our desire for
finding the most accurate conceptualisation of the problem so that we
can implement the most optimal solution. I believe this is wrong. At its
core, we know the solution to the problem (reduce greenhouse gases) and
we should accept the risk that we will implement a sub-optimal solution.
Waiting around for the most accurate conceptualisation of the problem is
counterintuitive, especially when we contemplate the risk it entails.
The goal should not be too solve this problem of multiple frames by, for
instance, taking steps to secure a unanimous acceptance of some
particular framing of the problem, and by consequent enact the most
optimal solution to climate change. Setting this as our aim is just to
promote even more inaction; we need to accept a sub-optimal solution. I
believe this desire to find the optimal solution which does not entail
people having to accept a reduction in their current standard (no one
gets elected by promising to reduce economic growth and causing other
detrimental effects on their electorate) better explains our inaction
then characterising climate change as a wicked problem. As Broome
writes: "the economics and politics of climate change has concentrated
on finding the best solution to the problem of climate change."7 Meaning
that we are looking for a solution without sacrifice --- and by
consequent choose business as usual.

Nevertheless, I believe we should not put too much importance on the
wickedness of the problem. We know what it takes, and our technological
achievements are well-equipped to deal with the problem (since it also
has created the problem). Implementing some policies that reduce
greenhouse gases is better, even if they are sub-optimal, then
postponing taking any preventive measures.

Nevertheless, before closing this section, [there is one]{.underline}
more [aspect of the problem of climate change that we ought to face; the
need for **immediate action**. This aspect is of **high
importance**]{.underline}, and we should not take it lightly; even
though it fills a short space in this paper. Climate change has been
going on for a long time, and [year by year we increase the yearly
outpour of **g**reen**h**ouse **g**ases into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, e.g., the last year (2019) we increase the
outpour even more.8 Additionally, [we are taking a risk when we do not
know what **positive feedback** we are potentially setting off by not
reducing the outpour. Accordingly]{.underline}, we need to accept the
fact that the problem of [climate change has the character of
**demanding** our **immediate action**]{.underline}.

1.3 Clarifications

Before turning to the argumentation for this paper's thesis, some
clarifications are necessary. One of these is the role of "political
authority". When I argue that we have good reasons to prefer an
epistocracy, I am arguing that we ought to accept the epistocratic
method as the political authority and that this authority is legitimate,
i.e., it has some moral justification for establishing a normative
relation between it (political authority) and the subjects. There are
several conceptual accounts of "political authority", and I will use the
right to rule account. This account portrays a more morally robust
account of the relation between an authority and a subject. It
essentially describes a kind of ideal political community where a deeper
moral connection is present. 9 I believe this is what we think of when
trying to evaluate the legitimacy that a political system, as in a
state, have in coercing a population, and the subjects have a moral duty
to obey the authority. This will be the conceptual definition of
political authority. It has a moral right to rule and coerce people into
obeying its political system of institutions that regulate the behaviour
of its subjects and set out the course for where the political entity is
heading, i.e., which state of affairs we realise in the future.

2\. INTRODUCING THE SOLUTION

In this section, I will demonstrate why we ought to accept The Solution
as a true normative claim, i.e., why we ought to take political action
to prevent State Of Affairs No Reduction from coming into existence.10
Here is the claim:

> [The **Solution**: Reduce the **global outpour** of greenhouse gases
> to a **level** that has an excellent chance of causing the
> **avoidance** of State Of Affairs No Reduction]{.underline}.

[One]{.underline} helpful [way to characterise the normativity of The
Solution is as a **navigational problem**. **Where** do we want our
**global society** to be **heading**?]{.underline} I believe [we can
characterise the possible directions as]{.underline} a
**[binary]{.underline}** choice [between The Solution and Not-The
Solution]{.underline}. The second option I describe as follows:

> Not-The Solution: Continue the outpour of greenhouse gases with the
> consequences that State Of Affairs No Reduction has an excellent
> chance of being actualised.

Now, [even though The Solution contains **multiple ways** to get
**implemented**, they **all** share the **same normative content** of
causing a **reduction of greenhouse gases** in the
atmosphere]{.underline}.11 Accordingly, it is [this **goal**, and how it
**dictates**]{.underline} the **[changes needed in]{.underline}** our
global **[institutions]{.underline}** that [are of]{.underline} such
**[vital importance]{.underline}**. By contrast, Not-The Solution shares
the same normative content of taking no action that will prevent State
Of Affairs No Reduction. Given this binary choice, I believe our
intuition tells us that we ought to choose The Solution. What could
speak in favour of Not-The Solution? Is there some option of Not-The
Solution that we have a better reason to prefer? Maybe someone would
contend that the uncertainty that surrounds climate change gives us good
reasons to postpone taking any action, or, that other goals are much
more important. Now, before addressing these concerns, perhaps our
intuition becomes stronger (that we ought to choose The Solution) if I
provide some scenario that could work as an intuition pump. Here is such
a scenario:

> *The Bus Ride*: So, picture, if you will, a bus that is on a direct
> course towards a large tree that will cause a great deal of suffering
> and death upon impact. Inside, the people are busy doing whatever they
> see fit, spending their time to make the bus ride as comfortable and
> meaningful as possible. However, there is a group of scientists that
> have analysed and investigated the devastating effect of this course,
> and that they need to perform some necessary action to avoid the tree.
> Perhaps they all need to drop what they are doing and give up some of
> their time jolting the bus enough so that the bus will miss the tree.

Accordingly, the world is the bus, the people on the bus is the world's
population, and the jolting of the bus is The Solution.12 I believe our
intuition tells us that we ought to perform the necessary actions in
order to prevent the bus from hitting the tree. What could possibly be
more pressing? Do we have good reasons to do something else? Is the
uncertainty of how bad the impact will be, and when it will occur, good
reasons to not start jolting the bus?

Weighing different values against each other is tricky, and there are
many scenarios where it is contentious if we should promote, for
instance, equality or liberty. Some could argue that we ought to
increase economic prosperity since it will maximise well-being for all
humans; others will argue that securing peace takes priority; social
justice; or environmental concerns. However, [**whatever we see as the**
road to the **common good** the implementation of The Solution is
**superior** in its **importance**, because it **secures** that **there
will be a ground** to put the road on. We will **certainly not** have
**social harmony** in a state of affairs where **climate disaster is
present**; the **economy will suffer** the consequences of the climatic
impact on everything from production to transfer, and we have good
reasons to believe **conflict and tension will arise** when the
situation gets worse]{.underline}.

Now, perhaps [some could say]{.underline} that [it is immoral to
demand]{.underline} that [people make sacrifices]{.underline} to reduce
greenhouse gases. I believe [this is **wrong**]{.underline}. The
implementation of The Solution will not demand a tremendous amount of
hardship for the effect world population.13 Like Peter Singer's case
where we should sacrifice our clothes in order to save a child from
drowning in a pond, we ought to sacrifice some niceties in order to save
ourselves, and future generation from State Of Affairs No Reduction.14
Accordingly, the sacrifices necessary do not entail some morally
questionable acts, i.e., reduce the level of greenhouse gases by killing
off a portion of humans. I am talking about, for example, having to
reduce flying to a necessary minimum, or, pay more in taxes so we can
develop, and build, the technology that reduces the outpour of
greenhouse gases, e.g., solar panels. Furthermore, it is [the
**affluent** world]{.underline} that will have to bear the biggest load
of these necessary sacrifices. Especially, since the cause of climate
change comes from the increased material standard enjoyed by people in
affluent countries. They [should]{.underline}, by consequent,
[accept]{.underline} the [**moral responsibility** to combat the harm
this wealth is causing, and going to cause]{.underline}. Or, put
differently, the economic prosperity that has created this wealth is the
cause of the climatic change, and the cost of emitting greenhouse gases
has been an externality unaccounted for by either the consumers or the
producers (a Pareto sub-optimal state of affairs). Additionally, it is
common-sensical that if one group have very few resources, and another
group has an abundance of resources, we should not solve a common
problem by removing the few resources from the first group. The harm
created by the amount of resources in the prosperous group should yield
a good reason for them, bearing the bigger load.

Additionally, we should also accept that since anthropogenic acts cause
State Of Affairs No Reduction, it leaves us with an additional moral
reason to implement The Solution (leaving aside just the badness of
State Of Affairs No Reduction). We bear the responsibilities of our
actions, and these actions will harm countless future human beings.15
Even if we do not bear the responsibility of stopping climate change
individually, we should not prevent our institutions from being reshaped
in a way that solves the problem of climate change. I would even
contend, if we are living in a democracy, we have a moral duty to use
our political power (vote), so we take the necessary steps to implement
something like The Solution.16 (Perhaps, this could also be interpreted
as a reason for restricting universal suffrage (the democratic process)
and justify an global epistocracy.) Possibly, in a counterfactual world
where a non-anthropogenic event will cause a similar type of harm (for
instance an impact by a meteorite), it could be argued that we have no
responsibility to prevent this event since we are not the actors that
create this event. I believe this is a weak argument for not preventing
the impact from the meteorite. However, in the case of climate change
that argumentation is not available since we are responsible for it.

One final thing is that The Solution is hardly a discriminatory or
biased policy. Certainly, different groups will be affected
differentially by the policy, and, as have been said, the affluent part
of the world should bear the biggest load. However, the policy itself
places no higher importance on any person or group. Satisfying, what
Vandamme calls, a quality of (substantive) impartiality: "understood in
a moral and substantive sense, as a property of public policies and of a
political order, can be simply defined as not favouring some groups or
individuals over others for morally arbitrary reasons."17

2.1 Uncertainty of Climate Change

What then about uncertainty and the effect it has on the normativity of
The Solution? Perhaps, [someone would argue that since there is still
**uncertainty**]{.underline} in the range of negative impact that
climate change will have, and the lack of knowledge when things will
start to get truly harmful, [we can delay making any decision until the
facts are in]{.underline}. I believe [this is **wrong**]{.underline}. As
Broome writes: "If you can costlessly delay a decision till all the
information is in, you should delay it. But [when **delay itself** is
risky, it is not a sensible remark]{.underline}."18 [Choosing Not-The
Solution and thus **gamble** in the hope that it will not have the
consequence of suffering and death]{.underline} in order to avoid making
a sub-optimal decision, that in hindsight is evaluated as unnecessary
[is]{.underline}, I believe, [immoral and irrational]{.underline}.19
Accordingly, [in the same way]{.underline} that [it is rational to
invest in a fire extinguisher]{.underline}, in case a fire starts in
your house, [it is rational to invest in]{.underline} the [removal of
the possibility of a climate disaster]{.underline} in the future. Why is
this? I believe that Expected Value Theory is a good guide to adopt when
facing uncertainty. Broome summarises this theory nicely:

> "When the quantitative outcome of some process is uncertain, the
> expectation of the outcome is calculated as follows. Take each of the
> possible values of the outcome and multiply each by the probability of
> its occurring. Add up all of these products. The sum is the
> expectation. It is just a weighted average outcome, where the weights
> are the probabilities."20

Even if it is a very small probability that climate change will have
civilisational ending results, the great badness that this state of
affairs constitutes should warrant our immediate action to avoid this
scenario. Perhaps, there could be a case for not implementing The
Solution if it would demand a large number of sacrifices, and by
delaying this implementation we could remove additional uncertainty. For
instance, what if people in The Bus Ride had to kill fifty per cent of
the passengers, by throwing them off the bus, in order to avoid the
tree. Certainly, given this tremendous sacrifice an argument could be
had why we should delay implementing necessary precautions. However,
even though the aggregation, of the small sacrifices every individual
has to make, could become large, it does not constitute this tremendous
sacrifice in The Bus Ride. The small sacrifices everyone have to make is
easily overshadowed by the badness of State Of Affairs No Reduction.
Accordingly, I still take it that we have better reasons to prefer The
Solution than Not-The Solution even though climate change will always be
immersed in uncertainty. We only have one opportunity to run this
experiment, so we should not gamble with the outcome.

Nevertheless, I will not try and persuade the reader more of the badness
of State Of Affairs No Reduction and that we ought to implement the
Solution. Possibly, the discussion of the next section will bear some
support for the accuracy of The Solution.

3\. THE ANSWER

What we then must ask ourselves is: Which process for collective
decision-making do we have reasons to believe will successfully
implement The Solution? We could start with an unhelpful answer: The
method that has the best chance to implement The Solution. Which method
is this then? Here we get to the core of this paper's thesis. I will
call the answer to this question simply: The Answer. Here it is:

> The Answer: [Given that we ought to implement The
> Solution]{.underline}, and by consequent avoid State Of Affairs No
> Reduction, [we have **better reasons** to prefer some form of global
> **epistocracy**, than a global **democracy**]{.underline}.

#### It's the [only]{.underline} existential risk

https://www.the-trouble.com/content/2019/1/4/deathly-salvation

A devastating fact of climate collapse is that there may be a silver
lining to the mushroom cloud. First, it should be noted that a [nuclear
exchange does not inevitably result in apocalyptic loss of life. Nuclear
winter]{.underline}---the idea that firestorms would make the earth
uninhabitable---[is based on shaky science. There's no reliable model
that can determine how many megatons would decimate **ag**riculture or
make humans extinct. Nations have already detonated 2,476 nuclear
devices]{.underline}.

An exchange that shuts down the global economy but stops short of human
extinction may be the only blade realistically likely to cut the carbon
knot we're trapped within. It would decimate existing infrastructures,
providing an opportunity to build new energy infrastructure and
intervene in the current investments and subsidies keeping fossil fuels
alive.

In the near term, emissions would almost certainly rise as militaries
are some of the world's largest emitters. Given what we know of human
history, though, conflict may be the only way to build the mass social
cohesion necessary for undertaking the kind of huge, collective action
needed for global sequestration and energy transition. Like the 20th
century's world wars, a nuclear exchange could serve as an economic
leveler. It could provide justification for nationalizing energy
industries with the interest of shuttering fossil fuel plants and
transitioning to renewables and, uh, nuclear energy. It could shock us
into reimagining a less suicidal civilization, one that dethrones the
death-cult zealots who are currently in power. And it may toss
particulates into the atmosphere sufficient to block out some of the
solar heat helping to drive global warming. Or it may have the opposite
effects. Who knows?

What we do know is that [humans can **survive** and **recover** from
war, probably **even a nuclear one**. Humans can**not** recover from
runaway **climate** change. **Nuclear war is not an inevitable
extinction event**; six degrees of **warming is**]{.underline}.

differently from the administrative military?

[Despite the DoD\'s size, budget, and idiosyncratic mission,
administrative law scholarship has \"generally **passed over** the study
of the **military**]{.underline} in favor of the domestic agencies.\"
296Indeed, [**very little legal scholarship** has **addressed** the
**APA\'s applicability** to the **DoD**]{.underline} (despite its status
as the largest federal agency). 297

The [APA]{.underline} (passed in 1946, just one year before the National
Security Act) [provides for **judicial review** over **agency actions**
and sets out **procedures** that agencies must follow when
**promulgating rules** and adjudicating **conflicts**.]{.underline}
298The APA has been described as a \"mini-Constitution\" and widely
praised as a mechanism to help ensure democratic accountability and
oversight over federal agencies. 299But the [[APA]{.underline}]{.mark}
was designed for a far different time and [[does not]{.mark} adequately
[take into account]{.mark}]{.underline}: (1) [the DoD\'s
**[existing]{.mark} legal [architecture]{.mark}** and **two-military
divide**]{.underline}; and (2) [the [**complexity** of]{.mark} **modern
military [operations]{.mark}** to include the numerous military
activities that take place **[overseas outside of war]{.mark}**. The APA
was better suited to regulate military activities, but [it **has not
kept pace** with changes to]{.mark} the massive **[military]{.mark}
organization** and the nature of modern warfare. This [results
in]{.mark} a [**disconnect** between]{.mark} the **APA\'s
[text]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} its **ongoing [applicability]{.mark}** to
the modern **military** organization]{.underline}.

CHALLENGING CIVIL-MILITARY LEGACY,"

dml)

To be sure, the new [Biden]{.underline} team will not be a carbon copy
of the Obama team and even those that return will do so with new
perspective and their own lessons learned in the interval. However, they
[would be wise to recognize that a [**rapid shift** in
leadership]{.mark} styles now may [create]{.mark} a sort of
**[civil-military whiplash]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} team almost certainly [[will
**want**]{.mark} to]{.underline} reestablish processes that [provide
[**greater civilian direction** for war plans]{.mark}, budgeting, and
global priorities.]{.underline} [[After]{.mark} four years of **relative
[autonomy]{.mark}** [for the Joint Staff]{.mark}]{.underline} and
combatant commands, combined with reduced daily civilian oversight due
to under-filled political positions in the Pentagon, [[a
**micromanagement narrative**]{.mark} could almost [write
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Biden and his team will [need to]{.mark}
be **attuned** to these dynamics and look for early opportunities to
**[establish trust]{.mark}** and **clarify their expectations** about
the civil-military relationship while also [providing]{.mark} senior
military [officers a **real voice** in]{.mark} the [policy]{.mark}
process that [makes them]{.mark} feel [**respected** and
**heard**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Institutional Context

[Biden's team will have to manage these challenges with a toolbox that
is under **severe fiscal constraint** and with [military leaders]{.mark}
who already [believe they are **strapped thin**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Trump did manage to increase defense spending trends and slightly
decrease the number of American military personnel deployed abroad,
resulting in a meaningful reinvestment in defense capabilities and a
moderate decrease in operational tempo. But [future [defense budgets
will be under]{.mark} **severe [pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, perhaps
rivaling in the aggregate the kinds of cuts imposed by the Budget
Control Act, [though [hopefully with **more flexibility**]{.mark} and
**predictability** to manage them]{.underline} in more sensible ways
than the threat of a sequester straitjacket permitted. Moreover, the
decline in foreign deployments was matched, and in some cases exceeded,
by a decline in "permanent" foreign basing. The result is that the
strains of military deployments on military personnel and their families
are as great as in earlier periods, when a larger number and a greater
scale of deployments were supported by more robust foreign basing
infrastructure. To pick just one example: A shorter NATO rotation to
Germany or Poland without family accompanying (and without combat pay as
a sweetener) could impose more strain on morale than a longer rotation
with family. There are few signs that civilian and military leaders
fully understand these challenges or that they are willing to make
difficult tradeoffs.

In the meantime, the last four years have seen a failure to make the
needed investments in the other tools of statecraft, particularly
diplomacy and development. While morale in the foreign policy and
national security ranks will likely improve, at least initially, with
the return of something resembling establishment values, the damage
caused by deferred or dysfunctional approaches to human capital will
hobble the Biden team for some time to come and will, in particular,
make it hard to quickly rebuild the capacity of civilian services to
match advances in the uniformed ranks --- especially in the face of the
prolonged resource fights to come. The Trump team was especially
vigorous in burrowing in some of its most partisan and suspect
appointments into civil service positions and on bipartisan boards
within the national security establishment. [An early challenge for the
Biden team will be deciding]{.underline} --- likely [on a **case-by-case
basis**]{.underline} --- whether [the restoration of the
"**above-partisan-politics**" norm]{.underline} in these areas requires
engaging in the seemingly partisan practice of cleaning house, or
whether the norm would be made stronger through greater forbearance.
None of these choices will be straightforward.

In terms of the institutional environment, [legislative changes and four
years of weak civilian control mean that Biden will face a **much
stronger**]{.underline} chairman of the **[Joint Chiefs]{.underline}**
and associated Joint Staff than he faced barely four years ago. The 2017
National Defense Authorization Act granted the chairman additional
responsibilities for global integration, technically expanding only his
advisory role. In practice, these powers have become more expansive,
with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff taking on some roles that
traditionally had fallen to the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
Trump administration officials also changed some of the procedures for
war plan reviews and political guidance, reducing the number of
interactions between military leaders and mid-level political appointees
that previously had provided the civilian Office of the Secretary of
Defense more opportunities to play an active oversight role.
[Trump's]{.underline} unorthodox and tumultuous personnel
[policies]{.underline} also [**shifted practical authority** to the
Joint Staff]{.underline}. Long nomination delays and unfilled civilian
posts resulting from Trump administration infighting weakened that
office further, leaving Mattis and his successors more beholden to the
advice and influence of the better-staffed and more efficient Joint
Staff. Trump's first chairman, Gen. Joe Dunford, enjoyed an unusually
close and trusting relationship with Mattis, whom Dunford had served
under as a marine. A similar dynamic also existed between Milley and
Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who had led the Army as chief of staff
and secretary, respectively, during the early days of the Trump
administration.

The appointment of Austin risks exacerbating this unbalance, unless he
takes pains to develop and empower a capable team of civilians in his
immediate office and within the larger Office of the Secretary of
Defense --- a point that has already been emphasized. The initial signs
on this front are encouraging. The announcement that the Biden
administration will nominate Kathleen Hicks as the first female deputy
secretary of defense and Colin Kahl as the undersecretary of defense for
policy ensure that strong, experienced civilian leaders who take
civil-military issues seriously will hold key roles in the Pentagon
assuming the Senate confirms their appointments, as we fully expect. The
unofficial reports that Austin will pick Kelly Magsamen as his chief of
staff, likewise puts a well-connected civilian with political experience
in a key position. We both know all these individuals well, and one of
us has worked for Hicks (who oversaw Golby's work on the "Thank You for
Your Service" podcast) and Kahl (who was Golby's direct supervisor on
Vice President Biden's national security staff).

Even with these capable selections, [the civil-military
dynamics]{.underline} awaiting the new secretary of defense and his team
in the Pentagon [will be **daunting**]{.underline}. Because of the
policy and personnel dynamics during the Trump administration, [the
[Joint Staff]{.mark}]{.underline} and the combatant commanders [[have
become accustomed to]{.mark} a **greater degree of [autonomy]{.mark}**
[and **influence**]{.mark}. Biden's political appointees]{.underline},
sitting at the head of the table and asking detailed questions, [will
**immediately cause some friction** between these groups]{.underline}.
They also will find themselves with smaller staffs, fewer resources, and
a shorter institutional memory than their military counterparts. Some of
the savviest members of the Biden team will recognize in these
challenges echoes of the challenges political appointees faced late in
the Obama years. But their intensity in combined form will stretch Biden
and members of his team in new ways. [[They **must
not**]{.underline}]{.mark} let their well-intentioned --- and much
needed --- desire to reestablish processes of civilian oversight
[[**undermine** the trust necessary for **effective civil-military
cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

At the same time, senior military officers on the Joint Staff and at the
combatant commands should prepare their staffs for increased
expectations of public transparency, civilian interaction, and intrusive
questioning than that to which they have become accustomed in recent
years. [A culture that pronounces **micromanagement** at the **first
sign of tough questioning** can also **undermine** the trust required
for effective civil-military communication. [**Iterative discussion**
and **questioning** are an **essential part** of]{.mark} the process of
[**aligning military ways** and **means** with **political
ends**]{.mark}. More developed **process** and **predictability** can
benefit the military]{.underline}, too, [but there will be **conflict**
and **misunderstanding** as these institutional muscles learn to flex
again]{.underline}. However, the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} team
[[will bear the]{.mark} **primary [burden]{.mark}** [of demonstrating
that its goal is **not** civilian control for the sake of control,
but]{.mark} rather [**civil-military trust** and **cooperation**]{.mark}
geared [toward]{.mark} the shared goal of **[effective]{.mark} national
security [policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The Societal Setting

Perhaps the aspect that will take the Biden team the longest to adjust
to is the new societal context --- the social milieu in which these
civil-military dynamics take place. In a nutshell, the Biden
administration must adjust to deeper political polarization and changing
attitudes about the appropriate role of serving and retired military
officers in foreign policy and national security debates.

Two survey comparisons underscore this challenge: a 2014 YouGov survey
--- the closest thing we have to a comparable survey from the time Biden
was in the White House --- and nationally-representative surveys of
4,500 Americans that the National Opinion Research Center conducted on
our behalf in 2019 and 2020 (and that are proprietary until we finish a
book on this topic) that reflect the environment today. We do not have
enough active duty military in these samples to offer statistically
meaningful descriptions of the attitudes of the actual personnel who
will constitute the "military" in civil-military policymaking, but
previous surveys have shown that the attitudes of veterans, particularly
of recent veterans, is a satisfactory proxy that can guide our
understanding. While some civil-military gaps we explored in both
surveys are overstated because they are driven primarily by demographic
differences, others have grown and will create sharper civil-military
challenges for the Biden administration. We also have found several
areas where civilian and veteran respondents largely agree, but in ways
that undermine civilian control over policy processes.

Among the most striking findings from the 2014 snapshot was a
"familiarity gap" tied to the lack of public knowledge about the
military. Despite numerous ongoing American troop deployments, many
civilian respondents --- often as many as a quarter or a third --- would
not even venture to answer basic questions about the military. Civilian
and veteran respondents also expressed very different views about
whether and how to use military force. In general, veterans were more
reluctant to express support for the use of military force than civilian
respondents, but civilians were more likely to favor troop limits or
other restrictions when troops were deployed. Both civilian and veteran
respondents expressed growing support for various forms of military
resistance to unwise civilian orders. With respect to traditional
civil-military norms and best practices, these findings --- including
that majorities of nearly all subgroups supported the idea of military
resignation in protest --- were somewhat troubling. In part, these
civil-military trends were likely the result of broader societal trends
reflecting lost public confidence in elected officials. In 2014, nearly
80 percent of all respondents reported that political leaders do not
share the public's values. In contrast, nearly three-quarters of
Americans expressed confidence in the military, with only small
differences between civilian and veteran populations. These attitudes
extended and intensified long-standing patterns seen in other surveys
during the post-Cold War Era.

Today, this dynamic persists and is intensified still further. In 2020,
approximately 69 percent of Americans express "a great deal" or "quite a
lot" of confidence in the military, down slightly from 74 percent in
2019 and 2014. Even at 69 percent, esteem for the military is higher
than it is for any other national institution, and indeed far higher
than it is for Congress, the Supreme Court, or the presidency. The
public's confidence in the military is highly conditioned on
partisanship, with 82 percent of Republicans expressing confidence in
the military compared to just 60 percent of Democrats, reflecting a
five-point larger difference between parties than in 2014. Biden's slice
of the electorate in 2020 also contains large groups that harbor serious
concerns about the military. Only 53 percent of self-identified liberals
express confidence in the military, with confidence dropping below 49
percent for both women liberals and non-white liberals. Our research
suggests even these numbers may overstate the public's true confidence
in the military by as much as 20 percentage points due to social
pressure, however. Yet, the fact that many Americans feel this pressure
is itself a sign of the military's influence in American society and
politics.

The five-point drop in confidence from 2019 to 2020 may, in part, be due
to the military's involvement in a number of controversies related to
the Black Lives Matter protests during the summer of 2020. Although
Trump ultimately decided against invoking the Insurrection Act to use
active duty troops in support of law enforcement on domestic soil,
members of the National Guard did back up federal law enforcement in
Washington, D.C. on June 1, when they cleared Lafayette Square prior to
Trump's photo op at St. John's church. We did find differences between
civilian and military attitudes about the use of the Insurrection Act,
however. As many as 57 percent of veterans told us they would support
the use of active duty troops if protests continued compared to only 41
percent of civilians. We also primed a subset of respondents with
reports suggesting the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opposed the
use of active duty troops. The views of civilians who received this
prompt did not change at all, but support among veterans who received
this prompt dropped 8 points to 49 percent. While pundits and national
journalists focused on the electoral implications of retired generals'
comments, our survey suggests their statements were likely more
influential in shaping the attitudes of veterans and service members on
this narrow issue.

The [Biden]{.underline} administration's [commitment to restoring normal
processes may give it an initial civil-military honeymoon, but it
**should not expect** that to translate **automatically** into deference
or an easy civil-military relationship]{.underline}. In our 2020 survey,
[**62 percent** of all veterans]{.underline} and 66 percent of post-9/11
veterans [agreed]{.underline} with the statement, "[Civilians who have
not been to war **should not question** those who have]{.underline}." In
contrast, [**42 percent** of civilians agreed]{.underline} with the
statement while only 30 percent disagreed, [suggesting that
[**pressure** for civilian leaders to **defer** to military officers
emanates from **both groups**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Post-9/11 veterans
--- who volunteered to serve in America's all-volunteer force during
America's longest military conflicts with no full-time mobilization of
society --- also expressed some open contempt in our survey for those
who did not volunteer. A full 60 percent of post-9/11 veterans "agreed"
or "strongly agreed" that the eligible Americans who did not volunteer
to serve during wartime should feel guilty compared to just 43 percent
of older veterans and 22 percent of civilians. [Given **perceptions**
that the Biden team will be **prone to micromanagement**, members of the
Joint Staff may find it **easy** to fall back into those **familiar
narratives**]{.underline} when new political appointees enter the
Defense Department prepared to reestablish oversight and processes that
have laid somewhat dormant since the Obama years.

The Biden team should also expect some normal points of civil-military
friction on policy and missions to emerge. In general, veteran and
military respondents in our survey are more likely to believe the
military's most important role is to compete with great powers like
China and Russia, especially when compared to Democratic respondents.
Veteran respondents are also more hawkish on Iran than civilian
respondents. They also tend to be more optimistic, though only slightly
so, on the success of military operations in the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Although only 13 percent of all civilians and 10 percent of
Democrats agreed that these operations have been "very successful," 24
percent of post-9/11 veterans said the same. Veterans were also
particularly optimistic on progress in Afghanistan, though there are
notable generational divides: 44 percent of post-9/11 veterans "agree"
or "strongly agree" that the United States has accomplished its goals in
Afghanistan while 39 percent "disagree" or "strongly disagree." Older
veterans and civilians break 30-47 and 21-39, respectively. Post-9/11
veterans are also particularly supportive of troop reductions in the
context of the deal with the Taliban with 54 percent in support and only
29 percent against. While there is some civilian support among civilians
for troop reductions as part of a deal with the Taliban, a 40 percent
plurality of civilians chose "no opinion" when asked about both troop
reductions and military success in Afghanistan. Most Americans simply
are not paying much attention.

Conclusion

[[Civil-military relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} are not an end in
themselves. These relationships [exist]{.underline} only [to [provide
**effective**]{.mark} **national security [policies]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}in a given geopolitical environment [in the context of]{.mark}
democratic accountability]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the environment
is not benign. As they sort through the civil-military and institutional
baggage --- the items they bring with them and the items they inherit
--- [Biden's team must]{.underline} also [navigate **intensified
[great-power conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, persistent
[[**instability** in the]{.underline}]{.mark} broader **[[Middle
East]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**strained ties** with key
allies]{.underline}, and little progress on all of the other stubborn
problems that have bedeviled leaders in the post-Cold War era,
including: the [**[prolif]{.mark}eration** of **w**]{.underline}eapons
of **[m]{.underline}**ass **[d]{.underline}**estruction, transnational
networks of [**[terrorism]{.underline}**, **[failed
states]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and **ethnic rivalries**]{.underline}.
And, of course, [Biden must still lead the country out of [the]{.mark}
worst **[pandemic]{.mark}** in a century while recovering from all of
the associated **[economic upheaval]{.mark}**. There will be **no
strategic holiday** during which the Biden team can painstakingly sort
through its civil-military affairs]{.underline}.

The new commander-in-chief starts with the enormous advantage of being
"not Trump." He will need all of that advantage --- and will need to
have learned from Obama-era missteps --- in order to navigate through
the tricky civil-military waters we have described above. Members of
[the]{.underline} Biden [team come in as seasoned professionals, but we
hope that leads them to **caution** and **humility** rather than
**unwariness** and **hubris** as they conduct national security
policy]{.underline}. If Lloyd Austin wins over the critics and proves
himself to be both fully sensitive to these civil-military realities and
savvy in how he seeks to overcome them, he may yet emerge as the
successful and strong secretary of defense the Department of Defense so
desperately needs. The early slate of civilian nominees named for key
roles is a welcome sign. The **[[initial weeks]{.underline}]{.mark}**
after the inauguration [[will be of]{.mark} **particular
[importance]{.mark}** [in setting the tone]{.mark}, especially after the
tumultuous and stressful transition]{.underline}. Even so, the norm of
civilian management of the Defense Department will be more difficult to
reestablish, like so many other civil-military norms that have weakened
in recent years, if Congress does grant another recently-retired general
legal permission to serve as secretary of defense. Biden, and Austin,
will need all the top civilian defense talent they can get.

Notwithstanding all of the other urgent priorities vying for his
attention, [**[neglect]{.mark}** of the civil-military file
would]{.underline} likely [[impose **intolerable costs**]{.mark} on
Biden down the road]{.underline} --- a price that would be vividly
evident, sooner or later, [[when]{.mark} an **urgent national security
[crisis]{.mark}** [takes]{.mark} center [stage. The]{.mark} **only
[prudent course]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} for the Biden team [to attend to
both **policy** and **process** at the **same
time**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- to move out quickly on the pandemic and
the economy, while also [setting the national security establishment on
the path to **healthier civil-military relations**. Problems in the
civil-military foundations]{.underline} of an administration [**must be
fixed** before a crisis **lays bare the rot** that may lie just out of
view]{.underline}.

B. REFORMING THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT TO BETTER REFLECT MILITARY
ORGANIZATIONAL REALITIES

As discussed in Part IV, [the APA is no longer aligned with the
**organizational realities** of the **two-military state**.]{.underline}
The APA was passed just one year before the National Security Act and
forty years prior to Goldwater-Nichols and remains antiquated as applied
to the modern military. 492As a general matter, most [**administrative
military** actions that occur within the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [remain subject to the **APA**]{.underline}
[while]{.underline} most [**[operational]{.mark} military**
[actions]{.mark} taken by **combatant commands** [are **not subject** to
the **APA**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 493

First, the [[definition of \"**agency**\" should be
**updated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Specifically, [the APA is **silent**
on how **administrative law** should address **actions** taken by
**combatant commanders**]{.underline}. Both the [Secretaries of the
military departments and combatant commands are one step below the
Secretary of Defense in the **DoD hierarchy**]{.underline}, but [only
the Secretaries of the **military departments** are \"**agencies**\"
within the **plain meaning** of the **APA**]{.underline}. 494

Second, [the **APA [exemptions]{.mark}** [should]{.mark} be **reformed**
to **[eliminate]{.mark}** \"**[the time of war]{.mark}**\" exemption to
more **precisely address** the **military activities** that take place
in **peace** and the **expanding menu** of actions **short of
war**]{.underline}. For example, [the **operational military** does
conduct certain \"[**gray area**\" activities]{.mark} that are neither
purely administrative nor operational]{.underline}. 495Both the United
States Navy and Coast Guard conduct a wide range of activities on the
high seas and outside the United States that may be fairly [described as
\"[**readiness**\" **activities**]{.mark} that are hard to **clearly
define** and are not **purely wartime** activities.]{.underline} 496[As
**operational activities**, however, they currently **[fall
outside]{.mark}** the **APA\'s [jurisdiction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [military function [exception should]{.mark} also [be **updated**
and **defined**]{.mark} more **[precisely]{.mark}**. **Rulemaking** and
**adjudications** that [involve]{.mark} \"the **conduct** of
**[military]{.mark}** or **[foreign affairs]{.mark} functions**\" are
exempt.]{.underline} 497Notice of a [proposed rule, opportunity for
public comment, and publication of the final rule are **central** to
**administrative law**. **Courts** have **struggled** to **determine**
what, exactly, is a **military function**]{.underline}, applying the
military function exemption to the creation of temporary security zones
498and to the determination of death of a service member because it
involved military affairs and public benefits. 499

Of course, any attempt to reconcile the APA with the modern military
organization may run against significant headwinds within the DoD. And
they will likely assert that this will only harm military readiness by
exposing an increased number of activities to judicial review. But [the
[APA]{.mark} has had an **enormous impact** in making **governmental
activity** \"more open, **accountable**, and **responsive** to the
public than in any other country]{.underline}\" 500[and can play a
[powerful]{.mark} role [in ensuring **civilian control** of the
**military**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 501

#### Operational military commands are approved [de facto exemptions]{.underline} from [APA authority]{.underline} due to [ambiguity]{.underline} over [applicability]{.underline} -- especially for [international actions]{.underline} -- AND, previous Court precedent does NOT clarify [reviewability]{.underline} of [EUCOM]{.underline} or [combatant commander]{.underline} actions broadly

1\. The APA\'s Definition of Agency Clearly Applies to the
Administrative Military but Lacks a Clear Application to the Operational
Military

The [[APA]{.mark} **broadly** [defines
\"**agency**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" as \"each authority of the
Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or subject
to review by another agency.\" 300Congress, courts, and governments of
the United States are specifically exempt from the agency definition.
301While the President is not specifically exempt, [courts have
routinely held that the President is not an agency]{.underline} within
the APA\'s meaning. 302This is of [particular importance for **military
matters** due to the President\'s **role** as **Commander in
Chief**]{.underline}.

However, [\"agency\" includes the Secretary of Defense and the civilian
Secretaries of the military departments who remain subject to suit under
the APA]{.underline}. This conclusion is reaffirmed by the text of the
APA\'s Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) section, which specifically
applies to any executive department or military department. 303And the
[Secretary of Defense and civilian Secretaries of the military
departments are routinely sued]{.underline}. 304Because the [APA
\"agency\" definition clearly applies to the **civilian heads** of the
administrative military]{.underline}, it follows that APA
[**litigation** is focused on **administrative military** functions via
lawsuits against the Secretary of **Defense** or civilian Secretaries of
**military departments**]{.underline}. For example, the Secretaries of
Defense and military departments were the defendants in numerous
lawsuits challenging the forthcoming change in transgender service
policy. 305

[It is [**less clear** whether]{.mark} the heads of the **[operational
military]{.mark}** (**combatant commands** and **joint task force
commands**) [are]{.mark} an \"**authority** of the Government of the
United States\" [within the **APA**]{.mark}\'s agency
definition.]{.underline} 306Although [the operational military is **[not
specifically exempt]{.mark}** from judicial review, it remains
**unclear** how the **APA applies** to the operational
military.]{.underline} No lawsuit to date has held that an agency
includes a combatant commander or subordinate operational commander,
although a suit against the Secretary of Defense as the head of the
operational military remains possible. 307

In addition, [much of the **[operational]{.mark}** military\'s
**[decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline} (particularly [by the
**geographic combatant commanders**]{.underline}) [[takes place
**outside**]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, where
it is [not **clearly subject** to the **APA**]{.mark}]{.underline}\'s
reach, [which **lacks** a clear **extraterritorial
application**]{.underline}. 308Finally, [for an APA suit to come
forward, actual **[knowledge]{.mark}** of an **agency action** [is
**required**]{.mark}; a [**particular problem** for]{.mark}
**operational military** [matters]{.mark} that occur
**[outside]{.mark}** the **U**nited **S**tates, are **out of sight**,
and are often **classified**]{.underline}. 309[Secrecy]{.underline} is
itself a form of regulation, [[bypass]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
traditional forms of [**judicial [review]{.mark}** [or **civilian
control**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 310

312[He asserted that the Goldwater-Nichols Act divested the Navy of any

between the Navy and the service member]{.underline}. 314This

2\. APA Military Exemptions and Military Deference as Applied to the
Operational and Administrative Militaries

Since its passage in the aftermath of World War II, [the [APA]{.mark}
has **specifically [exempted]{.mark}** [certain]{.mark} **military
activities** based upon when they are **occurring** and what they
do]{.underline}. 322Despite repeated calls to address or reform the
[APA\'s **military exemptions**, they **persist** and are **virtually
unchanged**]{.underline} from their original form. 323These [express
exemptions include \"**military authority** exercised in the field in
the **time of war** or in **occupied territory**\" and
\"**[military]{.mark}** or **foreign affairs** [functions of the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates.\"]{.underline} 324[They [amount
to APA \"**black holes**]{.mark}\" where **military activities occur**
[outside]{.mark} the constraints of **judicial
[review]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 325

The terms [\"military authority\" and \"**in the field** in the **time
of war**\" lack a **clear definition**]{.underline} (and we have not had
a formal declaration of war since 1942). 326As this provision has not
been modified since 1946, [[courts]{.mark} have **[struggled to
apply]{.mark}** this **[exemption]{.mark}** to modern
conflicts.]{.underline} 327As a fundamental matter, modern [military
activities cannot be **neatly placed** in **clear legal categories**.
The [**division** between **war** and **peace** remains
**murky**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [APA\'s **rulemaking** and **adjudications** section exempts
\"**military** or **foreign affairs** functions of the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.\" 328The term
[\"military function\" is of central importance but it, too, [lacks a
**clear statutory definition**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 329[Despite this
**exemption\'s broad implications** as applied to DoD, it has not been
the subject of much **legal scholarship**; [nor have]{.mark} **judicial
[decisions]{.mark}** [provided]{.mark} **helpful [guidance]{.mark}** on
its **precise meaning**.]{.underline} 330The [APA]{.underline} also
[broadly **excludes** from review agency action \"committed to **agency
discretion**]{.underline} by law.\" 331[This **catchall
[exclusion]{.mark}** has been used to [**preclude review** in **national
security**]{.mark} **contexts**.]{.underline} 332

Perhaps not surprisingly, [the [DoD]{.mark} has often [sought]{.mark} a
[**broad interpretation** of]{.mark} these **APA
[exemptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 333This is somewhat understandable;
it seems absurd to subject critical war making and tactical
decision-making to judicial review. 334[In addition, **[courts]{.mark}**
will always **[afford]{.mark}** a certain amount of
**[deference]{.mark}** to the **DoD** in reviewing its
actions]{.underline}, regardless of its activity. 335

The question remains, [what level of **deference** should be
**afforded** to]{.underline} the expanding menu of [**military actions**
performed by an **operational** military **commander** outside of an
armed conflict such as **[training]{.mark}**, **[engagement]{.mark}**,
or routine **[administrative functions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (FOIA,
hiring and firing, etc.) embedded within the command? [It is **unclear**
what level of **deference** a court **can** or **should** afford to the
**operational military** **vis-a-vis** the **administrative military**
and how to weigh the **relevant factors** in **determining** the
**deference** afforded.]{.underline} 336And [**[rules]{.mark}**
regulating **military functions** as applied to military contractors
[are **exempt**]{.mark} from following the **APA rulemaking
process**]{.underline}. 337

[**Doe v. Sullivan** may offer some guidance]{.underline}. 338In Doe, a
service member used the APA to challenge the HHS Secretary\'s decision
to allow DoD to use an unapproved drug in the event of a chemical nerve
gas attack. 339In dismissing the service member\'s complaint, [the court
**refused to apply** the \"military authority\" **exception**, not
seeing this decision as part of a military exigency]{.underline}.
340Nevertheless, [the court hinted in **dicta** of a more generalized
Commander-in-Chief **exemption** that **if applied broadly** would
eliminate an **enormous swath** of **operational military decisions**
from **examination** under the **APA**]{.underline} (as opposed to
statutory delegation based on other constitutional provisions). 341[This
would]{.underline} appear to \"[**[immunize]{.mark} administrative
[actions]{.mark}** that rely up[on]{.mark} the President\'s
constitutional **Commander-in-Chief power**]{.underline},\" 342[an
[authority]{.mark} **wholly [independent]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **APA
[oversight]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} an **outsized [effect]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} **operational [military]{.mark} matters**]{.underline}:

Plaintiffs seek review under the Administrative Procedure Act \... of a
rule published in the Federal Register by the Secretary of HHS, who is
not part of any military chain of command \...when he adopted the rule,
\[the Secretary\] did not purport to be exercising the President\'s
powers as Commander in Chief \... . 343

Courts have struggled mightily to apply a consistent and uniform
standard when determining the level of deference to afford to the
military. For example, in Gilligan v. Morgan,the Court stated:

It is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which
the courts have less competence. The complex, subtle, and professional
decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a
military force are essentially military judgments, subject always to the
civilian control of the Legislative and Executive Branches. 344

The military deference doctrine is premised on both the Executive and
Legislative Branches exercising some modicum of control. 345But there
has been a continual derogation of civilian control over operational
military matters. 346How should administrative law account for this?

And for the first time in modern history, the Supreme Court lacks
active-duty veteran representation among its members. 347While it still
remains unclear what impact this will have on the Court\'s application
of the military deference doctrine, the Court\'s firsthand wartime
military knowledge has disappeared for the time being. 348Further
complicating matters, [[military **deference standards** are
**flexible**]{.mark} and **prone to manipulation** in the **national
security context**: \"federal [courts **manipulate**]{.mark} **flexible
legal [standards]{.mark}** to accord **heightened deference** to federal
agencies during national crises, transforming **standards** such as
\"**reasonableness**\' and \"**good cause**\' [into \"**grey
holes**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}\'\" 349

3\. Secrecy as Self-Regulation350

Finally, a significant number of [military actions occur
without]{.underline} the [knowledge of the]{.underline} American [public
and are afforded what amounts to **blanket military
deference**.]{.underline} 351[This further [shields]{.mark} the
**operational** military [from **civilian**]{.mark} and
**administrative** law **[oversight]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Compounding
matters, while much of the administrative military\'s actions and
regulations are open, easily accessible, and unclassified, much of the
[**operational** military\'s **internal [regulations]{.mark}** [and
**decision-making** are]{.mark} **outside** the **public domain** and
**[hidden]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 352

Within the DoD, [**over-classification** of documents and material that
do not merit classification remains a continual problem]{.underline}.
353Indeed, [**citizen suits** and **judicial review** are predicated on
**actual knowledge** of the **underlying regulation** and some **degree
of familiarity** to understand the **regulation** and its practical
impact. This is particularly **difficult** for **operational military**
matters that occur **outside** the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.
354After all, how can the public make a determination whether an agency
properly interpreted its internal guidance if it is classified or
otherwise not easily accessible to the public? 355

Finally, [in the national security context, [courts]{.mark} will often
**[ascertain]{.mark}** whether there is an **affirmative [legal
obligation]{.mark}** when [determining i]{.mark}f an **agency
[action]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} even **[reviewable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
356[The **operational [military]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} considerably more
**[discretion]{.mark}** in its actions as **compared** to the
**administrative military**; this adds a final level of deference in
determining whether their action is reviewable.]{.underline} For
example, a federal court that recently considered the National Security
Agency\'s program for warrantless electronic surveillance of suspected
terrorists stated (in dicta) that the terrorist surveillance program was
not an \"agency action\" covered by the APA as there was no legal
obligation to conduct the surveillance. 357

**[d]{.underline}**estruction [[will all affect]{.mark} U.S. national
**[security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In contrast to the Cold War era,
[[most]{.mark} of these challenges [can not be addressed
through]{.mark}]{.underline} economic and [**security alliances**, with
[the **military**]{.mark}]{.underline} providing nuclear and
conventional deterrence. As the 2015 National Security Strategy notes,
"[The [challenges]{.mark} we face [require]{.mark} ... the pursuit of
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[comprehensive agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[that draws on **all elements**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.mark} our
[national strength]{.mark}]{.underline}."1 [While [the need is]{.mark}
clear, efforts to implement [a **"whole-of government"
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline} to national security have been episodic
and ultimately unsuccessful. Although there has been much discussion,
frustration, and angst about the lack of cooperation and coordination
between and among U.S. government agencies and departments, there has
been very little progress in establishing mechanisms to coordinate
disparate and diverse organizations, each with their own leadership,
culture, and authorities. The result is a disjointed and often
ineffective foreign policy. While it will take national leadership to
change this at the strategic level, there are measures that can be taken
to mitigate challenges at the operational and tactical levels. Although
a whole-of-government approach may seem a daunting task, one of the most
effective ways to encourage coordination and collaboration is to bring
representatives from interagency entities together for realistic
training with their military counterparts before they are forced to work
together in a crisis. Recognizing the importance of "training as you
fight," the Army's Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) in
Hohenfels, Germany, integrates interagency personnel into its exercises.
They include mission rehearsal exercises, noncombatant evacuation
operations, and brigade readiness exercises with NATO allies and
multinational partners. This experience provides soldiers and other
interagency participants the opportunity to work with, and learn from,
the other entities they may encounter during a deployment. Integrated
training also helps build the relationships and develop the trust
required to effectively implement national security policy. The Need for
Development of Interagency Lines of Effort In 2002, the first post-9/11
National Security Strategy dramatically changed the focus of how
national security policy was implemented.2 For the first time,
international development was included as an essential component. Since
then, every national security strategy has noted the importance of a
"Three D" (defense, diplomacy, and development), whole-of-government
approach to national security. The Department of Defense (DOD),
Department of State (DOS), and U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) are tasked to work together to foster peace and long-term
stability. While there are numerous challenges that have limited the
implementation of this guidance, two stand out: the lack of stability
and civil-military operations education and integrated, interagency
training. As part of its effort to fulfill this new national security
emphasis, USAID established a small cadre of foreign service officers
specialized in crisis, stabilization, and governance in 2003. Known as
Backstop 76ers, these officers are charged with planning and
implementing humanitarian, transitional, and governance activities in
unstable or politically volatile areas. However, they have had limited
impact where interagency coordination and joint planning and
implementation are crucial for success. This is the result of a number
of factors including little or no interagency education, very low-risk
tolerance, the predilection of promotion boards to favor traditionally
developed officers over those with experience in conflict zones, and a
siloed approach to programming in unstable areas. In 2004, the DOS
established a similar capability when it created the Office of the
Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization.3 It managed to recruit
over 130 direct-hire deployable specialists under the Crisis Response
Corps. However, this initiative ended in 2011 when funding cuts caused
the Crisis Response Corps to disband. It is worth noting that neither
entity included stability or civil-military operations education as a
regular requirement in their programs. The growth of violent extremism,
increased frequency of humanitarian disasters, global health crises
(e.g., Ebola), and increased migration mean that U.S. government
officials will continue to operate in unstable environments across the
globe. [[While the DOD has]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[capability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[capacity]{.underline}** [to respond to crises anywhere, [it often
lacks]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[subject-matter
expertise]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark} identify and
[mitigate]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[nonmilitary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[challenges that]{.mark} directly [affect political end states]{.mark}.
In contrast,]{.underline} **[[joint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, interagency,
intergovernmental and multinational **[[entities]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[have]{.mark} the subject-matter]{.underline}
**[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[but]{.mark} often [lack]{.mark} the
**[capability]{.mark}** and capacity to quickly]{.underline}
**[deploy]{.underline}** them. [[Therefore]{.mark}, it is imperative
that these entities understand and leverage each other's capabilities
and capacities. Mission [success **requires military and civilian
personnel to work seamlessly**]{.mark}]{.underline} with each other as
well as with allies and partners, international organizations, and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs); each with overlapping mandates and
often divergent objectives. Even though the DOD, DOS, USAID, and other
agencies are colocated in our embassies, they are not adequately trained
in crisis response, often causing unnecessary delays and potential
mission failure as interagency personnel have to learn "on the job"
about one another's roles, resources, and expertise. [To foster
effective collaboration and deconfliction of activities, these entities
must be educated in]{.underline} stability and **[civil-military
operations]{.underline}** and train together before a crisis. These are
significant challenges, as there is no interagency stability or
civil-military operations education or training, nor is there policy
guidance mandating it.

Cross-border violence

There is very little contemporary violence contained within
international borders. Instead it masses within regions that threaten to
engulf more territory if the right combination of timing and
circumstances converge. These regions of violence can be defined as
geographic territory that crosses legal borders. They can be controlled
by governments and/or armed groups who almost always target civilians
and govern by fear. Their borders may be diplomatically recognized as is
the case with Syria and Iraq but in reality they can also be redrawn and
redefined by the group in power. This has been the case with the newly
formed caliphate combining northern Syria with northwestern Iraq
declared by the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIL or ISIS). Boko Haram, a
group aspiring to establish a similar territorial caliphate in northern
Nigeria and neighboring countries proclaimed their allegiance to IS in
March 2015. Announced via social media this statement is as strategic
and purposeful as any formal diplomatic maneuver made by an established
nation state. It is meant to convey an image of Boko Haram's rising
regional and global power, an illusion of legitimacy, and to use the
reputation of IS to spread fear among their enemies (Wooldridge 2015).
Both [**IS**, **Boko Haram**, and]{.underline} **[other [emerging
terror]{.mark}ist]{.underline}** and insurgent
**[[groups]{.underline}]{.mark}** [are [seek]{.mark}ing [to establish
themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} as legitimate states. This raises two
questions for the international community. What constitutes a nation
state? What role can violence play in shaping it? While these questions
often elicit exhaustive and elusive discussions they are worth briefly
considering in this context.

The Montevideo Convention attempted to define a state in the 1930s by
listing four requirements: a permanent population; a defined territory;
a government; and the capacity to enter into relations with other
states. Strictly speaking the self-declared Caliphate of the Islamic
State in Syria and Iraq fits that description; however, the
international community has added a moral and political dimension to
this definition that decrees violence and terror cannot be rewarded.
This ignores the fact that North Korea, which regularly targets its
civilians, is a full member of the UN and that Taiwan, which has treated
its citizens well under peacefully elected governments, is not a UN
member having been sidelined due to its longstanding dispute with
mainland China and is only formally recognized by a few countries (Boyle
2015).

Joe Boyles compares three contemporary strategies in which regions can
officially become states in his BBC article "Islamic State and the idea
of statehood." One is to get UN membership, which requires the support
of the Security Council and two-thirds of the General Assembly. If
attempts to achieve UN membership fail then the next best option is to
gain official recognition by as many other countries as possible while
functioning as a de facto state. Regions that aspire to be states can
begin by initiating trading and developing business deals with other
states with which they have formed alliances. If successful, they may
receive official recognition or that type of approval may no longer be
necessary if they have highly developed unofficial networks (Boyle
2015). He maintains that there is no universal definition of a state
demonstrated by three simultaneous and differing interpretations of
statehood that have emerged from the Syria, Iraq and IS situation in
2015. One is where Syria as a UN member with internationally recognized
borders, partial control of land, has a government disliked by western
powers who have appeared to bypass Syria's right to protect its own
territory. The other is Iraq, also a UN member with defined borders but
with only partial control of their territory. It enjoys both political
and military support of the West, especially the US, who having recently
ended the long and mostly unsuccessful Iraq War began resending military
advisors joined by other NATO allies after IS overran Mosul and other
areas in northwestern Iraq. The third major interpretation reinforced by
combining captured sophisticated military weapons with medieval era
military tactics is IS, which has declared itself a caliphate despite a
lack of international recognition of its borders and partial control of
its territory with no legal right to protect it (Boyle 2015). These
subjective geopolitical interpretations of what constitutes a nation
gives armed insurgent and terrorist groups such as IS, Boko Haram, and
others who make declarations reinforced by developing governance and
other infrastructure in territory they hold a stronger claim that they
are being victimized by the international system (Boyle 2015).

Modern violence carried out by IS and Boko Haram is descended from a
thousand year lineage that includes war, revolution, and terrorism used
to conquer territory, establish statehood, and solidify power. (Ginsberg
2013: B7) In a different century their actions might have been viewed as
a legitimate part of the process of establishing colonies and
consolidating empires on behalf of powerful distant kingdoms aspiring to
be world powers. Indiscriminate violence with little or no regard for
what would later be called human rights determined which nations would
exist, how their boundaries would be drawn, and which groups would
ascend to political power within them. It has been claimed that the
composition of the ruling elite within every country has been shaped by
some form of violence incorporated into their laws, legal processes and
systems that structurally reinforces what has been called "law-making
violence" (Walter Benjamin quoted in Ginsberg 2013: B7). Peaceful
acquisition of territory and creation of new countries are rare. Most
modern western powers have a long legacy of some variation of
unrestrained violence that has shaped their borders and directly
influenced their institutions. This is borne out by the formation of the
United States, one of the world's most successful democracies that
emerged from a long and violent history.

Established governments and terrorist groups in contemporary regions of
violence such as Syria, Iraq, northern Nigeria are once again using an
old strategy that Hugo Slim calls "limitless war" to justify and
solidify the dominant group's position. These "winners" view violence as
a positive "cleansing and creative" agent of change that displaces or
kills all designated "undesirable" individuals and groups while
consolidating the victors' political and military power (Slim 2008:
25-8; see Chapter 4). Destroying a population's culture and heritage by
attacking their revered historic sites and symbols is intended to extend
a limitless war strategy beyond physical killing of designated enemies
to eliminating all physical evidence of their identity as a group and
civilization in ways that deny their existence for future generations.

In its latest manifestations these acts of killing and desecration are
staged to be captured by digital cameras that technology savvy IS
members can quickly upload as images and video that are transmitted via
social media networks and communication platforms. They have developed a
similar strategy for instilling and manipulating fears and anxieties
held by individuals and groups in regions of the world they cannot
physically invade. Particularly skilled in targeting and provoking
reactions from major western powers, especially the US (societies with
which a number of IS members are familiar), they have also mastered the
art of using these and other images to recruit potential followers
inside these countries and to inspire others to carry out internal acts
of violence on their behalf. This has extended what can only be
described as psychological operations designed to increase fear,
anxiety, and feelings of vulnerability among their enemies by raising
the possibility of random attacks by IS proxies inside their home
countries. Once again IS had discovered another means of extending their
reach. IS held the type of momentum that gave them an ephemeral but
undeniable psychological military advantage that inspired admirers among
similar groups in areas of the Middle East and North Africa including
Egypt, Yemen, Libya. Their proteges in Boko Haram, Al Quaeda and other
terrorist organizations were taking notes.

The problem for opposing countries and military forces has been the
undeniable and unanticipated success of IS, which has created greater
problems for their enemies. Once ignited violence flowed into vulnerable
communities like leaking water and spread like burning oil. A clear
demonstration for a classic case study on "new" war scenarios these
strategies and tactics are intended to synchronize local and
international political and criminal violence, infiltrate local
conflicts, social protests, gang violence, and organized crime and
terrorism networks to cross and minimize borders while simultaneously
threatening a range of countries with similar or different incomes,
identities, religions, and ideologies (Kaldor 2012; World Development
Report 2011).

The irony is that many of these operations are rooted in textbook
military strategies and tactics as basic as divide and conquer. Aside
from acquiring US weapons after overrunning Mosul, IS demonstrated the
type of clear cut military victory that can be established by combining
the right technological skills with sophisticated information and
psychological operations and military tactics (in the case of IS
borrowed from earlier centuries) that the US and international military
forces had never managed to accomplish after over a decade in
Afghanistan and Iraq (TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014: 14).

In September 2014 then US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel stated that
[US enemies were]{.underline} also [developing anti-**ship**,
anti]{.underline}-[**air**, counter-**[space]{.mark}**, **cyber**,
**[electronic warfare]{.mark}**, and]{.underline}
**[spec]{.underline}**ial **[op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**
[capabilities with goals to counter and neutralize traditional US
military advantages]{.underline}, especially the "Army's ability to
project power" (TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014: 49, 11). By early 2015 US
Army Chief of Staff, Ray Odierno acknowledged the success of IS (aka
ISIL) while discussing a new army operating concept stating that while
"our enemy creates multiple dilemmas for us, we don't create multiple
dilemmas for them" (Yergun 2015). A 2014 US Army Training and Doctrine
Command (TRADOC) paper "Win in a Complex World, 2020-2040" outlined
these challenges and the success of IS (aka ISIL) in using a range of
strategies and tactics to create and dominate their operating
environment (TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014). It described how IS used a
strategy of murder and brutality against civilians while forming
alliances of convenience to organize people, money, and weapons that
allowed them to take advantage of the opportunities offered by regional
conflicts and weak governance to consolidate their gains and to further
intimidate and marginalize competing insurgent groups. By declaring a
caliphate IS (ISIL) provided their followers with a type of sanctuary
and "strategic depth" that would allow them to launch a broader regional
and ultimately global campaign that reinforced their image of
invincibility(TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014: 14). Terrorist and insurgent
groups can easily access weapons equal to those used by international
military forces.

For the first time the new army operating concept focused on all three
levels of fighting wars---strategic, operational, and tactical, while
declaring that the future operating environment is composed of a series
of unknowns. The enemy is unknown, the location is unknown and the
answer to questions of who, what, where of involved coalitions is
unknown (TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014: iii). While indicating the
necessity for land forces to defeat determined enemies who operate among
civilian populations they control, the US Army acknowledged that the
challenges presented by "ISIL" also highlighted the need to "extend
efforts" beyond physical battlegrounds to "other contested spaces such
as public perception and political subversion" (TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1
2014: 14). [A growing [challenge]{.mark} for international
**[civilian]{.mark} humanitarian, aid, development
[organizations]{.mark}** [and **military forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}
is [[to]{.mark} successfully [identify]{.mark}]{.underline} areas of
chronic and potential destabilization where the "right" circumstances
can rapidly transform a random combination of risk factors,
vulnerabilities, and catalytic events into "unexpected
**[[synergies]{.underline}]{.mark}**" between otherwise independent
risks that evolve into larger cross-border regions of violence that
support the formation of "new" war scenarios and magnify their
consequences (Gamper 2014: 4). This requires a deeper understanding of
the characteristics of contemporary complex, interconnected risks.

Understanding complex risks

Complex risks, also known as compound risks, interdependent or
interconnected risks, and hyper-risks, can be generally described as a
rapid set of events with severely disruptive consequences that cross
administrative and national borders with the ability to produce ripple
effects on both local and global infrastructure networks, economic
sectors, and international civil-military operations (OECD in Gamper
2014: 4). Compound disasters have been described as events causing
extensive damage that multiplies the effect of the original cause to
prolong recovery. **[[Hyper-risks]{.underline}]{.mark}** describe an
event or process that [[trigger]{.mark}s another]{.underline} single or
[**series** of **unpredictable effects and events**]{.underline} [with
the potential to cross borders. All]{.underline} of these [are usually
shaped by a rapid clustering of what previously appeared to be mutually
exclusive causes that combine to trigger]{.underline}
[**["cascading"]{.mark} or domino effects**, also described as
cascading]{.underline} disasters and **[[failures in]{.mark}
infrastructure]{.underline}** systems [and]{.underline}
[**[interdependent networks]{.mark}**. In contrast to traditional risk
management techniques]{.underline} where assessments have focused
separately on each risk, [these encompass a]{.underline}
**[range]{.underline}** [of natural, social, technological, natural and
human-caused risks that merge a combination of "drivers" that overlap
and intersect to create a]{.underline} **[larger disaster]{.underline}**
(Gamper 2014: 5). These drivers include forgotten crises that form areas
of chronic violence, urbanization, complex infectious diseases,
environment, and the impact of technological developments on critical
infrastructure and systemic risks (Gamper 2014).

Forgotten crises

Identifying potential regions of future violence requires that
international focus be redirected away from highly publicized conflicts
toward quieter but no less potentially violent areas. Many of these
regions have been relegated to a lower priority status by the
international community when compared to highly visible complex crises
and emergencies that demand an immediate response. However recent
history has clearly demonstrated how quickly the "right" set of
circumstances can merge to link and interact with international 98 Part
III: Looking ahead The "new war" challenge 99 causes to suddenly erupt
into large scale regional violence. Sidelined by the international
community these "forgotten," overlooked potential "trouble" areas
experiencing unresolved, chronic local conflicts offer opportunities for
insurgents, terrorists, and criminal networks to hone their skills,
develop financial links, and establish human and arms trafficking
networks away from public scrutiny (UN Department of Economic and Social
Affairs 2014: 7).

The 2014 European Commission's Department of Humanitarian Aid and Civil
Protection (ECHO) Forgotten Crisis Index regularly publishes a list of
indicators for future regional problems. This index has consistently
demonstrated a large disparity between countries receiving a high level
of international attention and the location of countries that have
repeatedly appeared on the index since 2004. The Central African
Republic with an ongoing armed conflict that has caused a range of
humanitarian crises, Algeria which is home to the longstanding Sahrawi
Crisis, and Columbia with its long term unresolved and continuing armed
conflict are all top of the index. Other countries appearing on the
index six to nine times within the previous 10 years include Nepal,
which has Bhutanese refugee issues, Bangladesh with Chittagong Hill
Tracts and Rohingyas disputes, Mynanmar with conflict in the Rakhine and
Kachin States and Myanmar refugees in Thailand, Thailand in the Myanmar
border area, India in the Naxalite affected regions, Jamma and Kashmir
and the North East India conflicts, and Yemen (Global Humanitarian
Assistance Team 2014: Annex I).

Those that have appeared one to three times in the same decade are
Georgia, Abkhazia, the Russian Federation in Chechnya, Sudan with
humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict, the western Sahara on the
Algeria border, Haiti, Guinea, Chad, Uganda with ongoing armed conflict,
and the Democratic Republic of Congo affected by conflict caused
humanitarian crises. Somalia, Kenya which has a Somali refugee crisis,
Tanzania, Sri Lanka undergoing the impact of returning internally
displaced persons, Indonesia, the Philippines with its longstanding
Mindanao insurgency and Papua New Guinea are also included on the list
(Global Humanitarian Assistance Team 2014: Annex I).

Placed on ECHO'S high risk list for most of the last decade Yemen began
fragmenting into a highly unstable phase in late January 2015 when
western-backed President Abed-Rabbo Mansour Hadi and the Prime Minister
resigned following the capture of the presidential palace and control of
the capital by the militarily dominant Huthi fighters. This was
triggered by a dispute between the Huthis, a mostly Zaydi/Shiite
movement also known as Ansar Allah, and the President over a
constitution that divided the country into six federal regions and used
language that the Huthis found objectionable. They suspected the
President's advisor, who they had kidnapped earlier in January, of
trying to push through the constitution without their consent. While
there were few external actors other than Saudi Arabia and Iran to
influence the outcome, Yemen's location is in proximity to Al-Qaeda in
the Arabian Peninsula and there is the potential for internal violent
opposition from the Shafai (Sunni) areas and southern separatists.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the group that claimed
responsibility for the 7th January attacks on the satirical magazine
Charlie Hebdo in Paris and Yemen's police academy, which was bombed the
same day. Yemenis have been faced with the choice of either compromising
and forming an inclusive political settlement or undergoing a violent
break up of the country, which would mirror a Libyan type of scenario.
The longer the crisis continues the greater the potential for external
interference, both positive and negative (ICG 2015b: Syria Calling; ICG
2015c: Yemen Conflict Alert).

In 2015 the International Crisis Group (ICG) identified Central Asia,
including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan as a region with potential for future destabilization. This
is linked to the growing numbers of men and women travelling to the
Middle East from countries in the region to support and fight with IS.
ICG estimates between 2,000 and 4,000 joined in the 3 years prior to
2015 for a range of political, social, and economic reasons, attracted
by the prospect of combat experience and a more devout religious life.
If significant numbers of these IS recruits return to Central Asia they
have the potential to destabilize not only their own countries but the
entire region, which shares borders with Russia, Afghanistan, Iran, and
China. Ethnic Uzbeks, including Uzbekistan citizens make up the greatest
numbers of IS recruits and are primarily coming from southern
Kyrgyzstan, a country that borders Afghanistan, where the Uzbek
community was alienated by targeted ethnic violence in Osh in 2010.
Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, Turkmen, and Tajiks recruits are also numerous. They
are all coming from secular countries plagued by poor governance,
corruption, and criminal networks. None of these nations have the
resources or skills to cope with the expected return of battle hardened
and politically experienced radical Islamists. Instead of attempting to
promote religious freedom, safeguard secular institutions, and support
European style attempts to rehabilitate jihadis these countries have
reacted to these potential threats by implementing laws that increase
restriction of religion and sending badly trained police who enforce
them by carrying out heavy handed crackdowns that further exacerbate the
problem (ICG 2015b, Syria Calling: 1-2).

Urbanization

Global urbanization, increasing at a pace that threatens to overwhelm
local and national infrastructure, is another important potential
contributor to creating regions of violence as socioeconomic inequality
rises both inside cities and in surrounding areas (UN Department of
Economic and Social Affairs 2014: 7). Due to unprecedented urbanization
over the past 60 years more people now live in urban than in rural
areas. This is in stark contrast to 1950 when over 70 percent of the
world's population lived in rural areas. Most of the world's largest
urban areas were previously located in the more developed regions, but
large cities are now clustered in the less developed "global South." In
2014 54 percent of the global population was urbanized, with
expectations that will increase to 66 percent by 2050. India, China, and
Nigeria are expected to account for 37 percent of the global urban
population between 2014 and 2050 (UN Department of Economic and Social
Affairs 2014: 1, 7). The potential for these regions to evolve and
connect into regions of violence is high.

Much of the world's future population growth is projected to occur in
highly vulnerable, less developed countries where many of these dense
urban areas are home to densely concentrated and interdependent
populations, buildings and services. They are often located along
coastal areas threatened by climate change and weather-related
emergencies. Many individuals who voluntarily relocated to cities in
search of employment find that the only available housing they can
afford is structures built on illegal sites from discarded materials and
mud without access to public services. Making up a large proportion of
growing cities these impoverished and over-populated sites have been
generally ignored by local governments who have not integrated them into
their planning or public infrastructure strategies. Inadequate
construction materials, garbage disposal and sewage systems increase the
potential for regional destabilization by leaving them vulnerable to
growing pressures on the availability and safety of food supplies,
water, energy sources, and the possibility of new health-related risks.
With no growth restrictions these urban centers often expand onto lands
prone to geographic hazards such as landslides and environmental
problems such as toxic waste disposal sites. Increased flows of legal
and illegal migrants fleeing other areas, along with internally
displaced populations and refugees fleeing conflicts, accelerate this
undisciplined urban growth that increases the likelihood that these
cities will become incubators for disease and violence (Gamper 2014:
8-9; Patel and Burke 2009: 741; Mancini 2014). This has resulted in a
chaotic and disorganized urban landscape where expectations for a better
quality of life have not been met.

International concerns about destabilization in North and South East
Asia have increased as these areas become more vulnerable to combined
risks of urbanization, new and rapidly transmitted diseases, and climate
related disasters that put large segments of their population at risk.
Asia, likely to be home to fifteen of the top global cities by 2070, is
especially at risk from future (2030-40) coastal and urban flooding that
would cause widespread destruction to infrastructure, livelihoods, and
settlements (Peters 2014: 2-3). Countries at greatest risk in this
region include Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, China, Japan,
Philippines, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Timor-Leste. It is worth
noting that more than 71 million people were displaced in North and
South East Asia between 2008 and 2012, and that a number of these
countries were listed on the Forgotten Crisis Index, with several others
experiencing recent violent conflicts (Peters 2014: 9, 4).

Similar to forgotten crises these areas of chaotic urbanization are
ideal for incubating illegal gangs and activities that provide safe
havens and support home base environments for dangerous criminals,
terrorists, and insurgents who can easily operate undetected by the
police and military forces. If local and national governments continue
to fail to provide adequate security, employment, infrastructure and
services to their urban constituents they leave these populations open
to recruitment and exploitation by these armed groups. Cities have also
become ideal stages for carrying out politically motivated attacks
against innocent civilians. The 2013 Boston Bombing and the 2014 attacks
on coffee shop customers in Sydney, Australia are two examples. US and
international military forces are especially concerned about terrorists
and other criminal groups using uncontrolled urbanized environments to
launch long range missiles and other powerful weapons that could
threaten external populations (TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014: 12).

To successfully meet the challenge of future complex crises the
international civilian organizations and military forces will need to
develop a deeper understanding of the ways in which urbanization creates
its own urban "fabric," ecosystem, climate, society, culture, economy,
and governance systems. These urban systems influence and interact
within their own geographic boundaries of urban territory, sociocultural
activities, and politics to assume characteristics of mega city-states,
that have more in common with other giant urban metropolises than with
the national governance structure of the country where they are located
(Warmsler and Brink 2014, 11). The United Nations has stated that the
battle for future sustainable development will be won or lost in urban
areas. Their projects are beginning to focus on cities, especially those
located in the lower-middle-income countries experiencing rapid
urbanization. City and regional governments will need to review their
governance strategies to integrate human, national and international
security into their policies (Patel and Burke 2009, 741: Mancini 2014).

Successfully meeting challenges posed by these urban areas requires
developing better strategies to identify and anticipate the evolution of
complex risks specifically linked to these urban areas that are
independent from the countries in which they are located (Warmsler and
Brink 2014: 11). Operating in congested and restrictive urban terrain
will require that international military forces understand the specific
political, geographic, technological, and military challenges posed by
these and similar urban environments that are either located within or
have themselves turned into regions of violence. Both civilian and
military responders will need to develop broader more flexible urban
focused approaches to humanitarian aid, development and security to be
effective when conflicts and emergencies occur in these environments
(TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-1 2014: 12; UN Department of Economic and Social
Affairs 2014: 1).

Complex, infectious diseases

The destabilizing potential of infectious disease on vulnerable regions
that have recently emerged from long term conflict was clearly
demonstrated during the 2014 Ebola crisis. First the crisis began in
Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, countries that had only recently
emerged from long term regions of violence and conflict, which had
destroyed their basic health infrastructure. This left these countries
with a ratio of one or two doctors per 100,000 people (compared to Spain
with 370 and US with 245 doctors) and a young adult population who had
little or no education or knowledge about how diseases spread. Initially
misdiagnosed as cholera then Lassa fever, the Ebola virus was not
correctly identified until it had been circulating in Guinea for 3
months. Once it had taken root it decimated the already small number of
health care workers in these countries. Having been considered a rare
disease unlikely to appear in well developed countries there were no
vaccines and the only controls, early detection, isolation, infection
control and quarantine dated back to the Middle Ages. By the beginning
of 2015 almost 24,000 cases and 10,000 deaths were reported inside
Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. (Chan 2015; GHA Crisis Briefing
2015).

The drivers behind the spread of infectious diseases share
characteristics similar to complex risks in urban environments but they
are further complicated by the rapid pace of global mobility and
transport networks that extend their impact throughout interconnected
systems (Gamper 2014: 14-15). Warning flags and scares about the
potential catastrophic effects caused by large scale pandemics had been
raised for years prior to the Ebola crisis, but as long as diseases were
treatable, eventually contained and for the most part had little or no
effect on populations living inside western developed countries few
outside of the health field took serious note. Earlier outbreaks such as
Dengue and Chikungunya fever in the 1990s had been spread by the global
trade in used tires but more recently diseases have spread faster and
farther through interlinking networks of tourism, energy, transportation
and agriculture that have resulted in a wider range of international
consequences. The world health community made pre-Ebola assumptions that
"exotic" pathogens, which caused problems in the developing world, would
not be a threat to wealthier more developed countries with their higher
standards of living and sophisticated health systems. This theory was
seriously challenged by the 2002 and 2003 severe acute respiratory
syndrome outbreak that began in wildlife markets and restaurants in
southern China and quickly spread by air travel to urban areas in Hong
Kong, Vietnam, Taiwan, Singapore, Toronto, Thailand, and the US. The
international health community also erroneously assumed that future
health threats could be predicted. While many were focused on the 2009
H5N1 avian influenza pandemic in Asia along with African forests and
Asian cities as the most likely sources of the next pandemic, the 2012
Middle East respiratory syndrome suddenly emerged from the arid desert
environment of Saudi Arabia where camels, not chickens were the source
of disease (Gamper 2014: 14-15; Chan 2015). The appearance, spread, and
adaptability of the Ebola virus in 2014 broke through all previous
assumptions and rules.

Three key lessons learned by the international health community about
stopping the spread of global health risks following the Ebola outbreak
were outlined by the World Health Organization's Director Dr Margaret
Chan in a March 2015 speech to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine. The first is that competent functioning health systems need to
be in place before a health crisis occurs. This requires developing a
system that is designed to identify early warning signs of unusual
disease events, establishing response teams that can track and
investigate cases, and designating capable laboratory services to
support these outbreaks. Another lesson has been to expect the
unexpected (Chan 2015). Do not assume a virus will behave in the same
way as previous outbreaks when introduced into a new setting. Ebola
emerged at a time when the WHO and other global health experts were
focused on acute respiratory infections as the leading global cause of
sickness and death (WHO 2014). While Ebola had been a known entity for
40 years it mutated in an entirely new way during 2014. The spread of
the disease also highlighted the important role of community engagement
and the necessity of establishing trust while seeking their cooperation.
Distrust of authorities prompted many communities to hide patients,
conduct secret and unsafe burials, and refuse to cooperate with those
attempting to track the virus. In 2015 the World Health Organization
collaborated with the World Food Programme to bring WHO teams of social
anthropologists and epidemiologists to isolated villages to assist in
establishing trust with communities in an effort to track down the
remaining Ebola patients until all cases were resolved (WHO/WFP 2015). A
third lesson is the importance of creating incentives for research and
development of medical vaccines and other interventions for diseases
mostly associated with impoverished populations. Ebola demonstrated how
easily and quickly a sidelined disease could jump socioeconomic groups
and global barriers (Chan 2015).

More public health spending on general health care, vaccines,
antivirals, and antibiotics has the potential to reverse overall
vulnerability to pandemics (Gamper 2014: 14-15). In many ways Ebola was
an international wake-up call about the destabilizing potential of
infectious diseases that begin in distant locations. It points out the
dangers of weak health infrastructure in areas recently emerging from or
currently experiencing long term chronic violence and their connection
to global systems. It also highlights the link between environment and
the spread of infectious diseases. Changes in the global environment and
land use for agriculture, irrigation, hunting, and deforestation have
directly contributed to an increase in the spread of zoonotics (animal
diseases that can be transmitted to humans), food, and water-borne
diseases. Migration and climate change have eased the transmission of
vector-borne diseases such as malaria, transmitted by mosquitoes.
Changes in social and demographic factors such as aging, migration,
unemployment, displacement can also contribute to disease outbreaks.
These risks are further aggravated in areas where there are persistent
socioeconomic inequalities, where resources are lacking and where
disasters and conflicts have occurred (Gamper 2014: 14-15). Developing
integrated global strategies and interventions to identify and counter
future outbreaks of infectious disease and having functional health
systems in place that can withstand future shocks whether from climate
change or unchecked viruses is the only way they will be slowed or
stopped (Chan 2015).

Environment and climate change

Environment and climate change are widely considered to be interwoven
into and underpinning almost all complex risks. While the impact of the
environment and climate change on reshaping everyday lives has been
widely discussed in the context of disastrous weather events and forced
migration of populations due to degradation of land and availability of
water, it is more recently considered to be the factor driving an
increased frequency and intensity of future complex risks.

Increased rainfall causes flood; accelerating wind speeds can cause
hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes and similar destructive storms. More
frequent and longer periods of warm weather can lead to intense heat
waves and droughts that are associated with a rise in sea levels, and
rapid melting of glaciers and permafrost that destabilize hillsides and
increase coastal flooding. Flood risk has been estimated to be the
greatest natural catastrophic risk to the largest number of global
inhabitants as most of the world's cities are located on coastlines,
rivers, and other bodies of water. This includes world financial centers
like London and New York (Gamper 2014: 14-15).

Climate change has been progressively pressuring cities into a vicious
cycle of cause and effect between themselves and complex disasters.
Massive urban areas have been increasingly viewed not only at risk to
climate change but also the cause of additional climate-related risks
through interconnected systems that combine geographic and spatial,
environmental, sociocultural, economic and political institutions. These
include urban sprawl, lack and inefficient delivery of services, unsafe
construction, traffic, paving over earth and overcrowded informal
settlements. Sustainability of urban environments is challenged by a
lack of green areas, biodiversity, pollution, scarce water sources,
waste and wastewater contamination, and radiation. Sociocultural
challenges include a lack of security, segregation, aging populations,
loss of cultural and historic heritage, unequal access to services,
disease, traffic accidents. Economic issues are poverty, inflation,
unemployment. Political challenges are a lack of access to political
power that controls economic, social, and legal institutions that shape
policy affecting urban populations.

This sets up a feedback loop that is caused by the impact of climate
change on shaping climate-related disasters, the influence of the
resulting disasters on climate change, the impact of inadequate urban
development on climate change, and the reciprocating impact of climate
change on inadequate urban development (Wamsler and Brink 2014: 5, 25,
26).

This indicates that a timely and adequate response to one disaster may
be the key to preventing another meaning that the "right" response to
each environmental and climate-caused disaster is the key to preventing
another and should include actions that diffuse or stop a potential
chain of cascading effects. There have been suggestions that the nuclear
power plant disaster in Japan that followed the 2011 tsunami triggered
by the Great East Japan Earthquake could have been better controlled or
contained if there had been a more flexible response that combined
experience, better understanding of the range of potential disaster
scenarios, and a willingness for responders to anticipate, react, and
improvise to the unfolding situation. The type of cross-sector
engagement and collaboration that was necessary to address this crisis
included disaster management, environment, energy, public health, and
local economic, industrial, and international relations. [[Averting
future crises]{.mark} of this type [will necessitate]{.mark} that
previously specialized [agencies **broaden their

multi-sector policies and **[coordination]{.underline}** processes
(Gamper 2014: 22).

Impact of technological developments on critical infrastructure and
systemic risks

[The impact that]{.underline} [**sophisticated users of i**nformation
and **c**ommunication **t**echnologies can have on **[civil-military
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}hips [and the operating environment has
been explored]{.underline} in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.
[Tech]{.underline}nological improvements in information, communication,

**[economic development]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [can conversely act as **drivers of

significant threats to]{.underline} **[international]{.underline}**
financial and **[infrastructure]{.underline}** systems [as many remain
relatively easy to hack and capable of causing **widespread
damage**]{.underline}. However recent international analysis has also
focused on ways in which the presence of technology itself can
facilitate and accelerate risks (Gamper 2014: 13).

[Aside from the potential for inciting violence and spreading panic, an
equal if not greater and less predictable threat is posed by **natural
disasters** that **trigger technological** disasters]{.underline} (also
known as NATECHs), [as witnessed in]{.underline} the 2011 destruction of
the **[Fukushima]{.underline}** nuclear power plant in Japan. When a
devastating earthquake hit Japan on 11 March 2011, it caused a massive
tsunami that killed more than 15,844 people, destroyed homes and
businesses and set off a chain of nuclear accidents that resulted in the
meltdown of three nuclear reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Njuclear
Power Plant. This nuclear meltdown resulted in widespread contamination
of water, food, plants, animals, and fish on the Japanese mainland up to
200 miles away from the nuclear plant and directly caused over 150,000
people to be displaced. The total economic loss has been estimated at
between \$250 and \$500 billion and seen as responsible for a slowdown
or elimination of plans to build new nuclear power plants in many
countries that in turn affected the global energy market (Ray-Bennett et
al 2014: 14).

[This **merging** of a natural disaster with **vulnerabilities** in
**technological systems** has given rise to a **new concept of
hyper-risks** and the threats]{.underline} and costs that [their

insist [[the]{.mark} **US [military]{.mark}** [should apply]{.mark} its
**unique [capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to provide
**humanitarian**]{.mark} **and disaster [relief]{.mark}**]{.underline},
or to build levees to protect American cities like New Orleans, even if
such missions detract from traditional deterrence and war fighting.

Finally, there are naturogenic threats---those having no human source.
These are advertised as new but they are not.
**[[Ebola]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example, [is
terrifying]{.underline}. The **[[Zika]{.underline}]{.mark}** virus
[could change all our best expectations about demographic
projections]{.underline}.34 But [the Spanish flu]{.underline}, for which
there was no vaccine, [killed]{.underline} an estimated 675,000
Americans in 1918-19, and between 30 to [50 million]{.underline} people
[worldwide]{.underline}.40 [Americans are well aware of these
threats]{.underline}, as a Pew public opinion survey conducted in the
midst of West Africa\'s Fbola outbreak made clear.41 Again, [the armed
forces]{.underline} were employed, not just to provide security but also
to [construct facilities and treat patients]{.underline}.

Yet regardless of whether these nontraditional threats are new or have
just taken on new form, two things have changed. The first is the speed
at which disease and the effects of ecological disaster can diffuse has
increased. [The [transfer to a **global population**]{.mark}---as SARs,
MERS, Ebola, and Zika have all vividly illustrated---is facilitated by
the greater volume of people with access to **travel**]{.underline} by
land, sea, and air. [A modern pandemic could do **[far greater]{.mark}
damage** [than]{.mark} the [Spanish flu]{.mark} did]{.underline} in
1918-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in
2014, for example, that [the number of]{.underline} new [Ebola cases in
West Africa]{.underline} alone [could have **[double]{.mark}d [every
twenty days]{.mark}** without stringent quarantine regulations and
adequate]{.underline} medical [resources]{.underline}.42 Reinforcing the
notion that [**pandemics** have a **new scope** and
**scale**]{.underline} is the fact that the very term global health is
relatively new to the American lexicon, largely displacing the more
traditional notion of \"public\" or even \"international\" health.43

The second thing to have changed is that US policymakers have broadened
the working definition of national security to include more threats. The
maritime services---the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard---have
adjusted their top-end strategic documents to reflect this new emphasis.
The 2007 vision statement, A Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Sea
power (CS21), for example, included humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief (HA/DR) among its most important missions.41 This shift has been
reflected in operations, both during crises and on a day-to-day
basis---albeit with a significant amount of criticism from within the
ranks.45 In a 2014 interview, for example, President Obama stated:

> There\'s a reason why the quadrennial defense review---\[which\] the
> secretary of defense and the Joints Chiefs of Staff work
> on---identified climate change as one of our wont significant national
> security problems (italics added). It\'s not just the actual disasters
> that might arise; it is the accumulating stresses that are placed on a
> lot of different countries and [the possibility of war, conflict,
> refugees, displacement]{.underline} that [arise from a changing
> climate]{.underline}.46

[The **[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f **[D]{.mark}**efense is
thus **preparing to cope**]{.underline} [with the consequences of
climate change]{.underline},47 [while the armed forces
provide]{.underline} manpower, equipment, and technical expertise for
[**disaster relief and [humanitarian
op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Some critics argue that many of the new threats incorporated into major
policy documents are marginal to core US national security.48 Vet,
undeniably, more is expected of the American military\', adding to the
military\'s planning, training, and operating. Layering new
responsibilities on top of old ones has created an unprecedented number
of tasks that consume time and resources. Specialized training,
equipment, and exercises have been developed, despite concerns that the
military\'s suitability for particular tasks is not always self-evident.

This expansion of functions may partly be explained by the fact that
military units are available, adaptable, and willing to undertake
complex missions. These considerations often override questions about
appropriateness---a propensity demonstrated by then president Obama\'s
dispatching of more than twenty-eight hundred US troops to \"combat\"
the Ebola epidemic. In significant ways that operation was a departure
from, if not in conflict with, the military\'s core mission of
safeguarding US national security.49 But while some civilian medical
professionals were willing to volunteer to work with patients, few were
willing to volunteer for the complementary logistical tasks performed by
the military.

Famously, candidate George VV. Bush suggested in 2000 that the US
military does not and should not \"nation build.\" He favored reducing
America\'s military involvement in all sorts of noncombat activities,
from peacekeeping to humanitarian operations. Eventual National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice argued that \"the president must remember that
the military is a special instrument. It is lethal, and it is meant to
be. It is not a civilian police force. It is not a political referee.
And it is most certainly not designed to build a civilian society.\"511
Just as famously, the Bush administration reversed its position after
9/11 with its global counterterrorism campaign and invasions of Iraq and
Afghanistan. The US military embarked on a process of nation building,
and assumed the greatest variety of political, diplomatic, and economic
responsibilities since the Vietnam War. The \"military instrument\"
became a universal solvent.

Afghanistan and Iraq were sometimes characterized as exceptions, or only
the province of ground troops. Yet in the same period the Navy also
engaged in helping other nations develop the ability to provide for
local and regional \"Global Maritime Partnerships\" and a range of
counterterrorism and counterpiracy task forces (described in chapter 5)
that had more to do with capacity building than with deterrence or war
fighting.31 Domestic critics often focus on increases in the military
budget.52 They might also focus on increases in the military\'s roles
and missions---and how these increased functions cohere around any
single grand strategy.

Our central point is that the responsibilities of the US armed forces
have drastically expanded. [It is no longer enough to defend the nation
against invasion]{.underline} or project power against adversaries; [the
armed forces [are]{.mark} now [the]{.mark}]{.underline} nation\'s
[[first]{.mark} line of [defense against]{.mark}]{.underline} threats
ranging from cyberattacks to [**[nuclear prolif]{.mark}**eration,
[**climate change**, **pandemics**, and **natural disasters**]{.mark}.
And like it or not, they are sometimes called on [to **rebuild societies
torn apart**]{.mark} **by war**]{.underline} [or **support** those
simply **unable to perform security functions**]{.underline} like
policing the maritime commons.

\"Civil-Military Relations Theory for the Modern World.\" Small Crowded
World.
https://smallcrowdedworld.wordpress.com/2014/12/15/civil-military-relations-theory-for-the-modern-world/

While Huntington's theory of objective control still provides an
important foundation for thinking about
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ivil-**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ilitary
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations, it [[does not adequately deal
with]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[modern situations]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[where military officers have to]{.mark} take on roles beyond managing
violence. For example, in Iraq and Afghanistan the U.S. military had to
[perform roles related to **nation**]{.mark} **building**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[traditionally
left to]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Department [or]{.underline} [**USAID**. The inability of
the]{.underline} and [military to successfully manage]{.underline}
**[[interagency cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or to perform roles
outside of the management of violence, [contributed to the]{.underline}
[**deteriorating situation in both countries**, and [was]{.mark} one of
the]{.underline} **[most [important]{.mark} lessons [of]{.mark} the
[early years]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in both
conflicts]{.underline}.\[3\] This is not a new problem, but was analyzed
in depth by R.W. Komer in his RAND study of the Vietnam conflict,
"Bureaucracy Does its Thing." In Komer's analysis, he explains how large
organizations, the military included, tend to be slow to depart from
established beliefs and ways of doing things, and to reward conformity
rather than creative thinking. In the Vietnam War, the U.S. military
relied on a traditional war mindset that resulted in an overly
conventional and militaristic response when a more political
counterinsurgency response was needed. Komer recognized that the
civilian bureaucracies were just as stuck in their traditional mindsets
in the Vietnam War as the U.S. military. In particular, Komer points out
that the State Department deferred to traditional thinking on
civil-military relations and focused on diplomatic relations with the
South Vietnam government rather than becoming involved with ground
operations, despite the political nature of counterinsurgency missions.
In insurgencies, the military simply has more logistical capacity and
manpower to carry out nation building and development projects than
civilian agencies, and in many theaters it is too dangerous for
civilians to carry out this work. However, even as traditional war
becomes less and less common, there is still a lag as agencies are
unable and unwilling to change how they think of themselves that results
in inefficiencies that learning organizations like insurgencies can
exploit, despite their smaller traditional capacity. This is an
especially salient point considering that the U.S. military and foreign
policy bureaucracies have proven to have a short organizational memory
when it comes to non-traditional operations that fall out of the scope
of what these organizations consider to be their traditional roles. In
order to understand modern civil-military relations, it is important to
consider the role of the national security bureaucrats who increasingly
control national security policy more than elected political leaders.
According to Michael Glennon, [this has resulted in a double government
where the "dignified," institutions like the Congress and the Presidency
are a façade for the real decision making power wielded by career
national security professionals.]{.underline} This double government did
not emerge from conscious effort, but emerged overtime because of
systemic and legal incentives baked in the national security structures
of the United States. Glennon dubs this class of national security
officials and influencers an "efficient" class due to the relative
quickness they are able to work compared to the elected officials
publically thought to be in charge of national security policy. This
efficiency is especially important now that national security covers a
wide range of non-traditional threats like terrorism, piracy, and cyber
attack that require quick action and a wide range of expertise that
elected officials cannot match. Glennon points out that despite running
on a platform dedicated to changing the national security policies of
the Bush Administration, President Obama has continued most of the same
policies. The United States is a democracy, and as the head of the
executive branch, the American public expects the President to set the
national security agenda, so this double government has subverted U.S.
civil-military relations, even if the façade of Presidential leadership
remains. Another way that this situation has effected civil-military
relations is that some members of this efficient class are even taking
over the traditional military role of organizing violence. The best case
in point is the use of UAV strikes in counter-terror operations carried
out by the CIA. Under President Obama, the CIA has increased the number
of UAV strikes and covert operations, carrying out what should be
military operations.\[4\] [[As the]{.mark} security [environment]{.mark}
has **[evolved]{.mark}** and become more complex,]{.underline} theories
about
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ivil-**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ilitary
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**elations [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[vital]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark} [understand the complexity
of]{.mark} these [relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many older
theories still form a relevant core, such as Huntington's ideas about
military professionalism and objective civilian control, but are no
longer adequate to cover the evolving roles of both the civilians and
the military. As Komer has shown, [large organizations like the military
or the State Department are slow to change their conceptions of
themselves, and have difficulty in adapting to the new roles
that]{.underline} **[[modern "grey area" warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[demand]{.mark}. Even though these large institutions have
a]{.underline} **[hard time [adapting]{.mark}]{.underline}** to new
challenges, [[there is a]{.mark} [class of]{.mark} national security
[officials who operate **efficiently**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and as
shown by Glennon, are increasingly monopolizing national security
decision making, and in some cases the actual management of violence
itself. [[Situations as complex as these]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[require]{.mark} robust]{.underline}** theories and
**[frameworks]{.underline}** to analyze successfully, [and require
looking]{.underline} both [to]{.underline} traditional theorists as well

University of Pennsylvania State; Civil-Military Relations in
Perspective: Strategy, Structure and Policy, "Cyberwar and Nuclear
Crisis Management: Implications for Civil-Military Relations," Routledge

Other Implications

[The outcome of]{.underline} a [**[nuclear crisis]{.mark}**
management]{.underline} scenario [influenced by information operations
**may not be**]{.underline} a **[favorable]{.underline}** one.
[[Despite]{.mark} the [best efforts]{.mark} of crisis participants, the
dispute [may **degenerate** into]{.mark} a
**[nuclear]{.mark}**]{.underline} first **[[use]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or first strike by one side and retaliation by the other. In that
situation, [information operations by either, or both, [sides]{.mark}
might [make it]{.mark} more [difficult to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**limit** the war]{.mark} and bring it to a conclusion [before
**catastrophic destruction**]{.mark}]{.underline} and loss of life had
taken place. Although there are no such things as "small" nuclear wars,
compared to conventional wars, there can be different kinds of "nuclear"
wars, in terms of their proximate causes and consequences.20
Possibilities include: a nuclear attack from an unknown source; an
ambiguous case of possible, but not proved, nuclear first use; a nuclear
"test" detonation intended to intimidate but with no immediate
destruction; or, a conventional strike mistaken at least initially for a
nuclear one.21

The dominant scenario of a general nuclear war between the United States
and the Soviet Union preoccupied Cold War policy makers and, under that
assumption, concerns about escalation control and war termination were
swamped by apocalyptic visions of the end of days. The second nuclear
age, roughly coinciding with the end of the Cold War and the demise of
the Soviet Union, offers a more complicated menu of nuclear
possibilities and responses.22 Interest in the threat or use of nuclear
weapons by rogue states, by aspiring regional hegemons or by terrorists,
abetted by the possible spread of nuclear weapons among currently
nonnuclear weapons states, stretches the ingenuity of military planners
and fiction writers.

In addition to the world's worst characters engaged in nuclear threat or
first use, [there is also the possibility of backsliding in political
conditions as [between the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and
**Russia**]{.mark}, or **Russia and [China]{.mark}**, or **China and
[India]{.mark}**]{.underline} (among current nuclear weapons states).
[The nuclear "establishment" or P-5 thus includes cases of current
debellicism or pacification that depend upon the continuation of
favorable **political auguries**]{.underline} in regional or global
politics. [Politically [unthinkable conflicts]{.mark} of one decade have
a way of **[evolv]{.mark}ing** [into]{.mark} the **politically
[unavoidable wars]{.mark}** of another---World War I is instructive in
this regard.]{.underline} The war between Russia and Georgia in August,
2008 was a reminder that [local conflicts on regional **fault lines**
between **blocs** or major powers have the potential to **expand into
worse**]{.underline}. So, too, were the Balkan wars of Yugoslav
succession in the 1990s. In these cases, Russia's one-sided military
advantage relative to Georgia in 2008, and NATO's military power
relative to that of Bosnians of all stripes in 1995 and Serbia in 1999,
contributed to war termination without further international escalation.

Escalation of a conventional war into nuclear first use remains possible
where operational or tactical nuclear weapons have been deployed with
national or coalition armed forces. In allied NATO territory, the U.S.
deploys several hundred sub-strategic, air-delivered nuclear weapons
among bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Turkey.23
Russia probably retains several thousands of operational or tactical
nuclear weapons, including significant numbers deployed in western
Russia.24 The New START agreement, once ratified, establishes a notional
parity between the U.S. and Russia in nuclear systems of
intercontinental range.25 But U.S. and allied NATO superiority in
advanced technology, information-based conventional military power
leaves Russia heavily reliant on tactical nukes as compensation for
comparative weakness in non-nuclear forces. NATO's capitals breathed a
sigh of relief when Russia's officially approved Military Doctrine of
2010 did not seem to lower the bar for nuclear first use, compared to
previous editions.26

Russia's military doctrine indicates a willingness to engage in nuclear
first use in situations of extreme urgency for Russia, as defined by its
political leadership.27 And, despite evident superiority in conventional
forces relative to those of Russia, neither the United States nor NATO
is necessarily eager to get rid of their remaining sub-strategic nukes
deployed among American NATO allies. An expert panel convened by NATO to
set the stage for its 2010 review of the alliance's military doctrine
was carefully ambivalent on the issue of the alliance's forward deployed
nuclear weapons. The issue of negotiating away these weapons in return
for parallel concessions from Russia was left open for further
discussion. On the other hand, the NATO expert report underscored the
present majority sentiment of governments that these weapons provided a
necessary link in the chain of alliance deterrence options.28

[[Imagine]{.underline}]{.mark} now [the [**unfolding** of]{.mark} a
**[nuclear crisis]{.mark}** or]{.underline} the taking of a [decision

**on the threshold** of **nuclear first use**]{.underline}, or shortly

[difficulty of bringing **fighting to a halt** before a Europe-wide
**theater conflict** or a **strategic nuclear war**]{.underline}. All of
the previously cited [difficulties in crisis management **under the

[first use would be **compounded** by]{.underline} additional
[uncertainty and friction]{.underline} after the nuclear threshold had
been crossed.

Conclusion

[Optimistic expectations]{.underline} about the use of information
warfare to defeat or disrupt opponents on the conventional,
high-technology battlefield---in cases where nuclear complications do
not figure---[may be justified. On the other hand, where the shadow of
possible nuclear deterrence failure **hangs over the decision-making
process**]{.underline} between or among states in conflict, the
[infowarriors' efforts to obtain dominant battlespace knowledge may
**provoke** the opponent instead of deterring it]{.underline}. As
scholars and policy analysts Keir A. Lieber and Daryl G. Press, have
noted, with respect to U.S. superior performance at the sharp end of the
conventional RMA: "A central strategic puzzle of modern war is that the
tactics best suited to dominating the conventional battlefield are the
same ones most likely to trigger nuclear escalation."29

The objective of infowar in conventional warfare is to deny enemy forces
battlespace awareness and to obtain dominant awareness for oneself, as
the United States largely was able to do in the Gulf War of 1991.30 In a
crisis with nuclear weapons available to the side against which infowar
is used, crippling the foe's intelligence and command and control
systems is an objective possibly at variance with controlling conflict
and prevailing at an acceptable cost. And under some conditions of
nuclear crisis management, crippling the C4ISR of the foe may be
self-defeating. Deterrence, whether it is based on the credible threat
of denial or retaliation, must be successfully communicated to---and
believed by---the other side.31 Whether nuclear or other deterrence can
work in a particular context is more dependent upon political, as
opposed to military, variables.32

As Mackubin Thomas Owens has emphasized, [[the **essential
problematique**]{.underline} [of U.S.
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}[ivil-**[m]{.mark}**ilitary
**[r]{.mark}**elations is to [**combine** the **requirement for military

need for]{.mark} military **[preparedness]{.mark} for

**[effectiveness]{.underline}** in combat.33 The literature of
civil-military relations, as in the case of other academic and policy
studies, is mostly based in a pre-cyber world in which decision time and
military operations moved more slowly than currently, and prospectively.
In addition, [[cyber tech]{.mark}nology and information related concepts

Opportunities for Civil Affairs,\" Small Wars Journal,

What have we learned from sixteen years of trying to consolidate
hard-won battlefield gains and stabilize conflict-affected areas? How
can we apply those lessons to better support our defense, diplomatic,
and development officials on the frontlines in the future? And how can
we show a better return on investment for U.S. taxpayers back at home
who are understandably skeptical? Those were the questions that guided
the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of State (State), and U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID) to undertake the
Stabilization Assistance Review (SAR) in the summer of 2017. The
incoming U.S. Administration made clear that it wanted a new approach to
how the United States engages in conflict-affected areas. They wanted
more discipline in how we use our resources and they expected our
partners to share more of the burden.

The SAR resulted in a new policy framework, entitled "[A **Framework**
for **Maximizing** the **Effectiveness** of U.S. Government Efforts to
**Stabilize** **Conflict-Affected Areas**]{.underline}," which was
endorsed by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and USAID
Administrator as well as the National Security Council staff in
mid-2018. The SAR framework has also been hailed by wide-ranging
audiences from the Government Accountability Office to the Special
Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to the Alliance for
Peacebuilding. Perhaps most importantly, it has garnered support from
key Congressional committees. In the Fiscal Year 2019 State and USAID
appropriations bill, the Senate Appropriations Committee -- for the
first time -- directed specific funding [for "**stabilization
assistance**"]{.underline} and stipulated that assistance should be used
for programs and activities in line with the SAR framework.

Secretary Mattis, Secretary Pompeo, and Administrator Green have
directed DoD, State, and USAID to work on implementing the SAR framework
and mainstreaming the core principles into policy and practice.
Accordingly, we are working to ensure that the strategies and assistance
plans for priority conflict-affected countries and regions -- such as
Iraq, Libya, and Somalia -- reflect the SAR's principles. We are also
working to ensure that our U.S. embassies, country teams, and military
units deployed in those places have the tools and support they need to
apply the SAR framework.

The momentum created by the SAR presents a significant opportunity for
especially **[civil affairs]{.underline}** as it works to elevate its
profile and renew its capabilities. However, seizing this opportunity
[will require fundamental new ways of thinking about how **civil
affairs** and other **DoD elements** work alongside]{.underline} State,
USAID, and other [**civilian partners**; how DoD structures **security
cooperation** with host-nation security partners; and how the U.S.
government ultimately measures and defines success]{.underline}.

Why Stabilization is a Strategic Imperative

The National Security Strategy (2017) highlights that the United States
continues to face threats from weak and failing states. Despite global
gains in prosperity, [**armed conflicts** in many parts of the world --
particularly **internationalized** and **non-state conflicts** -- have
**increased** and become more **complex**]{.underline} over the past
decade. U.S. and partnered forces have struggled to consolidate
battlefield gains [against **ISIS** and other **transnational terrorist
groups** amidst **persistent levels** of **conflict** and
**instability**]{.underline}.

[The **human** and **financial costs** of these **conflicts** are
**staggering**]{.underline}. More people today are displaced due to
conflict than any time since World War II. Over the past five years
alone, overall international humanitarian funding requirements have
increased by an estimated 70 percent. At the same time, international
peacekeeping costs have also surged. A significant proportion of the
U.S. and international foreign assistance budget continues to be
dedicated toward these conflict-prone areas; although, according to a
recent OECD report, less than 10 percent of that funding is devoted to
conflict mitigation and peacebuilding.

This [status quo is **untenable** on]{.underline} several levels. More
focus is needed on [**resolving conflicts** and **restoring peace** and
**stability**, vice **responding to crises**]{.underline}. And yet this
must be done in a more cost-efficient way. There is declining public
appetite in the United States and broader international community [to
intervene and engage in industrial-scale **reconstruction
efforts**]{.underline}. Taxpayers in the United States and other parts
of the world are understandably wary of open-ended commitments. New ways
of thinking about these challenges are needed.

In its initial months, the current U.S. Administration convened a policy
planning process to rethink U.S. efforts [to address **fragility** and
**instability**]{.underline}. This process quickly affirmed the
[**imperative** for **stabilization**]{.underline} to consolidate
security gains, particularly [in **ISIS-affected areas**]{.underline}.
However, the process acknowledged the need for a new, leaner approach to
stabilization focused on defined outcomes and increased international
burden-sharing. In this context, DoD, State, and USAID initiated the SAR
to mobilize lessons learned and formulate such an approach.

The SAR: Something Old, Something New

The SAR identified ten core lessons for effective stabilization (see
below). Many of the lessons are not new. They are drawn from countless
DoD studies (i.e., the Chairman of Joint Chiefs' Decade of War study
from 2012), multiple Inspector General lessons learned reports from
Afghanistan and Iraq, and a wide body of peacebuilding literature. As we
reviewed the vast volumes of reports and talked to hundreds of conflict
experts for the SAR, we were struck by the overwhelming consensus about
the [core principles of effective **stabilization**: focusing on the
**political dynamics** driving conflict, **targeting** and **layering
assistance** to bolster **legitimate authorities**, cultivating
**host-nation partner ownership**, and fostering **unity of effort**,
especially across **civilian** and **military actors**]{.underline}.

SAR's Ten Lessons for Effective Stabilization

1\. Set realistic, analytically backed political goals.

2\. Establish a division of labor and burden-sharing among international
donors that optimizes the strengths of each.

3\. Use data and evaluation systems to assess strategic progress and
hold partners accountable.

4\. Forward deploy U.S. Government and partnered civilians and establish
local mechanisms that enable continuous engagement, negotiation,
targeted assistance, and monitoring.

5\. Start with small, short-term assistance projects and scale up
cautiously.

6\. Prioritize, layer, and sequence foreign assistance to advance
stabilization goals.

7\. Link subnational engagements with national diplomacy to advance
stabilization.

8\. Reinforce pockets of citizen security and purposefully engage with
security actors.

9\. Seek unity of purpose across all lines of effort.

10\. Employ strategic patience and plan beyond stabilization for
self-reliance.

What quickly became clear during the SAR is that while these principles
have been widely studied, they have not been systematically applied and
institutionalized in practice. In this regard, **[process
matters]{.underline}**. Secretary Mattis once said, "If you take good
people and good ideas and you match them with bad processes, the bad
processes will win nine of out of ten times." Accordingly, the SAR
framework focuses less on what stabilization entails and more on how we
pursue it as an interagency team.

Our first step was to ensure that our Departments and Agencies have a
shared vision of what we are trying to accomplish with stabilization and
a clear sense of our roles and responsibilities. For the first time, the
SAR framework establishes an agreed U.S. government definition of
[stabilization: a political endeavor involving an **integrated
civilian-military process** to create conditions where locally
legitimate authorities and systems can peaceably **manage conflict** and
**prevent** a **resurgence of violence**]{.underline}. Transitional in
nature, [stabilization may include efforts to establish civil security,
provide access to dispute resolution, deliver targeted basic services,
and establish a foundation for the return of displaced people and
longer-term development.]{.underline} The SAR framework also defines
State as the overall lead federal agency for U.S. stabilization efforts;
USAID as the lead implementing agency for non-security U.S.
stabilization assistance; and, [DoD]{.underline} as a supporting
element, to include [providing requisite security and **reinforcing
civilian efforts** where appropriate]{.underline}.

The SAR's clear articulation of DoD as a supporting element is a
significant new development and reflects the evolving thinking in the
Pentagon following the Biennial Review of Stability Operations last
year. There is an ongoing effort to update DoD Instruction 3000.05 to
reflect this new "defense support to stabilization" approach and to
elevate it to a DoD Directive. The draft Directive states clearly,
"[**Stabilization** must be **incorporated** into planning across all
lines of effort for **military operations** as early as possible to
**shape operational design** and **strategic decisions**]{.underline}."
The Directive further states, "DoD's core responsibility during
stabilization is to support and reinforce the civilian efforts of the
USG lead agencies consistent with available statutory authorities..."

Meanwhile, State and USAID are taking initial steps to evaluate and
upgrade their capabilities to perform leadership roles in stabilization
efforts. State's Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations is
convening stakeholders to establish planning guidelines and tools for
U.S. embassies in conflict-affected areas. As part of an agency
transformation, USAID is proposing to establish a new Bureau of Conflict
Prevention and Stabilization, which will incorporate and elevate the
important role played by the Office of Transition Initiatives. USAID
will work to mainstream certain core principles into how it works across
fragile and conflict-affected areas.

Integrating Civil Affairs with State and DoD to Advance Stabilization

At the heart of the SAR's stabilization definition is the recognition
that [stabilization must involve an "**integrated civilian-military
process**" at the **strategic**, **operational** and **tactical
levels**]{.underline}. While DoD plays a supporting role during
stabilization, [it is **imperative** that **all elements** of **national
power** -- both **military** and **civilian** -- are **synchronized**
during these **complex crises**]{.underline}. These [civil-military
connections]{.underline} are well-honed [in]{.underline} the
humanitarian assistance space, but [**integrating stabilization
efforts** remains **ad hoc** and **unrefined**]{.underline}. This
imperative requires new capabilities, authorities and approaches.

As the SAR continues to integrate through the Doctrine, Organization,
Training, Materiel, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities and Policy
(DOTMLPF-P) process, [**civil affairs** has a **key role** from the
strategic to the tactical levels in enabling **collaborative**
interagency and inter-organizational structures and **processes**
necessary to support more **effective** and **efficient stabilization**
endeavors]{.underline}. The integration of the SAR principles into DoD's
new Stabilization Directive 3000.05 combined with the new release of the
Army Civil Affairs Operations manual (FM 3-57) provides an opportunity
to develop DoD's support to civilian stabilization efforts, and to
strengthen civil-military engagement across State, USAID, and DoD.

Although the United States attempted to create a unified stabilization
strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan that would sequence and transition
security, governance, and development lines of efforts, there remain
abundant challenges to ensuring a "whole of government" approach across
different conflict and contingency environments. DoD's "shape, clear,
hold, and build" counter-insurgency framework recognized the importance
of sequencing necessary to drive security objectives and create space
for governance and economic development. Yet, interagency integration of
sequenced objectives and resourcing at the local levels was less clear
and often not linked across security, governance, and development gains.
[There is a need for more **coordinated planning** and **operations**
that **better align** **civilian** and **military efforts**]{.underline}
around bottom-up, locally-owned approaches to ensure host government
accountability and citizen participation.

As the national strategic capability for civil-military transition and
conflict management within DoD, civil affairs is the natural partner for
State and USAID civilian stabilization efforts. As emphasized at Civil
Affairs Association symposia we have participated in, [CA is an
**indispensable** strategic **conflict management capability** for U.S.
interagency, Joint, and Army missions across the full range of
operations. For the Army in particular, it is an **essential
capability** in each of the Army's four **strategic roles** (**shape**,
**prevent**, **prevail** in large scale combat operations, and
**consolidate gains**).]{.underline}

[Among its critical roles in interagency stabilization is
**civil-military integration**. Civil affairs forces **regularly cross**
the **civilian-military divide** at the **operational** and **tactical
levels**]{.underline}. Their [capabilities]{.underline} and access both
into commands and locally on the ground can [provide a unifying
civil-military platform for strengthened **communication**,
**coordination**, and **collaboration** between
**security**]{.underline}, **[development]{.underline}**, and
**[diplomatic efforts]{.underline}**. However, [this integration needs
to be **standardized** through **integrated civil-military training**
and **exercises**, standard **operating procedures**, and **new
doctrine**. Strengthened joint and **synchronized** civil-military
capabilities are **required** across the strategic, operational, and
tactical levels to deepen **coordinated planning**, align resources,
build a common operating picture, and **enable
interoperability**.]{.underline}

Synchronization of civil-military efforts necessitates a careful review
of civil affairs core competencies and how they can reinforce
comparative advantages and minimize overlapping functions with State and
USAID capabilities. In line with the new DoD Directive 3000.05, civil
affairs should work to ensure mechanisms are in place to enable
civilians to be engaged and integrated into civil affairs operations
during every stage of planning and implementing stability operations. At
the same time, State and USAID need to ensure that civil affairs
planners are incorporated into country-level stabilization planning
processes from the outset to align with overarching political outcomes,
identify common theories of change, and to sequence diplomatic,
development, and security activities.

During execution, SAR principles highlight the importance of an
integrated approach that can monitor both the desired political outcomes
and whether desired theories of change impact those outcomes. Increasing
civil-military interoperability for knowledge management, co-deployment,
and information sharing will prove to be a key operational and tactical
challenge. Merging Civil Information Management (CIM) capabilities and
functions, especially to ensure information is available on unclassified
systems, will play a critical role in building a common operating
picture. Furthermore, the SAR provides recognition that [it is
**critical** to have **civilian experts** on the ground working
alongside our **military colleagues** to enable a **unified**,
**civilian-led approach** that can **appropriately layer** and
**sequence security** and **non-security assistance**]{.underline}.
Working alongside civil affairs teams will enable State and USAID access
and visibility for difficult to reach areas critical to adequately plan,
monitor, and assess local conditions vital to furthering stabilization
objectives.

The Syria Transition Assistance Response Team -- Forward (START-FWD)
provides a good model for future endeavors. Recognizing the necessity to
co-deploy State and USAID civilians with military forces to plan and
monitor stabilization, humanitarian assistance and diplomacy activities
with local partners, the Civil Military Support Element (CMSE) provided
critical administrative and operational support to the Special
Operations Joint Task Force -- Operation Inherent Resolve (SOJTF-OIR)
for START-FWD. To address differences between State and USAID
authorities and mandates for START-FWD versus those that governed Iraq
and Afghanistan Provincial Reconstruction Teams, the CMSE helped develop
innovative solutions that allowed DoD to provide security and life
support requirements under both Title X and Title XXII authorities. This
produced an operational blueprint that is now feeding into an
interagency process to standardize co-deployment of civilians alongside
DoD elements in non- and semi-permissive environments.

To reinforce and facilitate this integrated approach, the Office of the
Secretary of Defense is pursuing a new legislative proposal in Fiscal
Year 2020 that would establish a targeted authority for the Secretary of
Defense, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in
consultation with the USAID Administrator, to support designated U.S.
Government stabilization efforts by providing logistic support,
supplies, services, and training to other U.S. departments and agencies.
It would also allow the Secretary of Defense to conduct transitional
stabilization activities in the interest of U.S. national security with
the concurrence of the Secretary of State and in consultation with the
USAID Administrator. DoD's existing humanitarian assistance authorities
enable civil-military collaboration to address humanitarian needs in
contingency environments but cannot fund crucial stabilization
activities such as minor repairs to electrical, water or sewage lines,
supporting local councils or removing rubble so that long-term
development efforts can begin. This new authority -- if approved by
Congress -- would change that.

New Models for Security Cooperation in Conflict-Affected Areas

The provision of [security and justice]{.underline} -- and how that is
perceived -- is at the heart of many of the conflicts that we see today.
The SAR report highlights that the U.S. government and international
community continues to devote substantial amounts of [**security sector
training** and **assistance** to some of the most **conflict-prone
countries**.]{.underline} For example, over the past four years, the top
fifteen bilateral recipients of U.S. security sector assistance have
included at least nine countries where we have been engaged in
stabilization in recent years. This includes - in no particular order:
[**Afghanistan**, **Colombia**, **Iraq**, **Lebanon**, **Pakistan**, the
**Philippines**, **Somalia**, **Syria**, and **Ukraine**]{.underline}.
However, the SAR report notes that security sector assistance programs
in many of these countries are often disconnected from political
stabilization strategies and do not address the primary drivers of
conflict.

The SAR [calls for]{.underline} more programs to focus on the
[**civil-military aspects** required for **transitional public** and
**citizen security**. Civil affairs]{.underline} has significant
expertise in this regard, which [needs to be **elevated**
in]{.underline} ongoing **[security cooperation]{.underline}** plans and
programs. In some cases, this could mean [incorporating civil affairs
perspectives and capabilities into existing training and mentoring
programs.]{.underline} In other cases, it could mean dedicated programs
to help partner nation forces to develop their own civil-military
operations capabilities. The UN has developed some capacity in this
regard, but their efforts are limited to those places where peacekeeping
missions are actively deployed. Many of these efforts [also require
greater engagement with **non-military elements** providing **civilian
security**, such as **local law enforcement**]{.underline}. In those
cases, it's important that DoD coordinate more closely with State and
USAID actors who are leading engagement with these non-military
elements. [**Civil affairs** can provide a **critical bridge** in this
respect]{.underline}.

The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act initiated major changes
in how DoD, in partnership with State, undertakes security cooperation
activities. This included consolidating and expanding several funding
authorities, elevating the importance of defense institution building,
and establishing new requirements for DoD to develop a dedicated
security cooperation workforce. Efforts are underway, led by the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency, to implement these reforms. [As the new
security cooperation processes and frameworks are put into place, it is
**critical** that they **institutionalize** lessons learned for
**conflict-sensitive approaches**]{.underline}. More focus needs to be
placed on how we can help security forces to secure population centers
and restore trust with local communities.

Rethinking Stabilization Success

At its core, the SAR calls for rethinking the way the U.S. government
measures success in stabilization environments. It is not enough to just
count completion of projects, number of people engaged, and other
output-based indicators. If stabilization is a fundamentally political
endeavor, we need to think rigorously about how our collective efforts
are making progress toward defined political end states. This requires
better metrics, indicators, and analytics to assess on a routine basis
how the political economy is changing in conflict-affected areas. It
also requires better indicators to assess the level of commitment and
buy-in from our partners. The SAR makes clear that the United States
will expect our host-nation partners to take greater ownership over
these efforts and our international partners to share more of the
burden. [Civil affairs can play an **important role**]{.underline} in
helping to develop these metrics and to incorporate them into ongoing
operations.

One of the things we heard over and over again as we conducted the
review is that we need to be more realistic about what success looks
like in places like Afghanistan or Somalia. Rather than focusing on
broad state-building efforts, the U.S. government, host nation, and
other partners should target those dynamics that are fundamental to
establishing basic peace and stability. The [goal of stabilization is
not to remake societies, but to help those with **legitimacy** to
**peaceably manage conflict**]{.underline}. This approach requires more
humility and more realism as we work to understand the dynamics in
places where we are operating and how we can influence them.

Conclusion

As we completed the SAR, far more than breaking new intellectual ground,
we were more interested in breaking bureaucratic barriers. The lessons
learned from stabilization efforts have been widely studied and written
about, including among civil affairs forces. The challenge remains how
to apply and institutionalize those lessons within our organizational
structures and ways of doing business. We need to create more incentives
for strategic discipline, integration, and accountability in how we work
together across the U.S. government and with our partners in
conflict-affected areas. We need new mindsets and ways of thinking about
success.

The SAR has garnered significant interest and enthusiasm from key
elements across the U.S. Administration, Congress, and non-governmental
communities. Now comes the hard part of trying to translate that
momentum into lasting reforms. As this process moves forward, the civil
affairs regiment can lead the way by integrating new approaches at the
strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Working together, we can
reinforce the importance of civil affairs and position the United States
to "secure the victory" in the years ahead.

[The world seems to be getting more dangerous]{.underline}. Terrorism
and the 'war on terrorism' are straining relations between Muslims and
the West. [Despite interstate wars being in decline, five attacks by a
state on another have occurred in the new century. [Competition]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} oil and other essential natural [resources]{.mark} [makes
**inter-state wars**]{.mark} over territory]{.underline}, viewed as a
thing of the past (John Mueller, 1989), [[more imaginable]{.mark}.
[Confrontations over **nuclear**]{.mark} [**weapons** have arisen with
**North Korea** and]{.mark} **[Iran]{.mark}**. Longstanding [arms
control]{.mark} regimes are [unraveling]{.mark}. Further **[intra-state
conflicts]{.mark}** [could erupt]{.mark}, as closed regimes face violent
oppositions; [fledgling **democracies** destabilize]{.mark};
[and]{.mark} post-conflict countries [fall back]{.mark} [into
war]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gurr and Marshall, 2005). [Trends such as
[**environmental degradation**, **climate**]{.mark} [**change**,
**population growth**]{.mark}, chronic **[poverty]{.mark}**,
**[globalization]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} increasing [**inequality**
risk]{.mark} [future conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., CNA, 2007).
[Facing such threats, [governments]{.mark}]{.underline} and
international bodies [[could]{.mark} be pursuing how to [**prevent
escalation** of]{.mark} emerging [tensions into]{.mark}
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus avoiding the immense human suffering
and problems that wars always cause, both for the countries involved and
the rest of the world. 1 Compared to the huge costs of war, the costs of
preventing it are dramatically less. 2 Many people are convinced the
horrific human costs of the current Iraq War were avoidable.
[**[Statistical research]{.mark}** on third-party diplomacy also
[supports]{.mark} the belief [that acting]{.mark} [before]{.mark} high
levels of [conflict]{.mark} intensity [is better]{.mark} [than trying to
end them]{.mark}]{.underline} (Miall, 1992: 126; Berkovitch, 1986, 1991,
1993). 3 [To try to head off more future conflicts seems
possible]{.underline}, moreover, [for armed conflict has
declined]{.underline} since the end of the Cold War, in part [because of
an 'extraordinary upsurge of activism by the international community
that has been directed to conflict prevention]{.underline}, peacemaking,
and peacebuilding' (Human Security Report, 2005: 155). 4 Indeed,
conflict prevention is now official policy in the UN, the EU, the G-8,
and many states (Moolak, 2005: G-8). [It has been tried in places where
the risk of conflict was present but they were averted, such as
SouthAfrica, Macedonia, the Baltics, Crimea, and the South China
Sea]{.underline}. 5 In short, prevention is not simply a high ideal, but
a prudent option that sometimes works (cf. Jentelson, 1996; Zartman,
2001: 305f; Miall, 2007: 7,16,17). Given the evidence that inaction is
wasteful and preventive labors can bear fruit, [international actors
could be]{.underline} collecting and [applying what has been
learned]{.underline} from recent experience [to manage the tensions
around the world from which future conflicts will emerge:
[mitigating]{.mark} sources of **[terrorism]{.mark}** and extremism;
[averting **genocides**]{.mark} and other mass atrocities; [buttressing
fragile governments]{.mark}; [reducing **w**]{.mark}eapons of
**[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction; [alleviating]{.mark}
[competition over **oil** and **water**]{.mark}; [and]{.mark}
[defusing]{.mark} inter-state [rivalries such as **China**]{.mark}--
[**Taiwan** and among the **major powers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
these actors show little interest in building on recent accomplishments
to reduce the current risks (e.g., the deterioration of Zimbabwe and
possible renewed war between Ethiopia and Eritrea). 6 Why this apparent
gap exists between the promise of conflict prevention and its more
deliberate pursuit is the puzzle this chapter seeks to unravel. 7 The
following sections seek to get beyond conventional answers by examining
three facets of conflict prevention that define its current status:
concepts, activities, and impacts. The conclusion sums up the state of
the art and offers ideas to advance it. WHAT IS CONFLICT PREVENTION? A
DISTINCT PERSPECTIVE As the idea has come into vogue, 'conflict
prevention' and synonyms such as 'preventive diplomacy' and 'crisis
prevention' are bandied about more loosely. New government units and
non-governmental organizations have sprung up that tout the term in
their logos. To be au courant, established organizations add it to
mission statements. But though 'conflict prevention' may now be heard
more often than the previously dominant 'conflict resolution,' it is not
clear whether the activities carried out under this new rubric are
actually new. Despite the ambiguity due to the idea's rise to fame,
however, close analysts have hammered out a core definition. Knowledge
can cumulate when people use the same terms for inquiry. Conflict
prevention applies to peaceful situations where substantial physical
violence is possible, based on typical indicators of rising hostilities.
Everyday spates where no blood is spilled, or public controversies that
get so rancorous that social groups stop communicating are socially
unhealthy, but much less grievous than states or groups about to kill
each other with deadly weapons. 8 A coup d'etat is less grave than the
genocide of hundreds of thousands of people. 9 Though thus narrowed to
conflicts with potentially wide lethality (hereafter 'conflicts' for
short), specialists' definitions have varied in two main respects: a)
the stage or phase during the emergence of violence when prevention
comes into play; and b) its methods of engagement, which are geared to
the differing drivers of potential conflicts that preventive efforts
address. 10 Moments for prevention Conflict prevention has been
distinguished from other approaches to conflict mainly by when it comes
into play during a conflict, not how it is done. When UN Secretary
General Hammerskjold first coined 'preventive diplomacy' in 1960, he had
in mind the UN keeping superpower proxy wars in thirdworld countries
from escalating into global confrontations. When the end of the Cold War
brought unexpected intra-state wars such as in Yugoslavia, UN Secretary
General Boutros- Ghali extended Hammerskjold's term in an upstream
direction to mean not simply keeping regional conflicts from going
global, but from starting in the first place (UN, 1992). This conceptual
breakthrough shifted the moment for taking action back to stages when
non-violent disputes were emerging but had not escalated into
significant violence or armed conflict. Just how far back in the
etiology of conflicts might preventive action go to work? Leaving the
pre-violent period open to a possible infinite regress might extend it
to to causes as primordial as original sin or as dispersed as
child-rearing practices, thus dooming the concept to impracticality. 11
To mark a beginning point when preemptive actions first become
practicable, Peck (1995) usefully delineated early and late prevention.
The former seeks to improve the relationship of parties or states that
are not actively fighting but deeply estranged. Left unaddressed, such
latent animosities might revert to the use of force as soon as a crisis
arose. 12 Late prevention pertains to when fighting among specific
parties appears imminent. Boutros-Ghali also extended conflict
prevention downstream to actions to keep violent conflicts from
spreading to more places. But because such 'horizontal' escalation
seemed to go beyond averting the rise to violence ('vertical'
escalation) and thus to include containing open warfare, some analysts
worried that it implied suppressing physical violence at any subsequent
stage in an armed conflict. This would conflate it too easily with
actions in the middle of wars (even though Boutros-Ghali offered the
separate term 'peacemaking' for those). Bringing prevention into the
realm of active wars would eclipse its proactive nature behind the
conventional interventions that occur late in conflicts, for which terms
like conflict management, peace enforcement or peacekeeping were more
fitting. This merging would vitiate the pre-emptive uniqueness of
prevention compared to those other concepts (cf. Lund, 1996). It would
forego the opportunity to test the central premise that had animated
this new post-Cold War notion: that [acting before violent conflicts
fully breaks out is likely to be more effective than acting on a war in
progress]{.underline}. To think of prevention as occurring while wars
are already waging not only disregards most people's connotation of
'prevention,' but would relegate the international community to
remediating costly war after costly war in a perpetual game of catchup,
foregoing the chance to ever get ahead of the game. While some analysts
continued to apply prevention to any subsequent level of violent
conflict (Leatherman et al. 1999), most now confine it to actions to
avoid the eruption of social and political disputes into substantial
violence, keeping the emphasis squarely on stages before, rather than
during violent conflicts. In particular, the focus of this chapter is
'primary prevention' of prospective new or 'virgin' conflicts, where a
peaceful equilibrium has prevailed for some years, but fundamental
social and/or global forces are producing new controversies, tensions
and disputes. 13 [However, imperative [later interventions]{.mark} are
for minimizing loss of life, they [are]{.mark} less humane and likely
[more difficult]{.mark} [because]{.mark} the [antagonists are]{.mark}
organized, armed, and deeply [invested in destroying each]{.mark}
[other]{.mark}]{.underline}. 14 Graph 15.1 locates this particular
moment in conditions of unstable peace and distinguishes it from actions
at other conflict stages. Methods of prevention Notions of prevention
have also varied with regard to the means of engagement, but here too a
consensus has emerged. The tools used depend on which causes of conflict
are targeted, and thus which providers of tools get involved.
Boutros-Ghali listed early warning, mediation, confidencebuilding
measures, fact-finding, preventive deployment, and peace zones. But
subsequent UN policy papers of the 1990s (e.g., 'Agenda for
Development') greatly expanded preventive measures to a panoply of
policies that address the institutional, socio-economic, and global
environment within which conflicting actors operate -- as diverse as
humanitarian aid, arms control, social welfare, military deployment, and
media. 15 It can now involve almost any policy sector, whether labeled
conflict prevention or not. Recent UN usage of **[['preventive
action']{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., Rubin, 2004)
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[better suited to this range
of]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially useful modalities. [[Direct and
structural instruments]{.underline}]{.mark} To classify its array of
methods, intercessory initiatives aimed at particular actors in manifest
conflicts are distinguished from [[efforts to **shape underlying
socio-economic**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**conditions and political
institutions** and processes]{.underline}]{.mark}. The former 'direct,'
'operational,' or 'light' prevention (Miall, 2004) is more
time-sensitive and actor- or event-focused -- for example, diplomatic
demarches, mediation, training in non-violence, or military deterrence
-- and seeks to keep divisive expressions of manifest conflicts from
escalating, and thus it targets specific parties and the issues between
them. 16 Integral also is 'structural' or 'deep' prevention, meaning
actions or policies that [[address deeper]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[societal conditions that generate conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}
[between interests and/or the institutional]{.underline}, [procedural
and policy deficits or capacities]{.underline} [that determine whether
competing interests]{.underline} [are channeled and mutually adjusted
peacefully]{.underline}. These more basic factors make up the
environment within which contending actors operate and thus policies
toward them can create constraints or opportunities that shape what the
actors do. [Diverse examples]{.underline} [are [reducing]{.mark} gross
regional [disparities]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in living standards,
reforming exploitative]{.underline}]{.mark} [[agricultural policies, and
building effective]{.underline}]{.mark} [governing
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. 17 [[These
structural]{.underline}]{.mark} [[targets make prevention more than
simply]{.underline}]{.mark} [[avoiding violence]{.mark}, or 'negative
peace,' [but]{.mark}]{.underline} [[rather **aspiring to positive
peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In pragmatic terms, it means [[being able
to meet the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[inevitable arrival of disruptive
social and]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[**global forces** with the ability
to **bring about**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[change
peaceably]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf. Miall, 2007). In recent years, for
example, it conflict prevention has been integral to the larger
post-Cold War agenda of creating peaceful democratic states out of
societies in transition from authoritarianism and patrimonialism (Lund,
2006).

### 2nc -- at: leaks

#### Leaks don't undermine intel, damage diplomacy, or cause enduring harm to relations

Mark **Fenster 17**, Stephen C. O\'Connell Chair at the Levin College of
Law, "8 The Disappointment of Megaleaks," The Transparency Fix: Secrets,
Leaks, and Uncontrollable Government Information, Stanford Law Books, an
imprint of Stanford University Press, 2017, pp. 174--192

In the aftermath of the [disclosures]{.underline}, U.S. military
officials concluded that they had both a legal and moral duty to reach
out to the informants who had been outed. As a result, the military
conducted operations to notify the informants that their covers had been
compromised.25 These operations often raised suspicion about the
informant and compelled substantial alteration or termination of the
informant's mission.26 Additionally, the disclosures caused backlash
against U.S. anti-proliferation efforts in Pakistan.27 Pakistani
officials had previously cooperated with U.S. officers to reclaim
enriched uranium from Pakistan, but they were less willing to do so
after Pakistani citizens and groups criticized their government for
collaborating with the United States.28

But these **[damages]{.underline}** [were]{.underline}
**[limited]{.underline}**. **[No corroborated incident]{.underline}**
[has come to light demonstrating that a document]{.underline} that
WikiLeaks [released caused significant **physical damage**]{.underline}
[to the U.S. military or **directly** and significantly damaged the
**diplomatic efforts**]{.underline} [of the United
States]{.underline}.29 [The prosecution **did not present
evidence**]{.underline} at Manning's court martial [that anyone had
**died in reprisal**]{.underline} following the disclosures.30 Defense
Secretary Robert **[Gates]{.underline}**, [who had
complained]{.underline} in July 2010 that Wiki[**Leaks** would have
"potentially dramatic and grievously harmful consequences,"]{.underline}
31 [concluded]{.underline} **[less than three months
later]{.underline}** [that the disclosures **did not reveal any
sensitive intelligence methods or sources**]{.underline}.32 Although
Gates continued to warn about attacks against individuals named in the
documents, a NATO official interviewed at the same time denied that any
such attacks happened.33

[Doubts that]{.underline} WikiLeaks' [disclosures would directly affect
military operations and individual lives cannot alleviate the **fear**
that such effects occurred later or could occur in the
**future**;]{.underline} [but they **do suggest that the assumption that
such effects would necessarily follow**]{.underline}---an assumption
made by military officials and conservative political figures---**[was
unwarranted]{.underline}**. Although it is difficult to assess the
significance of such threats without access to intelligence stating
otherwise, [WikiLeaks']{.underline} [disclosures and their aftermath at
**least** suggest that the **risk** of disclosure is just that---a
**risk**]{.underline} [that does not constitute a **necessary** and
**essential** effect of disclosure]{.underline}.34

However, the indirect effects of the WikiLeaks' disclosures on military
operations are more certain. The leaks required the Pentagon and
intelligence analysts to assess the potential harm of the documents
WikiLeaks released and to mitigate them as much as possible. At Chelsea
Manning's court martial, a military analyst testifying for the
prosecution stated that her unit was forced to spend nearly 1,000
man-hours, at a cost of \$200,000, to assess and analyze the impact of
the released documents, diverting resources from other activities in
Afghanistan.35 Other military and intelligence bureaucracies undoubtedly
also expended resources to review the disclosures, as the enormous
organizational machinery of which Manning was a part reacted to the
release of the information it had produced.36 The disclosure's adverse
effects on the U.S. military's reputation abroad likely also had
material effects on the security of troops stationed in Iraq and
elsewhere, raising the costs of those military engagements.

WikiLeaks' Direct and Indirect Effects on Diplomatic Relations

[The claim that disclosures would affect the]{.underline} **[State
Department]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} U.S.
**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [relations]{.underline} [exhibits a
**similar dynamic**]{.underline}. On the eve of the release of the
diplomatic cables, Harold Koh, the State Department's legal advisor,
warned Assange in a letter made public that WikiLeaks' planned
disclosure violated U.S. law; [Koh complained of the certain increased
danger that the disclosure of diplomatic cables would create for
innocent civilians named in the documents, for ongoing military
operations, and for cooperation and **relations**]{.underline} between
the United States and other nations.37 The State Department [also warned
hundreds of **human rights activists**]{.underline}, officials of
foreign governments, and businesspeople who were identified in the
diplomatic cables of the threats their identification might create for
them.38

[Again, however, **no clear evidence has come to light of any direct ill
effects the disclosures have caused**]{.underline}, and while it may
have, in Koh's words, "endanger\[ed\] the lives of countless
individuals," it seems not to have caused any deaths. [Administration
officials did not publicly identify any additional **harassment** that
its sources experienced]{.underline} as a result of the WikiLeaks'
disclosures.39 [The U.S. **ambassador to Mexico**]{.underline} [was
forced to resign after the release of cables in which he criticized the
Mexican government's efforts to fight drug trafficking]{.underline},40
[and the ambassador to **Ecuador**]{.underline} [was]{.underline}
**[expelled]{.underline}** after the release of her cable complaining of
widespread corruption among that country's police force.41 [The
ambassadors were **punished**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
**[accurately reporting]{.underline}** to Washington **[open
secrets]{.underline}** [about the nations where they were
stationed---that is, for being **exposed doing their
jobs.**]{.underline} [But]{.underline} **[no direct harm was traced to
the cables]{.underline}**. [The disclosures did not seem to permanently
damage U.S.--Mexico **relations**]{.underline}, [and the cable's
disclosure did not permanently damage the **already-strained**
relationship between the United States and **Ecuador**]{.underline}, as
[the countries **reestablished diplomatic relations within five
months**]{.underline} of the initial explusion.42

#### Leaks don't cause any intelligence failures

Mark **Fenster 17**, Stephen C. O\'Connell Chair at the Levin College of
Law, "8 The Disappointment of Megaleaks," The Transparency Fix: Secrets,
Leaks, and Uncontrollable Government Information, Stanford Law Books, an
imprint of Stanford University Press, 2017, pp. 174--192

If the case for a positive "**[Snowden]{.underline}** effect" therefore
is stronger than the one for Chelsea Manning and WikiLeaks, [critics
claim]{.underline} that it also [created significant **dangers** in the
**fight against terror**]{.underline}. The NSA and White House warned
about the Snowden leaks immediately after they began. Senator Dianne
Feinstein, a Democrat from the reliably liberal and tech-friendly state
of California, even called Snowden's actions treasonous.111 In a
February 2015 news conference, NSA Director Admiral Mike Rodgers claimed
that the leak "has had a material impact on our ability to generate
insights as to what terrorist groups around the world are doing. . . .
Anyone \[who\] thinks this has not had an impact . . . doesn't know what
they are talking about."112 Stewart Baker, formerly a high-ranking
Homeland Security official and General Counsel of the NSA, was one of
Snowden's most publicly vocal critics, alleging that Snowden might have
been in the employ of a foreign intelligence service and that his
disclosures significantly impaired the country's ability to defend
itself, especially given the specific details about the NSA's programs
that Snowden disclosed.113

As with Cablegate and the Iraq War Logs disclosures, [critics offered
**little in the way of specific proof of the costs of the disclosures**,
besides the **direct costs** of the **time**]{.underline} [that
personnel had to spend to assess and mitigate the damage and the costs
of changing the disclosed programs, if possible or
necessary]{.underline}. As time passed, **[the warnings appeared to
dissipate]{.underline}**. Director of National Intelligence James
Clapper conceded in a June 2014 interview that "it doesn't look like
\[Snowden\] took as much" as initially feared. The same article quoted
an anonymous senior intelligence official who conceded that the
disclosures' greatest impact would be the "damage in foreign relations"
they caused as well as the extent to which the leaks had "poisoned" the
NSA's relations with commercial providers.114

But [Snowden's disclosures continue to offer a ready **excuse** for
intelligence failures]{.underline}, as CIA Director John
**[Brennan]{.underline}** [appeared to blame Snowden for the difficulty
in stopping the terrorist attacks in **Paris**]{.underline} in November
2015, [complaining that the leaks had made "our ability collectively,
internationally, to find these terrorists much more
challenging."]{.underline}115 [Clapper's]{.underline} **[vague
claim]{.underline}** [only illustrates the **difficult of assigning
causation to complex events**. Even if the Paris terrorists used
encryption to keep their plans secure from surveillance, it is still
nearly **impossible to prove, or even conclude with any confidence, that
French intelligence, military, and police authorities would have
thwarted the attack but for Snowden's disclosures**]{.underline}.116
Indeed, prior to the attacks, private security firms and media outlets
had offered conflicting accounts of how much and how well terrorist
groups in the Middle East have responded to the leaks.117 It is likely
that the NSA has found it more difficult to gather intelligence on
future terrorist threats due to the leaks and the political response to
them. [It is **possible**]{.underline} [that some future attack will
occur that might have been preventable but for the relinquished
intelligence sources. But the public **cannot**]{.underline} and likely
will not **[learn]{.underline}** [of the relationship between the
disclosures and any past or future terrorist action--- and it is also
quite possible that the **i**ntelligence **c**ommunity **would not be
able to prove a connection between the two.**]{.underline}

#### Redaction failures routinely reveal secret information

Mark **Fenster 17**, Stephen C. O\'Connell Chair at the Levin College of
Law, "7 The Implausibility of Information Control," The Transparency
Fix: Secrets, Leaks, and Uncontrollable Government Information, Stanford
Law Books, an imprint of Stanford University Press, 2017, pp. 153--173

[When it releases documents from which text has been
"redacted"]{.underline} (that is, obscured with a black mark or erased)
for security purposes, [the executive branch simultaneously]{.underline}
**[discloses information]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[quite
explicitly]{.underline}** and clearly [**keeps it secret**. The public
can see the document; it just cannot see **every
word**]{.underline}---or perhaps any word at all, if the entire document
or page has been redacted. An agency sometimes redacts a document that
it is otherwise required to release under a legal mandate;
alternatively, an agency may not have been obliged to release a redacted
document but decided to declassify or make it available in an effort to
meet public expectations or enhance public understanding of an issue.
[As a **surgical** removal of privileged information, redaction
constitutes a compromise, a second-best alternative to complete
secrecy]{.underline} that is better than no disclosure at all. [But by
**making visible that which is kept secret, redaction reveals secrecy's
machinery**]{.underline} in ways that the flat refusal to release a
document does not. Paradoxically, [redactions **allow citizens to see
precisely what the state has decided they cannot know**.]{.underline}

This section demonstrates that understanding redaction as selective but
complete censorship proves to be only partially correct, given the
myriad ways in which redaction can fail. It begins with a discussion of
how laws enable govern ment to use redactions as a strategy to retain
control over information, then it illustrates the ways that redaction
has failed in recent high-profile cases. It ends by demonstrating how
even redaction's textual erasure still produces meaning. Information
Control and Release in Redaction Law

Government agencies redact information most frequently in response to
FOIA requests. The Freedom of Information Act requires federal agencies
to provide "\[a\]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record" of
documents when they rely upon one of FOIA's exemptions to deny a
document request.52 Agencies must make their redactions explicit and
obvious by indicating the amount of deleted information, the exemption
that authorized the deletion, and, when possible, where in the document
the deletion occurred.53 Courts occasionally play an active role in the
redaction process, and they will sometimes review the precision with
which an agency segregates information that cannot be withheld and the
reasoning the agency uses when it redacts.54 Judicial review of agency
redaction is notably variable, with different courts reaching different
conclusions about similar redactions or about how much they should defer
to government decisions to redact.

Intelligence agencies also redact, or demand redaction, in the pre-
publication review process that they use for the public writings of
their current and former employees.55 The CIA has long required
employees to sign secrecy agreements as a condition of employment.56
These agreements include provisions that require the employees to submit
written manuscripts they plan to publish prior to publication.57 The CIA
delegates manuscript review to its Publications Review Board (PRB),
which must respond to the author within thirty days with proposed
deletions.58 Although the PRB's approach has varied over time as
different agency directors use their discretion to set their secrecy
policy preferences, 59 some authors and critics of the CIA have argued
that the PRB overredacts information, especially when it supports
criticism of CIA performance and policy.60 Frustrated employees have
challenged agency efforts to enforce the secrecy agreements on First
Amendment grounds,61 as well as on the grounds that the redacted
information is in fact unclassified,62 or had been officially disclosed
previously,63 or had been improperly classified.64 Rarely do such
challenges prevail.

Redaction's legal authorities thus assume the following. Disclosure is
appropriate, within reason, as is secrecy. The two can be reconciled
through an agency's precise control of information, down to the page,
line, and word whose redaction will keep dangerous content secret.
Wielding its black pen, eraser, or software code, the government can
limit what it views as disclosure's ill effects.

How Redaction Fails

[Redaction]{.underline} **[can and does fail in a variety of
ways]{.underline}**, however. [The information that it tries to suppress
might **already** be in the **public domain**. The information can also
subsequently leak out or can be **inferred** from the **document** or
the **context** in which the redaction appears]{.underline}.65 [The
redactions might not **successfully** suppress information---either due
to **bureaucratic conflict**]{.underline} [or due to a **technical
error**]{.underline}.66 **[Agencies]{.underline}** [cannot extend the
redaction that they are authorized to make to **documents outside their
control**]{.underline}. [Despite its status as an explicit form of
information control, then, **redaction often reveals secrecy's
malfunction.**]{.underline}

### 2nc -- at: civil control bad / impact turns

#### Civilian control is a [relic]{.underline} that prevents [effective response]{.underline} to existential threats.

**Brooks, 3-2**-21---Scott K. Ginsberg Professor of Law and Policy at
Georgetown University Law Center (Rosa, "Are US Civil-Military Relations
in Crisis?," Parameters 51(1), Spring 2021, dml)

More than anything, our ongoing preoccupation with civil-military crises
may reflect our increasing uncertainty about the overall purpose of the
military and our growing inability to define the role of the armed
forces---or the distinction between the political and military
realms---in any coherent way. [[Considering]{.mark} today's **complex**,
**hybrid challenges** such as **[terrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
epidemic [**[disease]{.mark}**, **[climate]{.mark} change**,
**[cyber]{.mark} threats**, **[Russian info]{.mark}rmation
[warfare]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **expanding [Chinese]{.mark} global
[influence]{.mark}**, it is [**impossible** to draw]{.mark} **neat
[distinctions]{.mark}** [between]{.mark}]{.underline} the role of the
military and the role of diplomacy, development, and trade policy---or
for that matter, between foreign and domestic issues and threats.29 But
with the lines between war and not war, foreign and domestic, and
[[**military** and **civilian**]{.underline}]{.mark} growing ever
blurrier, it is less clear what we mean when we talk about crises in
civil-military affairs.

Of course, the categories we rely upon to structure and give meaning to
our world---war, peace, foreign, domestic, military, civilian, and so
on---are categories we have created. [These categories are neither
**sacred** nor **stable**]{.underline}, and if they no longer serve a
useful analytic purpose---if they are beginning to obscure more than
they clarify---then we must develop new ways of thinking about power,
force, control, and the institutions and rules we need.

This is an urgent challenge. Indeed, it could be [our continued fondness
for civil-military jeremiads risks **diverting attention** away from
**different** but just as **insidious threats**]{.underline} to American
democracy--- threats that may have more to do with other forms of state
capture and democratic dysfunction than with a crisis in civil-military
relations or civilian control of the military.

[The Founders **cared**]{.underline} deeply [about]{.underline}
civil-military relations and [civilian control of the
military]{.underline}. But they cared about this relationship
[for]{.underline} quite **[pragmatic reasons]{.underline}**---in the
late eighteenth century, those who controlled organized militaries had a
unique ability to control the state and its resources. The founders of
the fledgling American republic crafted a representative democracy in
which, they hoped, the will of the people would always prevail and not
be hijacked by force of arms.

The commitment of the framers of the Constitution to civilian control of
the military stemmed from their deep mistrust of concentrated power. The
US Constitution represents a comprehensive effort to break up
concentrations of power, to ensure no one branch of government can
outmuscle the others, and to ensure no one individual, region, party,
faction, or group can permanently capture the state. In 1789 organized
militaries were the sole actors with the ability to cause mass
destruction of life and property; they consequently possessed a unique
ability to capture, coerce, and control other would-be political actors.
A general commitment to diluting concentrations of power, then,
translated into a specific commitment to ensuring that the military, in
particular, would be subject to multiple checks and balances.

Moreover these Constitutional checks and balances relating to the use of
military force took many different forms. The Constitution established a
system in which the military was subordinated to the elected
representatives of the people, and for good measure they also divided
control over the use of military force between Congress and the
president. The framers' normative goal was to prevent concentrations of
power that could displace or distort the will of the people, and
civilian control of the military was valued because (and only because)
it was one of several overlapping mechanisms to ensure that the will of
the people would prevail over the will of the powerful.

Today, these core normative goals are as relevant as they were in 1789,
for to believe in democracy is to believe that the political legitimacy
of a government derives from the free and informed consent of the
governed. Most of us believe that the choices of the American people---
constrained by our constitutional commitment to individual rights and
due process, but otherwise uncoerced and unmanipulated---should guide
our foreign and domestic policies.

But [a [**formalistic commitment** to civilian control]{.mark} of the
military [**no longer achieves** what it promised]{.mark} to achieve
more than two centuries ago]{.underline}. For one thing, the US military
today is nothing like the redcoats of King George III, and nothing like
the ragtag militias hastily assembled under General George Washington.
Instead, [[the]{.mark} US [military]{.mark} now [has]{.mark} **elaborate
[internal checks]{.mark}** and **balances** [and]{.mark} a **deeply
ingrained [respect]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} democracy and the [rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 Most critically, [the ability to
destroy]{.underline}--- and hence to coerce and control---[is **no
longer** in the **exclusive possession** of those with military forces
and weapons]{.underline}.

Unlike in 1789, **[[nonstate actors]{.underline}]{.mark}**---even lone
individuals---[[can]{.mark} now [cause]{.mark} [**death** and
**destruction**]{.mark} on a mass scale, [and]{.mark} increasingly both
states and nonstate actors also [have]{.mark} a **range of [nonkinetic
means]{.mark}** of coercion at their disposal, [from **cyberattacks**
and]{.mark} **bioengineered [viruses]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
the deliberate global spread of [**disinformation** and **[fake
news]{.mark}**]{.underline}. All over the world [coercive power has
become simultaneously **more diffuse** and **more
concentrated**]{.underline}. Individual billionaires, multinational
corporations, hackers, and nonstate terrorist groups can increasingly
compete with state militaries in their ability to control the behavior
of both ordinary people and political actors.31

At the same time, as noted earlier, [the **lines** between military and
civilian tasks have grown **increasingly indistinct**]{.underline}. In
today's murky world of grayzone conflicts and persistent shaping
operations, uniformed military personnel train judges, eavesdrop on
electronic communications, vaccinate cows, and develop microfinance
programs---and civilian Intelligence Community employees and contractors
conduct raids, plan drone strikes, and execute offensive cyber
operations. Both military and civilian actors engage in information and
influence operations.

In this blurry world, we need to ask ourselves a serious question: [what
**work**]{.underline}, if any, [is the concept of civilian control of
the military **doing today**?]{.underline} When we say it was dangerous
for Trump to offer too many senior administration positions to retired
generals, or discourage President Biden from doing the same, what
exactly do we mean? [[What **specific negative consequences** do we
imagine would be **more likely to happen**]{.underline}]{.mark} if
retired generals make up half the president's cabinet---and what
positive outcomes could result if we keep retired generals out of a
president's inner circle? When we say we do not want retired military
officials to make partisan statements, why not? Similarly, [[when we
worry about **military involvement in** ]{.mark}**domestic
[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or about military obedience to
civilian commands, [we would do well to **define the harms** with
greater specificity]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[The notion of civilian control]{.underline} of the military in America
today has come unmoored from its original purpose and arguably [is **no
longer an effective means** to achieve the normative ends we still
rightly value]{.underline}. Instead it is at risk of becoming a rule of
aesthetics, not ethics, and [its invocation is at risk of becoming a
**soothing ritual** without accomplishing **anything of
value**]{.underline}.

Going further, in today's world [a **purely formalistic conception** of
[civilian control]{.mark} of the military [carries]{.mark} with it
potential **[dangers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If we focus on formalistic
rules at the expense of substantive normative ends, [[we may persuade
ourselves that if we can just **keep the generals**]{.underline}]{.mark}
inside the Pentagon and [**[away]{.mark}** from]{.underline} the
campaign trail and [the White House, [we will have]{.mark}
**accomplished [something meaningful]{.mark}**---even [as we **blind
ourselves** to]{.mark} the **frightening [new]{.mark} forms** of
[power]{.mark} and coercion [that]{.mark} increasingly **distort our
democracy** and **[destabilize our world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**Martin 15** (David A; Warner-Booker Distinguished Professor of
International Law Emeritus at the University of Virginia, former
principal deputy general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security,
member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council, J.D. from Yale Law
School; 2015; "Why Immigration's Plenary Power Doctrine Endures";

Justice Field, of course, does wind up treating the political branch's
conclusions, in this particular setting, as conclusive on the judiciary
--- but he does not rest that outcome on the idea that immigration
control is a sovereign power outside the reach of the Constitution.
Instead, he offers a statement about institutional roles seen as
appropriate for the respective branches of government in this specific
domain. [In the foreign arena]{.underline}, he writes, [as a matter of
"self-preservation,"]{.underline}34 [the government has the]{.underline}
"highest [duty" to "preserve . . . independence, and]{.underline} give
[**security against foreign aggression** and
**encroachment**]{.underline}."35 To achieve these ends, [the government
is **clothed with authority** to determine the occasion on
which]{.underline} the [powers shall be called forth]{.underline}; and
its determinations, so far as the subjects affected are concerned, are
necessarily conclusive upon all its departments and officers. . . . [The
**existence of [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} would [[render the
necessity]{.underline}]{.mark} of the proceeding only [more obvious and
[pressing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The same necessity, in a less pressing
degree, may arise when war does not exist, and the same authority which
adjudges the necessity in one case must also determine it in the other.
In both cases its determination is conclusive upon the judiciary.36 In
other words, [in 1888, the political branches judged
necessary]{.underline} the application of [a new]{.underline} absolute
[rule excluding Chinese laborers]{.underline}, in order [to **achieve
security** against]{.underline} what Congress deemed a type of [foreign
encroachment]{.underline}.37 [Even with misgivings]{.underline} about
the justice or fairness of the action, [[the courts **will not
second-guess**]{.mark} that judgment]{.underline} of necessity.
[[In]{.mark} realms touching]{.underline} upon [**[foreign
relations]{.mark}** and]{.underline} potential **[national
self-preservation]{.underline}**, Field indicates, [[the nation must
**speak with one voice**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [it is not
for]{.underline} the [courts to introduce a discordant
sound]{.underline}. B. Complexity, Prophecy, and Experimentation in
Foreign Affairs Decisionmaking [Some critics]{.underline} of the plenary
power doctrine [question this]{.underline} asserted [**linkage** between
immigration and foreign affairs]{.underline}. Chinese exclusion was not
a foreign affairs decision, they assert, but one driven by domestic
political considerations --- and in fact it worsened our relations with
China.38 The invocation of foreign affairs is seen as a pretext covering
up uglier motives, and the plenary power doctrine prevents courts from
looking behind the mask.39 Therefore, [some assert that courts
should]{.underline} simply [provide]{.underline} the ordinary measure of
**[constitutional scrutiny]{.underline}** --- to smoke out invidious
motives or at least [to provide an appropriate evaluation
of]{.underline} the weight of [the governmental interest]{.underline} in
light of the individual stake.40 This kind of pre-textual invocation
certainly can occur. But [here is the difficulty: We should not
assume]{.underline} that [pretexts in]{.underline} the [foreign
affairs]{.underline} arena [are readily identifiable]{.underline}. As
Justice Breyer observed in a recent political question case:
[[Decisionmaking in]{.underline}]{.mark} \[the [[foreign
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}\] area typically [[is]{.mark} highly
political]{.underline}. It is ["[**delicate**" and
"**complex**."]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} often
[[rests upon information]{.underline}]{.mark} readily [[available to the
Executive]{.underline}]{.mark} Branch [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
[intelligence committees]{.underline} of [[Congress]{.underline}, [but
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} readily **[available to [the
courts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It frequently is highly dependent upon
what Justice Jackson called "prophecy." And [the creation of wise
[foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline} typically [[lies]{.mark} well
**[beyond]{.mark}**]{.underline} the experience or professional capacity
of **[[a judge]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the same time, [where foreign
affairs is at issue, the]{.underline} practical [need for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to speak "with one voice and
ac\[t\] as one," is]{.underline} particularly [important]{.underline}.41
Many of [the nation's policy]{.underline} tools [in [the foreign
arena]{.mark} are crude and imprecise, with uncertain impact.
This]{.underline} very [uncertainty may [require
**trial-and-error**]{.mark}]{.underline} application, [[with]{.mark} a
need for **[quick]{.mark}**]{.underline} policy
**[[changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially **[[in times of
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Therefore, [**[deference]{.mark}** to the
political branches [is called for]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} not
because we can always be sure that their motives are pure and
nondiscriminatory --- we cannot --- but [because [subjecting
these]{.mark}]{.underline} measures [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} detailed
[[litigation would **interfere with**]{.mark} **the
[flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} often [necessary to act beyond our
borders]{.underline}. A too-ready [[judicial interference
would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**impair our ability** to
deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} uncertain [[tools ---]{.mark} deriving from
**immigration**]{.underline} control, [trade regulation, or]{.underline}
other [components of]{.underline} our [international relations ---
[according to a single]{.mark}]{.underline} unified
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}.42 C. An Example: The Contrast to
Domestic Measures [Consider the **seizure of U.S.
diplomats**]{.underline} by militants [[in Tehran]{.mark} in
1978]{.underline}. After the embassy invasion was ratified and defended
by the new Iranian government, [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline}
government [[turned to]{.mark} a disparate variety of countermeasures
to]{.underline} try to [win release]{.underline} of the American
hostages, [including the [seizure of]{.mark} billions]{.underline} of
dollars [in [assets]{.mark} of Iran]{.underline} and of its companies
and nationals, litigation in [the International Court of Justice,
a]{.underline}n ill-fated [military rescue attempt]{.underline} after
Iran defied the International Court, [[diplomatic
overtures]{.underline}]{.mark} through Algeria,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} certain [[immigration]{.mark}-law-based
[restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline} imposed on Iranian nationals in the
United States.43 There were even proposals at the time to use
immigration or other powers to intern large numbers of Iranian nationals
so they could perhaps be part of an exchange that would bring the
diplomats home.44 Thankfully, such internment was never put into motion.
[Contrast]{.underline} the trial-and-error use of [these]{.underline}
generally **[crude and scattershot measures]{.underline}** [with how the
government would respond to a domestic]{.underline} kidnapping and
potential [hostage situation]{.underline}. The police could deploy
quickly to investigate who seized the victims and where they were
currently located. In that process the authorities could use judicial
search warrants to facilitate the inquiry, plus arrest warrants and
compulsory grand jury subpoenas as appropriate. They could call on a
wide range of assistance and technical support from a host of fully
empowered domestic agencies, state and federal. Once the kidnappers were
located, the police would establish perimeter control around the hostage
site. [No hostile militias would stand in the way]{.underline} (or if
such appeared, other governmental power, including the National Guard,
could be deployed). [In a]{.underline} protracted [standoff, judicially
issued search warrants might help legitimate a]{.underline} forcible
[rescue operation]{.underline}. And [the full weight of]{.underline}
criminal [punishment]{.underline}, imposed [through]{.underline}
efficiently functioning [courts, could be expected]{.underline} for the
kidnappers or hostage takers. [This]{.underline} comparison [helps
reveal why courts are positioned to apply close]{.underline}
constitutional **[scrutiny of]{.underline}** official **[domestic
action]{.underline}**, whenever it is credibly challenged,
[but]{.underline} properly [feel]{.underline} more **[constrained [in
the international arena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the international
arena, U.S. actors generally cannot invoke compulsory process or other
reliable coercive means under their own government's control. Moreover,
[[the **stakes are**]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[**higher**,]{.mark} as is the number]{.underline} of people
[potentially affected]{.underline} --- not only by the immediate outcome
but also by downstream effects, as the resolution either deters similar
adverse actions in the future or instead stimulates them because the
U.S. effort failed. [With a domestic operation, judges can be
confident]{.underline} that [the government will]{.underline} still
[have plenty of capacity to deal with]{.underline} public safety
[threats, even in the presence of]{.underline} robust [judicial review.
One cannot have such confidence]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the
efficacy of alternative policy tools in [the **global arena**
if]{.underline} domestic [judicial action begins to]{.underline} prevent
or **[second-guess or slow down]{.underline}** the use of those
initially chosen by [the political branches]{.underline}. Another
difference between the two settings is relevant. In [the domestic arena,
we do not tolerate]{.underline} individuals using **[tit-for-tat
responses]{.underline}** to remedy wrongful behavior. I cannot justify
seizing and carrying away my neighbor's television on the ground that he
borrowed my riding mower months ago and never returned it. But this
prohibition on messy self-help obtains precisely because efficient
hierarchical legal mechanisms, involving professional police and a
developed court system, stand available to redress my neighbor's
wrongful act. In recent decades, the world has taken limited but hopeful
steps toward investing transnational institutions with comparable
powers, but progress remains quite uneven across different policy
domains. [[The plenary power doctrine **manifests**]{.mark}
**the**]{.underline} Supreme [**Court's [judgment]{.mark}**
[that]{.mark} the]{.underline} kind of [detailed constitutional
[scrutiny]{.mark} appropriate for the]{.underline} mature and developed
[domestic public order [is **not workable in the**]{.mark}]{.underline}
more primitive [**[international]{.mark} legal [system]{.mark}**,
marked]{.underline} primarily [by]{.underline} horizontal
[action-and-response to]{.underline} try to [rectify
breaches]{.underline}. D. The Nongovernmental Component of Foreign
Affairs Decisionmaking [Foreign affairs are involved in **immigration
decisionmaking** for another]{.underline}, more [entangling
reason]{.underline}, even when there is no clear effort to retaliate
against or to influence a foreign government. Most [high-level
immigration decisions]{.underline} --- by Congress or by the executive
branch --- [are designed]{.underline}, at least in part, [to **influence
or shape behavior overseas**]{.underline} by individuals and nonstate
actors, including both prospective immigrants (contemplating either
legal or illegal channels) and smuggling organizations. For example, the
decision (part of Operation Streamline45) to prosecute a high percentage
of simple entrants without inspection caught along the southern border,
causing them to spend some time in jail or prison before being
repatriated, has been criticized as disproportionate to the inherent
nature of this misdemeanor offense.46 But this critique misunderstands
the policy decision. [Operation Streamline is]{.underline} primarily
[meant to send a **deterrent**]{.underline} message [to others
contemplating a]{.underline} future [clandestine
crossing]{.underline}.47 The same is true of decisions to repatriate
violators to a distant part of the land border rather than back to the
border town from which they entered and where their coyote may be
waiting to help them try again to enter.48 To take another example, [in
1994, the Clinton administration decided to decouple]{.underline} the
grant of [work authorization from]{.underline} the simple act of [filing
for asylum]{.underline}, as had been provided under earlier regulations,
[though this]{.underline} change [would mean that]{.underline} many
[applicants would be without]{.underline} a means of
[support]{.underline}, other than private or family charity,
[for]{.underline} as long as [180 days. This]{.underline} austere step
[was taken]{.underline}, in significant part, [to **discourage people**
planning to come to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
file an ill-founded claim that]{.underline} previously [would have
secured]{.underline} several [years of residence and lawful
work]{.underline} while they awaited a hearing.49 Changes to the
treatment or opportunities of noncitizens in the United States, whether
in the direction of restriction or liberalization, almost inevitably
affect the decisions of people and organizations abroad who are thinking
about organizing or participating in migration to the United States.
Smuggling organizations, in fact, often build their business plans
around finding and exploiting weak spots in immigration laws or
processes.50 As a result, [some]{.underline} U.S. government [measures
take on a more **severe or restrictive aspect** than]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} [initially]{.underline} seem to [be warranted by
the]{.underline} acts of the [individuals most immediately
affected]{.underline}. This is because the policymakers mean the action
not just for those who are the direct object of enforcement on U.S. soil
but also for the message sent to others they want to deter. [This
dynamic appears to explain]{.underline}, in significant part, [the Obama
administration's decisions to respond to the]{.underline} southwest
[border migration surge]{.underline} in summer of 2014 [with
a]{.underline} surprisingly **[severe set of measures]{.underline}**,
including sustained detention, even though the subjects were mainly
children traveling with a mother or other relative. [The
executive]{.underline} branch [also implemented accelerated removal
processing]{.underline} where the law permitted such action, and assured
substantial publicity for the flight whenever recent migrants were
deported by airplane to their home country.51 Despite sharp criticism,
[these practices]{.underline} persisted, and they [seem to have
had]{.underline} much of [the **desired deterrent impact** in
the]{.underline} foreign [nations at issue]{.underline}. In fact,
monthly arrivals of unaccompanied minors from these countries declined
from 10,631 in June 2014 to 2,432 in September.52 [This]{.underline}
kind of [deterrence-based action]{.underline}, focused on overseas
individuals and nongovernmental players, [is]{.underline} also [an
**aspect of foreign affairs**]{.underline}, even though it falls below
the plane of high-level geopolitics. [It]{.underline} likewise [may need
to take the form of]{.underline} rough-hewn [trial-and-error,
like]{.underline} the more [traditional foreign-relations
actions]{.underline} directed at governments. [The]{.underline} Supreme
[Court's case law]{.underline} over the years [appears to consider such
policy]{.underline} choices **[equally worthy of foreign-affairs
deference]{.underline}**.53 [This]{.underline} analysis [is not meant as
advocacy for]{.underline} the quick or expansive use of [immigration
restrictions to respond to objectionable]{.underline} or unwelcome
[actions]{.underline} of foreign governments or nonstate actors. For
reasons of both policy and proportion, immigration sanctions of this
type should be sparingly deployed. [But the Court's **doctrine of
deference**]{.underline} in Chae Chan Ping and later cases [is based on
the recognition that even for]{.underline} relatively [liberal
foreign-affairs decisionmakers, **rough-hewn actions** that]{.underline}
initially [seem outsized]{.underline} or individually unfair [might need
to be in the mix to **respond to**]{.underline}, or to help shape,
**[actions]{.underline}** that others are taking
**[abroad]{.underline}**.54 III. Why the Court Resists Even Moderate
Proposals for a More Active Judicial Role [A]{.underline} more nuanced
[branch of]{.underline} the Chae Chan Ping [criticism accepts that
foreign affairs considerations may]{.underline} well [be at stake
in]{.underline} some [immigration decisions, but would **modify the
doctrine** to allow for a]{.underline} carefully structured **[closer
judicial look]{.underline}**.55 [The courts]{.underline}, such observers
contend, should not take political branch assertions as controlling, but
instead [should perform an initial judicial probe]{.underline} of the
asserted reasons, [to decide whether the]{.underline} challenged
[immigration restriction rests on]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
significant [foreign affairs foundation]{.underline}. If the answer is
yes, then the reviewing court should treat the political branches'
decision as dispositive --- essentially, as a political question not
subject to judicial review. But if not, then the court should apply
ordinary modes of constitutional review, which might well bring a form
of heightened scrutiny. At first glance, this kind of proposal would
seem to offer an attractive middle ground to the Supreme Court. Yet [the
Court]{.underline} in practice [has **manifested great resistance** to
these]{.underline} scholarly [invitations]{.underline}. Why? In my view,
a majority of the [[Justices harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[deep
**skepticism that lower courts can**]{.mark} **be trusted** to [give
sufficient weight to foreign policy]{.mark} concerns in making any
such]{.underline} threshold [assessment. The]{.underline} very [nature
of immigration litigation]{.underline} in the courts of appeals, with an
actual and often sympathetic human being front and center, [makes
a]{.underline} reviewing [judge]{.underline} far more [likely to
overvalue the]{.underline} individual [interests at stake and undervalue
the]{.underline} more subtle and complex [reasons why a]{.underline}
particular [measure may be **needed for**]{.underline} system
[**stability** or to **influence**]{.underline} behavior [**beyond our
borders** --- connections that]{.underline} often [would not
become]{.underline} fully [apparent until]{.underline} broader damage is
manifested [months or years after an interventionist judicial
decision]{.underline}.56 Anna Law's book, The Immigration Battle in
American Courts, documents this disparity in outlook between the Supreme
Court and the lower courts quite revealingly. She describes "how \[lower
court\] judges can disregard congressional edicts limiting their scope
of review in order to reach a desired result,"57 and can usually get
away with it because the Supreme Court can review only a tiny fraction
of their decisions.58 Professor Law regards this stance by the courts of
appeals as a virtue, but the Supreme Court doubtless views it otherwise.
[[Keeping the]{.mark} plenary power [doctrine **categorical**
gives]{.mark} the]{.underline} Supreme [Court greater [assurance that
lower courts will **preserve**]{.mark} **the space** needed for
government actions to meet]{.underline} real **[[foreign affairs
imperatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even if this stance inevitably also
leaves room for some ill-motivated actions adopted by the political
branches). If this symposium were being held at the time of Chae Chan
Ping's centennial, in 1989, we might have had greater reason to expect
some softening by the Supreme Court regarding the deference doctrine in
the foreign affairs arena. Exactly twenty-five years before the week
when this symposium convened in Norman, Oklahoma, the Berlin Wall fell,
signaling that the Soviet bloc was coming apart, about to be replaced,
in many instances, by democratic governments. Lengthy wars were ending
in Latin America, and dictators were being forced from office. [It
appeared we were on the cusp of a]{.underline} far more [**benign world
order** --- one that might permit]{.underline} the rapid flowering of
more [protective international legal institutions and]{.underline}
thereby [reduce reliance on **crude action-and-response**]{.underline}
in the international arena. **[[Today's global scene
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** far more [**[grim]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Not
only has [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[experienced]{.underline} the trauma of [al Qaeda's September 11
attacks]{.underline}, which revealed a genuine need for more vigilant
immigration screening, but [democratic [nations are]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[facing]{.underline}]{.mark} new [**global threats**
from]{.underline} other [**[nongovernmental actors]{.mark}**
who]{.underline} actually [glorify]{.underline} the use of [beheadings,
crucifixion, and slavery, in addition to]{.underline} other players
using more old-fashioned forms of [**[terrorism]{.mark}** directed at
civilians. **[Failed states]{.mark}** are]{.underline} more
[common]{.underline}, and [well-armed [insurgencies have
**proliferated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The march of [[**democracy** has
slowed]{.mark} and]{.underline}, in several countries, [reversed.

### 2ac -- judicial oversight bad -- leaks

#### No spillover -- [Congressional exemptions circumvent]{.underline} AND Courts [won't oversee]{.underline} intel gathering procedures -- OR, causes [leaks]{.underline} -- [wrecks ISR]{.underline} capabilities to avoid [compromising sources]{.underline}

Elizabeth **Rindskopf-Parker & Pate 7**, Bryan Pate, 2007, "Rethinking
Judicial Oversight of Intelligence," in Reforming Intelligence:
Obstacles to Democratic Control and Effectiveness,
<https://www.academia.edu/13052951/Reforming_Intelligence>, nihara

To function effectively, all democratic governments must subject their
actions to open public debate, **[review]{.underline}**, discussion, and
response. These [are]{.underline} the [essential ingredients of
**oversight** and **accountability**]{.underline}. Yet, [to survive in
an often **hostile world**,]{.underline} these same [governments
must]{.underline} also [be able to collect, analyze, and use **foreign**
and **domestic intelligence**---information of ongoing value only
insofar as its methods of collection and secrecy can be
maintained]{.underline}. This is the [paradox of intelligence oversight:
the **need to achieve** **open review** of **secret materials** and
activities **without destroying** their **value**]{.underline}.

In the United States, there are many established mechanisms of oversight
and accountability, both inside and outside the government. Under the
U.S. Constitution, the three separate branches of the federal
government---executive, legislative, and judiciary---share power through
a system of checks and balances. Each has the obligation and authority
to ensure that the other two branches perform their assigned functions
appropriately. This tripartite division naturally encourages oversight
and accountability between the branches. In addition, each arm of the
government provides its own unique internal oversight. Within the
executive branch, management reviews are conducted by numerous offices,
each of which typically includes an inspector general and a general
counsel to ensure that it is complying with the law.

Congressional oversight occurs through the appropriations process,
congressional audits, and statutory reporting requirements. Judicial
review of the legality of actions taken by the two political branches
occurs frequently, with judgments rendered on a case-by-case basis.
Outside the government, the actions of each branch are subjected to
scrutiny by an independent and active press and are ultimately adjudged
by the electorate through the democratic process.

Yet, [for the **national intelligence** system]{.underline}, these
[**traditional oversight** mechanisms are an **awkward
fit**]{.underline}. Perhaps [this is part of the reason
why]{.underline}, historically, [oversight of intelligence has been
**uneven**]{.underline} in its success. Often, the [importance of
maintaining **secrecy**]{.underline} to protect the sources and methods
of the intelligence capabilities [appears **directly opposed** to the
**effective functioning** of the **existing oversight**
structures.]{.underline} Moreover, the [secrecy surrounding intelligence
activities seems to limit the role of the press to reporting on periodic
**scandals**]{.underline}---some real, some not. Some critics argue that
the broader goals of oversight---the [**effectiveness** of the overall
**intelligence system**---are **inadequately served**]{.underline} by
the current system.1

[Secrecy concerns have also **restricted** the **judiciary's role** in
reviewing intelligence activities]{.underline}. For good reason, [court
procedures]{.underline} in a democracy [**do not** easily
**accommodate** secrecy. **Uncomfortable** with **secret procedures**,
the **judiciary** has been **reluctant** to engage issues arising from
intelligence activities]{.underline}, even when such matters are
properly presented to them.2 There is an important corollary to the
concerns of the judiciary: [**judicial openness** is commonly seen by
all branches of government as a **threat** to effective **intel**ligence
**gathering**]{.underline}. Thus, because [**revealing** individual
**secret facts** can **threaten** the underlying ''**sources** and
methods'' by which substantial amounts of intelligence are produced,
**legislated exceptions** to public **legal review** are common where
intelligence information is involved.]{.underline} Most notable in this
regard is the exception for foreign intelligence contained in the
Freedom of Information Act---the primary statute providing
accountability through citizen access to government information.3

[In a few of the areas where intelligence issues inevitably come under
the purview of the judiciary, **Congress** has **stepped in** to
**strike the balance** between competing concerns]{.underline}. For
example, to facilitate the adjudication of criminal [trials that involve
critical evidence that **cannot be made publicly
available**]{.underline}, Congress has [established the **C**lassified
**I**nformation **P**rocedures **A**ct (**CIPA**]{.underline}).4 CIPA is
modeled on earlier protective orders fashioned by the judiciary to
handle such problems and provides a procedure for the courts to follow
in handling classified evidence during a public trial. It is the means
Congress has chosen to achieve the dual objectives of protecting
national security and ensuring defendants a fair trial.

**[Procedural provisions]{.underline}** like CIPA, however, [have not
alleviated the **fundamental impediment**]{.underline} to greater
judicial involvement in the review of intelligence activities: [an
**overriding reluctance** on the part of the **judiciary** to become
**involved** with **foreign affairs** and **national security
concerns**]{.underline}. Is this resistance inevitable and unavoidable?
Or are there structures that exist now, or could be devised, that would
allow greater oversight by the courts in the overall process of
collecting, analyzing, and using intelligence?

These questions are particularly timely as terrorism places the national
security structures under increasing pressure to respond in new ways
both at home and abroad. With headlines exposing abused detainees,
''torture memos,'' race-based ''no-fly lists,'' and ''illegal
wiretapping,'' it is evident that the traditional balance between
national security and individual liberty is being challenged, making
even more important the courts' role in ensuring that responses to
terrorism do not fundamentally degrade personal freedoms and
liberties.What role should the courts have in intelligence oversight in
a time of terrorism? Before considering this question, we will first
review the origins of existing oversight structures; then we will
examine the basis for the judiciary's reluctance to participate in
national security matters; and finally, we will consider one example of
active judicial oversight that may presage future approaches, especially
if terrorism continues to pose a credible threat beyond the foreseeable
future.

#### Independently, miscalc from [ISR failure]{.underline} escalates to [full-scale]{.underline} nuclear war -- [nothing]{.underline} checks

Dr. Bruce G. **Blair 20**, Research Scholar in the Program on Science
and Global Security at Princeton University, PhD in Operations Research
from Yale University, "Loose Cannons: The President and US Nuclear
Posture", Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Volume 76, Issue 1
\[language modified; abbreviation in brackets\]

[The **fog** of nuclear conflict will prove]{.underline} all the
**[thick]{.underline}**er [because leaders and [planners
**lack**]{.mark} **adequate [knowledge]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}'
mind-set, resolve, wartime aims, and [game plans]{.underline}. For
instance, de-classified Soviet documents show clearly that the US
strategy of "escalation dominance" was completely out of sync with
Soviet nuclear strategy and that escalation to full-scale nuclear war
was virtually inevitable if the United States struck first.13 After many
decades of scholarly research, it is still not known what leaders in
Moscow and Beijing were thinking during Cold War crises involving US
attempts to threaten nuclear violence to coerce them.14 Today it would
be foolhardy in the extreme to presume we would know Putin's, Xi's, and
Kim's minds and behavior in wartime. A prudent leader would not only
refrain from initiating the actual use of nuclear weapons because of the
danger of escalation; that leader would also refrain from brandishing
them at all during a confrontation. [The **[fear of]{.mark} an adversary
[striking]{.mark} first** [is]{.mark} the leading **[textbook]{.mark}
cause** of **[crisis instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To stabilize a
military crisis situation, what is actually needed is predictability and
reassurance that first use is not on the table. For many strategists,
however, taking options off the table looks like weakness. Retired Gen.
James Mattis (the recent defense secretary) has a favorite military
maxim: "Never tell the enemy what you are not going to do." Strategists
weaned on Thomas Schelling's classic game theory arguments believe
threatening, manipulating risk, and blackmailing are the currency of
savvy crisis diplomacy. And it is certainly true that [past US
presidents have regularly played nuclear
**brinks**]{.underline}~~man~~**[ship]{.underline}** with the Soviets
and Chinese [and displayed **incautious risk-taking** in their crisis
maneuvering]{.underline}. This was in fact the playbook of the Nixon
advisors who ordered the world-wide nuclear alert that my crewmate and I
helped implement in 1973. This alert sent a provocative message to the
Soviets: The United States was prepared to play nuclear roulette to gets
its way.15 [[**Nuclear roulette** begins]{.mark} at the outset of a
crisis as the [belligerents **intensify**]{.mark} **their
[\[ISR\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance **[operations]{.underline}**. The aim is to maintain
"situation awareness," but [the activities lend themselves to the
**worst-case interpretation** that the adversary is updating its
targeting in **preparing to strike**. Similarly, nuclear forces and
command structures are **programmed to go to higher readiness** to
prepare for war if the adversary will not back down]{.underline}.
[Although]{.underline} the [**motives** may be **[defensive]{.mark}**,
these **[activities]{.mark}**]{.underline} may appear to be precursors
of a first strike and [[provoke]{.mark} an [**action-reaction
spiral**]{.mark} that **[spins out of control]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Certainly, [if even a **single**]{.underline} nuclear [weapon were
**use**d]{.underline}, the strategic nuclear forces on both sides would
move rapidly to a maximum war footing and project credible mutual
threats of large-scale preemptive attack. In sum, a nuclear posture
gearing up for a possible enemy first strike [risks
becoming]{.underline} a **[self-fulfilling]{.underline}** prophecy. From
the perspective of presidential decision making, the
[first-use]{.underline} contingency [could easily accelerate
**escalation**]{.underline} to the point of causing mental duress.
[This]{.underline} contingency [is]{.underline} also [notable for its
[**absence of guardrails**]{.mark} and the **[ease]{.mark}** with which
[a **misguided**]{.mark} or rattled [president could **order**]{.mark}
it]{.underline}. The launch protocol described earlier for [**launch on
warning** applies]{.underline} equally to first use. Although the
timeline could be extended greatly, the president could choose at any
time to end the discussion and order a strike. During the Cold War, I
seldom practiced executing a first strike, and today there are no
foreseeable scenarios that would justify transgressing the nuclear taboo
of first use. Nevertheless, a first nuclear strike remains the default
contingency of the US posture, owing to the huge uncertainties
surrounding the alternatives -- second-strike retaliation and launch on
warning. A crisis that brings the belligerents to the brink of nuclear
war would compel consideration of first use. Nuclear warfighters who
reject the adage that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be
fought may well brief and tout the purported warfighting advantages of
going first. Even though first use runs counter to and undermines the
entire framework of the global nuclear order, in which nuclear weapons
exist only to deter, leaders may waver if it seems the least fraught
choice at the moment of truth. An impulsive president may be drawn to
it. Wiser advisors may counsel restraint, but nothing would stand in the
way of the president ordering a first strike. [The]{.underline} likely
if not [[**inevitable** consequence]{.mark} of attacking a nuclear
adversary with nuclear weapons [is nuclear **retal**]{.mark}iation and
**uncontrolled [escalation]{.mark}** []{.mark}that crosses the threshold
of acceptable damage to this nation. First use [runs an **existential
risk**]{.mark} to the]{.underline} United States and [the world. It
carries a huge risk of triggering a **nuclear exchange** of
**cataclysmic proportions**]{.underline} with massive casualties to all
the belligerent parties and beyond.

The effect of most leaked information, however, is not nearly so clear
as these extreme hypotheticals. Pozen recently argued that the
government has deliberately chosen not to punish leakers because while
individual leaks may be harmful to government interests, leaks as a
whole are more beneficial than detrimental.92 A permissive attitude
toward leaks allows the government to credibly "plant" information in
the press, and promotes the public's belief in the legitimacy of the
government, compensating for an overbroad classification system.93 The
focus of Pozen's analysis, however, is the much more common, everyday
leaks of higher-level government officials, and Pozen acknowledges that
some leaks can be truly harmful.94 Citing Chelsea Manning's disclosures
to WikiLeaks as a "rare undeniable leak"95 of the unauthorized nature,
Pozen concedes that [even a permissive approach to leakiness "cannot
tolerate the]{.underline} **[proliferation of internal
dissenters]{.underline}** [who seek to]{.underline} [**impeach the
entire secrecy and national security system**."]{.underline}96 Pozen's
account of the costs and benefits of leaking thus does not fully account

#### Shoring up the democratic model [cascades]{.underline} and prevents a [global]{.underline} erosion to authoritarianism that causes [nuclear war]{.underline}

Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, PhD in
Sociology from Stanford University, Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from
Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency, p. 199-202

[The most obvious response to the **ill winds blowing** from the world's
autocracies is to help the winds of freedom blowing in the **other
direction**]{.underline}. The [democracies]{.underline} of the West
cannot [save themselves if they do not **stand with democrats** around
the world]{.underline}.

[This is truer now than ever]{.underline}, for several reasons. [We live
in a globalized world, one in which **models**]{.underline}, trends, and
ideas [**cascade** across borders. Any wind of change may gather
**quickly** and blow with **gale force**. People everywhere **form
ideas** about how to govern]{.underline}---or simply about which forms
of government and sources of power may be irresistible---[based on what
they **see happening elsewhere**. We are now immersed in a fierce
**global contest of ideas**, information, and norms]{.underline}. In the
digital age, that contest is moving at lightning speed, shaping how
people think about their political systems and the way the world runs.
[As **doubts** about and **threats** to democracy are **mounting** in
the West, this is not a contest that the democracies can afford to
lose]{.underline}.

Globalization, with its flows of trade and information, raises the
stakes for us in another way. Authoritarian and badly governed regimes
increasingly pose a direct threat to popular sovereignty and the rule of
law in our own democracies. Covert flows of money and influence are
subverting and corrupting our democratic processes and institutions.
They will not stop just because Americans and others pretend that we
have no stake in the future of freedom in the world. If we want to
defend the core principles of self-government, transparency, and
accountability in our own democracies, we have no choice but to promote
them globally.

It is not enough to say that dictatorship is bad and that democracy,
however flawed, is still better. Popular enthusiasm for a lesser evil
cannot be sustained indefinitely. People need the inspiration of a
positive vision. Democracy must demonstrate that it is a just and fair
political system that advances humane values and the common good.

To make our republics more perfect, established democracies must not
only adopt reforms to more fully include and empower their own citizens.
They must also support people, groups, and institutions struggling to
achieve democratic values elsewhere. The best way to counter Russian
rage and Chinese ambition is to show that Moscow and Beijing are on the
wrong side of history; that people everywhere yearn to be free; and that
they can make freedom work to achieve a more just, sustainable, and
prosperous society.

In our networked age, both idealism and [the harder imperatives of
**global**]{.underline} power and [**security** argue for more
democracy, not less]{.underline}. For one thing, [if we do not worry
about]{.underline} the [quality of governance]{.underline} in
lower-income countries, [we will face more and more **troubled and
failing states**. **Famine** and **genocide** are the curse of
authoritarian states, not democratic ones. Outright **state collapse**
is the ultimate, bitter fruit of tyranny. When countries like **Syria**,
**Libya**, and **Afghanistan** descend into **civil war**; when poor
states in Africa cannot generate jobs and improve their citizens' lives
due to rule by corrupt and callous strongmen; when Central American
societies are held hostage by brutal gangs and kleptocratic rulers,
people flee---and wash up on the shores of the democracies]{.underline}.
Europe and the United States cannot withstand the rising pressures of
immigration unless they work to support better, more stable and
accountable government in troubled countries. [The world
has]{.underline} simply [grown too small]{.underline}, too flat, and too
fast [to **wall off**]{.underline} rotten [states]{.underline} and
pretend they are on some other planet.

[**Hard security interests** are at stake]{.underline}. As even the
Trump administration's 2017 National Security Strategy makes clear, [the
**main threats**]{.underline} to U.S. national security [all stem from
**authoritarianism**, whether in the form of tyrannies from **Russia**
and **China** to **Iran** and **North Korea** or in the guise of
antidemocratic terrorist movements such as **ISIS**]{.underline}.1 [By
supporting the development of democracy around the world, we can deny
these authoritarian adversaries the **geopolitical running room** they
seek]{.underline}. Just as Russia, China, and Iran are trying to
undermine democracies to bend other countries to their will, so too can
[we **contain**]{.underline} these [autocrats' ambitions by
helping]{.underline} other countries [build effective]{.underline},
resilient [democracies]{.underline} that can withstand the dictators'
malevolence.

Of course, democratically elected governments with open societies will
not support the American line on every issue. But no free society wants
to mortgage its future to another country. The American national
interest would best be secured by a pluralistic world of free
countries---one in which autocrats can no longer use corruption and
coercion to gobble up resources, alliances, and territory.

If you look back over our history to see who has posed a threat to the
United States and our allies, it has always been authoritarian regimes
and empires. As political scientists have long noted, [no two
democracies have ever gone to **war** with each other---ever. It is not
the democracies of the world that are supporting international
**terrorism**, proliferating **w**]{.underline}eapons of
**[m]{.underline}**ass **[d]{.underline}**estruction, [or threatening
the territory of their neighbors]{.underline}.

For all these reasons, [we need a new global campaign for
freedom]{.underline}. Everything I am proposing in this book plays a
role in that campaign, but in this chapter, I am concerned more narrowly
with the ways that we can directly advance democracy, human rights, and
the rule of law in the twenty-first-century world.

As with any policy area, many of the challenges can be somewhat
technical, requiring smart design and the careful management of programs
and institutions. Those operational debates I leave for another venue.
Here, I make a more basic case for four imperatives. First, we must
support the democrats of the world---the people and organizations
struggling to create and improve free and accountable government.
Second, we must support struggling and developing democracies, helping
them to grow their economies and strengthen their institutions. Third,
we must pressure authoritarian regimes to stop abusing the rights and
stealing the resources of their citizens, including by imposing
sanctions on dictators to make them think hard about their choices and
separate them from both their supporters and the people at large.
Finally, we need to reboot our public diplomacy---our global networks of
information and ideas---for today's fast-paced age of information and
disinformation. [For the sake of]{.underline} both [our
interests]{.underline} and our values, [we need a **foreign policy**
that puts a **high priority** on democracy]{.underline}, human rights,
and the rule of law.

### 2ac -- deterrence !

#### Leaks wreck nuclear deterrence

Rachel Elizabeth **Whitlark 19**, Political scientist and assistant
professor of international affairs at the Georgia Institute of
Technology, "5. Should Presidential Command Over Nuclear Launch Have
Limitations? In A Word, No.," Texas National Security Review, 7-2-2019,
https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-nuclear-first-use-and-presidential-authority/

While passing a law to require congressional or military-legal approval
before a nuclear launch could take place may seek to address fears of an
unjustified attack, taking such steps would be misguided. Specifically,
it would introduce **[complexity]{.underline}** [and
dangerous]{.underline} **[time delays]{.underline}** that
[would]{.underline}, as an unintended consequence, [**undermine
deterrence**, the]{.underline} quintessential **[purpose of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. That said, there are ways to build more
oversight of the president's nuclear authority while still maintaining
the critical deterrence mission.

Presidential Authority

From the moment consideration begins, a president can launch nuclear
weapons in mere minutes. To initiate the process, the president
discusses the situation with key members of the defense establishment,
including the secretary of defense, the head of U.S. Strategic Command
(responsible for strategic nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal), and the
combatant commanders whose geographical jurisdictions might be relevant
to the mission at hand. As a group, these individuals are critical for
discussing attack plans and targeting, as well as for offering advice
and counsel to the president, who alone must make the eventual
determination for how to proceed. Embedded in the deliberations are
legal considerations, as the military personnel are bound by the Law of
Armed Conflict,89 which demands necessity, distinction (between civilian
and military targets), and proportionality for any use of force. As
such, legal expertise is woven into military activities, including
nuclear missions, from the planning stage to the execution. From the
initial deliberation, if an order is given, it is verified by the
Department of Defense and communicated to the relevant launch crews, who
carry it out.90

Two sets of actors seem to be missing from or lacking formal roles in
this process. The first is Congress. For foreign and military matters,
the U.S. Constitution deliberately enshrined a system of shared powers
between the executive and legislative branches.91 Article I gives
Congress the power to declare war, raise and support armies, and provide
and maintain navies. Article II reserves the role of commander-in-chief
of the Army and the Navy for the office of the president. While only
Congress can declare war, presidents have repeatedly ordered forces into
action without congressional approval. Likewise, although the
Constitution is silent on nuclear matters for obvious reasons, the
president's commander-in-chief authority has extended to control over
nuclear use. One key motivation for this policy follows from the
founders' desire to enshrine civilian control over the military. Nuclear
authority specifically derives from World War II, when the president's
commander-in-chief authority extended, by default, to Harry Truman's
nuclear launch decision in 1945.92 Since then, when issues have arisen
regarding which war powers of the president are beyond congressional
control, little has been resolved, perhaps because the judiciary has
been wary of wading too far into this debate.93

In light of this lack of a formal role for Congress in nuclear command
authority, on Jan. 29, 2019, Sen. Ed Markey and Rep. Ted W. Lieu
reintroduced a bill first brought forward during the Obama
administration that seeks to prevent the president from launching a
nuclear first strike without congressional approval.94 There are 82
House co-sponsors and 13 in the Senate. Functionally, the bills seek to
legally prohibit the president from using nuclear weapons without first
determining that an enemy has launched a nuclear attack against the
United States. Absent such a determination, the launch of nuclear
weapons must be preceded by a congressional declaration of war that
explicitly authorizes nuclear use.

The second set of actors without a formal role in the process is the
secretary of defense and the attorney general. In light of this, a
second proposal, authored by Columbia University professors Richard
Betts and Matthew Waxman, supports requiring additional authentication
of a presidential order to use nuclear weapons,95 and does so by
formalizing a role for the defense and legal leadership. Betts and
Waxman advocate two added layers of verification. First, the defense
secretary, or her/his designee, would certify that the order to launch
nuclear weapons was valid, i.e., that it was actually from the
commander-in-chief. Second, the attorney general, or her/his designee,
would certify the order was legal. Through these measures, the defense
and legal authorities would have a formal role beyond their current
advisory capacity.

Dangerous Limitations

Beyond constitutional concerns, there are substantive reasons to be
skeptical of limiting presidential authority in this arena.
Specifically, [from a]{.underline} **[national security
perspective]{.underline}**, it is useful to have the ability to conduct
war in the hands of a single person because of the relative speed with
which one actor can mobilize when compared to the speed of 535 people.
[When threats manifest]{.underline}, it is often the case that speed and
**[secrecy]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[paramount
considerations]{.underline}** [for a state deciding how to respond. To
that end, national security decisions like]{.underline} **[mobilizing
for war]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} **[suffer]{.underline}** [---
through]{.underline} **[leaks]{.underline}** and lengthy discussion and
debate --- if they must occur within the halls of Congress. Speed,
[**stealth**, and]{.underline} **[nimble deliberations]{.underline}**
[can be]{.underline} **[incredibly important]{.underline}** [for
executing]{.underline} [**foreign policy and military operations**. This
remains the case both for consideration of]{.underline} **[nuclear
strikes]{.underline}** [as well as for]{.underline}
**[conventional]{.underline}** [scenarios, as these features are
**central to deterrence**]{.underline}. **[Any changes]{.underline}**
[to the existing system that]{.underline} could **[undermine
deterrence]{.underline}** [should be]{.underline}
**[avoided]{.underline}**.

Less Secure," E-International Relations, 10/4/2016,
https://www.e-ir.info/2016/10/04/a-no-first-use-policy-would-make-the-united-states-less-secure/

The very term "no-first-use" is misleading. While a nuclear weapon has
not been used in anger for over 70 years, nuclear weapons are used every
single day to deter large-scale conventional and nuclear attacks. Former
Air Force Chief of Staff General Larry Welch points out that "we have
used the nuclear forces every second of every day for 50 years."
Moreover, [during]{.underline} those [50 years, humankind has
experienced the **most peaceful period in its history**]{.underline} [as
measured by the number of conflict-related casualties as a proportion of
the world's population. This is due in large part to the
devastating]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}** [that nuclear weapons
pose to any society that is attacked with them]{.underline}. For the
United States and the Soviet Union, a large-scale nuclear exchange meant
the end of society as Americans and Russians had known it. [That risk
led American and Soviet leaders to exercise]{.underline} a level of
**[caution]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[restraint]{.underline}**
that was not exercised by German, Japanese, and other world leaders in
the years leading up to World War II.

If the United States were to adopt a no-first-use policy, the perceived
threat of nuclear conflict admittedly would decline. While [a decline in
the]{.underline} **[perceived threat]{.underline}** [of nuclear weapons
use]{.underline} may seem like a good thing, however, it
[is]{.underline} actually **[dangerous]{.underline}**
[because]{.underline} it is [that]{.underline} **[very perceived
threat]{.underline}** that [gives leaders who may be]{.underline}
**[contemplating]{.underline}** the use of **[force]{.underline}** [the
chance for]{.underline} **[second thoughts]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} can **[prevent great-power war]{.underline}**. This
is an important point. [Opening the door to great-power conflict, even
if]{.underline} [**ever so slightly**, is]{.underline}
**[obviously]{.underline}** a step in the **[wrong]{.underline}**
direction.

[Nor are great-power conflicts the]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}**
[dangerous challenge that nuclear weapons deter.]{.underline}
[**Biological**, **chemical**, and even well-organized and
targeted]{.underline} [**cyber**-attacks can be]{.underline} **[as
devastating]{.underline}** [as nuclear attacks]{.underline}. Some
proponents may claim that the combination of a no-first-use policy and
American conventional superiority plays to America's strength, but
recent history suggests that simply using our conventional forces rarely
achieves our political objectives. It is also worth noting that the U.S.
military is overstretched and on the verge of a readiness crisis. In the
European theater, for example, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
forces are judged by many to be insufficient to counter  a Russian
military advance into the Baltics. Most important, [the point of
deterrence is to]{.underline} **[prevent]{.underline}** a
**[war]{.underline}** **[from happening]{.underline}**, which is
frequently preferable to becoming engaged in a war even if one wins at
the end of the day.

Today?", Nação e Defesa, p. 11-14

In Russia, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea or Israel, the relevance
of nuclear deterrence is hardly questioned. However, in Western
countries, [nuclear deterrence has been the target of **criticism** on
strategic, legal and moral grounds]{.underline} since 1945. [In the past
decade, the renewed **debate** on nuclear disarmament has been
accompanied by an increase in such criticism. Efforts]{.underline} led
[by]{.underline} four US statesmen, or [the]{.underline} more [radical
Global Zero movement]{.underline}, as well as various diplomatic
initiatives, [have been accompanied by a flurry of new, serious
**academic studies** questioning the legitimacy of nuclear weapons. More
than ever, nuclear deterrence is attacked by]{.underline} many, both on
[the Left]{.underline} and on the Right. To the traditional arguments
related to the credibility of nuclear deterrence are now added two other
factors. First, nuclear weapons, it is argued, have limited value
vis-à-vis proliferation and terrorism, and such risks bolster the case
for nuclear disarmament. Second, alternatives such as high-precision
conventional means and missile defense are said to now be much more
effective than they were in the past. This paper refutes these arguments
on the grounds that nuclear deterrence has proven to be an effective war
prevention instrument, that it is cost-effective, and that today's
challenges confirm its relevance.

Nuclear Weapons Have Been Effective War-Prevention Tools

It is by definition impossible to prove that deterrence has worked, and
correlation is not causality. [But History gives us **solid arguments**
in support of the positive role played by nuclear weapons, especially
since our "database" now covers nearly 70 years]{.underline}.

[Firstly, no major power conflict has taken place in nearly **70
years**. The role of nuclear deterrence to explain this **historical
anomaly**]{.underline} has been highlighted by leading historians and
authors such as John Lewis Gaddis, Kenneth Waltz, and Michael Quinlan.3
[No comparable period of time has ever existed in the history of States.
There were two dozen conflicts among major powers in the equivalent
amount of time following the Treaties of Westphalia]{.underline} (1648),
[and several after the Vienna Congress]{.underline} (1815).4

[Secondly, there has never been a direct military conflict between two
nuclear States]{.underline}. Beyond this mere observation, two
[**studies** have shown that the possession of nuclear weapons by two
countries **significantly reduced**]{.underline} [the likelihood of war
between them (Pasley, 2008; Rauchhaus, 2009)]{.underline}. [Events in
Asia since 1949 provide an interesting test case. China and India fought
a war in 1962, but have refrained from resorting to arms against each
other ever since. There were three India-Pakistan wars]{.underline}
(1962, 1965 and 1971) [before both countries became nuclear; but since
the late 1980s]{.underline} (when the two countries acquired a minimum
nuclear capability), [none of the two has launched any significant air
or land operations against the other]{.underline}.

*Thirdly, no nuclear-armed country has ever been invaded*. This
proposition too can be tested by the evolution of regional crises.
Israel had been invaded in 1948, on the day of its independence. But [in
1973, Arab States deliberately limited]{.underline} their [operations to
disputed territories]{.underline} (the Sinai and the Golan Heights).7
[It is thus incorrect to take the example of the Yom Kippur war as a
"proof" of the failure of nuclear deterrence]{.underline}. Likewise,
India refrained from penetrating Pakistani territory at the occasion of
the crises of 1990, 1999, 2002 and 2008, whereas it had done so in 1965
and 1971. [Another example]{.underline} is sometimes [mistakenly
counted]{.underline} as a failure of nuclear deterrence: [the Falklands
War]{.underline} (1982). [But this was a British Dependent Territory for
which nothing indicated that it was covered by nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}. Furthermore, it would be erroneous to take
these two events as evidence that extended deterrence does not make
sense, as some authors have done ("if nuclear weapons cannot protect
part of the national territory, how could they protect a foreign
country?"8). Extended deterrence is meant to cover interests that are
much more important to the protector than nonessential territories; for
instance, during the Cold war Germany was much more "vital" to the
United States than, say, Puerto Rico.

*Fourthly, no country covered by a nuclear guarantee has ever been the
target of a major State attack*. Here again evidence is hard to give,
but can be found a contrario. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [refrained from invading Cuba]{.underline} in
1962, for instance, [but did not hesitate in invading Grenada, Panama or
Iraq. The Soviet Union invaded Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan,
but not a single US ally]{.underline}. China has refrained from invading
Taiwan, which benefits from a US defense commitment. North Korea invaded
its southern neighbor in 1950 after Washington had excluded it from its
"defensive perimeter", but has refrained from doing so since Seoul has
been covered with a nuclear guarantee. Neither South Vietnam nor Kuwait
were under the US nuclear umbrella. Russia could afford to invade
Georgia because its country was not a NATO member. A partial exception
is the shelling of Yeongpyeong island (2011); but the limited character
of the attack and its location (in a maritime area not recognized by
Pyongyang as being part of South Korean territory) make it hard to count
it as a major failure of extended deterrence.

Alternative Explanations Are Not Satisfying

[Some]{.underline} have [suggested alternative explanations
which]{.underline} all [rest]{.underline}, to some extent,
[on]{.underline} the idea that international society has undergone major
transformations since 1945: the development of international
[institutions]{.underline}, the progress of [democracy]{.underline}, the
rise of [global trade, etc.]{.underline}, to which is often added the
memories of the Second World War. Thus for authors such as John Mueller,
nuclear weapons played a marginal -- non-necessary -- role in the
preservation of peace.9 The Soviet Union, it is also argued, was a
status quo power in Europe which would not have taken the risk of a
major war on the continent.

[But such explanations are **not satisfying**. The rise of]{.underline}
international [trade]{.underline} from 1870 onwards [did not prevent the
First World War]{.underline}: Norman Angell's "Great Illusion" was a
fallacy. The construction of [a new global order based on the League of
Nations did not prevent the Second]{.underline}.10 Kenneth Waltz reminds
us that "in a conventional world even forceful and tragic lessons have
proved to be exceedingly difficult for states to learn".11 In the same
vein, Elbridge Colby holds that such cultural argumentation "markedly
overestimates the durability of historically contingent value systems
while seriously downplaying the enduring centrality of competition,
fear, uncertainty and power".12 Major powers have continued to use
military force in deadly conflicts, especially in the two decades after
1945: "war fatigue" is a limited and rather recent phenomenon. As for
[democratization]{.underline}, it [is obviously a red herring: during
the Cold war, the risk of major war was between pro-Western]{.underline}
(not all of them democratic until at least the late 1970s) [and
totalitarian regimes]{.underline}.

No one knows how a "non-nuclear cold war" would have unfolded in Europe.
However, without nuclear weapons, Washington might have hesitated to
guarantee the security in Europe ("no nukes, no troops"), and might have
returned to isolationism; and without US protection, the temptation for
Moscow to grab territory in Western Europe would have been stronger. And
as Michael Quinlan puts it, in order [to claim that nuclear deterrence
was key in the preservation of peace, one does **not need** to postulate
a Soviet desire for expansionist aggression: it is enough to argue that
"had armed conflict not been so manifestly intolerable the **ebb and
flow of friction** might have **managed with less caution**, and a
**slide sooner or later into major war**, on the pattern of 1914 or
1939, might have been less unlikely]{.underline}".14

Alternative explanations might not even suffice to explain the absence
of conflict among European countries: the integration process which
began in 1957 and culminated with the creation of the European Union in
1991 might have been much more difficult without the US umbrella.15
Neither are they satisfying regarding regional powers. It is hard to
believe that the political, economic and cultural factors mentioned
above are enough to explain the absence of a major conventional war
involving Israel, India or Pakistan since these countries have become
nuclear powers.16

[Deterrence has limited the **scope** and **intensity** of conflict
among the major States. If **crises** in **Europe**, as well as wars in
**Asia** and the **Middle East**, did not turn into **global
conflicts**, it is probably **due largely to nuclear weapons**. The fear
of nuclear war and the **precautions** taken by decisionmakers during
the Cold war to **reduce the risks of direct conflict** have been made
clear by a collective study that contradicts Mueller's
thesis]{.underline} (Gaddis, Gordon, May and Rosenberg, 1999).3

A former Russian official even writes:

> I dare claim and am ready to prove that nuclear weapons were the
> greatest 'civilizing tool' for these elites. They cleansed their ranks
> of all radicals and ideologues, and they strengthened the pragmatists
> who saw their main goal in averting a nuclear war or the
> [clashes]{.underline} that [had the potential to **escalate** to a
> nuclear conflict]{.underline}. 18

One could go as far as saying that [the international stability obtained
thanks to nuclear deterrence]{.underline} (in its national and extended
forms) [has been a form of **"global common good"**. For all non-nuclear
weapons States benefitted from it during the past 65-plus years -- even
though some]{.underline} of them [suffered from]{.underline} the
[indirect conflicts]{.underline} made possible by the
stability-instability paradox. [Without it]{.underline}, for instance,
[it is dubious that Asia would have known the peace and stability that
allowed for its massive transformation and development, leading to
hundreds of millions of human beings being lifted out of
poverty]{.underline}. Patrick Morgan adds that nuclear weapons may even
have hastened the end of the Cold war, by giving confidence to Soviet
leaders that the country's survival would be assured even after the loss
of the Eastern European *glacis*.19

In light of recent geostrategic developments, [some]{.underline} former
U.S. defense experts [are calling for the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [dramatically to curtail its nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}.

These experts assume that the deterrent value of nuclear weapons is
waning and that since the it spends far more on overall defense than do
other nations, the U.S. can afford to cut back in this area.\[2\]

But [are such recommendations unwise? **Absolutely**]{.underline}.

A former U.S. Chief of Naval Operations produced [a chart]{.underline}
some years ago [show]{.underline}ing [annual deaths per capita prior to
the nuclear age]{.underline}, in an era [when only conventional
deterrence existed. Surprisingly, after]{.underline} the atomic bombs
were dropped on [Hiroshima]{.underline} and Nagasaki, [the **worldwide
per capita death toll** from armed conflict during the next half-century
dropped 80%, and during the next seventy years, by **more than
90%**]{.underline}.\[3\]

[In the half-century before 1945, two conventional world wars were
fought, which included the **use of chemical weapons** and the
**fire-bombing of cities**. Add to that devastation the]{.underline}
deaths from the [**Nazi Holocaust** and the mass **murders committed in
the USSR by Stalin**]{.underline} and his successors, and it is clear
that hostile behavior by states was the norm even before the nuclear
age.

Retired General Brent Scowcroft, National Security Advisor to two U.S.
Presidents, once remarked that [the two world wars were a testament to
the **fragility** of traditional conventional
deterrence]{.underline}.\[4\]

[Since 1945, however, **large-scale war between nuclear-armed powers**
has been avoided. That is not to say that there have been no conflicts
between states]{.underline}. The fight between totalitarianism and
freedom took the form of a cross-border war in Korea, subversion and
guerilla warfare in Vietnam, and state-sponsored terrorism in Africa,
Central America and the Middle East, to name just a few. The fight
continues today, in the post-Cold War era, despite the \"end of
history\" narrative that promised armed conflict would pretty much
end.\[5\]

Potential [**major conflicts**, however, still are **prevented** by the
U.S. nuclear deterrent: on the **Korean peninsula**; between **China and
Taiwan**; in the **Middle East** and in **Eastern Europe**]{.underline}.

[Conflict continues]{.underline}, of course, [in the form of **Iranian
and North Korean** terrorist activity, Chinese aggression in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea,
[continued **Russian subversion in Ukraine** and elsewhere,
and]{.underline} in various terrorist activities [in **Africa** and the
**Middle East**]{.underline}. Those conflicts have not been prevented
even by conventional capabilities, let alone U.S. nuclear deterrent
forces. Nevertheless, [is the prudent response to jettison a significant
portion of U.S. nuclear capability?]{.underline}

[The new post-Cold War era still requires the prevention of any number
of possible crises from **escalating** into **armed conflict** between
any of the nine **nuclear-armed** nations. The era also requires
stopping **existing** conflicts from becoming **wholesale nuclear
wars**]{.underline}.

[It is]{.underline} always [important to avoid]{.underline} what Israeli
missile defense expert Uzi Rubin calls [**\"fortune cookie analysis\"**
\-- the claim that the need for nuclear deterrence is over because \"it
didn\'t stop 9-11\" or today\'s conflicts]{.underline}.\[6\]

Terrorist attacks, such as 9-11, were also not prevented by non-nuclear
capabilities such as the FBI, Coast Guard, Border Patrol, the military,
or intelligence agencies. But the U.S. nuclear deterrent is not there
just for today. Any future deterrent needs to be robust and flexible
enough to anticipate technological surprise. There can also be sudden
changes in regimes and regimes\' intentions; these must also be taken
into account.

In addition, emerging technological threats such as cyber-attacks, the
advanced capabilities of long-range conventional strikes, and the threat
of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attacks are changing the pattern of
deterrence among various countries, according to Andrew Krepinevich,
president of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments
(CSBA).\[7\] Even so, as he underscores the need for new deterrent
capabilities, he does not minimize the need for a continued powerful
nuclear deterrent.

It is not enough to claim that a much smaller, even minimalist, nuclear
deterrent, will suffice for today. \"Less\" does not automatically mean
\"better.\" Nor is it enough simply to add up what other countries spend
on defense, compare it to what the United States spends, and declare
that the two sides need only be relatively equal in defense expenditure
for deterrence to be effective.

Deterrence is not about guaranteeing to your adversaries that you will
only spend what the adversary deems acceptable to enable a \"fair
fight.\" It is important to spend whatever is needed to ensure a
credible, capable force. It would be reckless to adopt some arbitrary
figure based on what others might spend, or unilaterally to accept
sentimental notions about what is \"fair.\"

Unfortunately, there have been a number of recent calls for the U.S. to
reduce its nuclear arsenal unilaterally by 85% and to keep no more than
250 nuclear warheads. This low number would roughly equal the warheads
fielded by Pakistan and India combined.

What is the basis for such a proposal? Apparently such advocates start
with the assumption that a U.S. president will be deterred from taking
military action if, in a conflict, upward of 250 enemy warheads were
targeted in retaliation on American cities. [This logic
assumes]{.underline} that one\'s enemies think the same way as oneself,
and consequently, [that a small]{.underline} American
[arsenal]{.underline} of 250 nuclear warheads [would suffice to deter
would-be adversaries]{.underline}.

But do adversaries really think this way? Ironically, even the advocates
of such a minimal nuclear deterrent do not appear to believe their own
rhetorical assumptions. Most of the advocates of [a minimal nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} claim that 400 Minuteman silo-based missiles,
spread out over tens of thousands of square miles in five U.S. western
states, [would be vulnerable to attack]{.underline} by the same enemies
who are supposedly interested in attacking only cities. Why would Russia
or China target U.S. missile silos and other military assets when
presumably all they would need to do to maintain deterrence against the
U.S. is hold a few dozen American cities for ransom?

If one is to believe the advocates of minimum deterrence, Russia has
plans to attack 400 U.S. missile silos and nearly 50 associated launch
control centers. This assault would require Russia to maintain at least
900 warheads, attacking each American ICBM with at least two warheads to
ensure a high chance of destroying all of those targets.

But a Russia that had at least 900 warheads would not be balanced by the
United States that had only 250.

Deterrence simply does not work the way advocates of minimum deterrent
assert.

When a U.S. president orders military commanders to provide deterrence
against the country\'s enemies, this strategy must be measured against
what it takes to implement deterrence, and not against a nice round
number of nuclear warheads that appears \"reasonable.\"

Further, is a U.S. president comfortable with only the option of
striking back at an adversary\'s cities? Would threatening to incinerate
millions even be a moral or workable deterrent strategy? With 250
warheads in total, and perhaps just half of them available for
retaliation, [the only targets a U.S. president could sufficiently
threaten would be an adversary\'s cities, but not]{.underline} an
adversary\'s **[military assets]{.underline}** \-- not to mention if
other countries were to pile on, such as Russia, China, North Korea and
Iran.

The [minimalists argue that destroying]{.underline} a nation\'s [cities
would certainly deter any]{.underline} sane national [leader.
Yet]{.underline}, as Keith Payne, president of the National Institute of
Public Policy, explains, [many nations have not been deterred from
aggression, even by the prospect of losing millions of their own
citizens]{.underline}.\[8\] [In efforts to achieve their political
objectives, the Soviet Union, Iran, Cambodia, China and North Korea, to
mention the most obvious, have slaughtered tens of millions of their own
people]{.underline}. In communist nations alone, the number exceeds 95
million.\[9\] Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan killed and maimed millions
of their own people by going to war and continuing the conflict even
when their defeat was clearly imminent.

Would the U.S. seek to deter ISIS and Hezbollah this way? Or Iran or
North Korea, for that matter?

The weapons or [military assets]{.underline} of one\'s adversaries \--
the weapons one would need to hold at risk or target \-- [are precisely
the instruments of state power on which these enemies rely for their
status as global or regional powers and prestige. Holding such assets at
risk gives the U.S. president the **ultimate \"stick\"**]{.underline}
with which to threaten to take away the adversary\'s power: his military
assets.

Today, non-state terrorist organizations also have such assets, as seen
from fighting ISIS, Al Qaeda, Hamas Hezbollah, the FMLN and FARC.

Thus, holding at risk, or being able to destroy a significant number of,
say, Russian submarines, missile silos, bomber bases, and other
instruments of military power, thereby leaving Russia unable to act as a
major power, is not an attempt to \"go first\" in a crisis or \"get the
jump\" on one\'s enemies. Instead, it merely places at risk all the
instruments of state power \-- consisting of hundreds of militarily
critical targets \-- upon which, for instance, a Russian or Chinese head
of state relies for world power status.

This plan requires a nuclear deterrent capable of striking back at an
enemy with sufficient surviving nuclear warheads, even after absorbing
an enemy\'s initial strike against one\'s own military assets.

A deterrent strategy such as the U.S. has today leaves nuclear-armed
adversaries with only one sound choice in a crisis. Either they risk
\"Armageddon\" and use all their nuclear weapons early in a crisis, to
avoid seeing any of their military assets destroyed by the U.S. in a
subsequent retaliatory strike; or they stand down, not launching their
nuclear weaponry, and instead seek to end any crisis through
diplomatically. This is the essence of deterrence. It is one that the
late American diplomat Paul Nitze described as the \"Not Today,
Comrade\" option.\[10\] Today it would be, \"Not Today, Jihadi.\"

Such a deterrent strategy, as advocated here and reflected in America\'s
current nuclear modernization plans, stands the test of logic. If an
adversary used all its nuclear forces against the U.S. in a first
strike, such an attack would invite a massive retaliatory strike from
the U.S. that would leave an attacker completely destroyed.

But [that]{.underline}, of course, [requires a survivable U.S. deterrent
force to begin with; not one subject to being eliminated by an enemy\'s
first strike because the U.S. deterrent was **so small** that it was
**no deterrent at all**]{.underline}.

According to the Obama administration, to guarantee maximum flexibility
in a crisis so that a president can be confident he has a survivable
deterrent, a robust deployment of 1550 warheads is required, on a
mixture of 12 submarines, 400 ICBMs and 40-60 bombers. Fortunately, this
is the number the U.S. can field under the 2010 New Start Treaty with
Russia.

Having a nuclear deterrent strategically dispersed among over 500
nuclear assets \-- submarines, land-based missiles, and bombers \--
means that any enemy attempt to destroy the U.S. nuclear arsenal before
the U.S. could use it, would require an unambiguous attack. If an
adversary, such as Russia, were to deploy its entire arsenal against the
United States, the attack would involve over fifteen hundred warheads.

The U.S. would know from where most of the warheads would be coming:
ICBMs flying over the North Pole could easily be seen by U.S.
early-warning satellites.

U.S. allies also would see preparations, such as weapons platforms
moved, for such a strike. Enemy forces would have to be moved from a
day-to-day alert status to heightened alert if there were plans to
destroy U.S. nuclear forces in their entirety. That is why the U.S. has,
and is planning to keep, more than 500 nuclear assets, including
submarines, bombers, and silo-based missiles capable of surviving even
the most massive strike.

Deploying only 250 warheads, however \-- all of them on submarines, as
many minimal deterrent advocates have proposed \-- would make such a
secure retaliatory force impossible to maintain. It would also so
minimize the size of the U.S. deterrent forces \-- to fewer than 10
targets \-- as possibly to invite an attack.

By contrast, a flexible U.S. nuclear deterrent policy, based on keeping
a large deployment of day-to-day survivable forces \-- numbering over
500 missiles, submarines and bombers \-- leaves the president options.
There is no need to act rashly. An enemy could then be informed that any
attack, no matter how large, would invite such a massive retaliation
that no benefit whatsoever would accrue to the attacker. Such a force
also would allow the president, during a crisis, to make the U.S.
deterrent even more survivable over time, by putting more U.S.
submarines to sea and placing U.S. bombers on alert or in the air.

Such [a new nuclear force of submarines, bombers and ICBMs, which **the
U.S. is now beginning to produce**]{.underline} (albeit after much
delay), [would allow the U.S. to threaten the **entire range** of an
adversary\'s military assets, and not be limited only to striking back
at an enemy\'s cities]{.underline}. These twin capabilities \-- having a
survivable force day-to-day and an even more highly survivable force
over time \-- would avoid putting all one\'s nuclear eggs in one
minimalist leaky basket.

[The U.S. nuclear \"Triad\"]{.underline} consists [of]{.underline}
nuclear [warheads]{.underline} mounted on platforms based [at sea, in
the air and on land]{.underline}.

The strategy [is called **\"crisis stability\"**: giving no nuclear
power the incentive to strike first, and providing **the world** with
the **stability** it needs to **avoid Armageddon**]{.underline}.

[For **70 years**, this strategy has **kept the nuclear peace**. This
strategy even allowed the U.S. and]{.underline} the USSR, (subsequently
[Russia) carefully and logically to reduce the number of]{.underline}
strategic, long-range nuclear [weapons by nearly 90%, while maintaining
strategic stability]{.underline}.

[In short, **nuclear deterrence still matters**]{.underline}. If the
U.S. deterrent is even more survivable, flexible, and robust, while
maintained at lower levels than during the Cold War, such
[modernization]{.underline} as the U.S. is now planning
[provides]{.underline} America\'s [leaders with the **leverage** in a
**crisis** to keep a **major armed conflict** from breaking
out]{.underline}. And it keeps the United States and its allies safe.

Unlike spies, most of whom are eventually caught; leakers of classified
information are infrequently identified. The dramatic cases of Snowden
(who identified himself) and Manning are notable exceptions. [**[Most
leakers]{.underline}** [remain]{.underline}
**[hidden]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, and [only a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[handful]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have ever been

**[dismal]{.underline}**. During the four-year period 2009-2013,
intelligence agencies filed 153 crimes reports about classified leaks to
the press with the Department of Justice. But only 24 were investigated;
only half of these were identified, and not a single indictment was
issued.27 The scorecard reads: Leakers 153; Intelligence Community 0. In
general, our legal system is ill equipped to deal with leakers.28 And
the culture that strongly supports First Amendment press freedoms often
seems conflicted about whether leakers are really law-breakers and is
skeptical that press leaks of intelligence actually do much damage.
Perhaps [the **great**est **damage**]{.underline} to national security
from press leaks, as with espionage, [is **opportunity costs**: The
**intel**ligence that will never be collected or used for the nation's
decision advantage because of the damage to or even the loss of
classified collection sources and methods compromised by press
leaks]{.underline}.

Conclusions

Importantly, American spies and government employees who leak classified
information to the press have recently become a national priority for a
concerted program to counter the threats they pose to national security.
On November 21, 2012, the White House issued a Presidential Memorandum
establishing [a new]{.underline} **[Insider Threat
Program]{.underline}**. It aims to deter, detect, and mitigate such
actions by government employees as espionage and unauthorized
disclosures of classified information, including "vast amounts of
classified data available on interconnected United States Government
computer networks and systems."29 While a notably important initiative,
it [falls]{.underline} **[dramatically short]{.underline}** of the
comprehensive steps really needed.

directly with diminished capabilities of the major instruments of
national power---and thus, a diminution of American power. **The

review of how the nation keeps its secrets -- and how to get better at
it -- is long overdue.

WHAT MAY GO WRONG

As already noted, [a fashionable rejoinder]{.underline} to such
broodings [is to insist that all]{.underline} of these [states will be
mutually deterred. Any intelligent state, it is argued, should know that
using nuclear weapons is militarily self-defeating and that these
weapons' only legitimate mission is to deter]{.underline} military
threats. [According to this view, fretting about nuclear use and
proliferation is mistaken or overwrought.]{.underline}18

**[But is it?]{.underline}** **[Can]{.underline}** [states deter
military threats with **nuc**lear weapon**s** if their]{.underline}
**[actual use]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[universally
viewed]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} being
**[self-defeating?]{.underline}** [Which nuclear-armed states, if
any,]{.underline} **[actually believe]{.underline}** [they
are]{.underline} **[militarily useless?]{.underline}** As noted earlier,
[the]{.underline} [**[Russia]{.mark}**ns and]{.underline}
[**[Pakistan]{.mark}**is clearly do not. Just the]{.underline}
[**opposite**, they have gone]{.underline} **[out of their
way]{.underline}** [to develop]{.underline} **[battlefield
nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon**[s]{.underline}** and plan to use them
first to deter and defeat opposing advanced conventional forces. As for
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[**France**, and]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom, [all have]{.underline} [**studiously
refuse**d to renounce first use]{.underline}. Israel, meanwhile, insists
that, while it will not be first to introduce nuclear weapons in the
Middle East, it will not be second. This leaves North Korea---a wild
card---and India and China, whose declared no first use policies are
either unclear or under reconsideration.19

[However, are the days of highly destructive wars--- nuclear or
nonnuclear---not behind us?]{.underline} Certainly, with the events
surrounding September 11, 2001 (9/11), this view has gained increasing
support from a number of U.S. and allied military analysts and
pundits.20 Reflecting this outlook, the United States and its European
allies have turned several Cold War nuclear "survival" bunkers into
private real estate offerings or historical tourist sites.21

[The problem is that]{.underline} at least two states have not done so.
U.S. intelligence agencies have determined that **[Russia]{.underline}**
invested over US\$6 billion to expand a 400-square-mile underground
nuclear complex at Yamantau, a full decade after the fall of the Berlin
Wall. This complex is burrowed deep enough to withstand a nuclear
attack, [and]{.underline} is large enough and provisioned sufficiently
to house 60,000 people for months. U.S. intelligence officials believe
it is one of a system of as many as 200 Russian nuclear bunkers (see
figure 3-7).22

\[\[FIGURE 3.7 OMITTED\]\]

[**[China]{.mark}**'s nuclear passive defense is]{.underline} no less
**[impressive]{.underline}**. In 2009, China's strategic missile
command, the 2nd Artillery Brigade, revealed that it had completed 3,000
miles of dispersed, deep, underground tunnels for the deployment of its
nuclear-capable cruise and ballistic missile forces. China spent
enormous sums to build this system and is still expanding the complex,
known as the Underground Great Wall. The system is said to be
**[designed]{.underline}** and provisioned [to **house
thousands**]{.underline} of military staff [during a]{.underline}
**[nuclear exchange]{.underline}** (see figure 3-8).24

\[\[FIGURE 3.8 OMITTED\]\]

GOING BALLISTIC

All of [this suggests]{.underline} that several [nuclear-armed states
**still [believe]{.mark}** [they may]{.mark} have to **endure** or
**[engage in nuclear exchanges]{.mark}**. **Fortifying**]{.underline}
[this suspicion is the increasing capacity states have to deliver both
nuclear and nonnuclear payloads quickly against one
another]{.underline}. Back in 1962, only the United States and Russia
had nuclear-capable missile systems---i.e., cruise or ballistic missile
systems capable of delivering a first-generation nuclear warhead
(weighing 500 kilograms) 300 kilometers or farther.26 Now, no fewer than
24 countries have perfected or acquired such systems, and nine can
launch a satellite into orbit---i.e., have mastered all that is needed
to deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). In addition, the
United States, China, Iran, South Korea, Israel, and key NATO states are
all working on precision conventional missiles capable of knocking out
large military bases and major naval surface combatants that, only a few
decades ago, were difficult or impossible to destroy without using
nuclear weapons.27 More nuclear-capable missile states are likely to
emerge (see figure 3-9).

\[\[FIGURE 3.9 OMITTED\]\]

[The]{.underline} **[strategic uncertainties]{.underline}** [these
missile trends can generate are]{.underline} **[difficult to
exaggerate]{.underline}**. First, the
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [[of]{.mark} **long-range
[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[allows]{.mark} many [more countries
to play in any]{.mark} given **[regional dispute]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
One way to measure a state's diplomatic potential to influence others
militarily is simply to map out the range arcs of its deployed missiles.
Today, increasingly, these arcs and the diplomatic-political "power"
shadows they cast overlap. Consider **[Iran]{.underline}**: its missiles
now target Israel, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
**[Russia]{.underline}**, Pakistan, France, Saudi Arabia,
**[China]{.underline}**, and [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom.

This is a very different world than that of a half-century ago. In 1962,
when alliance loyalties within the Communist and Free World Blocs were
at their height, only Russia and America had missiles aimed at each
other. Now, there is no Communist Bloc, what remains of the Free World
alliance system (e.g., NATO; Australia, New Zealand, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates Security Treaty
\[ANZUS\]; etc.) is relatively weak, and nuclear-capable missiles in
hotspots like the Persian Gulf could be fired from any number of
states---both near and far. For nuclear-armed states, this situation
places a premium on protecting their nuclear weapons-related systems
against surprise attack.29 It also raises first-order questions about
nuclear escalation, which brings us to the second reason more missiles
in more hands is a major worry: these **[missiles]{.underline}** also
[can [act as]{.mark}]{.underline} **[conventional
[catalysts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for]{.underline} **[nuclear
wars]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Increasingly, with precision guidance and advanced munitions
technologies, it is possible to destroy targets that once required
nuclear weapons---e.g., large air strips and air fields, command
centers, naval ports, and even large, moving surface ships---with a
handful of precise, conventionally-armed missiles instead. This has
raised the prospect of states being able to knock out a significant
portion of an opponent's key military forces without having to use
nuclear weapons.30

The good news is that this should make the initial use of nuclear
weapons less likely. The bad news is that [with enough precision
guidance capabilities, [a state might]{.mark} be tempted to]{.underline}
[**[initiate combat]{.underline}** [in the **expectation**]{.underline}
[of winning without]{.underline}]{.mark} [ever [having to go nuclear
and]{.mark} end up]{.underline} [**[miscalculating]{.mark}**
badly]{.underline}.

WAR SCENARIOS

A real-world case, much discussed by Pakistani security analysts, is the
mid-term prospect of an Indian conventional missile decapitation of
Pakistani nuclear strategic command and control centers. The Indians, in
this scenario, would use precise, offensive, longrange missiles to
destroy these centers. Then, New Delhi could deter any remaining
Pakistani retaliatory nuclear strike with India's much larger nuclear
forces and with Indian nonnuclear missile defenses. Finally, India could
prevail against Pakistani armor and artillery, with superior Indian
military conventional forces.

To hedge against this prospect, Pakistan ramped up its nuclear arms
production and is deploying its nuclear weapons in ways designed to
complicate Indian efforts to destroy them (e.g., delegation of launch
authority under certain circumstances, forward deployment, dispersal,
mobility, etc.). All of these methods only increase the prospects for
nuclear use and have goaded India to develop new nuclear options of its
own.

[Beyond this, advanced conventional weapons [might
ignite]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[nuclear conflict]{.mark}
directly]{.underline}. Again, consider India and Pakistan. After being
targeted by so many Pakistani-backed terrorist attacks, the Indian
Government has developed a conventional counterstrategy known as "Cold
Start." Under this approach, India would respond to Pakistan-backed
terrorist attacks by quickly seizing a limited amount of Pakistani
territory with quick alert, forward deployed Indian forces (i.e., that
could launch from what Indian military planners call a "cold start").
The idea here would be to threaten to take a limited amount of territory
that Pakistan holds dear, but not enough to prompt Pakistan to attack
India with its nuclear weapons.

Unfortunately, India's adoption of its Cold Start plan has had nearly
the reverse effect. Shortly after New Delhi broached this strategy,
Pakistani military officials announced their intent to use tactical
nuclear weapons against any invading Indian force and deployed new,
short-range nuclear-capable tactical missiles along the Pakistani-Indian
border precisely for this purpose. India has responded by deploying
tactical missiles of its own. It is unclear just how serious either
India or Pakistan are about carrying out these war plans, but this
uncertainty is itself a worry.31

Of course, relying on nuclear weapons to counter conventional threats is
not unique to Pakistan. Moscow, faced with advanced Chinese and NATO
conventional forces, has also chosen to increase its reliance on
tactical nuclear weapons. For Russia, employing these weapons is far
less stressful economically than trying to field advanced conventional
forces and is militarily pragmatic, given Russia's shrinking cohort of
eligible military servicemen. China, in response, may be toying with
deploying additional tactical nuclear systems of its own.32

CHINA AND THE NUCLEAR RIVALRIES AHEAD

All of these trends are challenging. They also suggest what the next
strategic arms competition might look like. First, if the United States
and Russia maintain or reduce their current level of nuclear weapons
deployments, it is possible that at least one other nuclear weapons
state may be tempted to close the gap. Of course, in the short- and even
mid-term, Pakistan, Israel, and India could not hope to catch up. For
these states, getting ahead of the two superpowers would take great
effort and at least one to three decades of continuous, flat-out
military nuclear production. It is quite clear, moreover, that none of
these states have set out to meet or beat the United States or Russia as
a national goal.

China, however, is a different matter. It clearly sees the United States
as a key military competitor in the Western Pacific and in Northeast
Asia. China also has had border disputes with India and historically has
been at odds with Russia as well. It is not surprising, then, that China
has actively been modernizing its nuclear-capable missiles to target key
U.S. and Indian military air and sea bases with advanced conventional
missiles, and is developing missiles that are even more advanced to
threaten U.S. carrier task forces on the open seas. In support of such
operations, China is also modernizing its military space assets, which
include military communications, command, surveillance, and imagery
satellites and an emerging antisatellite capability.33

Then there is China's nuclear arsenal. For nearly 30 years, most
respected Western security analysts have estimated the number of
deployed Chinese nuclear warheads to be between 190 and 300.34 Yet, by
any account, China has produced enough weapons-usable plutonium and
uranium to make up to four times this number of weapons. Why, then, have
Chinese nuclear deployments been judged to be so low?

First, China has experienced first-hand what might happen if its nuclear
weapons fell into the wrong hands. During the Cultural Revolution, one
of its nuclear weapons laboratories test fired a nuclear-armed
medium-range missile over heavily populated regions of China and
exploded the device. Not long after, Mao Zedong ordered a major
consolidation of China's nuclear warheads and had them placed under much
tighter centralized control. Arguably, the fewer nuclear warheads China
has, the easier it is for its officials to maintain control over them.35

Second, and possibly related, is China's declared nuclear weapons
strategy. In all of its official military white papers since 2006 and in
other forums, Chinese officials insist that Beijing would never be first
to use nuclear weapons and would never use them against any nonnuclear
weapons state. China also supports a doctrine that calls for a nuclear
retaliatory response that is no more than what is "minimally" required
for its defense. Most Western Chinese security experts have interpreted
these statements to mean that Beijing is interested in holding only a
handful of opponents' cities at risk. This, in turn, has encouraged
Western officials to settle uncertainties regarding Chinese nuclear
warhead numbers toward the low end.36

What China's actual nuclear use policies might be, though, is open to
debate. As one analyst quipped, with America's first use of nuclear
weapons against Japan in 1945, it is literally impossible for any
country other than the United States to be first in using these weapons.
More important, Chinese officials have emphasized that Taiwan is not an
independent state and that under certain circumstances, it may be
necessary for China to use nuclear weapons against this island
"province." In addition, there are the notso-veiled nuclear threats that
senior Chinese generals have made against the United States if it should
use conventional weapons against China in response to a Chinese attack
against Taiwan (including the observation that the United States would
not be willing to risk Los Angeles to save Taipei).37

Finally, as China deploys more land-mobile and submarine-based nuclear
missile systems, there will be increased technical and bureaucratic
pressures to delegate more launch authority to each of China's military
services. China's ballistic missile submarines already have complete
nuclear systems under the command of their respective submarine
captains. As China deploys ever more advanced road-mobile nuclear
missiles, their commanders may want to have similar authority.
Historically, in the United States and Russia, such delegation of launch
authority came with increased nuclear weapons requirements.38

The second cause for conservatism in assessing China's arsenal is the
extent to which estimates of the number of Chinese warheads have been
tied to the observed number of Chinese nuclear weapons missile
launchers. So far, the number of these launchers that have been seen has
been relatively low. Moreover, few, if any, missile reloads are assumed
for each of these missile launchers and it is presumed only a handful of
China's missiles have multiple warheads. The numbers of battlefield
nuclear weapons, such as nuclear artillery, are also presumed to be low
or nonexistent.

All of this may be right, but there are reasons to wonder. The Chinese,
after all, claim that they have built 3,000 miles of tunnels to hide
China's nuclear-capable missile forces and related warheads and that
China continues to build such tunnels. Employing missile reloads for
mobile missile systems has been standard practice for Russia and the
United States. It would be odd if it were not also a Chinese practice,
particularly given China's growing number of land-mobile solid-fueled
rocket and cruise missile systems. With China's recent development of
the DF-41, a massive, mobile, nuclear-armed ICBM, and its deployment of
multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRVs) on its
silo-based DF-5s, U.S. authorities believe China is deploying a new
generation of MIRV missiles.39 As already noted, several experts believe
China may be considering battlefield artillery for the delivery of
tactical nuclear shells.

Precisely how large is China's nuclear arsenal, then? The answer is
unclear. The Chinese say they are increasing the size of their nuclear
weapons arsenal "appropriately."40 They have not yet said by how much.
General Viktor Yesin, the former chief of Russia's strategic rocket
forces, told U.S. security experts in 2012 that China may have more than
900 deployed nuclear weapons and another 900 nuclear weapons stored in
reserve.41 This estimate, which is roughly seven times greater than most
analysts believe Beijing possesses, would give China roughly as many
warheads as the United States currently has deployed.42 Putting aside
how accurate this Russian projection might be, the first problem it and
other larger estimates present is how sound long-term U.S. and Russian
strategic plans might be. It hardly is in Washington's or Moscow's
interest to let Beijing believe it could threaten Taiwanese, Japanese,
American, Indian, or Russian targets conventionally because China's
nuclear forces were so large Beijing could assume they would deter any
of these states from ever responding militarily (see figure 3-10).

\[\[FIGURE 3.10 OMITTED\]\]

Yet another question that a much larger Chinese nuclear strategic force
would raise is how it might affect future U.S.-Russian strategic arms
negotiations. As China has increased its deployments of highly precise,
nuclear-capable missile systems, Moscow has chaffed at the missile
limits that the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty imposes
on its fielding similar systems. Since the conclusion of New START in
2011, Moscow has balked at making any further cuts unless China is
included in the negotiations. Shortly after several U.S. security
analysts and Members of Congress spotlighted Russian moves to break out
of the INF Treaty,44 the State Department announced that Russia, in
fact, had violated the treaty.45 American hawks, meanwhile, have warned
against the United States making further nuclear cuts lest other states,
like China, quickly ramp up their force levels to meet or exceed ours.
Yet, U.S. President Donald Trump has voiced a desire to do so.46 All of
this suggests the imperative for Washington and Moscow to factor China
into their arms control and strategic modernization calculations. The
question is how.

OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES

Unfortunately, getting a sound answer to this question is not possible
without first considering the security concerns of states other than the
United States, Russia, and China. **[Japan]{.underline}**, for one,
[is]{.underline} an [interested]{.underline} party. It already has
roughly 2,000 weapons' worth of separated plutonium on its soil. This
plutonium was supposed to fuel Japan's light water and fast reactors, a
fleet that, before the accident at Fukushima, consisted of 54 reactors.
After the accident, Japan shut down all of these plants, decided to
reduce its reliance on nuclear power as much as possible, and is
projected in the mid-term to bring no more than one-third of its light
water reactor fleet back online.47 Meanwhile, Japan's fast reactor
program has been effectively frozen since the 1990s due to a series of
accidents. Japan, the United States, and France plan on cooperating on a
renewed effort, but it is unlikely that a new fast reactor will be
operating in Japan for decades.48

A related and immediate operational question is whether Japan will bring
a US\$20-billion-plus commercial nuclear spent-fuel reprocessing plant
capable of producing roughly 1,500 bombs' worth of plutonium a year at
Rokkasho online sometime in the spring of 2021. This plutonium recycling
effort has been controversial. The original decision to proceed with it
was made by former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and can be tied to
Japanese considerations of developing a plutonium nuclear weapons
option. Although this plant is not necessary for the management of
Japan's spent fuel, the forward costs of operating it could run as high
as US\$100 billion. It is expected to produce 8 tons of weapons-usable
plutonium annually---enough to produce nearly as many first-generation
nuclear weapons as is contained in America's entire deployed nuclear
force (see figure 3-11).49

\[\[FIGURE 3.11 OMITTED\]\]

In light of the questionable technical and economic benefits of
operating Rokkasho, it would be difficult for Tokyo to justify
proceeding with this plant's operation unless it wanted to develop an
option to build a large nuclear weapons arsenal.51 Given Japan currently
retains nearly 11 tons of mostly reactor-grade plutonium on its soil,
enough to make roughly 2,000 first-generation nuclear warheads, there is
no immediate need to bring Rokkasho online to assure a military nuclear
option.

However, Japan says it is committed to eliminating this surplus
plutonium stockpile and recently surrendered roughly 800 kilograms of
weapons-grade plutonium and uranium to the United States in pursuance of
this stated goal.52 In this context, keeping Rokkasho on the ready could
be seen as a national security insurance policy. Some leading Japanese
figures clearly see it in this light,53 and technically, there is little
question that the plutonium could be used to make effective weapons.54
In this regard, even under a much less nationalistic, pro-nuclear
government than the one now in office, Japan's National Diet in the fall
of 2012 felt compelled to clarify in law that the purpose of the
country's atomic energy program included supporting Japan's "national
security."55 Many nuclear observers outside of Japan saw this as a
not-so-veiled reference to Japan's "civilian" plutonium-fuel cycle
program.

Certainly, South Korean and Chinese officials and commentators
spotlighted this prospect with concern.56 Their apprehensions, then,
raise the questions: What might happen if Japan ever decided to open
Rokkasho? How could this avoid stoking South Korean ambitions to make
their own nuclear fuels? What of China's longterm efforts to modernize
its own nuclear weapons systems and its "peaceful" scheme of building a
copy of Rokkasho itself? Would starting up Rokkasho not catalyze these
efforts? What if Japan's [startup]{.underline} of Rokkasho came after
some Chinese or North Korean military provocation? [Might]{.underline}
this not [trigger **a**]{.underline}n additional [round of]{.underline}
[[**Chinese**, **No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rean, [and
**So**]{.mark}uth]{.underline} [**[Ko]{.mark}**rean]{.underline}
military and **[[nuclear hedging]{.underline}]{.mark}** actions?57

Yet another "peaceful" East Asian nuclear activity that bears watching
is the substantial plans both Japan and China have to enrich uranium.
Both countries justify these efforts as being necessary to fuel their
light water reactor fleets. There are several difficulties with this
argument, though. First, both countries already have access to foreign
uranium enrichment services that are more than sufficient to supply
current demand. Second, any effort to become commercially
self-sufficient in enriching uranium in the name of "energy
independence" is questionable for Japan and China, given their lack of
economic, domestic sources of highgrade uranium ore.

Even assuming China could stop importing enrichment services, as it now
does from URENCO of Europe and Minatom/Tenex of Russia, then it still
would want to import much of its uranium ore from overseas. Of course,
operating a commercial enrichment capacity could afford a bargaining
advantage to secure cheaper foreign enrichment service contracts. In
China's case (and Japan's and South Korea's cases as well), such
advantage can be had at enrichment capacities far below those they have
or want to acquire. Again, both uranium ore and enrichment services are
readily available globally at reasonable prices and are projected to
remain so. Uranium yellowcake spot prices are currently at historic
lows. As for enrichment services, the world's current surplus of
enrichment capacity is projected to persist at least through 2035.58 In
short, there is no lack of enrichment services internationally and,
given China's access to Russian and European enrichers, there is little
or no immediate economic imperative for building more.

China, however, sees things differently. It currently has enough
capacity to fuel a dozen large reactors and is building more than enough
centrifuges to fuel 58 gigawatts of nuclear capacity, optimistically
projected to be online by 2020.59 Some of this projected capacity may be
set aside for possible reactor exports beyond those China is making to
Pakistan. Yet, again given the foreign enrichment services glut, none of
this enrichment expansion makes economic sense. What is all too clear,
however, is just how much of a military option this enrichment capacity
affords. By 2020, China's planned enrichment capacity could fuel all of
its planned civilian reactors and still produce additional material
sufficient for more than 1,500 nuclear weapons a year.60

Japan's enrichment plans differ only in scale. Like China, it too lacks
economic, domestic sources of highgrade uranium ore. As for Tokyo's
current enrichment capacity, it can fuel about eight reactors a year. If
Japan used all of this enrichment capacity for military purposes, it
could make roughly 4,500 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium
annually---enough to make at least 200 first-generation nuclear
weapons.61 Japan plans to upgrade its uranium enrichment centrifuges.
The question, in light of the global surplus of commercial uranium
enrichment capacity, though, is why (see figure 3-12).

\[\[FIGURE 3.12 OMITTED\]\]

As noted, China or South Korea agree with none of these Japanese nuclear
fuel-making activities and plans. Seoul, in a not so well-disguised
security hedge, began to press Washington in 2009 for permission to
separate "peaceful" plutonium from U.S.-origin spent fuel and to enrich
U.S.-origin uranium in South Korea.

These requests coincided with several other South Korean
security-related demands. The first came after North Korea's sinking of
the Cheonan and the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island. South Korean
Parliamentarians asked the United States to redeploy U.S. tactical
nuclear weapons on South Korean soil. Washington refused.63 Then Seoul
pushed Washington to extend the range of its nuclear-capable missiles
from 300 to 800 kilometers, and be practically freed from range limits
on its cruise missile and space satellite launchers. Washington
relented.64 As for South Korea's nuclear demands, Seoul is likely to
continue to press its case.65

The question is what is next? Will Japan start Rokkasho as planned in
2021? What commercial nuclear fuel making activities, if any, might
Washington allow South Korea and China to engage in?66 Will North Korea
or China continue to engage in provocations that will increase Japanese
or South Korean demands for more strategic military independence from
their American security alliance partner?

The two popular rejoinders to these questions are that there is no
reason to worry. Most experts insist that neither Japan nor South Korea
would ever acquire nuclear weapons. The reasons, they argue, are simple.
It would not only undermine the nuclear nonproliferation regime that
they have sworn to uphold and strengthen, but it would also risk their
continued security ties with their most important ally, the United
States.

Perhaps; but [when]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [first doubted its American security guarantees
in the 1970s, **it tried**]{.underline} [to get nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.67 [Those doubts]{.underline} **[continue
today]{.underline}** as North Korea builds up its nuclear and nonnuclear
forces against the South.68 On May 29, 2014, South Korea's president
noted that, if North Korea tested another nuclear weapon, it would be
difficult "to prevent a nuclear domino from occurring in this area."
This would be a clear warning to not only North Korea, but also the
United States and China, that, if they fail to prevent Pyongyang from
further perfecting its nuclear force, Japan and South Korea might well
acquire nuclear weapons of their own.69 After Pyongyang conducted its
fourth nuclear test on January 6, 2016, South Korean and Japanese
politicians commented on the legality and desirability of developing
nuclear weapons options.70 They repeated these points when Pyongyang
tested its fifth device later in 2016.71

Yet another optimistic view argues that it may actually be in
Washington's interest to let Japan and South Korea go nuclear. Letting
them arm might actually tighten U.S. relations with these key allies,
while reducing what the United States would otherwise have to spend for
their protection. Implicit to this argument is the hope that neither
Seoul nor Tokyo would feel compelled to acquire many weapons---i.e.,
that like the United Kingdom, they would eagerly integrate their modest
nuclear forces with that of America's larger force, share their target
lists with Washington, and that Washington would do likewise with them
(as Washington already has with London).72

Again, this is plausible. However, it is worth noting that Japan and
South Korea are not the United Kingdom. Early on, the United Kingdom
understood its nuclear weapons efforts would ultimately be subordinate
to and in the service of maintaining its "special relationship" with
Washington (and scaled down its nuclear efforts accordingly). With the
Japanese and South Koreans, though, their nuclear efforts would
unavoidably be seen as a vote of no confidence in Washington's nuclear
security guarantees. As such, these efforts would have to deal with
demands by nationalists eager to build a truly independent nuclear force
of much more ambitious dimensions.73 More important (and more likely),
even if Japanese and South Korean officials wanted to keep their forces
subordinate to those of the United States, they might still be driven to
acquire larger nuclear forces of their own to deal with the likely
military reactions of China, North Korea, and other nuclear states.74

Consider the action-reaction dynamic that Seoul or Tokyo going nuclear
might set into motion with Beijing and Pyongyang. Presumably, in all
cases (**[China]{.underline}** included), each state [would try to
protect its strategic forces against possible attacks by building
more]{.underline} **[passive defenses]{.underline}** (hardening,
mobilizing, tunneling, etc.). They [also]{.underline} would [focus on
building up their]{.underline} **[offensive]{.underline}**
[forces]{.underline} (both nuclear and nonnuclear) so they might
eliminate as much of each other's strategic forces at sea and on land as
soon as any war began (this to limit the damage they would otherwise
suffer). [Finally, they would [increase the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[number]{.underline}** [of nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} [weapons
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}, missile portals, and other strategic aim
points to prevent any of their adversaries from thinking they could
"knock out" their retaliatory forces. [This]{.underline}, roughly, [is
what unfolded during the Cold War rivalry]{.underline} between
Washington and the Soviet Union. As was the case for Russia and the
United States then, maintaining one's relative nuclear position could
easily drive up East Asian nuclear weapons requirements well beyond
scores or even hundreds of weapons.75

Potentially catalyzing this rivalry further are the actions China's
immediate nuclear neighbors might take. As has already been noted,
[the]{.underline} **[Russians]{.underline}** [are unlikely to reduce
their nuclear weapons deployments if the Chinese increase
theirs]{.underline}. As for **[India]{.underline}**, it already has
roughly 100 nuclear weapons and many hundreds of bombs' worth of
separated reactor-grade plutonium it claims it can fashion into nuclear
weapons. It [is]{.underline} [hedging its nuclear bets]{.underline} even
further with plans to build six unsafeguarded plutonium-producing
breeder reactors by 2030 and an enrichment plant that may double its
production of weapons-grade uranium.76 Late in 2011, India announced it
was working with Russia to develop a terminally guided ICBM in response
to Chinese medium-range ballistic missile deployments near India's
borders.77

New Delhi has also pushed the development of a nuclear submarine force,
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), missile defenses,
long-range cruise missiles, and improved strategic command and control
and intelligence systems. India is not yet competing with China
weapon-for-weapon. However, if China were to increase its nuclear
weapons deployments significantly, Indian leaders might argue that they
had no other choice but to increase their own nuclear holdings.

This then brings us back to **[Pakistan]{.underline}**. It has done all
it can to keep up with India militarily. Since Islamabad is already
producing as much plutonium and highly enriched uranium as it can, it
would likely seek further technical assistance from China and financial
help from its close ally, Saudi Arabia. Islamabad may do this to hedge
against India, whether China or India build their nuclear arms up or
not. There is also good reason to believe that **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}** [may]{.underline} want to cooperate on nuclear
weapons-related activities with Pakistan or China to help Saudi Arabia
[hedge against]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}**'s growing nuclear
weapons capabilities. It is unclear if either China or Pakistan would
actually transfer nuclear weapons directly to Saudi Arabia or choose
instead to help it merely develop aspects of a "peaceful" nuclear
program, including reprocessing and enrichment. They might do both.78

In this regard, Saudi Arabia has made it known that it intends to build
up its "peaceful" nuclear energy capabilities and will not forswear its
"right" to enrich uranium or to reprocess plutonium.79 This would
constitute one of the most lucrative, best financed near and mid-term
nuclear power markets in the world. The reactors Saudi Arabia might
build also could serve as the basis for development of a major nuclear
weapons option. As Saudi Arabia's former head of intelligence told NATO
ministers, the kingdom would have to get nuclear weapons if Iran did.80
Further underscoring this point, during a March 2018 visit to
Washington, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated that if Iran
acquires a nuclear weapon, Saudi Arabia would do so as well "as soon as
possible."81

Saudi Arabia is not the only Muslim state to be pursuing a nuclear
future. **[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** [also announced an
ambitious]{.underline} "peaceful" [atomic]{.underline} power
[program]{.underline} shortly after Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts
were revealed in 2002, and expressed an interest in 2008 in enriching
its own uranium.82 Given Turkish qualms about Iran acquiring nuclear
weapons, the possibility of Ankara developing a nuclear weapons option
(as it previously toyed with doing in the late 1970s)83 must be taken
seriously. In addition, **[[Algeria]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[[Egypt]{.underline}]{.mark}** (political rivals)
[[and]{.underline} **[Syria]{.underline}**]{.mark} (a historical ally of
Iran) [all have either attempted to develop nuclear weapons]{.underline}
options or refused to forswear making nuclear fuel, a process that can
bring them within weeks of acquiring a bomb. Algeria now has enough
plutonium and the skills to separate it from spent fuel to make several
bombs' worth.84 Egypt, which has long complained about Israeli nuclear
weapons and previously attempted to get nuclear weapons, has signed a
deal with Russia to construct its first large power reactor.85 Israel,
meanwhile, continues to make nuclear weapons materials at Dimona, and
all of these states have nuclear-capable missile systems (see figure
3-13).86

\[\[FIGURE 3-13 OMITTED\]\]

Very little of this rhymes with the world a halfcentury ago. In the
early 1960s, the only countries with civilian nuclear power reactors
were the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia. There are now 31
states. Most of these are in Eastern and Western Europe, but as figure
3-13 shows, other states in far less stable regions are hoping to bring
their first nuclear power plants online before 2035. This trend,
particularly in the Far and Middle East, has strategic implications.87

As already noted, each of these plants---even the most
proliferation-resistant light water reactor types--- can be regarded as
a "nuclear bomb starter kit." Although the nuclear industry has
consistently promoted the mistaken idea that the plutonium power
reactors produce is unsuitable to make bombs, these reactors can be
operated not only to produce large amounts of reactor-grade plutonium
that can be made into bombs, but also large amounts of weapons-grade and
near-weapons-grade plutonium as well.88 In fact, in their first 12-18
months of normal power production operation, these reactors can produce
roughly 50 bombs' worth of near-weapons-grade plutonium. If refueled
every 10 months, they can produce roughly 30 bombs' worth of
weapons-grade plutonium.89 The plants can and have been used as covers
to acquire weapons related technology, hardware, and training.90
Finally, the massive amounts of low-enriched fresh fuel stored at these
reactors for safety reasons can afford a source of low-enriched uranium
(LEU) to jumpstart a uranium enrichment weapons option.91 That is why
efforts are made to control the export of these plants and why they are
routinely inspected to guard against military diversions.92

As for declared nuclear fuel making plants---uranium hexafluoride and
enrichment facilities, plutonium separation and fuel fabrication plants,
etc.---a deeper problem occurs that relates to the limits of
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards themselves. Even
under ideal circumstances, the agency allows that, with commercial-sized
plants, it can lose track of special nuclear material. The margins of
statistical error associated with the inspection of these plants are
egregiously large. Consider the reprocessing plant Japan wants to
operate at Rokkasho. In this case, the agency can be expected to lose
track of roughly 250 kilograms (i.e., roughly 50 first-generation bombs'
worth) a year. This means that nearly 50 bombs' worth of weapons-usable
plutonium could possibly go missing from Rokkasho without setting off
any international inspection alarms at all.93

[Will the world be able to cope with the further [spread of]{.mark}
such]{.underline} "peaceful" [[nuclear facilities]{.mark}? Given
the]{.underline} additional noted missile, fissile, and weapons [trends,
**what, if anything, can be done to avoid**]{.underline} their military
diversions or worse---more widespread nuclear weapons competitions and,
far worse, [a possible]{.underline} **[accidental or intentional use of
nuclear weapons?]{.underline}**

\[\[CHAPTER 3 ENDNOTES OMITTED\]\]

CHAPTER 4. WHAT MIGHT HELP

[[These trends]{.underline} [**invite disorder**. How]{.underline}
**[much]{.underline}** [depends on]{.underline}
**[how]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[well [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, Russia, China, [and]{.underline}
other **[key states]{.underline}** **[[deal with
them]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Despite Washington's **strained relations**]{.underline} with Moscow,
U.S. President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[still
interested]{.underline}** [in negotiating]{.underline} **[more nuclear
constraints]{.underline}** with Russia.1 The United States has
encouraged all countries to protect civilian and military nuclear
facilities and stores of weapons-usable nuclear materials against theft
or sabotage. The United States has tried to persuade non-weapons states
to forgo civilian reprocessing or enrichment.

[These U.S. nuclear control initiatives, even if successful, **still
leave much to be done**]{.underline}. Several related areas cry out for
greater attention: nuclear and missile developments in China and East
Asia, the global spread of "peaceful" nuclear technology, and the
continued failure to develop a consistent, broad approach to preventing
nuclear proliferation. This suggests three recommendations.

RECOMMENDATION 1

Clarify China's strategic military capabilities and promote
nonproliferation and arms control measures that limit strategic weapons
in Asia. Most current nuclear arms control initiatives (e.g., the
Limited Test Ban Treaty \[LTBT\], the Comprehensive Nuclear-TestBan
Treaty \[CTBT\], the Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty \[FMCT\], limits on
missile defenses, Strategic Arms Limitation Talks \[SALT\], Strategic
Arms Reduction Treaty \[START\], and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty \[INF\]) were originally designed to limit arms competitions
between the United States and Russia. The Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT) was initially designed to reduce the prospects of nuclear
proliferation mostly in Europe. As the world's economic and strategic
center of gravity shifts toward Asia, though, it would make sense to
tailor more of our control efforts toward this region.

Wither Beijing?

This means, first, clarifying China's strategic capabilities. Beijing's
revelations that it has built 3,000 miles of deep tunnels to protect and
hide its dual-capable missiles and related nuclear warhead systems,
suggest the need to reassess estimates of China's nuclear-capable
missile and nuclear weapons holdings and plans. Are Beijing's
revelations disinformation designed to intimidate? Is it hiding more
military assets than we currently assess it has? What is it planning to
acquire and deploy? How much military fissile material---plutonium and
highly enriched uranium (HEU)---does China currently have on hand? How
likely is it that China has or will militarize or expand its fissile
material holdings? How might China militarize its civilian nuclear
infrastructure? How many different types of nuclear weapons does it have
or intend to deploy? How much fissile material does each type require?
How many missile reloads does China currently have; how many is it
planning to acquire? How extensive are Chinese deployments of multiple
warheads for the country's missiles, and how much further might China
expand these deployments? For which missile types and in what numbers?
How many nuclear and advanced conventional warheads is China deploying
on its missiles, bombers, submarines, and artillery? What are its plans
for using these forces? How might these plans relate to China's emerging
space, missile defense, and anti-satellite capabilities? All of these
questions, and more, deserve review within the U.S. Government, with
America's allies, and, to the extent possible, in cooperation with
India, Russia, as well as China itself.

As a part of this review, it also would be helpful to game alternative
war and military crisis scenarios that feature China's possible use of
these forces. These games should be conducted at senior political levels
in American and allied governments. Conducting such games should also
inform U.S. and allied arms control policies and military planning. With
regard to the latter, a key focus would have to be how one might defend,
deter, and limit the damage that Chinese nuclear and nonnuclear missile
systems might otherwise inflict against the United States, its bases in
the Western Pacific, America's friends and allies, and Russia.

This could entail not only the further development and deployment of
active missile defenses, but also of better passive defenses (e.g., base
hardening and improving the capacity to restore operations at bases
after attacks; hardened command, control, and communication systems;
etc.) and possibly new offensive forces---more capable, long-range
conventional strike systems to help neutralize possible offensive
Chinese operations.

Yet another focus for such gaming would be to clarify the likely
consequences of Japanese or South Korean acquisition of nuclear weapons.
These games should be held routinely, bilaterally, and multilaterally
with our allies and friends and, at times, with all of the key states,
including China, represented by informed experts and officials. The aim
of such games would not only be to understand just how risky Japanese
and South Korean nuclear proliferation might be, but to clarify the
risks China and North Korea will run if they continue to build up their
missile and nuclear forces.

Controlling Nuclear Missiles

Such gaming should also encourage a review of Washington's current arms
control agenda. Here several specific ideas, which are particularly
relevant to Asia, deserve attention. First among these is talks with
China, Russia, and other states about limiting groundbased, dual-capable
ballistic and cruise missiles. China possesses more of these systems
than any other state. Counting American, Russian, Indian, Pakistani,
North Korean, South Korean, and Chinese ground-based missiles, Asia is
targeted by more such missiles than any other region.

Unlike air- and sea-based missiles, groundlaunched systems can be
securely communicated with and fired instantly upon command. As such,
they are ideal for use in a first strike. These accurate, dual-capable
missiles also can inflict strategic harm against major bases and naval
operations when carrying conventional warheads.

Former U.S. President Ronald Reagan referred to these weapons as
"nuclear missiles," and looked forward to their eventual elimination.
Toward this end, he concluded the INF Treaty agreement, which eliminated
an entire class of ground-based nuclear-capable missiles, and negotiated
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), which was designed to
block the further proliferation of nuclear-capable missiles (i.e.,
rockets and unmanned air-breathing systems capable of lifting over 500
kilograms for a distance of at least 300 kilometers). With the promotion
of space-based missile defenses, President Reagan hoped to eliminate
enough of such ground-based missiles to eliminate credible nuclear first
strike threats.2

Which states have an incentive to eliminate these missiles? The United
States eliminated all of its intermediate ground-launched missiles under
the INF Treaty. Most of America's shorter-range missiles are either
air-launched or below MTCR range-payload limits. As for U.S.
ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), they are all
based in fixed silos. To avoid being knocked out in any major future
nuclear exchange, these missiles may have to be launched on warning.
Russia, on the other hand, has a large, road-mobile ICBM force. At the
same time, it is worried about growing numbers of long-range, precision
missiles that both the United States and China are developing against
which it cannot easily defend.3

India and Pakistan have ground-launched ballistic missiles, but some of
their most seasoned military experts have called for the elimination of
short-range missiles, arguing that these weapons are only likely to
escalate border disputes.4 As for China, it has much to gain by
deploying more ground-launched missiles, unless, of course, such
deployment causes India, Russia, and the United States to react
militarily. The United States has been developing hypersonic boost glide
systems that could provide it with prompt global strike options. It
could base these systems either in the continental United States or in
forward bases in the Western Pacific.5 It also has hundreds of
silo-based ICBMs that it could convert to deliver advanced nonnuclear
payloads, including hypersonic boost glide systems.6 Provoking an
uncontrolled competition on the development of these weapons between the
United States, China, and Russia would not be in anyone's long-term
interest. Talks about reducing longrange, nuclear-capable ground-based
missile systems and preventing the further spread of advanced missile
technologies (e.g., hypersonic boost glide technology7 ) to other states
should be explored.8

Limiting Forward Nuclear Deployments

Another arms restriction that should be considered is keeping the
world's nuclear-armed states from deploying any additional nuclear
weapons in peacetime on the soil of states that lack such weapons. An
immediate concern is Saudi Arabia, rumored to be interested in buying
nuclear weapons either from China or Pakistan, or in getting either
nation to deploy several of their warheads there. Under the NPT, it is
permissible for nuclear weapons states to deploy their weapons in states
that lack such weapons so long as these weapons stay under the "control"
of the donor nuclear weapons state. This provision in the NPT was
crafted in the 1960s to allow the United States to continue to deploy
tactical nuclear weapons to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
countries and East Asia, and for the Soviet Union to do so in Warsaw
Pact countries.

Although the United States continues to forward base some of its weapons
in Europe, long-range bombers and missile systems have made it possible
to remove all of the forward deployed U.S. tactical nuclear systems from
East Asia. Given that Washington is unlikely to reintroduce them or to
increase existing deployments, it may be possible to broker some
understanding to forbid any further deployments in exchange for Chinese
and Pakistani pledges not to deploy any of their nuclear arms beyond
their soil.

With the turmoil in the Persian Gulf region, brokering such an
understanding would be timely. It also would have the immediate
advantage of engaging Pakistan, a non-NPT member, in some form of
nuclear arms restraint. This is something that should be encouraged more
generally with nuclear weapons-armed non-NPT members. Pakistan recently
announced its willingness to forgo nuclear testing unilaterally.9 Given
Pakistan's rivalry with India, perhaps New Delhi could be persuaded to
consider adopting such limits as well. Beyond this, other limits,
including on nuclear fissile production, might be sought by not only
Pakistan and India, but Israel as well. In this manner, one could begin
to view states that are now outside the NPT as being instead potential
NPT members in noncompliance---i.e., as states, which by taking steps
toward nuclear restraint, might improve their current noncompliant NPT
status. Additional nuclear restraints ought also to be promoted among
the nuclear weapons armed states. Although, there is no clear legally
binding obligation for the nuclear-armed states to disarm, the NPT
encourages all states to make good faith efforts to do so.10

Fissile Limits, Starting with China

If the United States could get other states to reduce their nuclear
weapons capabilities in a verifiable fashion, it should be open to
continuing to do so. Reaching new treaty agreements, though, ought not
to be the only measure of progress. Although it may not be possible to
conclude a fissile material cutoff treaty anytime soon, all of the other
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) should
press China to follow their lead in unilaterally forswearing making
fissile material for weapons. This, in turn, could be helpful in
pressing for moratoriums on "peaceful" nuclear fuel making of
uneconomical nuclear weapons-usable fuels as well.11

In this regard, an informal pause on the commercial production,
stockpiling, and recycling of plutonium would make sense. A good place
to begin would be in East Asia and the Pacific, starting with China, the
United States, Japan, and South Korea.12 Here, it is worth noting that
the 2012 report of the U.S. Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear
Future determined that dry cask storage would make more economic sense
for the United States to pursue in the management of waste and economic
production of nuclear electricity than commercial plutonium recycling in
the near and mid-term.13 Meanwhile, America's efforts to convert weapons
plutonium into commercial mixed oxide fuel (MOX) are likely to be
terminated.14 As for Japan's planned plutonium reprocessing and fast
reactor programs, Tokyo will have trouble implementing them given its
reduced reliance on nuclear power and its termination of its only
demonstration sized breeder at Monju. South Korea wants to recycle
plutonium in a prototype integrated fast reactor, but this program may
well get pushed back considerably. Its planned first fuel loading will
be low-enriched uranium (LEU), not plutonium-based fuel.15

China is working with AREVA to build a commercial reprocessing plant
nearly identical to the Rokkasho plant in Japan. A sticking point,
though, is siting. So far, Beijing has been unable to select a site its
public can accept. According to nuclear analysts, Beijing might build
this large commercial reprocessing plant by 2030, have it separate
plutonium for 10 to 20 years, and stockpile this material to fuel a
fleet of commercial breeder reactors.16 This view, in turn, is driven by
the expectation that uranium yellowcake will be unavailable after 2050
for anything less than US\$130 (current) per pound (i.e., 300 percent
more than the price today).17

This uranium price projection is speculative and rebuttable. What is not
is the potential military utility of China's civilian plutonium program.
As already noted, the commercial-sized reprocessing plant the Chinese
nuclear establishment may decide to build could produce enough plutonium
for roughly 1,500 first-generation bombs annually. Assuming China's
first breeder reactor came online by 2040, its first fueling with
plutonium would come only after China had amassed well over 15,000
weapons' worth of plutonium.

Of course, if any of the three East Asian states begins to reprocess
plutonium commercially, the other two would almost certainly follow, as
much as a security hedge against each other as for any civilian purpose.
At a minimum, the United States, France, and Russia should refrain from
promoting reprocessing and large fast reactors in the region.18 For
similar reasons, China, Japan, and South Korea are each interested in
significantly expanding their capacity to enrich uranium even though
there is a surfeit of uranium enrichment capacity worldwide. South Korea
also is interested in developing naval reactors, which would require
enriched uranium fuel.19 This raises the question of how naval reactor
fuels might be inspected and controlled by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA), not just in South Korea but also in Brazil, Iran,
and Pakistan―states that have also expressed an interest in developing
naval reactors.20 To head this off, it would be helpful to call for a
freeze on the deployment of any additional commercial uranium enrichment
capacity in China, Japan, and South Korea (and North Korea, if
possible).21

As already noted, the United States and Russia maintain surplus nuclear
weapons and nuclear weapons materials stockpiles, and India, Israel,
Pakistan, China, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom hold significant
amounts of nuclear explosive plutonium and uranium. This fissile
material overhang increases security uncertainties as to how many
nuclear weapons these states might have or could fashion relatively
quickly. Given the verification difficulties with a proposed fissile
material cutoff treaty and the improbabilities of such a treaty being
brought into force, it would be useful to consider control
alternatives.22

One idea, backed by several analysts and former officials, is a
voluntary initiative known as the Fissile Material Control Initiative
(FMCI).23 It would call on nuclear weapons-usable material producing
states to set aside whatever fissile materials they have in excess of
their immediate military or civilian requirements for either final
disposition or internationally verified safekeeping. Russia and the
United States have already agreed to dispose of 34 tons of weapons-grade
plutonium, and have blended down 683 tons of weapons-grade uranium for
use in civilian reactors. Much more could be done to dispose of, and end
production of, such weapons-usable nuclear materials, not only in the
United States and Russia, but also in other fissile-producing states,
including those in Asia.24

RECOMMENDATION 2

Encourage nuclear supplier states to condition their further export of
civilian nuclear plants upon the recipients forswearing reprocessing
spent reactor fuel and enriching uranium and press the IAEA to be more
candid about what it can safeguard. Will Iran's pursuit of "peaceful"
nuclear energy serve as a model for Saudi Arabia (which says it wants to
build 16 large power reactors before 2035), Turkey (which says it plans
to build 20), Egypt (4), and Algeria (3)? When asked, none of these
countries' officials has been willing to forgo making nuclear fuel. So
far, only Turkey and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have ratified the
IAEA's tougher nuclear inspection regime under the Additional Protocol.
There also is the outstanding issue of whether the United States will
eventually authorize South Korea to recycle U.S.-origin nuclear
materials.

All of this should be a worry, since, as already noted, the IAEA cannot
find covert enrichment or reprocessing facilities or reactor plants with
much confidence (compare to recent history regarding nuclear plants in
Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria). Once a large reactor operates in a
country, fresh LEU becomes available and raises the possibility that it
could be seized for possible further enrichment to weapons grade in a
covert or declared enrichment plant. Alternatively, the reactor's
plutonium-laden spent fuel could be reprocessed to produce many bombs'
worth of plutonium. Unfortunately, IAEA inspections at declared
commercial-sized uranium hexafluoride and enrichment plants, plutonium
separation facilities, and plutonium fuel production plants could lose
track of several scores of bombs' worth of nuclear explosive material
annually.

The Gold Standard

Given these points and recognizing that the authority to inspect
anywhere at any time without notice is not yet available to the IAEA
(even when it operates under the Additional Protocol), any state's
pledge not to conduct reprocessing or enrichment could not be fully
verified in a timely manner. Still, securing such a legal pledge would
have some value: it would put a violating country on the wrong side of
international law if or when it was found out, and would make such
action sanctionable. This may not be as much as one wants or needs, but
it is far more of a deterrent to nuclear misbehavior than what current
nonproliferation limits afford.

Other than the United States, no nuclear supplier state (i.e., Russia,
France, Japan, China, or South Korea) has yet required any of its
prospective customers to foreswear enriching uranium or reprocessing
spent fuel to extract plutonium, or committing to ratify the Additional
Protocol. It is unclear how far the United States will push states to do
so (i.e., demanding what is called the nonproliferation gold standard
for civil nuclear cooperation agreements).25

There is some support in the U.S. Congress for making it more difficult
to finalize any future U.S. nuclear cooperative agreements with
nonnuclear weapons states like Saudi Arabia unless they agree to the
U.S.-UAE nuclear cooperative conditions.26 These congressional
representatives believe that by taking the lead on imposing such
nonproliferation conditions, the United States would be in a much better
position to persuade other nuclear supplier states to do the same.

With the Japanese and South Koreans, close U.S. nuclear cooperation and
security guarantees could be leveraged to secure these countries'
agreement to such conditions on their nuclear exports. They and the
Chinese want to export reactors based on U.S. designs. It is unclear
whether they can do so legally to states that do not have a nuclear
cooperative agreement with the United States. China, meanwhile, needs
all the help it can get from the United States to complete the
Westinghouse-designed reactors it is building and the Chinese variant on
which it is basing much of its nuclear future. Moreover, France may have
difficulty exporting reactors without significant Asian support.27 With
Russia as well as China, the United States should be more candid about
the safety issues that the construction and operation of their reactors
present and offer to renew or expand nuclear cooperation to help resolve
these concerns in exchange for upgrading the nonproliferation conditions
on these countries' nuclear exports.28 Finally, the United States should
approach URENCO about requiring recipients of uranium exports not to
enrich or reprocess these materials without URENCO's consent.

Timely Detection

It also would be helpful if the IAEA was more honest about what kinds of
nuclear activities and material holdings it can actually safeguard
effectively---i.e., which ones it can inspect so as to detect military
diversions in a timely fashion and which ones it cannot. As it is, the
IAEA is unwilling to make public its assessments of the agency's ability
to meet its own timeliness detection goals (which are hardly strict).
Meanwhile, no state, including the United States, has yet done such an
assessment of the effectiveness of the agency's safeguards.29

In the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, when only a handful of states
lacking nuclear weapons were interested in enriching uranium or
separating plutonium from spent reactor fuel, this lax approach may have
been tolerable. Today, however, Japan, South Korea, Argentina, Brazil,
South Africa, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Vietnam, and Jordan are
all either making enriched uranium, reprocessing spent reactor fuels, or
reserving their "right" to do so. All of these states are members of the
NPT and have pledged not to acquire nuclear weapons. Should we assume
that none of them would ever cheat? What confidence should we have that
the IAEA would be able to detect possible diversions early enough for
the other NPT members to intervene to prevent them from producing
nuclear weapons?

Currently, the IAEA's own nuclear safeguard guidelines set routine
inspection intervals to approximate the time the agency estimates is
needed to convert certain special nuclear materials into bomb cores. The
IAEA's ability to verify production figures at large uranium
hexafluoride (reprocessing, uranium enrichment, and plutonium and mixed
oxide fuel fabrication) plants though, is limited. Not only does the
agency have difficulty detecting abrupt diversions in a timely fashion
(i.e., it may only be able to learn of diversions after they have
occurred), but the margins of error associated with the IAEA's ability
to detect small, incremental diversions are equivalent to many bombs'
worth every year. In either case, once a state has enough fissile
material to make a bomb, it could break out well before the IAEA or
other states could intervene to prevent nuclear weapons from being
built.

These facts are troubling. What makes them doubly so is that the IAEA
has yet to share these specifics publicly in any detail. Worse, it
continues to claim that it can safeguard these materials and plants
(i.e., provide "timely detection" of possible military nuclear
diversions), when, in fact, in many cases, it cannot.

It is essential that inspectors and diplomats distinguish between what
inspectors can merely monitor (i.e., inspect to provide confidence that
major diversions have not taken place sometime in the past) from what
they can actually safeguard (i.e., inspect to assure detection of
military diversions early enough so outside parties have sufficient time
to block actual bomb making). If this distinction were made clear,
governments could fully appreciate and, perhaps restrict, nuclear
activities and holdings that are not able to be safeguarded and hence
are dangerous.30 This, in turn, would make promoting tougher
nonproliferation standards, like the Gold Standard, much easier.

RECOMMENDATION 3

Anticipate and ward off nuclear proliferation developments before
recognized redlines have been clearly violated. One of the regrettable
legacies of the Cold War is the habit U.S. and allied government
officials have acquired of waiting for irrefutable evidence of
undesirable, foreign nuclear weapons developments before taking action.
This must change.

After the Soviet Union first acquired nuclear weapons in 1949, the
West's aim in competing against it was not so much to prevent Russia
from acquiring more strategic weapons as it was to prevent it from
gaining strategic superiority. For this purpose, it was sufficient that
Western military forces remained more modern and sufficiently numerous
to deter Soviet offensive capabilities---i.e., that Russia's strategic
technology stayed roughly one or more generations behind ours so that
its strategic deployments could never change the relative balance of
power. If Russia deployed a new strategic nuclear rocket, Washington
would focus on what the Soviets had built and build a bigger or better
U.S. version, or develop some new passive or active defenses, or build
counter offensive forces that could neutralize the new Soviet weapon
system.

After the United States and Russia ratified a number of strategic arms
limitation agreements, any Russian strategic nuclear deployment that
exceeded agreed limits became a matter for diplomatic adjudication. In
either case, U.S. or allied action turned on detecting and verifying the
violation of agreed or implicit redlines. Fortunately, in this
competition, the Soviets ultimately failed to keep up with the United
States and its allies. Moscow's failed attempts to do so only helped
bankrupt it financially and politically.31

Today, aggressive Russian behavior on the world stage and a similar
neurotic worldview poses serious risks to the geopolitical stability of
the United States and Europe. As a former KGB intelligence officer in
East Germany who saw firsthand the decline of Soviet influence within
the Warsaw Pact, since coming to power in late 1999 Russian President
Vladimir Putin has been a strong proponent of restoring Russian power
and prestige in the world and diminishing the political, economic, and
geostrategic foundations of the transatlantic partnership. Over the past
few years, however, [the Russian president has shown himself to be
increasingly]{.underline} like some of [his]{.underline}
**[predecessors]{.underline}** [as the US and Europe have been
preoccupied with costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of
international terrorist organizations]{.underline} such as al-Qaeda and

Putin's "Strong Man" Politics

From its origins as the Grand Duchy of Moscow that grew to become the
Russian Empire, evolved into the Soviet Union, and finally into today's
modern authoritarian state, Russia has depended on strong, centralized
government control to preside over its vast geographic territory and its
multi-ethnic population. Over the centuries, Russian nationalism and
cold-blooded rule from Moscow or St. Petersburg became ingrained in the
leadership of Russian political calculation and combined with what
Kennan called the "traditional and instinctive Russian sense of
insecurity ... \[because\] Russian rulers have invariably sensed that
their rule was relatively archaic in form, fragile and artificial in its
psychological foundation, unable to stand comparison or contact with
political systems of western countries."

Indeed, Putin has followed in varying degrees the blueprints of previous
strong men who have led Russia such as Peter the Great, Emperor Nicholas
I, and of course, Stalin. Whenever opportunities presented themselves,
Moscow advanced its geopolitical position either directly through
military aggression or, as Kennan wrote, Russian diplomacy would focus
on "inhibiting or diluting the power of others". As such, Putin's two
overarching geostrategic goals since coming to power have been the
restoration of Russia's previous status as a global superpower, to
include rebuilding the Russian armed forces and regaining or controlling
some of the territories in Russia's "near abroad" in Eastern Europe and
the Black Sea region lost after the end of the Cold War, and distancing
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries from Eastern
Europe and from each other.

Russian history has shown that callous and ruthless control of Russia's
domestic politics is a prerequisite for any successful Russian foreign
and national security policy. From 2000 until 2008, Putin radically
amended the 1993 Russian constitution to make an already strong
presidency even stronger. Overall, Putin's time in office so far has
been marked by the growth of authoritarian rule coupled with a corrupt
bureaucracy that favors a few oligarchs who control the country's
critical infrastructure and key industries and who primarily answer only
to the Russian president. Initially limited to two four-year terms as
president, Putin then served as prime minister from 2008 until 2012,
only to return as president to begin a six-year term in March 2012
through what were widely perceived to be unfair elections.

In addition, Putin has been responsible for significantly curbing
democratic freedoms and for the repression of domestic political
dissent. Under Putin's leadership, Russia has also implemented several
restrictive laws against minority groups, harassed, intimidated, and
imprisoned political activists, and cracked down on critics in the
Russian media who contradict or oppose the government's line. The
international watchdog group Freedom House rates Russia very poorly in
terms of government openness and political liberty, noting especially
that "Decisions are adopted behind closed doors by a small group of
individuals --- led by Putin --- whose identities are not often clear,
and announced to the population after the fact. Corruption in the
government and business world is pervasive, and a growing lack of
accountability enables bureaucrats to act with impunity." Putin will be
up for re-election in 2018 for another six-year term while his United
Russia party has strongly benefited from recent changes to national,
regional, and local election laws to ensure continuity of Putin's
political control of Russia for some time to come.

Russia's Military Buildup under Putin

One of the primary ways in which Russia is trying to elevate its
geopolitical power is with respect to the Russian armed forces, where
Putin has prioritized the country's largest military buildup since the
Cold War. According to SIPRI's Military Expenditure Database, Russia's
total military spending in current US dollars grew from approximately
\$11.7 billion in 2001 and peaked at \$88.4 billion in 2014,
representing over a seven-fold increase in military spending. In
addition, many news outlets have claimed that this does not include a
significant number of unreported programs, making the growth of Russia's
military spending higher still. Some organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund have even estimated that the unreported
share of Russia's military budget in 2016 may be nearly 25% more than
what the Russian government has officially claimed.

In 2010, Russia embarked on a 10-year program to increase the size of
its military as well as modernize, update, or replace approximately 70%
of its aging and obsolete military equipment by 2020. The number of
Russians serving active duty in its military has also significantly
grown to an estimated 850,000 in 2014 at a time when the number of
troops in almost every Western country has been dropping (Photo 2).

At the same time, the Russian government's rearmament program is seeing
a technologically much improved force taking shape, which according to
IHS Jane's includes plans calling for more than 600 fixed-wing aircraft,
more than 1,000 helicopters, over 4,600 heavily armored tracked vehicles
and 17,000 lighter military vehicles, 50 surface ships, 28 ballistic
missile and attack submarines, as well as improvements to various
short-, medium-, and long-range missiles and mobile missile systems.
Russia is currently positioning its upgraded military force in various
key geostrategic locations around the country and its near abroad to
potentially challenge NATO forces in Eastern Europe, to consolidate its
existing military gains in Ukraine, and to project Russian power in the
Black Sea region and beyond in the Middle East.

Nowhere is Russia's growing military capability on full display to NATO
and the rest of the world than in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad,
located on the Baltic Sea and nestled between Poland and Lithuania.
Kaliningrad is the home of Russia's Baltic Fleet (Photo 3), which
according to publicly available data comprises approximately 50
different vessels, including diesel-powered submarines, one
Sovremenny-class destroyer, eight Steregushchyand Nanuchka-class missile
corvettes, two Neustrashimy-class guided missile frigates, six
Paschim-class anti-submarine warfare vessels, and a few dozen smaller
vessels and landing ships, together with one brigade of naval infantry
and two regiments of coastal defense artillery, along with a garrison
with an estimated 200,000 military personnel --- despite official
Russian numbers claiming only 100,000. Other significant upgrades to
Kaliningrad's military infrastructure have occurred in the past couple
of years, including the reconstruction and enlargement of the airfield
at Chkalovsk to accommodate large military aircraft, as well as the
refurbishment of an abandoned Soviet-era airfield for hydroplanes on the
Baltic Spit.

In early October 2016, significant East-West tensions were raised when
Moscow deployed Iskander-M mobile systems to Kaliningrad (Photo 4).
First introduced to the Russian military in 2013, the Iskander-M is able
to target enemy missile systems, rocket launchers, long-range artillery,
and command posts, as well as aircraft and helicopters at a distance of
up to 320 miles --- threatening much of eastern Poland and all of
Lithuania. Tensions were further raised later in the month when Russia
sent to the Baltic Sea two Buyan-M class corvettes armed with
nuclear-capable Kalibr cruise missiles which have a range of 930 miles.
According to Russian news sources, there are also plans for Russia's
Baltic Fleet to receive three additional such warships armed with Kalibr
missiles by the end of 2020 along with enhanced coastal defenses
including Bastion and Bal land-based antiship missile systems. Russia's
current and planned military buildup of Kaliningrad is protected by its
existing long-range radar and its S-400 Triumf air defense system which
has a 250-mile range and provides the surrounding region with a fairly
sophisticated anti-access/area denial capability for the Russian
military.

Hybrid Warfare & Power Projection

As highlighted in a previous issue of this magazine (July/August 2014),
a resurgent Russia under Putin has also seen Russian aggression
successfully used to secure Russia's "near abroad" --- most notably
against Ukraine. Beginning in March 2014, Russia annexed the Crimean
peninsula and its key naval base at Sevastopol. Russia then divided the
eastern, ethnically Russian, and highly industrialized areas of its
neighbor from the western, ethnically Ukrainian, and mostly agricultural
areas. Moscow not only accomplished this by arming and supplying local
separatists, but also by utilizing a provocative propaganda campaign to
create political unrest with hacked information that included the
broadcast of an intercepted February 2014 telephone call between US
Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland and US Ambassador to
Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt describing US brokering of a political deal among
Ukrainian government officials who were then negotiating the formation
of a new Western-leaning government. The disclosure of this conversation
seemed to prove American involvement in the local politics of a country
bordering Russia and that the US was working directly against Russian
interests.

Other Russian actions in Ukraine included spreading "fake news" stories,
interrupting energy flows, and even sending in Spetsnaz special forces
units, the masked and unmarked camouflage-wearing "Little Green Men",
whose mission was to take control of key strategic locations in the
country such as military bases, airports, and government buildings in
eastern Ukraine (Photo 5). Out of the success of Russia's barely
disguised aggression against its neighbor, experts have come up with the
term "hybrid warfare" which has come to describe these "gray areas" of
Russian military and paramilitary activities to support favorable
political outcomes. Indeed, recent Russian activities with respect to
Ukraine harken back to the early Cold War period when Stalin's
government was similarly able to pressure, undermine, and ultimately
control most of Eastern Europe.

Beyond its immediate border regions, Russia has also actively supported
the regime of Bashar al-Assad since the beginning of the Syrian civil
war in 2011. As longtime allies dating to the early Cold War period,
Russia initially resisted Western calls in the United Nations Security
Council for Assad to step down from power or to implement UN sanctions
against Syria. As the crisis intensified, Russia provided Syrian
government forces with military aid to suppress the rebel opposition,
specifically the US-supported Free Syrian Army (FSA) trying to overthrow
the government in Damascus. Since September 2015, however, Russia has
engaged in direct military operations to not only secure Assad's regime
and to defeat the FSA and other rebel forces, but also to overthrow the
self-declared Islamic State straddling northwestern Syria and northern
Iraq.

Russian forces have been primarily operating out of the airbase near
Latakia and the port of Tartus, as well as from an aircraft carrier
battlegroup in the Eastern Mediterranean, conducting significant and
sustained Russian airstrikes on key rebel towns and villages (up to 60
per day) for the better part of two years. It should be highlighted,
however, that the Russian military involvement in Syria has not been
completely void of international incident. In November 2015, Turkey's
air force shot down a Russian Sukhoi Su-24 strike aircraft for allegedly
violating Turkish airspace, temporarily resulting in increased regional
tensions. Moreover, Russia has come under strong political condemnation
from the international community for airstrikes that are believed to
have deliberately struck civilian targets such as hospitals, schools,
and homes, especially in and around the destroyed city of Aleppo --- the
epicenter of the Syrian crisis. From a military perspective, however,
the projection of Russian military power in support of the regime in
Damascus is widely seen to have successfully turned the tide of the
Syrian civil war in Assad's favor and helped Syrian government forces
recapture large areas of lost territory. It is the first time since the
Cold War that Russia has engaged in sustained military operations beyond
its immediate borders, and is another sign of Russia's intent to
overturn the post1991 geopolitical order.

Hybrid Politics & Kompromat

The famous dictum by the military theorist Carl von Clausewitz that "war
is a mere continuation of politics by other means" certainly holds true
today. In today's technologically advanced global environment, however,
Putin also appears to be turning this famous line on its head --- that
influencing politics may also be a mere continuation of war by other
means. In this era dominated by mass communication through smartphones
and social media, along with the relative ease and low cost of
cyberwarfare, democratic political processes --- particularly those of
open, Western societies whose governments do not restrict their
citizens' access to the Internet --- are vulnerable to Russian influence
campaigns. Indeed, as much as Russia's hybrid warfare can be seen as a
success in destabilizing Ukraine and annexing Crimea, this era may also
be one characterized by hybrid politics, whereby democratic institutions
or processes can be manipulated or undermined through the release of
intelligence, disinformation, or compromising information (known in
Russian as kompromat) that has been hacked or otherwise acquired to
tarnish the reputation, or question the legitimacy, of an intended
political target, and thus used to achieve a political outcome favorable
to the Kremlin. The main idea behind kompromat is to create plausible
truths about intended political victims, while also allowing Russian
leadership plausible denial regarding the origin of the leaked
information.

Certainly, Putin's background, training, and experiences in
intelligence, deception, and misinformation for the KGB and its
successor, the FSB, are important puzzle pieces in the development of
Russian hybrid politics. First, as a young major in the Soviet secret
police who spent the late 1980s working closely with the East German
Stasi in Dresden and recruiting people trained in "wireless
communications" to steal Western technology and NATO secrets, and then
in the late 1990s as FSB director, Putin reportedly became not only
expert in blatant disregard for the truth about Russian military
activities and casualty rates during the war in Chechnya, but also more
than capable of inventing and distributing self-serving lies and
inaccurate information to sow confusion among political opponents and
ultimately to control them.

[A]{.underline}nother [reason for the growth of Russian]{.underline}
**[hybrid politics]{.underline}** [is the]{.underline} current
[**environment in which Western governments operate**. With vast amounts
of **government documents**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[data]{.underline}** [now being stored]{.underline}
[**electronically**, the ease with which this information can be
transferred almost instantaneously is **greater than
ever**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the increased use]{.underline} over the
past two decades [of]{.underline} private sector firms that support key
national security organizations such as [the]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efense, [the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[A]{.underline}**gency, [the]{.underline}
**[C]{.underline}**entral **[I]{.underline}**ntelligence
**[A]{.underline}**gency, and others presents a security challenge which
in some respects is unique to the US. Outside contractors --- private US
citizens who work alongside government employees with many of the same
clearances and therefore access to the same classified government
information --- [today]{.underline} provide countless additional
potential **[exit points]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} government
[information to be]{.underline} **[leaked]{.underline}**.

[Indeed, Russia appears to be connected to a massive]{.underline}
**[info]{.underline}**rmation-**[gathering]{.underline}**
**[effort]{.underline}** on potential political targets [focused on the
US and Europe. Most famously]{.underline}, in June 2013 the outside
contractor Edward **[Snowden]{.underline}** [who was working for the NSA
released **classified documents**]{.underline} to various journalists
and newspapers around the world [revealing information on US government
surveillance programs against other countries, including US allies.
Snowden]{.underline} fled the US and eventually [sought]{.underline}
political [asylum in]{.underline} the waiting arms of
**[Moscow]{.underline}** (Photo 6). The US, UK, and French intelligence
services also all believe [there is a]{.underline} **[direct
connection]{.underline}** [between the Russian government
and]{.underline} the international open government organization
Wiki**[leaks]{.underline}**, whose founder Julian Assange has been
responsible over the past several years for releasing compromising
documents about both the US government and the Democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton.

Finally, Russian hybrid politics is to some extent dependent upon
willing political targets. The Kremlin's attempt to influence the 2016
US presidential election as alleged by the US intelligence community
involved the acquisition and release of compromising information on
Clinton, the opponent of Russia's preferred candidate Donald Trump. For
his part, both on the campaign trail and following his election, Trump
expressed an unusually strong affinity for Putin and Russia, at various
times taking to Twitter to praise the Russian leader as "very smart", to
call upon Russia to release damaging information on Clinton (which some
claimed was treasonous), and even to deflect public attention on
himself, claiming that "Clinton's close ties to Putin deserve scrutiny."

As was the case, Trump won the election in one of the largest upsets in
US political history. Although it is impossible to measure the effect of
Russia's influence on the 2016 US election, Trump cannot condemn Russia
too strongly without casting doubt on the legitimacy of his own
electoral success. Nevertheless, he has been reluctant to assign any
blame to Russia and has dismissed the US intelligence community's
post-election analysis despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary ---
going so far as to fault US intelligence for leaking an unverified
political report alleging financial improprieties and embarrassing
salacious personal behavior about himself (Photo 7). "If Putin likes
Donald Trump," he told a crowd of journalists at a January 2017 press
conference, "guess what, folks, that's called an asset not a liability."

Putin's Annus Mirabilis

Today it is worth remembering that Kennan's Long Telegram concluded with
a stark warning: "We must have the courage and self-confidence to cling
to our own methods and conceptions of human society. After all, the
greatest danger that can befall us in coping with this problem of
\[Russia\], is that we shall allow ourselves to become like those with
whom we are coping."

[The year 2016 may be]{.underline} considered [an]{.underline} **[annus
mirabilis]{.underline}** [for Putin's long-held plan to restore Russia
--- challenging not only the]{.underline} **[global order]{.underline}**
created by the end of the Cold War, [but]{.underline} perhaps [also
overturning the]{.underline} **[very foundations]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} the **[postwar international security]{.underline}**
structure. Under President Barak Obama, the US largely only took
symbolic gestures to confront the buildup of Russia's military
capabilities and its aggression in Ukraine, sending token forces to the
region and imposing sanctions, albeit in coordination with its European
allies and with some economically crippling effects. From the Russian
point of view, however, the election of Trump has already had its
intended effect --- [to create]{.underline} political
**[confusion]{.underline}** [and generate]{.underline}
**[divisions]{.underline}** within the US and **[among]{.underline}**
the members of [**the Western Alliance**, to **divert**]{.underline}
Washington's **[attention]{.underline}** away from Russia's growing
military and intelligence capabilities, [and to]{.underline} **[sow
doubt]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the US political system and its
**[democratic institutions]{.underline}**.

The year 2017 looks even brighter for Russia and Putin. It appears he
may be gaining a useful political ally in Trump, who indicated he might
even be willing to lift the sanctions on Russia in exchange for Russian
help in the fight against terrorism. In an unmistakable reference to
Russia in his inaugural address, Trump noted that the US would
"reinforce old alliances and form new ones --- and unite the civilized
world against radical Islamic terrorism." Moreover, Trump's enthusiasm
for NATO is low. Just prior to assuming office, he labeled the
organization "obsolete" and is likely to approach European capitals
early in his term with a demand they pay more towards their own
security. As the United Kingdom appears set to trigger negotiations to
exit the European Union, while both France and Germany are facing
national elections with rightwing parties rising in popularity, and as
the new era in Washington begins with strong mutual distrust between
Trump and his own intelligence community, [Russia is in a]{.underline}
**[strong position]{.underline}** [to shape the geopolitical environment
to more closely align with its core national interests and continue its
return to]{.underline} **[great power status and growing global
relevance]{.underline}**.

#### The liberal order prevents extinction from nuclear war, warming, and rogue tech development

Yuval Noah **Harari 18**, Professor of History at Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, 9/26/18, "We need a post-liberal order now," The Economist,
<https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/26/we-need-a-post-liberal-order-now>

For several generations, [the world has been governed by]{.underline}
what today we call "[the global liberal order]{.underline}". Behind
these lofty words is [the idea that all humans share some core
experiences, values and interests, and that no human group is inherently
superior]{.underline} to all others. [Cooperation is therefore more
sensible than conflict]{.underline}. All humans should work together to
protect their common values and advance their common interests. And the
best way to foster such cooperation is to ease the movement of ideas,
goods, money and people across the globe.

Though [the global liberal order]{.underline} has many faults and
problems, it [has proved superior to all alternatives]{.underline}. The
liberal world of the early 21st century is more prosperous, healthy and
peaceful than ever before. For the first time in human history,
starvation kills fewer people than obesity; plagues kill fewer people
than old age; and violence kills fewer people than accidents. When I was
six months old I didn't die in an epidemic, thanks to medicines
discovered by foreign scientists in distant lands. When I was three I
didn't starve to death, thanks to wheat grown by foreign farmers
thousands of kilometers away. And when I was eleven I wasn't obliterated
in a nuclear war, thanks to agreements signed by foreign leaders on the
other side of the planet. If you think we should go back to some
pre-liberal golden age, please name the year in which humankind was in
better shape than in the early 21st century. Was it 1918? 1718? 1218?

[Nevertheless, people all over the world are **now losing faith in the
liberal order**. Nationalist]{.underline} and religious
[views]{.underline} that privilege one human group over all others [are
back in vogue]{.underline}. Governments are increasingly restricting the
flow of ideas, goods, money and people. Walls are popping up everywhere,
both on the ground and in cyberspace. Immigration is out, tariffs are
in.

[If the **liberal order is collapsing**, what new kind of global order
might replace it?]{.underline} So far, [those who challenge the liberal
order]{.underline} do so mainly on a national level. They have many
ideas about how to advance the interests of their particular country,
but they [don't have a viable vision for how the world as a whole should
function]{.underline}. For example, Russian nationalism can be a
reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia, but Russian
nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of course,
nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to conquer
and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist movements
indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's nationalists,
whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain from
advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, [some
nationalists]{.underline} such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They [argue]{.underline} that all
nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

[The world will]{.underline} then [be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, [the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. **All
attempts** to divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}
so far **[resulted in war and genocide]{.underline}**. When the heirs of
Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the multi-ethnic
Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line dividing
Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny
the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[humankind]{.underline} today [faces]{.underline} three [common problems
that make a mockery of all national borders]{.underline}, and [that can
**only be solved through global cooperation**. These are **nuclear war,
climate change and technological disruption**. You cannot build a wall
against nuclear winter or against global warming, and no nation can
regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or bioengineering
single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only the European
Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[An **AI arms race** or a **biotechnological arms race**]{.underline}
almost [**guarantees the worst outcome**. Whoever wins]{.underline} the
arms race, **[the loser will likely be humanity itself]{.underline}**.
For in an arms race, [all regulations will collapse]{.underline}.
Consider, for example, conducting genetic-engineering experiments on
human babies. Every country will say: "We don't want to conduct such
experiments---we are the good guys. But how do we know our rivals are
not doing it? We cannot afford to remain behind. So we must do it before
them."

Similarly, [consider developing autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline},
that can decide for themselves whether to shoot and kill people. Again,
[every country will say: "This]{.underline} is a very dangerous
technology, and it [should be regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we
don't trust our rivals to regulate it, so we must develop it
first]{.underline}".

[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline} such [destructive arms
races is **greater trust between countries**]{.underline}. [This is
**not an impossible mission**]{.underline}. If today the Germans promise
the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing killer robots in a secret
laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the French are likely to believe
the Germans, despite the terrible history of these two countries. [We
need to build such trust globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point
when Americans and Chinese can trust one another like the French and
Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[to survive]{.underline}** and flourish [in the 21st century,
humankind needs **effective global cooperation**]{.underline}, and so
far [the **only viable blueprint** for such cooperation is offered by
**liberalism**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world are
undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and the
world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel the
impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually **[the whole of humankind will feel the
squeeze]{.underline}**.

2\. Military Cooperation

Another [significant category of [secret commitments **creates** and
**regulates** **defense relations**]{.mark} between **states**,
including]{.underline} by [[structuring]{.mark} **defensive
[partnerships]{.mark}**, military **[coop]{.mark}eration**,
**[training]{.mark}**, and **basing**]{.underline}. The United States
has concluded many of these commitments, as have other states. As one
scholar put it:

As we came to learn only in the 1970s, the United States and presumably
the Soviet Union made agreements throughout the Cold War with foreign
friends, backed by the promise to use force if necessary.
[Some]{.underline} of these arrangements were [concluded by
**Exec**utive **Agreement**, open or secret; others were simply **off
the record**.]{.underline} Some agreements allowed for American bases on
the ally\'s territory, some even for positioning nuclear weapons there.
143

As discussed further in section B, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its partners may employ
**secrecy**]{.underline} in these contexts [to **[increase]{.mark}** the
**[certainty]{.mark}** each state has [about]{.mark} the other\'s
[support during]{.mark} a **future [attack]{.mark}** [or threat
of]{.mark} **armed [conflict]{.mark}**, and to **[diminish]{.mark}** the
[perception of]{.mark} an **[infringement]{.mark}** on
**sovereignty**]{.underline} that might arise when foreign troops are
present on the host\'s soil.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[has [concluded]{.mark} a [number of **classified**]{.mark} \"status of
forces agreements\" (\"**[SOFAs]{.mark}**\") with other
states.]{.underline} 144 The [U.S.-Spanish SOFA]{.underline}, for
example, apparently contains a secret annex limiting how the United
States may use its Spanish bases. 145 Likewise, a [secret U.S.-UAE
basing agreement]{.underline} limits U.S. activities from the base to
[defending the UAE from an attack]{.underline}, though that limit may be
softening. 146 [Other secret defense agreements authorize military
operations by one or both of the parties]{.underline}. For example, the
U-2 aircraft piloted by Gary Powers in 1960 lifted off from Peshawar,
Pakistan, and was scheduled to land in Bodo, Norway (before the U.S.S.R.
shot it down). 147 This indicates the presence of [advance, secret
arrangements between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Pakistan, as well as the United States and Norway]{.underline}. In a
more recent example, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Afghanistan]{.underline} concluded a classified arrangement in 2014
giving the United States permission to engage in direct combat against
the Taliban, the Haqqani networks, and al Qaeda in Afghanistan. 148

Foreign examples exist as well. In 1954, France and Cambodia concluded
an agreement by which 720 French military instructors would train
Cambodian armed forces. 149 In the early 1980s, Grenadian Prime Minister
Maurice Bishop entered into five secret agreements with the Soviet
Union, Cuba, and North Korea, pursuant to which those states would make
large shipments of military equipment to Grenada, help train soldiers,
and base military advisers on Grenada. 150 In one of the more troubling
secret defense cooperation agreements that has come to light in the
post-Charter era, Israel concluded a secret agreement with Britain and
France in 1956. In the socalled Protocol of Sèvres, the three states
planned to invade Egypt in response to President Nasser\'s decision to
nationalize the Suez Canal. 151 In reliance on the Protocol, Israel
attacked Egypt and occupied Sinai and the Gaza Strip, and France and the
United Kingdom invaded Egypt to secure the Canal. 152 Other states
undoubtedly have concluded secret defense pacts that have not come to
light.

2\. Potency of Political Arrangements

One [obvious difference between **secret exec**utive **agreements** and
**secret political arrangements** is]{.underline} that the former carry
with them [**binding** international **legal obligations**]{.underline}
and the latter do not. For that reason, one might argue that this
article should exclude the latter from consideration because there is
little reason to expect that political arrangements reflect anything but
time-limited expectations between states about how their arrangement
partners will behave and do little to govern the behavior of states that
have crafted the arrangement. However, more so than in the non-secret
context, [the [**distinction** between legally binding]{.mark}
[commitments and political arrangements is
**narrow**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

On the one hand, secret international agreements are harder for a state
to enforce than public international agreements. A secret international
agreement will rarely contain a dispute resolution mechanism that
involves third party adjudicators, which is one means by which states
give their legal commitments teeth. 52 Likewise, states may choose to
comply with public international agreements to preserve their reputation
(both with its treaty partner and with other states in the international
community) as law-compliant, even if they would have preferred not to
comply in a particular instance. 53 When the international agreement at
issue is secret, the reputational costs of violating that agreement are
reduced, because only the state or states that are parties to the
agreement will be aware of the violation. If we assume that states
comply more consistently with public agreements than public
arrangements, the impact of choosing between secret agreements and
arrangements may be somewhat smaller than the impact of choosing between
public agreements and arrangements.

On the other hand, [there are several reasons to think that
[states]{.mark} tend to [**comply** with]{.mark} their [secret]{.mark}
political [commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that in many cases
those [**commitments [fairly predict]{.mark}** the [behavior]{.mark} of
both states]{.underline}. In some cases, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates has [employed political arrangements to
[establish]{.mark} relatively [**intricate** **relationships**]{.mark}
with foreign states]{.underline}, [and has invested significantly
in]{.underline} foreign bases and foreign intelligence centers in
[reliance on those **secret arrangements**]{.underline}. 54 [Congress
itself has **expressed concern** about]{.underline} the Executive\'s

[political commitments . . .which were not and could **not** be
**legally binding** at all, but]{.underline} which
[**[effectively]{.mark} [pledge]{.mark}** the [faith and \'credit\'
of]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates nonetheless . . . . \[T\]hough
[Presidents as well as foreign governments know the difference between
political commitments and legal obligation]{.underline}s, and are well
aware of the braking powers of Congress, they know, too, that in the
end, [[Senates]{.mark} and Congresses, [**theoretically free** to
disown]{.mark} such [commitments, **cannot do so
lightly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 55

[If the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [took its
secret political commitments lightly, Congress would have **no reason to
worry**]{.underline}.

Further, whether the goal is to conclude an agreement or arrangement,
[negotiating a document that ultimately will remain [secret **increases
transaction costs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, because it
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [[complicated
**logistics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many negotiations, even for
agreements that eventually will become public, take place out of public
view. But [negotiating secret commitments can only occur in a limited
number of places]{.underline} (such as secure facilities), and among a
limited set of actors (such as those who have certain security
clearances). Therefore, [concluding a secret arrangement may [signal a
**high level** of **commitment** to the **underlying
relationship**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 56 (On the other hand, the
Executive usually does not share secret arrangements with Congress,
which might reduce the level of care and detail put into the
arrangements and thus lower the costs of concluding them.) In view of
the quantity and range of secret arrangements in U.S. practice and their
apparent ability to affect state behavior, this article includes secret
political arrangements in its analysis of secret commitments in today\'s
international ecosystem.

1\. Secret Political Arrangements in U.S. Law

Section A identified a group of agreements that meet the definition of
\"treaty\" found in the VCLT. But there are almost certainly many more
secret arrangements that states do not intend to be governed by
international law. 35 In common parlance, these are [political
arrangements that happen to be **[secret]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some of
these arrangements, which [set out [**rules** or **modes of operation**
to be followed in]{.mark}]{.underline} one or more [interactions
**between** or **among states**]{.underline}, are surprisingly detailed.
A [paradigmatic example would be a **secret** memorandum of
understanding (**[MOU]{.mark}**) [between]{.mark} the **U.S. [Defense
Department]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a **[foreign military]{.mark}** agency
to guide]{.underline} specific types of **[intelligence
interactions]{.underline}**. 36 Other examples include arrangements
between the CIA and its foreign counterparts and oral or tacit
arrangements between the United States and foreign states, the legal
status of which may be ambiguous. Pakistan\'s reported consent to the
U.S. use of armed drones to target individual members of al Qaeda in the
Federally Administered Tribal Areas may reflect such a secret tacit
arrangement. 37 Some of these secret arrangements explicitly state that
the parties do not intend them to create legally binding obligations. 38

Compared to secret agreements (at least those to which the United States
is a party), [secret arrangements often are [**seen** and **approved**
by **fewer people**]{.mark} because the **[Exec]{.mark}utive** [has
**no** ]{.mark}**statutory [obligation]{.mark}** [to transmit them to
Congress]{.mark}.]{.underline} 39 [The Case Act establishes a mechanism
by which the]{.underline} Department of State (**[DOS]{.underline}**)
[should be informed]{.underline} of these arrangements, so that the DOS
[can determine whether the arrangement is or is not an international
agreement.]{.underline} 40 However, [it is not clear that each agency
**actually shares** every one of its arrangements with the
DOS.]{.underline} Some arrangements may be highly classified, which
might make the initiating agency reluctant to share the arrangement\'s
contents. Alternatively, [[agencies]{.mark} may have [worked out a
**modus vivendi**]{.mark} with the DOS, whereby the [DOS]{.mark}
determines that certain **categories** of arrangements do not represent
international agreements and thus **[effectively blesses]{.mark}**
another agency\'s [conclusion]{.mark} of such arrangements
**[without]{.mark} DOS [involvement]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The fact that only a limited number of people and a limited category of
people are aware of these arrangements means several things. First, the
[arrangements]{.underline} constitute what Professor David Pozen has
[referred to as \"**[deep secrets]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} 41 That is,
these [arrangements [are]{.mark} often \"**[unknown
unknowns]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline} where [the [**public** is]{.mark}
generally **[unaware]{.mark}** that the arrangements even
exist]{.underline}. 42 (In contrast, an [agreement is a shallow secret
when the public knows that a particular secret agreement exists, but
does not know the content of the agreement.]{.underline}) Less is known
about these arrangements because [there are **[fewer players]{.mark}**
in a **position** within either government [to **leak them**]{.mark} to
the **press** or the **public**.]{.underline} Second, the arrangements
almost surely contain narrower national undertakings than do secret
agreements (of which Congress and the DOS, as well as the originating
agency, at a minimum, are aware). If only a single agency\--or a limited
set of actors within an agency\--knows of the arrangement, its
implementation by definition cannot require the involvement of large
numbers of government officials.

Compared to secret agreements, [it is even more **[difficult to
estimate]{.mark}** the number of secret arrangements between the United
States and other states]{.underline}. This is because many of them are
negotiated by [intelligence agencies]{.underline}, which [tend to be the
**best secret-keepers** within governments]{.underline}. Jeffrey
Richelson and Desmond Ball assert that over 1,000 intelligence
arrangements exist among the five states that are parties to the Five
Eyes agreement (the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand). 43 Richelson describes some of them, including
[[arrangements regarding]{.mark} **defense intelligence**]{.underline}
analysis, 44 [ocean surveillance]{.underline}, 45 and **[[satellite
imagery exchanges]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 46 Secret arrangements also
exist between various U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies. 47 The
U.S. [CIA reportedly has established connections with more than 400
foreign agencies, which almost certainly entails concluding secret
arrangements with some of those agencies]{.underline}. 48 Likewise, the
CIA\'s Canadian equivalent has more than 250 intelligence-sharing
arrangements with foreign intelligence entities. 49 These [arrangements
[may take the form of **m**]{.mark}emoranda **[o]{.mark}**f
**[u]{.mark}**nderstanding [or]{.mark} even **[oral agreements]{.mark}**
between intelligence officials]{.underline}. 50 [Defense agencies also
seem to conclude a **wide variety** of secret cooperative
arrangements]{.underline}. 51

B. Reasons for Secrecy

As this article has shown, [states]{.underline} today [keep]{.underline}
some of their [international commitments **secret**]{.underline}.
Because there has been [**[scant]{.mark} [attention]{.mark}** [paid
to]{.mark} the **existence** of the
**[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline}, there has been little scholarly
analysis of why states resort to secrecy in their commitments. This
section undertakes such an analysis. There are at least five reasons why
states employ secrecy when concluding international commitments. Some of
these reasons are readily justified under international law and
longstanding expectations of state behavior; others are more difficult
to justify.

1\. Publicity Would Defeat Commitment\'s Legitimate Purpose

States keep a variety of commitments secret because the
[[info]{.mark}rmation they contain [is]{.mark} **properly
[classified]{.mark}** under the domestic law of one or more of the
states parties and its **[disclosure]{.mark}** would **[defeat]{.mark}**
the **[purpose]{.mark}** of the **commitment**.]{.underline} Consider,
for example, [a commitment to **share intel**ligence collected using
classified capabilities.]{.underline} Concluding that commitment in
unclassified form would [**[reveal]{.mark}** the very [**existence**
of]{.mark} the **[capabilities]{.mark}** that [states sought to **keep
secret**]{.mark} under their domestic laws]{.underline}. A similar need
for secrecy attaches to commitments that advance non-proliferation
goals. A secret nuclear agreement between the United States and the
U.S.S.R. in 1974 included details about how each side would dismantle
replacement missiles. 176 If the information were made public, it would
have revealed very sensitive information that might help non-nuclear
weapons states develop nuclear weapons and thus hinder widely-held
non-proliferation goals. 177

The [[need for secrecy]{.mark} in the area of military operations and
plans [is **well-accepted**]{.mark} by **states**. States have a long
history of keeping secret those commitments that **[establish]{.mark}**
and structure military **[coordination]{.mark}**, **[training]{.mark}**,
or [**plans** to **preserve advantages** over]{.mark} **current** or
**future [enemies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Myers McDougal and Asher
Lans put it in the context of World War II,

No person concerned with the security of this continent could reasonably
expect that the details of the military arrangements \[contained in a
1940 secret agreement between the United States and Canada\] should have
been publicized for the edification of the German and Japanese general
staffs. Similarly, it would be unreasonable to expect that armistice or
other military agreements made with regard to active war zones during
the continuance of combat should be publicly disclosed. 178

Jeremy Bentham, who pled generally for publicity in the conduct of
government activity, deemed [secrecy acceptable \"if
**[publicity]{.mark} [favors]{.mark}** the projects of an
**[enemy]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} 179 Even philosopher Sissela Bok, who
is generally skeptical about the use of secrecy because of its ability
to corrupt, notes that [military [secrecy]{.mark} may be [necessary to
**implement**]{.mark} \"certain **[plans]{.mark}**, to
**[provide]{.mark}** the crucial element of
**[surprise]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} 180 Bok recognizes [the close link
between **military secrecy** and a state\'s right of
**self-defense**]{.underline}, which she describes as [self-**evident**
and **sacred**.]{.underline} 181

[Using [secrecy]{.mark} in **military contexts**]{.underline} such as
these [[**reduces uncertainty** for]{.mark} the [**states** that are
**parties**]{.mark} to the **commitments**]{.underline}, while
[sustaining **uncertainty** for those who are **not
parties**]{.underline}. 182 In the context of weapons sales, [the
parties might opt for secrecy because the states seek to reduce
uncertainty between themselves about how the purchaser may use the
weapon, while [leaving **external players
uncertain**]{.mark}]{.underline} about what restrictions might exist on
the purchaser\'s military operations.

It is no surprise that [commitments implicating information of the type
that is commonly classified in domestic systems **endure in
secret**.]{.underline} And [[where]{.mark} the **substantive
[purpose]{.mark}** of those commitments [is consistent with]{.mark}
generally **accepted [norms]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} military and
intelligence **[coop]{.mark}eration**, the **[secrecy]{.mark}** of the
commitments [is **not troubling**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### 2 -- [transparency]{.underline} -- secrecy [increases assurances]{.underline} for [info-sharing]{.underline} and enables communication that otherwise [wouldn't occur]{.underline} AND is key to [effective diplomatic exchange]{.underline} -- turns the case

Ashley S. **Deeks 18**, Associate Professor, University of Virginia Law
School. 2018, "Symposium: The Forefront of International Law: A
(Qualified) Defense of Secret Agreements," Arizona State Law Journal,
49, 713, pp. 753-754, Lexis, nihara

2\. Enhanced Transparency Behind the Veil

**[[Secrecy]{.underline}]{.mark}** in international commitments also
[can [facilitate **transparency** among]{.mark} the **[states]{.mark}**
that hold discussions behind that veil.]{.underline} For example, Russia
and the United States might only be willing to consider negotiating an
agreement related to nuclear weapons if they can discuss in some detail
the nature and number of those weapons. [[Each]{.mark} might be [willing
to **share**]{.mark} certain **[info]{.mark}rmation** with the other,
but **[only with the other]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, in 1974,
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger signed an agreement with the Soviets
to limit underground nuclear tests, which offered an example of
\"sharing of secrets of nuclear affairs among Soviet and American
officials, but not publicly.\" 183 The [secrecy of the setting
facilitates the **exchange of info**rmation]{.underline} between the
United States and Russia [[about]{.mark} a [**sensitive issue**
at]{.mark} the [**core** of]{.mark} the
**[negotiation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, the U.S-Soviet/Russian
agreements offer a paradigmatic example of using secrecy to enhance open
exchanges behind the veil between players who are otherwise skeptical of
each other\'s motives.

[[**Diplomatic assurances** offer]{.mark} another
[example]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States has entered into a
number of secret commitments with states into whose custody the United
States seeks to transfer individuals. The transfers may occur in the
context of extradition, immigration removals, military detention, or
renditions. 184 In these assurances, the receiving state may commit to
treat the individual humanely, provide a fair trial, and allow
non-governmental observers to visit the individual in detention. A
declaration produced by a State Department official during Guantanamo
litigation explains how [secrecy can further transparency]{.underline}:

[[If]{.mark} the Department were [**required to disclose** outside
appropriate **Exec**]{.mark}**utive** branch **[channels]{.mark}** its
**communications** with a **foreign government**]{.underline} relating
to particular mistreatment or torture concerns, [that government, as
well as other [governments, would]{.mark} likely [be
**reluctant**]{.mark} in the future [to **communicate frankly**]{.mark}
with the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[**concerning** such **issues**]{.underline}. I know from experience
that [the delicate [diplomatic exchange]{.mark} that is often required
in these contexts [**cannot occur** effectively **except** in]{.mark} a
**[confidential setting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 185

The [idea that states employ **secrecy** in their commitments to
**enhance** interstate **transparency** is supported by the appearance
of the **secrecy/transparency paradox** in other contexts]{.underline}.
For example, in the context of foreign surveillance, David Kris and Doug
Wilson have written that the [F]{.underline}oreign
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [S]{.underline}urveillance [A]{.underline}ct

encourages, and in some cases requires, the government to provide
extensive disclosures to the \[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court\]
. . . . The FISC needs that information, and candor from the government,
to perform its essential function. But [if the government entertains a
fear that the FISC will release that information to the public, its
**incentive** will be to **reduce disclosures** to their bare
minimum]{.underline}. 186

[**Secrecy** thus allows the Executive to be far **more forthcoming** to
a body **overseeing** its **actions**]{.underline}. Similarly, in 2010
the executive branch began to include classified annexes in its War
Powers Reports to Congress. [Through the use of **secrecy**, the
**Executive** was able to **provide Congress** with **more
details**]{.underline} [about executive military
**operations**.]{.underline} Although the FISA and War Powers examples
are not cases involving secret commitments, they help illustrate how the
[conclusions of commitments in [secret can **enable**
**info**]{.mark}rmational **[exchanges]{.mark}** among relevant
players.]{.underline} In particular, [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} that
are not used to working with each other\--and that may be in a publicly
adversarial posture\--[may [need to **employ secrecy** to]{.mark} be
able to **[cooperate at all]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### 3 -- deference to sovereignty -- otherwise, states say no

Ashley S. **Deeks 18**, Associate Professor, University of Virginia Law
School. 2018, "Symposium: The Forefront of International Law: A
(Qualified) Defense of Secret Agreements," Arizona State Law Journal,
49, 713, pp. 754-756, Lexis, nihara

3\. Deference to Sovereignty

Another reason that a [state chooses to keep a **commitment
secret**]{.underline} is [out of deference to its **partner\'s
sovereignty** or national pride]{.underline}. In some instances, [the
partner believes that the commitment, if made **public**, would
**signal** an **unwelcome surrender** of its **sovereignty** or **reveal
military** or **political weakness**.]{.underline} 187 [The **secrecy**
of U.S. diplomatic assurances **exemplifies deference** to the
**sovereignty** of the state **providing assurances**. The
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has explained that it
usually **keeps secret** its **decisions** to **seek assurances** and
the content of the **assurances** themselves \"**in order** to avoid the
**chilling effects** of making such **discussions
public**.\"]{.underline} 188 Some states presumably take offense at the
request for assurances, because the request implies that the state has a
reputation for mistreating people in its custody. [Keeping the
diplomatic assurances secret allows the United States to
obtain]{.underline} the **[commitments]{.underline}** it requires [while
**minimizing** the **impact** on the receiving **state\'s
dignity**]{.underline}.

In a number of cases, the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates has [kept secret its **SOFAs**, pursuant to
which other states agree to allow the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to operate]{.underline} bases and house
military personnel [inside their countries]{.underline}. 189 According
to the State Department, [one reason SOFAs may be **classified** is
because of the \"potentially **damaging implications** of making
**concessions** on **sovereignty** to the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. In a few cases, the reason appears to be
sensitivity (sometimes felt by both the United States and the host)
about the very idea that there are U.S. military personnel in the host
country.\" 190 [Keeping the SOFAs **secret** limits **perceived damage**
to the host state\'s **sovereignty** and **self-image** as
**independent** or **militarily self-sufficient**]{.underline}. A state
may also seek to keep a military cooperation commitment secret to avoid
positioning itself as a terrorist target. Recently Tunisia agreed to
allow U.S. drones to fly out of a base in Tunisia, but reportedly wanted
the commitment kept secret to avoid raising its profile as a target for
ISIS. 191

Additionally, [in the context of **weapons sales**]{.underline}, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} the
[purchasing states]{.underline} might [choose to keep]{.underline} the
[use restrictions **secret** because the purchaser perceives the
**limitations** as a **challenge** to its **sovereignty**.]{.underline}
That is, the purchaser would prefer to be able to use the weapons it
acquires in whatever way it sees fit, and may accept restrictions
grudgingly, because the restrictions seem to encroach on its freedom of
action as a sovereign state.

### 2nc -- solvency -- at: strikedown -- i-law

#### 1 -- international law [does NOT ban]{.underline} secret arrangements -- ONLY indicates they're [non-binding]{.underline} until [registered]{.underline} -- which doesn't [obviate]{.underline} the [possibility]{.underline} of [legal force]{.underline}

Ashley S. **Deeks 18**, Associate Professor, University of Virginia Law
School. 2018, "Symposium: The Forefront of International Law: A
(Qualified) Defense of Secret Agreements," Arizona State Law Journal,

4\. Seeds of Non-compliance

A variety of actors celebrated the enactment of these registration
provisions, first in the Covenant and then in the Charter. Not least
were international law scholars, who both vilified the substance of
earlier secret agreements and anticipated advantages for international
law generally in making all agreements public. Manley Hudson, for
instance, who was a leading supporter of this development, expressed
enthusiasm for the Covenant\'s approach not only because Article 18
advanced \"open diplomacy\" but also because it facilitated \"the
scientific study of the conventional law of nations.\" 107 Although
[[states]{.mark} registered a large number of their agreements, they
**[did not]{.mark} [register]{.mark} all** of them]{.underline}. 108 In
the midst of the celebrations, there were clear signs that [the
[**norm** against secret agreements]{.mark} [was]{.mark} already [on
**thin ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

a\. Textual Challenges

The [**challenges** to **developing a norm** that would force states
**truly** to **abandon** the use of **secret agreements**]{.underline}
were apparent from the moment states concluded the Covenant. [One
challenge was **textual**]{.underline}. The [[Covenant]{.mark} itself
**[did not literally ban]{.mark}** the [use]{.mark} of secret
agreements]{.underline}; rather, [it [provided]{.mark} that
international [agreements]{.mark} and \"engagements\" [would not be
**binding**]{.mark} until **registered**]{.underline}. 109 [This raised
several **interpretive questions**.]{.underline} One was [whether a
secret agreement was **void ab initio** or, rather, **voidable at** the
**request** of one of the parties]{.underline}. International law
authority Charles Cheney Hyde adopted the latter view. 110 Another
question related to the types of agreements that Article 18 covered. The
United Kingdom argued that Article 18 was only intended to prohibit
\"secret aggressive treaties injurious to the peace of nations,\" even
though the registration practice included \"every\" treaty and
international agreement. 111

In addition, [the Covenant applied to **legally binding** commitments,
[which invited the use of **creative drafting** to
**circumvent**]{.mark} its [application]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Megan
Donaldson points out, \"\[A\]lthough Article 18 \[of the Covenant\] was
drafted with sweeping language to capture all manner of legal
commitments regardless of nomenclature and form . . . [foreign
ministries drew on the same techniques of drafting evident in some of
the prewar secret arrangements . . . to [craft agreements with]{.mark}
at least **some [claim]{.mark}** [to **legal force**]{.mark}, but which
were **[not unambiguously]{.mark} legally
[binding]{.mark}**[\--and]{.mark} thus **[escaped]{.mark}** the reach of
**[Article 18]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" 112 [**Creative lawyering** thus
facilitated the continuing use of secret commitments that did not
clearly fall within Article 18\'s purview]{.underline}.

#### 2 -- [practically]{.underline} -- the counterplan is [NOT binding]{.underline}, so it [doesn't violate]{.underline} international sanctions -- AND, [secret diplomacy]{.underline} ensures the [existence]{.underline} of [secret agreements]{.underline}

Ashley S. **Deeks 18**, Associate Professor, University of Virginia Law
School. 2018, "Symposium: The Forefront of International Law: A
(Qualified) Defense of Secret Agreements," Arizona State Law Journal,
49, 713, pp. 739-740, Lexis, nihara

b\. Practical Challenges

[Another challenge]{.underline} to the idea that states would surrender
their use of secret agreements [flowed from]{.underline} the realpolitik
nature of [international diplomacy. [States will **always insist**
on]{.mark} the **need** for **[secret diplomacy]{.mark}**, and [as long
as there is secret diplomacy there is]{.mark} an **obvious
[opportunity]{.mark}** [to conclude **secret
agreements**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even as President Wilson was
proclaiming the first of his Fourteen Points (\"open covenants of peace
openly arrived at\"), and even as states such as France and the United
Kingdom publicly accepted that vision, those states continued to
negotiate secret agreements during the Peace Conference. 113 Indeed,
during Peace Conference discussions, states continued to consult with
Italy how secretly to divide Turkey. 114 More broadly, the French and
British governments remained interested in retaining the ability to
craft secret binding agreements, at least on some subjects. 115
Immediately after the armistice was concluded, one commentator wrote,
\"I admire and appreciate the principles of President Wilson; but I
cannot understand how any one who has his eyes open for a moment
believes in their realization.\" 116

[Those who advocated for forcing secret agreements into a
**non-binding** or **less binding** form **misperceived** how **states
would respond** to this sanction]{.underline}. As discussed supra, there
is reason to believe that [[states]{.mark} have **incentives to
[comply]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} secret [arrangements, even when]{.mark}
those arrangements are **[not legally binding]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
117 Therefore, [the modest [sanctions]{.mark} built into the
Covenant]{.underline} (and the even more modest sanctions built into the
Charter) [were **[unlikely to deter]{.mark}** states from continuing to
rely on the use of [secret arrangements, whatever]{.mark} [their]{.mark}
**formal [legal status]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The short-lived nature of states\' enthusiasm for Wilson\'s first Point
(and for Article 18 of the Covenant) is further evidenced by the various
secret treaties that states concluded before World War II. In 1925, for
instance, Italy and Albania concluded a secret military pact in which
Albania accepted an Italian protectorate over Albania. 118 In 1936 the
Italians and Spanish concluded a secret agreement in which Italy
promised to help Spain reestablish order within its territory, and in
which both sides agreed to continue to trade with each other even if one
state was drawn into war. 119 These states were members of the League of
Nations when they concluded these agreements. 120 These examples
illustrate that secret treaties retained their appeal in the Covenant
period. Indeed, the agreements among Britain, the U.S.S.R., and the
United States that emerged from the Yalta Conference in 1945\--just
months before states convened to create the United Nations\--were
largely kept secret. 121 [Notwithstanding the common trope that secret
agreements must be abandoned, [states]{.mark} **clearly were
[loath]{.mark}** [to give them up]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- solvency -- intel-sharing

#### Counterplan solves intel operations

School. 2018, "Symposium: The Forefront of International Law: A
(Qualified) Defense of Secret Agreements," Arizona State Law Journal,
49, 713, pp. 741-744, Lexis, nihara

1\. Intelligence Cooperation

[Given that states\' **intel**]{.underline}ligence [**activities**
are]{.underline} among [the **most secretive acts** they perform, it is
**predictable** that states seek to **conceal** from the **public eye**
the **intel**]{.underline}ligence-[related commitments they **conclude**
with other **states**.]{.underline} These [commitments range in scope:
some establish long-term, stable intel]{.underline}ligence
[relationships, while other anticipate shorter-term, more discrete
cooperation]{.underline}.

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is party to
several intelligence agreements that have been in place for **many
decades**]{.underline}. These [**durable agreements** with **close
allies** establish the modalities by which the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and its partners undertake certain
**intelligence collection** and **exchanges**]{.underline}. The Five
Eyes agreement among the United States, United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand is the most famous long-standing secret
intelligence agreement (though earlier versions of the agreement have
been declassified). 124 The agreement allocates electronic surveillance
collection among the five states and anticipates a high level of
coordination and intelligence sharing. 125 The Five Eyes reportedly have
added other states as \"third parties,\" which have a formalized
relationship with the Five Eyes but remain outside the core group. 126
The United States and Australia have concluded several secret agreements
related to a joint defense facility at Pine Gap, Australia, from which
the two states conduct electronic surveillance and monitor nuclear
weapons development and testing, among other things. 127 In 1999, they
renewed the Pine Gap agreement, which they first concluded in 1966. In
2008, the United States and Australia also secretly agreed to share
classified geospatial intelligence from surveillance satellites and
reconnaissance aircraft. 128 It appears that the United States may help
Australia operate its surveillance satellite and have access to the
imagery the satellite collects. 129

[Secret commitments also help **establish** the **rules of the road**
for **joint intelligence operations**]{.underline}. Two examples
recently emerged. First, the Government of Mexico apparently concluded
an arrangement with the U.S. Government that granted \"high-flying U.S.
spy planes access to Mexican airspace for the purpose of gathering
intelligence\" to suppress narcotics trafficking. 130 Mexican
authorities retained operational control during the drone flights. 131
Second, in the wake of September 11, intelligence services of France,
the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Canada, and Australia
established Alliance Base, an operations center in Paris that planned
and undertook joint counter-terrorism field operations. 132

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [also]{.underline}
has [concluded **intelligence agreements** that help **build** and
**bolster** other **states\' intelligence capacities**.]{.underline} The
[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which **maintains U.S.
satellites** and collects **geospatial intelligence** to
**facilitate**]{.underline} (among other things) [national security
policymaking, counter-terrorism, and warfighting, has entered into more
than **400 agreements** with over **120 countries** to build their
**geospatial intel**ligence **capacities**, enabling **international
partners** to \"operate in **coalition environments**, **transform** and
**modernize** their **defense structures**, and protect **common
interests**]{.underline}.\" 133 Some of these agreements appear to be
classified. 134 Similarly, in 1949 the CIA agreed to provide funding and
equipment to Turkey\'s intelligence organization in exchange for the raw
communications intelligence traffic that Turkey collected. 135 Later,
[the **N**ational **S**ecurity **A**gency and the **Turkish General
Staff** concluded a **secret commitment** pursuant to which the
**U**nited **S**tates could **operate signals** intelligence sites on
**Turkish soil**.]{.underline} 136 The **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**enhances allies\' capabilities** in exchange
for **access** to the **info**rmation that the **allies obtain** with
those more advanced capabilities]{.underline}.

Yet other secret intelligence commitments establish more discrete (and
possibly shorter-term) modalities of cooperation. Consider two examples
related to Israel. The United States reportedly sold F-16 jets to Israel
under a secret agreement in which Israel agreed to use the F-16 jets for
defensive purposes only. 137 International law generally forbids
preemptive uses of force. 138 Bilateral cooperation also exists with
Israel in the signals intelligence sphere. In 2013, Edward Snowden
leaked a memorandum of understanding between the National Security
Agency and the Israeli Signals Intelligence National Unit (ISNU). 139
Pursuant to the memorandum, NSA would share raw signals intelligence
with the ISNU, which would handle that intelligence in accordance with
U.S. law (including the requirement to minimize U.S. person
information). 140 NSA appears to train Israeli personnel in the
minimization process. 141 [**European states** also seem to have
**established** certain **intel**ligence-**sharing**
**commitments**]{.underline} in the wake of the 2015 Paris attack and
2016 Brussels attacks, [though the **scope** and **breadth** of the
commitments is **unclear**.]{.underline} 142

4\. Weapons-Related Commitments

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[has [concluded]{.mark} a variety of [agreements that **regulate** how
**states** that **purchase**]{.mark} **U.S. [weapons]{.mark}** may
**employ** those **weapons**.]{.underline} Many of those agreements are
public, but [in some cases the restrictions are **secret**.]{.underline}
Perhaps the worst-kept secret agreement in this category is one between
the United States and Israel limiting how Israel may use
U.S.-manufactured cluster munitions. The agreement reportedly prohibits
Israel\'s use of cluster munitions \"in populated areas and against
targets that are not clearly military.\" 168 (Using cluster munitions in
civilian-populated areas is likely to result in civilian deaths during
or after an armed conflict, by virtue of the way the munitions work.) In
at least two cases, the United States has opened investigations into
Israel\'s possible violation of that agreement, and in one case
suspended sales of cluster munitions to Israel for six years. 169

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates may have
[established **similar classified restrictions** on its sales of **armed
drones**]{.underline}. In 2015, the Obama Administration announced that
it would permit the export of armed drones, while [[establishing
**principles** to which foreign state purchasers would **need to
adhere**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 170 One such principle is that the
purchasers would have to agree to use the drones [for \"national defense
or other situations in which force is [**permitted** by **international
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\" 171 The [U.S. [policy]{.mark} governing
sales [remains **classified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which suggests that
the [[subsequent agreements]{.mark} between the United States and

I. INTRODUCTION

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [expends
**significant resources** on]{.underline} what it calls [efforts to
preserve **international peace** and **security**.]{.underline} These
costs are [incurred both through U.S. agencies directly and through
**[international organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
[which]{.underline} the United States plays a part. Both U.S. agencies
and international organizations also [[have]{.mark} the [**capability**
to **infringe** on]{.mark} **legally** and **normatively guaranteed
[rights]{.mark}** of Americans and non-U.S. citizens.]{.underline}
However, [despite the **sums expended** by Americans and the **potential
infringements** and **abuses** by **international organizations**, U.S.
[citizens have]{.mark} very [**few mechanisms** to obtain
**info**]{.mark}**rmation** about these organizations.]{.underline} This
is in contrast to the established regime of transparency required and
practiced by U.S. agencies. Specifically, [the existing [**transparency
tools** for]{.mark}]{.underline} citizen oversight of two international
security organizations, the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.mark}**)]{.underline} 1and the International Criminal Police
Organisation (INTERPOL), 2[[are inadequate]{.mark} because [they
**default to secrecy**]{.mark} rather than **balancing organizational
needs** against the **requirement** for **public
legitimacy**.]{.underline}

A. Public Interest in NATO Operations

[U.S. support to NATO takes two **primary forms**: **indirect
contributions** in the form of American **troops deployed** on NATO
missions and **direct contributions** in the form of **American money**
provided for **NATO\'s budget**.]{.underline} 3In June 2008, the United
States contributed 23,550 troops to NATO\'s International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, in addition to 19,000 forces
operating independently of NATO in Afghanistan under Operation Enduring
Freedom (OEF). 4In June 2019, the U.S. contribution to Resolute Support
(RS), NATO\'s successor mission to ISAF, was 8,475 troops. 5In addition,
the United States contributed about \$ 570 million to NATO\'s
headquarters in 2018 alone. 6

[The]{.underline} U.S. [**[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f
**[D]{.mark}**efense accepts that its [troops must]{.mark}, inter alia,
[**plan** and **execute operations** in]{.mark}]{.underline} Afghanistan
7in [[**compliance** with]{.mark} the **law of war** principles of
**proportionality** and **distinction**]{.underline}. 8When [U.S. troops
commanded]{.underline} 9[by NATO]{.underline} under the former ISAF and
current RS mission engage in combat, they [must follow certain rules of
**[international law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 10One such rule,
[**[proportionality]{.mark}**, requires military commanders to **weigh**
the expected **combat benefits** of action against the **incidental
harms** to the **civilian population**, [and]{.mark} **avoid combat**
where the **incidental harms** are **excessive compared** to the
**benefits** of the legitimate military mission]{.underline}.
11[**[Distinction]{.mark}**, another law of war principle, mandates that
commanders take care to **differentiate** between **enemy forces**,
which can be **targeted**, and **civilians**, who cannot be
**intentionally targeted**.]{.underline} 12

[However, [during]{.mark} **non-international** **armed
[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as the one in Afghanistan,
[military [authorities]{.mark} may [experience]{.mark} **greater
[difficulties]{.mark}** [distinguishing]{.mark} between **enemy
combatants** and **civilians**]{.underline}. 13As a result,
[[NATO]{.mark} and independent U.S. forces in Afghanistan have killed
hundreds of civilians in airstrikes.]{.underline} 14[Human rights groups
have alleged these **military [forces failed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
properly **[follow i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}** in the course of
such attacks.]{.underline} 15Yet, as demonstrated below, [the [records
of U.S. forces]{.mark} are **presumptively open** to **civilian
inspection**, [allow]{.mark}ing Americans [to **assess**]{.mark} **the
[legality]{.mark}** [of the **force**]{.mark} used in our name and with
our tax dollars, while the [**records** of **NATO forces are
not**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 16

II\. CASE STUDIES

Existing [**international** organization **transparency efforts fail**
to account for the]{.underline} public\'s interest in their actions and
for the [need for **public legitimacy**]{.underline}. 66This [lack of
transparency is borne out by]{.underline} two case studies of
international organizations that perform public duties like those
undertaken by comparable U.S. agencies, with similar risks to human
rights, but without the same level of public transparency: (1) [**NATO**
troops made up of soldiers from the United States and other nations
compared with U.S.-commanded troops in **Afghanistan**]{.underline}, and
(2) INTERPOL Red Notices compared with domestic arrest warrants.

A. NATO Airstrikes in Afghanistan

Both [NATO forces and U.S. forces in Afghanistan are funded by U.S.
taxpayers, both help to implement U.S. security interests,
and]{.underline} both [have the **potential** to **violate**
**i**nternational **laws** and **norms**]{.underline}. However, for the
reasons explained below, [the actions of U.S. forces are far **more
transparent** to the U.S. taxpayer **than** the actions of **NATO
forces**]{.underline}.

1\. Structure and Mission of NATO and U.S. Forces in Afghanistan

In order to understand the different levels of transparency applied to
NATO and U.S. forces undertaking similar public duties in Afghanistan,
it is first necessary to understand the basic organizational details and
legal authorities of both institutions. Transparency itself depends on
the entity from which the armed forces derive their authority and on the
organizational arrangements used by those armed forces.

a\. NATO Structure

The North Atlantic Treaty establishes only one NATO body, the North
Atlantic Council. 67The Council contains representatives from each state
party and has authority to \"set up such subsidiary bodies as may be
necessary.\" 68The North Atlantic Council has created a military
hierarchy for its armed operations. 69The chief military authority is
the Military Committee, which consists of the most senior military
officer of each member country or his or her representative. 70The
Committee is assisted by its International Military Staff. 71

Subordinate to the Military Committee is the military command structure,
which is composed of two commands: Allied Command Operations and Allied
Command Transformation. 72Allied Command Transformation is led by
Supreme Allied Command Transformation and focuses on strategic planning
and readiness. 73Allied Command Operations directs and executes all
military operations and is led by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe
(SACEUR) from the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in
Belgium. 74Traditionally, SACEUR is also the U.S. military officer in
charge of U.S. European Command. 75

The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was authorized by the
U.N. Security Council to provide security in and near the Afghan
capital, Kabul, in December 2001. 76NATO took control of the ISAF
mission in August 2003. 77ISAF\'s authority was expanded to encompass
the entire country in October 2003. 78ISAF was terminated in 2014 and
replaced with the RS mission. 79The NATO commander in Afghanistan is
subordinate to SACEUR/SHAPE. 80

b\. U.S. Forces Structure

Separate and apart from U.S. troops operating in Afghanistan under the
NATO banner, the U.S. military also commands troops in Afghanistan
directly. 81The structure of those forces is the result of the evolution
of American military organization in the twentieth century more broadly.
82Past the beginning of World War II, the Department of War and the
Department of the Navy, the two extant departments of the American
military, 83operated autonomously from one another. 84In response to the
shortcomings of this approach, Congress and the executive branch took
steps during and after World War II to increasingly remove the
leadership of the military departments from any direct control over
military operations. 85

In 1986, responding to concerns that the military departments still
exercised too much informal control over operations, 86Congress
officially removed the departments from any command over the operational
elements. 87That reform, which still provides the basic framework for
the American military structure, 88tasks the military departments 89with
preparing their forces for combat. 90The military departments then
assign their forces to the combatant commands, which have operational
authority. 91The President is responsible for creating combatant
commands and assigning their areas of operation or responsibilities.
92There are presently eleven active combatant commands, including U.S.
Central Command (CENTCOM), 93the combatant command responsible for U.S.
forces in Afghanistan and the Middle East more broadly. 94

Most U.S. troops in Afghanistan who are not assigned to the NATO mission
are under the control of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A), which in
turn, is a component of CENTCOM. 95USFOR-A was created by the Department
of Defense in 2008 to merge several different Afghanistan chains of
command into one, and it commanded most soldiers assigned to OEF, which
has subsequently been replaced by OFS. 96Since USFOR-A was created in
2008, its commander has always simultaneously commanded NATO troops in
Afghanistan under the ISAF and then RS missions. 97

2\. Alleged Abuses

Airstrikes carried out by both NATO and U.S. forces are a consistent
source of civilian casualties in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch has
alleged that airstrikes by these two military organizations were
responsible for 116 civilian deaths in 2006 and 321 in 2007. 98In 2018,
the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan counted 393
civilian deaths and 239 civilian injuries caused by aerial operations by
U.S. and NATO forces for a total of 632 civilian casualties. 99These
figures are disputed by military officials. 100However, the issue with
these casualties for the purpose of this comment is not so much their
exact number, but the fact that they raise serious concerns about
whether the United States and NATO are complying with relevant law of
war standards. 101Human Rights Watch and the U.N. noted similar casualty
trends across time in both reports. For instance, both organizations
noted their concern about civilian casualties caused by relatively
spontaneous airstrikes carried out in support of ground forces, as
opposed to airstrikes planned well in advance. 102

3\. Comparative Inability to Access NATO Records

Both the United States and NATO have transparency laws or policies.
103However, NATO\'s transparency policy is far weaker. As a result,
there is no public right to access most NATO documents, even though
their equivalents are public under U.S. law. Because the commander of
NATO forces in Afghanistan is an American, 104and most NATO troops are
contributed by the U.S., 105it is arguable that many NATO records should
be accessible as records of one or more U.S. military agencies. However,
the Department of Defense has concluded that NATO records in the
possession of American personnel assigned to NATO are not records of
U.S. agencies. 106

a\. High-Level Policy Documents

In the United States, laws and quasi-legislative documents of the
federal government must be made public, a requirement that falls under
the legislative and judicial type of transparency. First, the U.S.
Constitution itself requires public access to Congressional enactments.
107Second, provisions of the Freedom of Information Act require
executive agencies to publish all general rules and policies. 108As a
result, the public has access to a wealth of information about the law
and policy governing the American armed forces. These include not only
the law, 109but also voluminous quasi-law policy documents from the
Department of Defense and the services branches, such as Department of
Defense Directives, 110service regulations, 111and doctrinal
publications. 112If an executive branch agency refuses to disclose such
policy documents, any individual can seek a court order compelling their
release. 113

In contrast, NATO\'s transparency policy is far more limited. First,
unlike the Freedom of Information Act, NATO\'s policy is limited to
historical documents\--those thirty years or older, which NATO has
determined for itself to have permanent historical significance. 114Even
though the present war in Afghanistan is now nearly twenty years old,
115this transparency mandate does not extend to any policies enacted
since NATO became involved in that conflict. 116Second, the policy
provides no mechanism for outside enforcement. 117

b\. Investigations into Alleged Abuses

The Freedom of Information Act is not limited to official policy
documents. It also creates a presumption of access to unpublished
internal government records, an example of executive type transparency.
118This presumption is qualified with several exceptions, including
classified information and information that would compromise
investigations. 119Even so, U.S. military agencies must at times release
the results of their investigations into alleged human rights abuses.
For instance, after a high-profile incident in which soldiers assigned
to USFOR-A carried out an airstrike against a hospital operated by the
charity Médecins Sans Frontières in Kunduz Province, CENTCOM released a
redacted copy of the investigation report under the Freedom of
Information Act. 120Agency failures to disclose records of these
investigations are subject to judicial review. 121

When U.S. troops under either command allegedly carry out human rights
abuses, both NATO and U.S. authorities may carry out investigations into
such allegations. 122However, NATO appears to carry out more frequent
investigations, while the United States undertakes relatively few
civilian casualty investigations under its internal procedures. 123Under
the NATO Public Disclosure Policy, none of the investigative results
from NATO investigation processes are publicly available for at least
thirty years. 124As a result, valuable information about compliance with
the law of war is not available to the public.

#### Strong LOAC norms against civilian casualties prevent satellite attacks

**Beard, 18**---associate professor of law at the University of
Nebraska-Lincoln (Jack, interviewed by Brandon McDermott, "Crafting The
Manual For Warfare In Space,"
<http://netnebraska.org/article/news/1163396/crafting-manual-warfare-space>,
dml)

There\'s another factor here too, the growing commercialization of
space. With more and more launches, [with **more** and **more
satellites**]{.underline} -- the individual operators the individual
companies -- those are the responsibility of the states under the rules
that are now in place in the Outer Space Treaty. You can see, [as space
becomes **more congested** and **more competitive** that there are going
to be **problems** that]{.underline} are likely to [occur]{.underline}
between -- for instance -- space mining entities. Which is no longer a
far-fetched idea. [As competition for resources in space grows the
**likelihood of a conflict grows**]{.underline} and so you\'d like to
try to interpret [some of the terms]{.underline} that **[haven\'t been
applied yet in space]{.underline}**. Phrases like "interference," or
"due regard," which are found in the treaties haven\'t ever been
interpreted to this point in any real detail.

[It would be nice to know **what the appropriate response is** to
certain actions in space and things that are perceived as hostile in
order to **prevent as much damage as possible to civilian objects** and
to **civilians**. The **law of armed conflict** has as one of its
**central goals** preventing unnecessary or excessive damage to the
**civilian population**. There are satellites up there that are **solely
dedicated to all sorts of humanitarian purposes**]{.underline} --
weather satellites, satellites related to rescue and emergency --
[those]{.underline} sorts of things [**aren\'t appropriate targets** in
an armed conflict and should be **treated with some special
regard**]{.underline}.

#### Satellite attacks cause nuclear war

**Grego, 17**---Senior Scientist, Global Security Program, with the
Union of Concerned Scientists (Laura, "50 years after the Outer Space
Treaty: How secure is space?,"
<https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2017/12/50-Years-OST-article.pdf>,
dml)

For the foreseeable future, [**military tensions** among the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [**China**, and
**Russia** are likely to **remain high**, as are those between **China**
and **India**]{.underline}. It is imperative to track investments and
[strategies]{.underline} that [could **escalate a crisis** or lead
actors to consider **approaching** or **crossing the nuclear
threshold**. **Attacks on satellites can create** or **escalate
terrestrial crises** in ways that are **difficult to predict** and which
are **particularly dangerous among nuclear powers**]{.underline}.

[While the OST prohibits nuclear weapons in space, it is **less
specific** about other military activity]{.underline}, and states have
different interpretations of "peaceful purposes." Thus, [the drift is
toward a space regime that includes **increasingly sophisticated
anti-satellite technology**, with **very little mutual understanding**
about how actions in space are perceived and **what
constraints**]{.underline}, if any, **[global governance
provides]{.underline}**.

[States---and]{.underline}, increasingly, [sub-state actors---have been
developing technologies that can be used to **interfere with
satellites**]{.underline}. Not all such technologies are equally
dangerous, and it may be possible to prioritize appropriate limits.
Signals jamming, for example, is relatively low-tech, but is also
limited temporally and spatially in its effects; identification of the
perpetrator is relatively straightforward, even if remedies for the
interference are less so. More concerning are technologies with a
strategic-sized capability, or which are stealthy and hard to attribute,
or which make intent difficult to discern; [these technologies can
provide **new** and **unpredictable paths to crisis escalation**. The
inventories of such weapons are **growing** and relevant technology is
**proliferating**]{.underline}.

Renewed Efforts in the 116th Congress

On January 30, 2019, Representative Khanna and 96 co-sponsors introduced
[H.J.Res. 37]{.underline}, which again would [[direct]{.mark} "the
[**removal** of]{.mark} United States **[Armed Forces]{.mark}** from
**hostilities** in the Republic of Yemen [that have **not been**]{.mark}
[**authorized** by **Congress**]{.mark}]{.underline}." The language in
H.J.Res. 37 as introduced was identical to the amended version of
S.J.Res. 54 that passed the Senate in the 115th Congress. The
[resolution was referred to the House Foreign Affairs Committee,
which]{.underline} on February 6, 2019, [considered the resolution at a
markup session after a hearing of the full committee regarding U.S.
policy in the Arabian peninsula. During markup, opponents]{.underline}
of the measure [argued]{.underline} that U.S. support operations related
to the counter-Houthi campaign in Yemen were not "hostilities," and that
[passage]{.underline} of H.J.Res. 37 [[would **set a precedent**]{.mark}
[under which]{.mark} any Member of [**Congress** could]{.mark} **force
votes** **calling into [question]{.mark}** "all U.S. **[security
cooperation]{.mark}** agreements **[throughout the
world]{.mark}**."]{.underline} Those in favor of the measure stated that
U.S. actions in Yemen in this specific case involved direct involvement
in an armed conflict, and that "support for ongoing hostilities by a
third power and ally ... qualify" as involvement of U.S. armed forces in
hostilities.139 The committee voted 25-17 to report H.J.Res. 37 to the
full House and recommend its passage.140

Foreign affairs have been subject to informal, ad hoc oversight by the
House and Senate since the Founding. 37As the young Republic\'s
diplomatic business grew steadily over the first few decades, both
chambers soon created standing committees to oversee it: SFRC was
established in 1816 38and HFAC followed in 1822. 39Although the precise
jurisdictions of the foreign relations committees have shifted over the
centuries, they have always been responsible for oversight of relations
with other nations. 40In recent years, this has translated into
jurisdiction over the State Department, including U.S. embassies abroad,
and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). 41

[The committees have traditionally overseen decisions to **declare
war**, **authorize** traditional military **interventions**, and **shape
relations** with foreign nations]{.underline}. 42That [jurisdiction has
been **deeply connected** to the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution
(**WPR**)]{.underline} 43since its passage in 1973. 44Enacted in
response to concerns that the executive branch had abused its war powers
in Southeast Asia, 45[the [WPR **requires**]{.mark} the [President to
**notify** and **consult**]{.mark} [**Congress** regarding]{.mark} the
[**introduction** of **armed forces** into
**hostilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}; 46[provide periodic updates to
Congress throughout the duration of involvement in
hostilities;]{.underline} 47[[and **withdraw**]{.mark} **armed forces**
from **hostilities** after **sixty days** [unless]{.mark} **otherwise
[authorized]{.mark}** by **Congress**]{.underline}. 48WPR oversight,
along with congressional decisions to authorize the use of military
force (AUMF), fall under the jurisdiction of the foreign relations
committees. 49The [WPR\'s rigorous restraint provisions came **under
attack** almost **immediately** after it was passed.
Presidents]{.underline} since Nixon have [**questioned** the
**constitutionality** of the WPR]{.underline}, 50although they have
generally complied with its reporting requirements by filing reports
\"consistent with the War Powers Resolution.\" 51[The WPR\'s
[**ambiguity** and **interpretive flexibility**]{.mark} - especially
**[regarding]{.mark}** the term \"**[hostilities]{.mark}**\" - has
**[limited]{.mark}** its [**scope** and]{.mark} **practical
[effect]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 52[The WPR **does not define** what
constitutes \"**hostilities**,\" and no **legislation** or **court
decisions** have **offered more specificity**]{.underline}. 53Even
though the [WPR\'s legislative history suggests that [Congress
**intended** \"hostilities\" to be]{.mark} a **[broad]{.mark}
term**]{.underline}, 54[[Presidents]{.mark} have [interpreted it
**narrowly**]{.mark} to **avoid reporting requirements** and
**triggering** its **withdrawal provisions**]{.underline}. 55In 2011,
for example, as the WPR sixty-day termination date for U.S. military
operations in Libya neared, the Obama administration concluded that U.S.
military operations did not constitute \"hostilities\" within the
meaning of the WPR even though the United States had already conducted
an extensive bombing campaign. 56The Trump administration subsequently
adopted a similar position on \"limited\" hostilities in Syria. 57And in
Yemen, President Trump argued that U.S. military operations in support
of the Saudi-led coalition did not amount to \"hostilities,\" as U.S.
troops served only in a noncombat support role, despite a resolution
supported by both houses of Congress specifically labeling the
operations \"hostilities.\" 58

[The executive branch\'s **narrow interpretation** of the **WPR** has
**[cabined]{.mark}** its [**scope** and]{.mark} thus
**[limited]{.mark}** the foreign relations committees\' ability to
exercise their intended **[oversight]{.mark}** role]{.underline}. As one
congressional staffer explained, \"[The foreign relations [committees
**never managed** to have the **hook** they should have]{.mark} had
through the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution. They used it as a
**rhetorical cudgel** rather than as an **operative means** to have a
**seat** at the **decision-making table**.\"]{.underline} 59As [[modern
warfare]{.mark} tactics have [**increasingly fallen** outside]{.mark}
the **[WPR\'s scope]{.mark}**]{.underline}, 60the [foreign relations
committees have been **increasingly sidelined**]{.underline}. As
discussed in the next two Sections, much of that oversight authority has
instead gone to the armed services and intelligence committees.

Biden,\" Nation,

Hard as it is to believe in this time of record pandemic deaths,
insurrection, and an unprecedented encore impeachment, Joe
[**[Biden]{.mark}** is]{.underline} now officially [at the **helm** of
the **US war machine**]{.underline}. He is, in other words, the fourth
president to [**oversee** America's **unending** and **unsuccessful**
post-9/11 military campaigns]{.underline}. In terms of active US combat,
that's only happened once before, in the Philippines, America's
second-longest (if often forgotten) overseas combat campaign.

Yet that conflict was limited to a single Pacific archipelago. [Biden
inherits a **global war**---and burgeoning new Cold War ---spanning
**four continents** and a **military** mired in **active operations** in
**dozens of countries**, combat in some 14 of them, and bombing in at
least seven]{.underline}. That sort of scope has been standard fare for
American presidents for almost two decades now. Still, while this
country's post-9/11 war presidents have more in common than their
partisan divisions might suggest, distinctions do matter, especially at
a time when the White House almost unilaterally drives foreign policy.

So, [what can we expect from Commander in Chief **Biden**]{.underline}?
In other words, what's the forecast for US service members who have
invested their lives and limbs in future conflict, as well as for the
speculators in the military-industrial complex and anxious foreigners in
the countries still engulfed in America's war on terror who usually
stand to lose it all?

Many Trumpsters, and some libertarians, foresee disaster: that [the man
who, as a leading senator **facilitated** and **cheered** on the
disastrous **Iraq War**, [will]{.mark} surely **[escalate]{.mark}
American [adventurism]{.mark} abroad**]{.underline}. On the other hand,
establishment Democrats and most liberals, who are desperately (and
understandably) relieved to see Donald Trump go, find that prediction
preposterous. Clearly, Biden must have learned from past mistakes,
changed his tune, and should responsibly bring US wars to a close, even
if at a time still to be determined.

In a sense, both may prove right---and in another sense, both wrong. The
guess of this long-time war-watcher (and one-time war fighter) reading
the tea leaves: [Expect Biden to both **eschew big new wars**
and]{.underline} avoid fully ending existing ones. At the margins (think
Iran), he may improve matters some; [[in]{.mark} certain rather **[risky
areas]{.mark}** (**[Russia]{.mark}**n relations, for instance), he could
**worsen them**]{.underline}; but [in]{.underline} most cases (the rest
of [the]{.underline} Greater [**[Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark}**,
**[Africa]{.mark}**, and **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}), [he's likely
to remain squarely on the **status-quo spectrum**]{.underline}. And mind
you, [there's **nothing reassuring** about that]{.underline}.

It hardly requires clairvoyance to offer such guesswork. That's because
Biden basically is who he says he is and who he's always been, and the
man's simply never been transformational. [One need look no further than
his long and generally **interventionist** **past record** or the nature
of his current **national-security picks** to know that the safe money
is on more of the same.]{.underline} Whether the issues are war, race,
crime, or economics, Uncle Joe has made a career of bending with the
prevailing political winds and it's unlikely this old dog can truly
learn any new tricks. Furthermore, [he's [filled his foreign policy
squad with]{.mark} **Obama-Clinton retreads**]{.underline}, a number of
[who]{.underline}m [were [**architects** of]{.mark}]{.underline}---if
not [the initial **Iraq** and **Afghan debacles**---then
**[disasters]{.mark}** [in **Libya**]{.mark}, **[Syria]{.mark}**,
**[West Africa]{.mark}**, **[Yemen]{.mark}**, and the **[Afghan]{.mark}
surge** of 2009]{.underline}. In other words, [Biden is putting the
**former arsonists** in charge of the **forever-war fire**
brigade.]{.underline}

There's further reason to fear that he may even reject Trump's "If Obama
was for it, I'm against it" brand of war-on-terror policy-making and
thereby reverse The Donald's very late, very modest troop withdrawals in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Somalia. Yet even if this new old hand of a
president evades potentially existential escalation with nuclear Russia
or China and offers only an Obama reboot when it comes to persistent
low-intensity warfare, what he does will still matter---most of all to
the global citizens who are too often its victims. So, here's a brief
region-by-region flyover tour of what Joe's squad may have in store for
both the world and the American military sent to police that world.

THE MIDDLE EAST: OLD PRESCRIPTIONS FOR OLD BUSINESS

It's increasingly clear that Washington's legacy wars in the Greater
Middle East---Iraq and Afghanistan, in particular---are generally no
longer on the public's radar. Enter an elected old man who's charged
with handling old business that, at least to most civilians, is old
news. Odds are that [Biden's]{.underline} ancient tricks will amount to
safe bets in a region that past US policies essentially destroyed. Joe
is [likely to take a middle path in]{.underline} the region [between
**large-scale military intervention**]{.underline} of the Bush or Obama
kind and more prudent full-scale withdrawal.

As a result, [**such wars** will probably **drag on**]{.underline} just
below the threshold of American public awareness, [while]{.underline}
avoiding Pentagon or partisan charges that his version of
[cutting-and-running endangered US security]{.underline}. The prospect
of "victory" won't even factor into the equation (after all, Biden's
squad members aren't stupid), but political survival certainly will.
Here's what such a Biden-era future might then look like in a few such
sub-theaters.

The war in **[Afghanistan]{.underline}** is hopeless and [has long been
**failing**]{.underline} by every one of the US military's own
measurable metrics, so much so that the Pentagon and the Kabul
government classified them all as secret information a few years back.
[Actually **dealing** with the **Taliban** and **[swiftly
exiting]{.mark}** a disastrous **[war]{.mark}** likely to [lead to a
**disastrous future**]{.mark} with Washington's **tail between its
legs**]{.underline} is, in fact, the only remaining option. The question
is when and how many more Americans will kill or be killed in that
"graveyard of empires" before the United States accepts the inevitable.
Toward the end of his tenure, Trump signaled a serious, if cynical,
intent to so. And since Trump was by definition a monster and the other
team's monsters can't even occasionally be right, a coalition of
establishment Democrats and Lincoln-esque Republicans (and Pentagon
officials) decided that the war must indeed go on. That culminated in
last July's obscenity in which Congress officially withheld the funds
necessary to end it. [As vice president, Biden was better than most in
his Afghan War skepticism, but his incoming advisers weren't, and Joe's
nothing if not **politically malleable**]{.underline}. Besides, since
Trump didn't pull enough troops out faintly fast enough or render the
withdrawal irreversible over Pentagon objections, expect a trademark
Biden hedge here.

[**Syria** has always been a **boondoggle**]{.underline}, with the
[justifications for America's peculiar **military
presence**]{.underline} there [constantly **shifting** from pressuring
the regime of Bashar al-Assad]{.underline}, to [fighting the Islamic
State]{.underline}, to [backing the Kurds]{.underline}, to [balancing
Iran and Russia]{.underline} in the region, to (in Trump's case)
[securing]{.underline} that country's meager [oil]{.underline} supplies.
As with so much else, there's a troubling possibility that, in the Biden
years, personnel once again may become destiny. Many of the new
[president's [**advisers** were **bullish** on **Syrian
intervention**]{.mark} in the Obama years, even wanting to take it
further and topple Assad]{.underline}. Furthermore, [when it comes time
for them to convince Biden to agree to stay put in Syria, there's a
**[dangerous]{.mark}** existing **[mix of motives]{.mark}** to do just
that]{.underline}: the emotive sympathy for the Kurds of known
gut-player Joe; his [susceptibility to revived Islamic State (ISIS)
fear-mongering]{.underline}; and [perceptions of a toughness-testing
[**proxy contest** with **Russia**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

When it comes to [Iran]{.underline}, expect Biden to be better than the
Iran-phobic Trump administration, but to stay shackled "inside the box."
First of all, [despite Joe's long-expressed desire to reenter
the]{.underline} Obama-era [nuclear deal with Iran]{.underline} that
Trump so disastrously pulled out of, doing so may prove harder than he
thinks. After all, [why should Tehran trust a political basket case of a
negotiating partner prone to significant partisan policy-pendulum
swings]{.underline}, especially given the way Washington has waged
nearly 70 years of interventions against Iran's politicians and people?
In addition, [Trump left Biden the Trojan horse of Tehran's hardliners,
empowered by dint of The Donald's pugnacious policies]{.underline}. If
the new president wishes to really undercut Iranian intransigence and
fortify the moderates there, he should go big and be
transformational---in other words, see Obama's tension-thawing nuclear
deal and raise it with the carrot of full-blown diplomatic and economic
normalization. Unfortunately, status-quo Joe has never been a
transformational type.

KEEP AN EYE ON AFRICA

Though it garners far less public interest than the US military's
long-favored Middle Eastern playground, [**Africa** figures
significantly in the minds of]{.underline} those at the Pentagon, in the
Capitol, and in Washington's influential think tanks. For
**[interventionist hawks]{.underline}**, including liberal ones, that
continent has been both a petri dish and a proving ground [for the
development of a **limited power-projection** paradigm of **drones**,
**Special Operations** forces, **military advisers**, **local proxies**,
and clandestine **intelligence missions**]{.underline}.

It mattered little that over eight years of the Obama
administration---from [Libya to the West African Sahel to the Horn of
East Africa]{.underline}---[the war on terror proved]{.underline}, at
best, [problematic]{.underline} indeed, and even worse in the Trump
years. There remains a worrisome possibility that the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} posse might [prove **[amenable]{.mark}**
yet again [to]{.mark} the [**alarmism** of]{.mark} US Africa Command
(**[AFRICOM]{.mark}**)]{.underline} [about the rebirth of ISIS and the
spread of other Al Qaeda--inked groups there, bolstered by
**fear-mongering nonsense** masquerading as sophisticated
scholarship]{.underline} from West Point's Combating Terrorism Center,
and the Pentagon's perennial promises of low-investment, low-risk, and
high-reward opportunities on the continent. So, a [savvy
betting]{.underline} man might [place chips on a Biden
**[escalat]{.mark}ion** [in]{.mark} West Africa's [**Sahel** and]{.mark}
the **[Horn of East Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even if for different
reasons.

American [Special Forces and military advisors have been in and out
of]{.underline} the remote borderlands between [Mali]{.underline} and
[Niger]{.underline} since at least 2004 and these days seem there to
stay. The French seized and suppressed sections of the Sahel region
beginning in 1892, and, despite granting nominal independence to those
countries in 1960, were back by 2013 and have been [stuck in their own
**forever wars** there]{.underline} ever [since]{.underline}. [American
**War on Terror**]{.underline}(izing) and French neocolonizing have only
inflamed regional resistance movements, increased violence, and lent
local grievances an Islamist resonance. Recently, France's lead role
there has truly begun to disintegrate---with five of its troops killed
in just the first few days of 2021 and allegations that it had bombed
another wedding party. (Already such a War on Terror cliché!)

[Don't be surprised if]{.underline} French President Emmanuel [Macron
asks for help and Biden agrees to bail him out]{.underline}. Despite
their obvious age gap, Joe and Emmanuel could prove the newest and best
of chums. (What's a few hundred extra troops between friends?)

Especially since Obama-era Secretary of State Hillary [Clinton
and]{.underline} her then-favored errand boy, incoming national security
adviser Jake [Sullivan]{.underline}, could be said to have
[founded]{.underline} the current [coalition of jihadis in Mali and
Niger]{.underline}. That's because [when the two of them championed a
heavy-handed **regime-change intervention**]{.underline} against Libyan
autocrat Moammar El-Gadhafi in 2011, thousands of his Tuareg fighters
blew back into that region in a big way with more than just the clothes
on their backs. They streamed from post-Gadhafi Libya into their Sahel
homelands loaded with arms and anger. It's no accident, in other words,
that [Mali's latest round of insurgency kicked off in 2012]{.underline}.
Now, [Sullivan might **push** new boss **Biden** to attempt to **clean
up** his old **mess**]{.underline}.

On the other side of the continent, [in Somalia]{.underline}, where
Trump began an eleventh-hour withdrawal of a long-failing and aimless US
troop presence (sending most of those soldiers to neighboring
countries), there's a real risk that [Biden could **double-down** in the
region, adding **soldiers**, **special operators**, and
**drones**]{.underline}. After all, if Trump was against it, even after
exponentially increasing bombing in the area, then any good Democrat
should be for it, especially since the [Pentagon has]{.underline}, for
some time now, [been banging the drum about Somalia's al-Shabaab
Islamist outfit being the biggest threat to the homeland]{.underline}.

However, [the real selling point for Biden might be the fantasy that
**Russia** and **China** are flooding into the region.]{.underline} Ever
since the 2018 National Defense Strategy decisively shifted the
Pentagon's focus from counterterrorism wars to "great power
competition," or GPC, [**AFRICOM** has **opportunistically altered** its
own campaign plan to align with the new threat of the moment, honing in
on Russian and Chinese influence in the Horn region]{.underline}. As a
result, [**[AFRICOM'S]{.mark}** **come-back-to-the-Horn [pitch]{.mark}**
could [prove]{.mark} a [relatively **easy** ]{.mark}**Biden
[sell]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

TOUGHNESS TRAPS: POKING RUSSIAN BEARS, RAMMING CHINESE (SEA) DRAGONS

With that new GPC national security obsession likely to be one Trump-era
policy that remains firmly in place, however ill-advised it may be,
perhaps [the [biggest **Biden risk** is]{.mark} the possibility of
**[stoking up]{.mark}** a "new," **two-theater**, 21st century version
of the **Cold War**]{.underline} (with the possibility that, at any
moment, it could turn into a hot one). After making everything all about
Russia in the Trump years, the [ascendant Democrats might just feel
obliged to follow through and **escalate [tensions]{.mark}** [with
**Moscow**]{.mark}]{.underline} that Trump himself already brought
[[to]{.mark} the brink (of **[nuclear
catastrophe]{.mark}**)]{.underline}. Here, too, personnel may prove a
key policy-driver.

Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Anthony [[**Blinken**, is
a]{.mark} resident **[Russia hawk]{.mark}** and]{.underline} was an
[early "arm Ukraine" enthusiast.]{.underline} Jake
**[[Sullivan]{.underline}]{.mark}** already [has a tendency to [make
**mountains** out of **molehills**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the subject,
as when he described a minor road-rage incident as constituting "a
Russian force in Syria aggressively attack\[ing\] an American force and
actually injur\[ing\] American service members." Then there's the
troubling signal of Victoria **[[Nuland]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
recent nominee for undersecretary of state for political affairs, a pick
that itself [should be considered a **road-rage-style provocation**.
Nuland [has]{.mark} a [history of]{.mark} **hawkish
[antagonism]{.mark}** toward Moscow and]{.underline} is reportedly
[despised by]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline}. Her [confirmation will]{.underline} surely [[serve
as]{.mark} a **[conflict accelerant]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, [**[China]{.mark}** may be the **[lead
antagonist]{.mark}** in the Biden crew's race to **risk** a **foolhardy
cataclysm**]{.underline}. Throughout the election campaign, [the new
president seemed set on **out-hawking Trump** in the Western Pacific,
explicitly writing about "**getting tough**" on **China**]{.underline}
in a March 2020 piece he penned in Foreign Affairs. [Joe]{.underline}
had also previously [called Chinese President Xi Jinping "a
thug."]{.underline} And while Michèle Flournoy may (mercifully) have
been passed over for secretary of defense, her [**aggressive posture**
toward **Beijing** still infuses the thinking of]{.underline} her fellow
Obama alums on [Biden's team.]{.underline}

As TomDispatch regular Andrew Bacevich pointed out last September, a
Flournoy Foreign Affairs article [illuminated the sort of
**absurdity**]{.underline} she (along with assumedly various [Biden
appointees]{.underline}) [thinks **necessary** to effectively **deter
China**]{.underline}. She called for "enhancing U.S. military
capabilities so that the United States can credibly threaten to sink all
of China's military vessels, submarines, and merchant ships in the South
China Sea within 72 hours." Consider that [Dr. Strangelove-style
strategizing retooled for an **inbound** **urbane** **imperial
presidency**]{.underline}.

ENDGAME: WAR AS ABSTRACTION

Historically, [foreign-policy paradigm **shifts** are **exceedingly
rare**]{.underline}, especially when they tack toward peace. Such
[pivots appear]{.underline} almost [impossible once the immense power of
America's **military-industrial complex**, invested in every way in
endless war]{.underline}, as well as endless preparations for future
Cold Wars, [has reached today's grotesque level]{.underline}. This is
especially so when each and every one of [[Biden's]{.mark} archetypal
national security [nominees has]{.mark}]{.underline}, metaphorically
speaking, had [his or her [mortgage paid by]{.mark} some **offshoot** of
that **[war industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, as the
muckraking novelist Upton Sinclair used to say, "It is difficult to get
a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not
understanding it!"

Count on tactics including drones, commandos, CIA spooks, and a mostly
amenable media to help the Biden administration make war yet more
invisible---at least to Americans. Most Trump-detesting and domestically
focused citizens will find that just dandy, even if exhausted troopers,
military families, and bombed or blockaded foreigners won't. More than
anything, Biden wishes to avoid overseas embarrassments like unexpected
American casualties or scandalous volumes of foreign civilian
deaths---anything, that is, that might derail his domestic agenda or
hoped-for restorative leadership legacy.

That, unfortunately, may prove to be a pipe dream and leads me to two
final predictions: Formulaic forever war will never cease boomeranging
back home to rot our republican institutions, and neither a celestial
God nor secular History will judge Biden the war president kindly.

B. Nuclear Nightmares Two and Three: Rogue President, and Precipitous
President

The current nuclear command and control system may be the best that can
be crafted to deal with the classic [**[nuclear]{.mark} nightmare** of
[launch]{.mark} in the face of [imminent]{.mark} or initiated adversary
attack]{.underline}. That risk [is resurgent [thanks to]{.mark} the
advancing **nuclear capabilities** of **[Russia]{.mark}**,
**[China]{.mark}**, and **[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea, and their
long-term trajectories of increasingly **confrontational relations**
with the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. 43[The
inherited system, however, [creates]{.mark} **serious [hazards]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the [hands of]{.mark} a **President** **intent** on **first
use** of **nuclear weapons** where **adversary attack** is not
**temporally imminent**, and the **necessity** and otherwise
**legality** of **nuclear use** have not been **established**. One
variant of this nightmare is a]{.underline} [**[Rogue]{.mark}
President** who orders **nuclear use** without evident factual
**predicate** [or]{.mark} **legal basis**. A second]{.underline} related
but distinct [risk]{.underline} - one where there is no imminent threat
of adversary nuclear attack - [is that of a **[Precipitous
President]{.mark}**.]{.underline} That is, [a Commander in Chief who
[**resorts** to **nuclear weapons**]{.mark} where a **crisis** or
**conventional conflict** is **underway** and U.S. nuclear use at some
point might be necessary and legal, but nuclear use\'s **implications**,
**legality**, or **alternatives** have not yet been **carefully
evaluated**]{.underline}. A Precipitous President is [an **[impulsive
leader]{.mark}** who [reaches for \"**the button**\" **too
quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The President would be able to rely neither on **international law**
nor on Article II **constitutional authority** for a **non-necessary**
**use of force**. Use of force is **illegal** if it is unnecessary, and
under U.S. law any use of force rising to the level of \"war\" (which
any **[nuclear strike]{.mark}** **certainly** would due to its
**effects** or **escalation risk**) that is **not a response** to an
**armed attack** would [require]{.mark} **congressional
[authorization]{.mark}**.]{.underline} 44Even where the United States is
involved in an armed conflict that is authorized under international and
U.S. law, [particular uses of force are still illegal if they do not
comply with the international **l**aw **o**f **a**rmed **c**onflict
(**LOAC**) and its **jus in bello principles** of **necessity**,
**distinction**, **proportionality**, and **humanity**]{.underline}.
Compliance with LOAC requires careful analysis of intelligence and
tailoring of the use of force in terms of target selection, choice of
weapon, angle of attack, and other respects, a process that involves
military personnel, lawyers, and sometimes national leadership.
45Ensuring the [[**lawfulness** of **nuclear operations** is]{.mark}
especially **[challenging]{.mark}** because the effects of nuclear
weapons are so powerful (including **heat**, **blast**, and **prompt
radiation**) and **hard to contain** (especially **radioactive fallout**
and computer-destroying electromagnetic pulse (**EMP**))]{.underline}.
46[The inherited [nuclear]{.mark} command and control [system]{.mark}
**structurally [anticipates]{.mark}** that [presidential]{.mark} nuclear
[orders will be **legal**]{.mark}, however, [and the **President** will
**never misuse**]{.mark} the nation\'s **nuclear loaded
weapons**.]{.underline}

As Professor and former NSC legal advisor James E. Baker observes,
presidents get the process they choose \"within the constitutional and
statutory framework of decision-making.\" 47The Constitution and statute
provide a general chain of command. 48However, there is no statute or
publicly known executive order governing nuclear launch specifically.
49In a legitimate crisis the President may be content to consult the
anticipated line-up of threat conference civilian and military leaders.
The President could additionally involve other civilian officials, the
Attorney General, or other lawyers. Or, [an **[impulsive
President]{.mark}** could [open the **nuclear football**]{.mark} and
[give]{.mark} an [order **without consulting**]{.mark}
anyone]{.underline}. 50As senators worried at the recent congressional
hearing, the President could awaken senior civilian and military
officials with a strike order, rather than their waking the President
with a threat warning. 51

Senior officials have only bad options in the face of a Rogue President
or Precipitous President. [There is **[no]{.mark} legal [rule]{.mark}**
[or]{.mark} known **[framework of norms]{.mark}** to apply short of
**asking** whether a **strike order** is **illegal** under LOAC, and how
that body of law is **interpreted** and **applied** by the United
States.]{.underline} General Kehler testified that \"the military does
not \[unwittingly\] ~~blindly~~ follow orders\" and executes only legal
orders. 52Here, [an impulsive presidential launch order might fall into
a **[worrisome]{.mark} grey [zone]{.mark}**[: **ambiguously
legal**]{.mark}, **potentially [illegal]{.mark}** [if **carefully
analyzed**]{.mark}, but in the moment perhaps **not \"clearly
illegal\"** or **\"manifestly unlawful.\"**]{.underline} 53Yet whether
the President\'s order is legally ambiguous or clearly illegal, the
complete list of recourses for the Secretary of Defense, the Commander
of the U.S. Strategic Command, or subordinates in the chain of command
is short. Their only options at that point would be verbal dissuasion of
the President, refusal, or resignation. If the President persisted,
General Kehler testified that \"I do not know exactly\" what happens. 54

While those in the chain of command would benefit from time to consult
lawyers and analyze the legal issues and intelligence, the President in
contrast could relieve an objecting official immediately. If an official
tried to continue in office despite dismissal, the official could rely
only on their knowledge of the nuclear command and control system and on
their own power of persuasion with other personnel in a desperate,
insubordinate attempt to thwart transmission of the President\'s order
to the field. [With **nuclear war** and countless lives in the
**balance**,]{.underline} a rogue secretary or relieved general or
admiral would bureaucratically battle a Rogue President or Precipitous
President. [The **nation** and **world** could [get to this
**nightmarish point**]{.mark} **stunningly fast**]{.underline}. 55

[The only options remaining would be **complicated**, **fraught
processes**]{.underline} provided by the Constitution: [removal of the
President]{.underline} by the Cabinet under the Constitution\'s 25th
Amendment, or by Congress via impeachment by the House and trial and
then conviction by the Senate. 56These [processes involve a large number
of officials who are typically **scattered** across the capital or
country (or world) at any given moment, surely a considerable amount of
informal **process** and **politicking** behind the scenes, and multiple
formal process steps. Both removal efforts could be **contested** by the
President and their most loyal **aides** and **partisans**.]{.underline}
57Accordingly, these [removal processes could be expected to take at the
very least many hours. Removal could also take days, weeks, or months.
In contrast, a [**nuclear launch** order can be **executed** in
**minutes**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Constitution\'s **solutions** for
removing a Rogue or Precipitous President are]{.underline}, for this
reason, probably best thought of in the nuclear context as **[ex post
processes]{.underline}** - as first steps along a long road of
correction and national reflection on an atomic atrocity. [The
[President]{.mark} can [push \"**the button**\" **faster** than]{.mark}
Executive or Legislative Branch [officials can]{.mark}
**constitutionally [oust]{.mark}** the Commander in Chief]{.underline}.

INTRODUCTION

In February 2020, the [Senate passed a **resolution** calling for an end
to escalating military hostilities against Iran without congressional
authorization]{.underline}. 1A month later, the House of Representatives
passed the resolution as well, 2but in May 2020, [the resolution landed
on President Donald Trump\'s desk, where it was **vetoed**]{.underline}.
3The day after, [Congress attempted to **override the veto** but
**lacked** the necessary **two-thirds majority**]{.underline}. 4With
only a handful of Republicans breaking ranks in both the House and
Senate to vote for the resolution, [it amounted to no more than a
\"**legal slap** on the **wrist**\"]{.underline} 5for the Trump
Administration.

Congress pushed for this resolution in response to the Trump
Administration\'s series of strikes against Iran in late 2019 and the
January 2, 2020, strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani.
House Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel argued on the House floor
that legislation curtailing President Trump\'s actions against Iran was
necessary, and that \"[Congress\'s powers are **not as narrow** as the
administration would like us to believe]{.underline}.\" 6

These steps that Congress took are significant. [A provision of the
**[W]{.mark}**ar **[P]{.mark}**owers
**[R]{.mark}**esolution]{.underline} of 1973 (**[WPR]{.underline}**)
[[allows **Congress**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **direct** the **President**
to **remove** U.S. **armed forces** from
\"**hostilities**,\"]{.underline} 7and [the Iran resolution marks only
the **second time** in history that measures **invoking the WPR** to
**[limit]{.mark}** the **[President\'s authority]{.mark}** to **use
force** have passed both the **House** and **Senate**. The first
instance occurred in April 2019]{.underline}, only a year prior, [when
the House and Senate **passed resolutions** calling for an **end to U.S.
support** for the **Saudi-led coalition** in **Yemen\'s** bloody **civil
war**]{.underline}. 8[U.S. involvement at the time had included **arms
sales**,]{.underline} 9**[military advisers]{.underline}**,
**[intelligence]{.underline}**, and **[midair refueling]{.underline}**
of Saudi aircraft. 10The [Trump]{.underline} Administration,
[maintaining that U.S. troops were not involved in \"**hostilities**\"
in Yemen, argued that the WPR **did not require** the **withdrawal** of
troops]{.underline}. 11Ultimately, [**Congress** was **unable** to
**muster two-thirds majority** support, and the **resolution died**
after Trump\'s veto]{.underline}. 12

[Congress\'s actions over Iran and Yemen represent an **attempt** to
**[reassert]{.mark}** its **constitutional [authority]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} **U.S. [military]{.mark} action**.]{.underline}
Importantly, [these steps demonstrate that [Congress \"is]{.mark} both
[**able** and **willing**]{.mark} to take on the responsibility of
articulating approaches to **foreign policy** **independent** of the
**exec**utive branch]{.underline}.\" 13Despite the fact that the Obama
Administration initiated U.S. involvement in Yemen without congressional
authorization, [Congress\'s recent actions attempt [to
**rebalance**]{.mark} constitutional [**war powers** and **engage**
in]{.mark} **meaningful [oversight]{.mark}** over future **uses of
force**]{.underline}. 14As Stephen Pomper has noted, executive overreach
\"does not mean Congress has to throw in the towel on its rights and
responsibilities.\" 15

Questions of when and how the President can go to war or send U.S. armed
forces abroad are deeply contested, and considerations of the balance of
war powers are especially relevant now at a time when U.S. involvement
in overseas conflicts is once again at the forefront of the national
conversation. Political scientist Edward Corwin once famously observed
that the Constitution is \"an invitation to struggle for the privilege
of directing American foreign policy.\" 16[Under the **Constitution**,
**war powers** are **divided** between the **President** and
**Congress**. The President is Commander in Chief of the armed
forces]{.underline}, 17[and Congress has the power to declare war, among
other related powers.]{.underline} 18The Founders believed that Congress
was primarily responsible for authorizing uses of force, with narrow
exceptions permitting the President to repel sudden armed attacks or
rescue American nationals abroad. 19Over the course of U.S. history,
there have been formal declarations of war across five wars, in addition
to statutory authorizations for the use of force. 20However, since the
time of the founding, [the **[exec]{.mark}utive branch** has **steadily
[interpreted]{.mark}** its **war [powers expansively]{.mark}**, and with
[courts **reluctant** to **adjudicate**]{.mark} any sort of
**tug-of-war-powers** between the **President** and
**Congress**]{.underline}, the law in this area has been heavily based
on historical practice. 21[With a history of \"under-motivated
Congresses and over-reaching presidents,\"]{.underline} 22[the
**conventional adage** is that the **President\'s war powers** have
become essentially **unconstrained**]{.underline}.

This Article joins the ranks of scholarly work arguing that
**[presidential [unilateralism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which [[risks
\"**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** and **aggrandizement**,\"]{.underline}
23is not normatively appealing [and should not remain
unconstrained.]{.underline} It argues that [[Congress]{.mark}
[should]{.mark} seek to **[reassert]{.mark} its role** in **regulating
[war powers]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} order [to produce **better**]{.mark}
**military [policy]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} to act as a **[check]{.mark}**
on the [President]{.mark}\'s **ever-expanding powers**]{.underline}.
Generally, views on war powers have favored either pro-Congress or
pro-executive stances. The pro-Congress school believes that pursuant to
the Article I power to declare war (among other Article I powers), [war
powers should primarily reside with Congress, with the President\'s
unilateral ability to use force limited to narrow
circumstances]{.underline}. 24 This school includes members of Congress;
scholars such as John Hart Ely, Louis Henkin, and Michael Glennon; and,
most notably, President Joseph Biden. 25In contrast, the pro-executive
school, populated by scholars like John Yoo, believes that pursuant to
the Article II Commander in Chief Clause and Vesting Clause, the
Constitution places war powers squarely with the President. 26

This Article contends that the law in this area, informed by historical
practice and [the **statutory language** of the **WPR**, is not fully
without content and **can** in fact **constrain** the
President]{.underline}. However, [the ability of the law to constrain
has been **threatened** by the **[exec]{.mark}utive branch\'s** existing
**practice** of creating **[self-imposed limits]{.mark}** that **[do
not]{.mark}** **meaningfully limit** **presidential
discretion**.]{.underline} 27But based on Congress\'s recent resolutions
invoking the WPR, there seems to be a way forward. After four years of
the Trump Administration\'s eager exercise of executive branch
unilateralism, and with a new administration helmed by President Biden,
who has historically supported pro-Congress war powers reform, 28[there
may be **political will** within Congress to **reexamine** its
**ability** to **check the President**.]{.underline} In particular,
[Congress may be motivated to **strengthen** an **existing constraint**
on the **President**: the **W**ar **P**owers
**R**esolution]{.underline}.

Today, [as the **President\'s war powers** fall under **renewed public
scrutiny**, the WPR has become]{.underline} a **[focal]{.underline}**
point of any discussion on the use of force. 29Passed in 1973 over
President Nixon\'s veto, 30the [WPR represents Congress\'s attempt to
assert its **authority** to **limit** and **oversee** the President\'s
**engagement** of **U.S. forces** in **military operations abroad**.
Despite the **expansion** of **presidential war powers** since its
enactment, and despite **[exec]{.mark}utive** branch
[**interpretations** limit]{.mark}ing its **[statutory reach]{.mark}**,
the WPR \"remains the **key statutory framework** for **regulating** the
**relationship** between the **political branches** with respect to the
use of U.S. armed forces abroad.]{.underline}\" 31For purposes of this
Article, [the WPR\'s **most important** provision for congressional
control is **Section 5(b)**]{.underline}, which [creates a **sixty-day
termination** clock. If the President introduces armed forces into
**hostilities** or imminent hostilities]{.underline}, then [unless
Congress]{.underline} declares war, otherwise [**authorizes** military
action]{.underline} to continue, or extends the period by law, [the
President must **withdraw**]{.underline} the forces within sixty days.
32However, [since the enactment of the WPR, the executive branch has
worked to **[limit]{.mark}** the sixty-day clock\'s
**[applicability]{.mark}** to the President\'s use of force [by
**narrowly interpreting**]{.mark} the meaning of
\"**[hostilities]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline} The current executive branch
standard for what constitutes \"hostilities\" originated from State
Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh\'s 2011 testimony on airstrikes in
Libya, in which he concluded that a military operation limited in
mission, exposure of armed forces, risk of escalation, and military
means does not engage in hostilities as envisioned by the WPR. 33

This Article argues that although the WPR still serves as the best
framework through which Congress can check presidential unilateralism,
[one flaw in the resolution is the **elasticity** of the term
\"**hostilities**,\" which has **allowed** the **executive branch**
[to]{.mark} raise **colorable arguments** that the **WPR\'s withdrawal**
mandate **does [not apply]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a **wide range** of
**military [activities abroad]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This Article
proposes to [**clarify** and **reconceptualize** the term
\"**hostilities**\" under the WPR]{.underline}. It aims to [provide
**clearer standards** of what constitute engagements in \"hostilities,\"
so that Congress can **raise** the **political costs** of presenting
**weak legal justifications** for **deploying** U.S. **armed forces**,
as well as **shape public opinion** when the President\'s actions are
inconsistent with the WPR, which may ultimately **constrain**
presidential **decision-making**.]{.underline}

This Article makes two proposals: First, it argues that
[\"**[hostilities]{.mark}**\" [can]{.mark} still [exist when]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[plays a **[support]{.mark}ing role** in a \"**partner
mission**\"]{.underline}\--a mission at the express invitation of
another state, pursuant to UN authorization, [or with a coalition like
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}\--[and must be reframed to encompass not
only situations where U.S. forces **participate** in **active
exchanges** of fire, but in which they **use** or are **subject** to
**lethal force**.]{.underline} In support of this argument, this Article
clarifies that [while U.S. participation in partner missions is an
indicator that the mission is **narrow in scope**]{.underline}, such
[participation is **not** on its own **sufficient** to show that U.S.
forces have **avoided** engagements in \"**hostilities**.\"]{.underline}

Second, this Article proposes considering the following criteria in
determining whether U.S. armed forces have been introduced into ongoing
(rather than intermittent) hostilities: (1) whether there is a risk of
harm to U.S. forces from exchanges of fire, taking into consideration
the likelihood of sustained violence occurring over an extended period
of time, as indicated by factors like internal rules of engagement; and
(2) whether there is regular use of force by or against U.S. forces,
taking into consideration additional troop deployments. This proposed
[**reconceptualization** of \"hostilities\" is **motivated** by the
**desire** to create **[statutory guidance]{.mark}** that would
**[limit]{.mark} implausible** executive branch [**interpretations**
that **circumvent**]{.mark} congressional **[oversight]{.mark}**, and to
provide **[clarity]{.mark}** in order to allow Congress ways of
**channeling** **political sanctions** and **public opinion** to
**[constrain]{.mark}** presidential **[overreach]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This Article is informed by and expands upon a rich literature proposing
reforms to the WPR, including to the definition of \"hostilities.\"
34Past reform proposals have aimed to strike a balance between providing
the President flexibility in responding to a range of combat situations
and providing guidance on when the President can use force without prior
congressional authorization. This Article offers a novel contribution by
proposing a reconceptualization of \"hostilities\" informed in part by
executive branch practices that have in past instances acted as some
limitation on presidential decision-making. 35Moreover, building off the
balancing act in the literature, [this Article aims to **tip the
balance** away from **presidential discretion** and towards **clearer
standards** on situations that constitute \"**hostilities**\" and
**trigger** the **sixty-day withdrawal** requirement\--standards that
are **required** to **curb** **unauthorized** U.S. **involvement** in
consequential **military operations**.]{.underline}

This Article proceeds in three parts. Part I provides the history of the
division of war powers between Congress and the President and discusses
how the WPR operates. This Part describes how the war power was
initially envisioned and presents the problem of the executive branch\'s
steady accretion of power. Part II argues that the law in this area, and
not solely politics, can serve as a constraint on the President. It
suggests that self-imposed constraints by the executive branch offer no
meaningful limits, and that congressional checks like the WPR must be
fortified. This Part explores the executive branch\'s erosion of the
term \"hostilities\" in the WPR through two examples: the 2011 Libya
operation and the 2020 Soleimani strike. Part III presents two proposals
for reconceptualizing \"hostilities\" within the WPR, demonstrating that
Congress can strike the right balance in curtailing presidential power
while avoiding the pitfall of imposing a \"\'one size fits all\'
straitjacket\" 36on the President\'s decisions to commit armed forces
abroad.

1\. The Rise of Modern Warfare and Its Oversight Challenges

These oversight challenges became particularly apparent in the wake of
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The 9/11 Commission, which was created to
investigate the incident and recommend ways to prevent future attacks,
stressed that executive branch reforms \"will not work if congressional
oversight does not change too. Unity of effort in executive management
can be lost if it is fractured by divided congressional oversight.\"
108Calling oversight \"dysfunctional,\" the Commission recommended
either creating a joint intelligence committee or giving the existing
intelligence committees both authorizing and appropriating authorities.
109In short, the Commission concluded, the outdated committee structure
required reform to address contemporary cross-cutting national security
challenges.

Despite these warnings, the problems the Commission identified only
worsened in the years after 9/11. In particular, the convergence of
Title 10 and Title 50 operations accelerated considerably. The DOD
(whose operations are generally authorized under Title 10) continued to
develop its clandestine capabilities for traditional military
activities, while the CIA (whose operations are generally authorized
under Title 50) acquired new lethal capabilities. 110This convergence
was especially evident with respect to operations carried out by special
forces and drones. After 9/11, Special Operations Forces (SOF) became a
crucial counterterrorism force. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) has
more than doubled in size since 2001 and has commandos deployed to
nearly 150 countries. 111Likewise, lethal drone strikes have become a
central element of the U.S. counterterrorism strategy, with one database
cataloging over 14,000 strikes from 2010 to 2020. 112

[**Security [cooperation]{.mark}** efforts]{.underline}, including
programs to train, equip, and otherwise assist foreign defense and
security forces, have also **[[expanded]{.mark}
significantly]{.underline}** since 9/11. 113Indeed, [security
cooperation formed the foundation of the U.S. counter-ISIS policy in
Iraq and Syria]{.underline}, 114[and the U.S. government spent over **\$
200 billion** on **security assistance** and **security cooperation**
programs from 2006 to 2018.]{.underline} 115In 2017, [Congress
authorized security cooperation funds under Title 10 U.S.C. § 127e to
support special operations to combat terrorism.]{.underline} 116One
Green Beret explained, § 127e programs are \"less, \"We\'re helping
you,\' and more, \"You\'re doing our bidding.\'\" 117In 2017, SOCOM
reportedly expended nearly \$ 80 million to resource twenty-one programs
under the § 127e authority. 118

[As]{.underline} the role of special forces, drones, and [security
cooperation has grown]{.underline}, the [[**oversight gaps** caused
by]{.mark} the **artificial** **[Title 10-Title 50 distinction]{.mark}**
have become **increasingly apparent**]{.underline}. One scholar
explained, \"When the CIA and SOF operate together on the battlefield,
the [legal **distinctions** regarding operating **authorities** and
**procedures**, and **accountability**, can become
**blurred**]{.underline}.\" 119[This can [have **far-reaching
implications**]{.mark} for oversight.]{.underline} 120For example,
lethal operations can be carried out by either the DOD or CIA. 121When
led by the DOD, the operation falls under Title 10 oversight by HASC and
SASC. 122When led by the CIA, even with the same operators, the
operation is typically undertaken as a \"covert action\" and subject to
extensive but highly classified reporting to HPSCI and SSCI under 50
U.S.C. § 3093. 123For example, [the raid that killed Osama bin Laden was
executed by U.S. Navy Seals from Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC)
in the **DOD**]{.underline}. 124[However, it was classified as a Title
50 operation under the]{.underline} \"command\" of the
**[CIA]{.underline}** director. 125[Because it was
considered]{.underline} a CIA [operation, only the Gang of
Eight]{.underline} - which includes [HPSCI and SSCI
leadership]{.underline} as well as the House and Senate leadership -
[was **informed**]{.underline}. The [**armed services** and **foreign
relations committees**, however, were **not**.]{.underline} 126

[Section 127e programs and activities present further oversight
challenges]{.underline}. While § 127e includes reporting requirements,
127these [**[operations]{.mark}** often **[elude]{.mark}** effective
**[oversight]{.mark}**. They are typically **[highly
classified]{.mark}** and **[briefed]{.mark}** only [to]{.mark} a
**[narrow group]{.mark}** of congressional **members** and
**staff**]{.underline}. Former congressional staffer Tommy Ross
explained, \"[**[Policymakers]{.mark}** and congressional staffers [who
work in]{.mark} areas likely to be most affected by 127e operations -
traditional **foreign [assistance]{.mark}** [and **diplomacy**]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}, for example - [are generally **[not
included]{.mark}** among those **briefed** \... . [**limiting
accountability** and]{.mark} profoundly **[challenging]{.mark}** the
government\'s [ability to **plan**, **coordinate**, and
**integrate**]{.mark} **comprehensive [assistance]{.mark}**
packages]{.underline}.\" 128[Even within a **single committee**, only a
**few members** are typically **notified** of sensitive operations, and
staff are sometimes **excluded altogether**.]{.underline} 129

Moreover, [**similar** and sometimes **[overlapping]{.mark} training**
and [**assistance** programs can be operated by]{.mark} the
[CIA]{.mark}, which follows its own distinct reporting
regime.]{.underline} 130For example, the CIA reportedly spent over \$ 1
billion over four years on a [[covert action]{.underline}]{.mark}
program to support Syrian rebels. 131This program reportedly [operated
[alongside]{.mark} an **[overt DOD program]{.mark}** **authorized** and
**overseen by HASC** and **SASC**.]{.underline} 132The [[CIA]{.mark}
programs would have been reported under **Title 50** to **HPSCI** and
**SSCI alone**, even though they may have [**directly overlapped**,
and]{.mark} even [**competed**, with programs authorized by **HASC** and
**SASC**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 133As one former staffer put it in an
interview with us, \"I saw in a couple of cases some of these programs
that were not only duplicative, but competitive. The DOD and CIA were
trying to displace one another from the same landscape.\" 134

Importantly, special operations, drone strikes, and [**[security
cooperation]{.mark}** missions [often **fall outside**]{.mark} of the
**oversight [jurisdiction]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} HFAC and SFRC under the
[WPR]{.mark}.]{.underline} As discussed in Part I, 135[the executive
branch has often **narrowly defined** \"**[hostilities]{.mark}**\" in
the **WPR** to [require]{.mark} \"the [**presence** of]{.mark} U.S.
**[ground troops]{.mark}**, U.S. **casualties** or a **serious threat**
thereof.\"]{.underline} 136[This definition \"allows the President to
escape the WPR whenever drones are relied upon - regardless of the
extent of a military campaign involving **drones**.\"]{.underline}
137[Under this **contested interpretation** of **hostilities**, the
**executive** branch is [**not obligated** to **report**]{.mark}
**special forces** [operations]{.mark}, including **kill/capture**
missions, [to **Congress**]{.mark} under the **WPR**.]{.underline}
138This interpretation has largely kept HFAC and SFRC in the dark on the
vast majority of counterterrorism operations.

#### Statutory elasticity of WPR's hostilities limit [enables executive overreach]{.underline} through [narrow interpretations]{.underline} that avoid [authorization]{.underline} AND [oversight]{.underline} requirements

By Erica H. **Ma 21**, J.D., 2020, New York University School of Law;
B.A., 2015, University of Pennsylvania, \"Article: The War Powers
Resolution and the Concept of Hostilities,\" Northeastern University Law
Review, 13, 519, pp. 549-552, May 2021, Lexis, nihara

C. The War Powers Resolution Framework and the Narrowing of
\"Hostilities\"

While [the **[WPR]{.mark}**, as a **congressional check** on executive
**war powers**, remains an **important limit** on the President, one
**particular [flaw]{.mark}** of the **resolution** [is]{.mark} the
[**elasticity** of]{.mark} the **term**
\"**[hostilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Under the resolution, only
the introduction of U.S. armed forces into hostilities or imminent
hostilities triggers the resolution\'s sixty-day termination clock.
159But [\"hostilities\" [lacks **hard
definitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which means that
[**[Presidents]{.mark}** have [**interpreted** the **term** to **avoid**
]{.mark}**triggering** any **congressional [oversight]{.mark}** under
the resolution. The consequence is that unless Congress can **muster the
votes** to **override** a **presidential veto** of a **resolution**
directing the President to **terminate** the **use of force** abroad,
[Congress]{.mark} \"may be [**unable** to stop]{.mark} military
[engagement]{.mark} abroad]{.underline} once it has begun [using
the]{.underline} mechanism of the [WPR]{.underline} alone, [so long as
the **president believes** that the military engagement in question
**does not constitute \'hostilities**.\'\"]{.underline} 160

The [legislative history of the WPR reveals that the [**ambiguity**
in]{.mark} the meaning of \"[**hostilities**\" was]{.mark}
**[intentional]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Senator Jacob Javits, one of the
resolution\'s principal sponsors, noted that the drafters intended the
resolution \"[[to]{.mark} proceed in the kind of language which
**[accepts]{.mark}** a [**whole body** of **experience** and
**precedent**]{.mark} without **endeavoring specifically** to define
it.]{.underline}\" 161But the term was still intended to be broad. The
accompanying House report used the term \"hostilities\" instead of
\"armed conflict\" because the former was considered broader in scope,
as \"hostilities\" encompassed situations of \"clear and present danger
of armed conflict.\" 162

However, [the [**meaning** of \"**hostilities**]{.mark}\" under the WPR
[has been **contested**]{.mark} over the years]{.underline}. 163Harold
Koh, as Legal Adviser to the State Department in the Obama
Administration, argued that \"the question whether a particular set of
facts constitutes \'hostilities\' for purposes of the Resolution has
been determined more by interbranch practice than by a narrow parsing of
dictionary definitions.\" 164This [**[interbranch practice]{.mark}**,
however, like in other areas of war powers, has **[consisted]{.mark}
primarily** [of]{.mark} the **[exec]{.mark}**utive branch\'s
**assertions** of its [**interpretation** of
\"**hostilities**]{.mark}.]{.underline}\" Since the passage of the WPR,
successive administrations have deviated from and narrowed Congress\'s
conception of \"hostilities.\" In 1975, the Ford Administration defined
\"hostilities\" as situations \"in which units of the U.S. armed forces
are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile
forces.\" 165A 1980 OLC opinion noted that the term \"should not be read
necessarily to include sporadic military or paramilitary attacks on our
armed forces.\" 166In August of 1981, following an attack by two Libyan
jet fighters on U.S. naval forces in the Gulf of Sidra, U.S. forces
fired back and downed the Libyan aircraft. 167The Reagan Administration
determined that this situation did not rise to the level of
\"hostilities\" under the WPR\--and thus did not trigger the
resolution\'s countdown clock\--because no further action by Libya was
expected. 168Similarly, in June 1984, U.S. aircraft operating in Saudi
airspace assisted Saudi aircraft in shooting down two Iranian aircraft
in the Persian Gulf. 169The extent of U.S. involvement included
providing the Saudis with target location and assisting with aircraft
refueling. 170The Reagan Administration determined that this was a
\"one-time, unanticipated incident\" 171and again argued that this did
not rise to the level of \"hostilities\" within the meaning of the WPR.

[[Even when]{.mark} members of [Congress have **disagreed** with
executive]{.mark} branch **[characterizations]{.mark}** of the meaning
of \"hostilities,\" **Congress** has had **little incentive** to
maintain **sustained pushback** against the President when the term
retains such **flexibility**, and [eventually]{.mark} Congress
**[acquiesces]{.mark}** to the executive branch\'s
interpretation]{.underline}. Political theorist John Rourke notes that
\"\[s\]ometimes the urge to achieve unity is so strong that any degree
of dissent comes under suspicion,\" 172and Congress is especially
sensitive to any public perception of hampering American military
activity. For example, on August 24, 1982, with the United States
participating in a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon,
President Reagan transmitted a forty-eight-hour report detailing this
activity to Congress. 173The report did not specify whether Section
4(a)(1) of the WPR (introduction of armed forces into \"hostilities\" or
\"imminent hostilities\") or another prong had triggered the reporting
requirement. 174By September 1983, with the situation in Lebanon
intensifying, members of Congress publicly announced that they believed
U.S. armed forces were engaged in hostilities and that the sixty-day
clock had begun to run. 175At the time, there were \"1,600 U.S. marines
equipped for combat on a daily basis and roughly 2,000 more on ships and
bases nearby; U.S. marine positions were attacked repeatedly; and four
marines were killed and several dozen wounded in those attacks.\" 176But
any further debate on the meaning of \"hostilities\" was forestalled
when Congress began to consider a resolution authorizing retention of
U.S. armed forces in Lebanon, 177ultimately granting authority for the
mission in Lebanon to continue. 178As the next Section explains through
two examples, the term \"[[hostilities]{.mark}\" has been **[narrowly
interpreted]{.mark}** by the **exec**utive branch in order [to
use]{.mark} **unauthorized [force]{.mark}** [in **situations**]{.mark}
in [which]{.mark} the **drafters** of the [**WPR** would have
**intended**]{.mark} the [**President** to seek]{.mark} **congressional
[authorization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Reconceptualizing "[hostilities]{.underline}" is key -- raises [political costs]{.underline} and sets [clear threshold]{.underline} for [violations]{.underline} of the WPR -- executive "norm internalization" does NOT solve -- NO [textual guidance]{.underline} causes [overreach]{.underline}

This Article supports the view that [the **[law]{.mark}** can
**[constrain]{.mark}** the President\'s **[war
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} and argues that some mechanisms of legal
constraint work better than others in limiting these powers. In
considering Bradley and Morrison\'s mechanisms of constraint in
[**[reconceptualizing]{.mark}** the meaning of
\"**[hostilities]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline} this Article argues that the
second and third of these mechanisms\--external sanctions and public
legal dialogue\--[**[operate]{.mark}** most **[effectively]{.mark}** in
**[limiting]{.mark} presidential [discretion]{.mark}** on **war
powers**]{.underline}. By [proposing a **definition** to provide
**clearer standards** of what **constitutes** an **introduction** of
**U.S. forces** into \"hostilities]{.underline},\" this Article posits
that [Congress can **[raise]{.mark}** the **political [costs]{.mark}**
of the President\'s **precarious legal arguments**, as well as more
clearly **[identify]{.mark}** potential [**violations** of]{.mark} the
**[WPR]{.mark}** to temper executive branch discretion]{.underline}.

As the [**weakest mechanism** for constraining the
President]{.underline} on matters of war powers, **[norm
internalization]{.underline}** is the process by which an actor
internalizes the normative force of a legal rule. 120Bradley and
Morrison argue that OLC is able to internalize legal norms due to its
tradition of adhering to its own precedents across administrations,
which \"give\[s\] it some distance and relative independence from the
immediate political and policy preferences of its clients across the
executive branch.\" 121OLC may not always act as a blank check for the
President, as it \"does not always say yes \[to affirming the
President\'s policies\], and the absence of an OLC opinion in the
President\'s favor likely makes it more difficult for him to pursue that
course of action.\" 122For example, norm internalization may explain the
Bush White House\'s position on a warrantless surveillance program. When
the White House pushed to implement the program despite refusal from the
Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, and head of OLC to certify
the legality of the program unless certain changes were made, these top
officials threatened to resign, resulting in the White House
subsequently making the changes. 123Bradley and Morrison describe this
episode as Justice Department officials\' internationalization of
institutional norms \"that not only takes law seriously as a constraint,
but that insists on a degree of independence in determining what the law
requires.\" 124

However, as the next Section details, [[norm internalization **does
not**]{.mark} **truly [constrain]{.mark}** the President\'s **expanding
[war powers]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is perhaps [due to the
confluence of several factors: **[little]{.mark} textual
[guidance]{.mark}** from the **Constitution** on the **division** of
**war powers** [and]{.mark} a **subject matter** (**national security**)
with [**incentive** for the **President** to **overreach**]{.mark} and
**Congress** to **abdicate decision-making** to the
**President**]{.underline}. 125[A **dearth** of **textual guidance** on
**war powers**]{.underline} from the Constitution [resulted
in]{.underline} OLC and other [executive]{.underline} branch officials
[having an **outsized role** in **developing norms**]{.underline} in
this area in the first instance, 126and [**[Congress]{.mark}** has been
[**reluctant** to **exert**]{.mark} its **institutional [power]{.mark}**
[to **challenge**]{.mark} the **[President]{.mark}** on questions
**fraught** with **political consequences**]{.underline}. 127While these
norms may on the surface seem to constrain presidential
decisionmaking\--for example, OLC advises the President to follow the
law\--the [\"**[law]{.mark}**\" here [is]{.mark} the [**result**
of]{.mark} the **[executive]{.mark}** branch\'s own
**[interpretations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 128Successive presidential
administrations have been [consistently **resolute** in their
understandings [of]{.mark} the meaning of \"**[hostilities]{.mark}**\"
in the WPR, resulting in the **entrenchment** of **executive** branch
**interpretations** of the law]{.underline}. 129For example, in the 2011
Libya operation, the administration relied on its own interpretation of
\"hostilities\" to argue that it had no obligation to withdraw troops
after sixty days. 130As this episode illustrates, [war powers
[reform]{.mark} **[cannot rely]{.mark} solely** [on
**executive**]{.mark} branch **norm [internalization]{.mark}** to
produce **checks** on **presidential discretion**]{.underline}.

Instead, [imposing **external [sanctions]{.mark}** for **violations** of
norms [would be **more effective**]{.mark} for bringing the **law** to
**bear** on the **President**.]{.underline} According to Bradley and
Morrison, [**external sanctions** that constrain the President\'s
actions do not have to be formal and can even [**exert pressure**
through]{.mark} the **[political process]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
131[**Accusations** of **illegal conduct** could \"**enable** the
President\'s congressional opponents to [impose]{.mark} even **greater
[costs]{.mark}** on him through a variety of means, ranging from
**oversight** hearings to, in the extreme case, threats of
**impeachment**.\"]{.underline} 132The opposition party in Congress can
attempt to impose these political costs by criticizing unilateral
presidential authorizations of force in the media. As legal theorists
like Fred Schauer have suggested, \"law violation increases the
political penalty for those official actions that are or turn out to be
unacceptable on policy or political grounds.\" 133[External sanctions
work [as a]{.mark} **legal [constraint]{.mark}** [when]{.mark} the
[costs of **non-compliance**]{.mark} with a **norm**
**[outweigh]{.mark}** the **[benefits]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In some
instances, [partisan **politics** often exert the most **pressure**,
with Congress\'s \"**institutional checks** . . . operat\[ing\]
[to]{.mark} facilitate the **[constrain]{.mark}ing effect** of
[law]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} 134External sanctions on norm violations,
which can include \"\[c\]riminal trials . . . lawyer scrutiny, reporting
requirements, inspector general and congressional investigations,
Accountability Board proceedings, prosecutorial and ethics
investigations, civil trials, FOIA processing and disclosures, public
criticism and calumny, and elections\" can all impose \"various forms of
psychological, professional, reputational, financial, and political
costs on those held accountable.\" 135

#### Historical practice [shapes norms]{.underline} governing [war powers]{.underline} -- Congressional reluctance AND executive [overreach]{.underline} results in a [lack]{.underline} of [meaningful legal checks]{.underline} -- public opinion OR political calculus is [NOT sufficient]{.underline}

A. How the Law Constrains

This Section argues that law can constrain the President\'s discretion
in authorizing uses of force, a view supported by Curtis Bradley and
Trevor Morrison, among others. 102[With **limited guidance** on the
**scope** of the President\'s and Congress\'s **war powers** in the text
of the Constitution, the development of the law in this area has been
dictated by the push and pull of **historical practice**.]{.underline}
This kind of [law, informed by historical practice, can serve as a
constraint on presidential powers]{.underline}. Justice Frankfurter
famously observed in Youngstown that [**[historical practice]{.mark}**
is part of the **[interpret]{.mark}ation** of **[presidential
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, 103and other scholars have similarly
noted that [it is \"the \'court of history,\' an **accretion** of
**interactions** among the **branches**, that [**gives rise** to]{.mark}
**basic [norms]{.mark}** [governing]{.mark} the **branches\'
[behavior]{.mark}** in the **area**]{.underline}.\" 104 However, [the
historical practice has been **one-sided**: Congress has often been
**reluctant** to **push back** on the President\'s **expanding
powers**]{.underline}, 105and [**courts** have been **reluctant** to
**resolve war powers disputes** between the **political
branches**]{.underline}, meaning that [it is the historical practice of
the **[executive]{.mark}** that has **[predominantly shaped]{.mark}**
the law of **[war powers]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

One perhaps cynical view is that the President\'s war powers have been
shaped solely by the political process. 106Scholars often lament the
[**[lack]{.mark}** of **genuine legal [limits]{.mark}** on the President
and]{.underline} the fact that [[even]{.mark} **supposedly
[politically-insulated]{.mark}** [offices]{.mark} like OLC **[offer no
meaningful checks]{.mark}** on presidential policymaking]{.underline},
as evidenced by the Bush-era OLC\'s torture memos. 107The [[**absence**
of]{.mark} **judicial [review]{.mark}** in this area certainly makes it
easier to throw our hands up and say that the **law fails to
constrain**]{.underline}. In fact, Bruce Ackerman warns that \"politics
and communications,\" \"bureaucratic and military organization,\" and
\"executive constitutionalism\" [[risk turning]{.mark} the role of
Commander in Chief [into]{.mark} \"a [vehicle for]{.mark} **demagogic
[populism]{.mark}** [and **lawlessness**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}
108Other scholars like Eric Posner and Adrian Vermeule argue that
[whatever constraints the President faces are **purely non-legal**, and
that it is \"[**politics** and **public opinion**]{.mark},\" rather than
law, that check the President.]{.underline} 109They contend that [any
factors that ostensibly constrain presidential action lack status as
norms, [result]{.mark}ing [in **weak \"normative justification**]{.mark}
for \[their\] **continued existence** if **political** or other
**extralegal factors** pull in a different direction.\"]{.underline}
110In part, this kind of skepticism of \"practice-based\" law originates
from \"post-Watergate cynicism about the behavior of government
officials, including the extent to which they are likely to act based on
internalized norms\" 111\--a cynicism [**exacerbated** in the last few
years by the **Trump** Administration\'s **disregard** for such
**norms**.]{.underline} 112

In contrast, Bradley and Morrison note that \"[the interrelationship of
law and politics **[does not]{.mark}** by itself **[negate]{.mark}** the
**[importance of law]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" and term the historical
gloss in this area \"practice-based constitutional law.\"
113Practice-based law may constrain the President\'s actions simply
through a recognition that [law is necessary to justify policy decisions
and through public discourse on presidential power framed in legal
terms.]{.underline} 114As Bradley and Morrison argue, the [**law** acts
as a **constraint** \"[when it]{.mark} **[exerts]{.mark}** some
[**force** on **decisionmaking**]{.mark} because of its **status as
law**.\"]{.underline} 115Moreover, the executive branch\'s justification
of policy decisions in legal terms \"might be puzzling if the law were
not playing any constraining role.\" 116Specifically, Bradley and
Morrison describe three mechanisms of legal constraint: norm
internalization by executive branch actors, external sanctions for
violations of norms, and the existence of public dialogue on the
President\'s authority, framed in legal terms. 117While it is possible
to determine instances of genuine, reasonable disagreement about the
content of the law, 118any accusations, by Congress or the public, that
the President is acting outside of constitutional or statutory bounds on
questions of war powers is \"virtually always contested\" by executive
branch actors. 119

#### [Reconceptualizing hostilities]{.underline} and [clarifying]{.underline} its [scope]{.underline} via [expansion]{.underline} is key to Congressional [oversight]{.underline} that checks [military adventurism]{.underline}

By Erica H. **Ma 21**, J.D., 2020, New York University School of Law;
B.A., 2015, University of Pennsylvania, \"Article: The War Powers
Resolution and the Concept of Hostilities,\" Northeastern University Law
Review, 13, 519, pp. 558-560, May 2021, Lexis, nihara

A. The Importance of New Definitions

[As the **key framework** for **regulating** the **balance of war
powers** between Congress and the President, the **WPR** serves as a
**source of constraint** on the President. Yet the **lack** of **clear
parameters** of what constitutes \"**hostilities**\"]{.underline} under
the resolution [has allowed the executive branch to put forth its own
concept of \"hostilities\" that **impedes** Congress\'s **involvement**
in **regulating** presidential **uses of force**. **Clarifying** and
**reconceptualizing** \"hostilities\" under the WPR is **crucial** for
\"rejuvenat\[ing\] the resolution as a more effective institutional
constraint.\"]{.underline} 217

Rethinking \"hostilities\" is important for several reasons. First, [the
term\'s **ambiguity** remains a **key gap** in the text of the
resolution. A **lack of clarity** has led to **several instances** of
**public disagreement** between the President and Congress about whether
the President introduced U.S. armed forces into situations of active or
imminent hostilities.]{.underline} 218When the WPR was first drafted,
the exact meaning of \"hostilities\" was not contested\--[**Congress
intended** for the definition of \"hostilities\" to be **flexible** in
order to allow the President to respond to a range of situations into
which U.S. armed forces could be introduced]{.underline}. 219But [the
original intent of Congress was **not** for the term to be
**interpreted** as **narrowly** as the executive branch **currently
interprets** it,]{.underline} as part of the reason for the original
passage of the WPR was the Nixon Administration\'s bombing of Cambodia.
220Although those airstrikes did not involve \"\'sustained fighting or
active exchanges of fire with hostile forces,\' the presence of U.S.
ground troops, or substantial U.S. casualties,\" the operation still
engaged in the kind of hostilities the drafters of the WPR envisioned
that Congress would have a role in authorizing. 221

However, since the passage of the resolution in 1973, [Congress and the
President have developed **opposing definitions** of the term
\"hostilities.\"]{.underline} 222Successive [Presidents have taken a
**narrow view** of the kinds of activity that constitute hostilities in
order to **avoid triggering** the **WPR**\'s sixty-day withdrawal
mandate]{.underline}, 223engaging in a wide range of military
activity\--often past the sixty (or ninety) day mark\--[without labeling
these activities as \"**hostilities**.\"]{.underline} 224These include
operations in Lebanon in 1982-83, the 1983 invasion of Grenada, the 1986
Gulf of Sidra incident, the April 1986 bombing of Libya, the 1987-88
Persian Gulf Tanker War, and the 1989 invasion of Panama. 225More
recently, the Obama Administration claimed that the 2011 Libya
airstrikes did not constitute \"hostilities\" under the WPR despite the
existence of \"a naval force of 11 ships and engage\[ment\] in an
extensive bombing campaign that included striking 100 targets in just 24
hours.\" 226In contrast, [members of Congress have put forth a broader
view of what constitutes \"hostilities.\"]{.underline} For instance, the
April 2019 House resolution invoking the WPR to withdraw U.S.
participation in Yemen\'s civil war defined \"hostilities\" as the House
understood it. 227The resolution noted that the term \"[includes
in-flight refueling of non-United States aircraft conducting missions as
part of the ongoing civil war in Yemen]{.underline},\" and found that
\"\[s\]ince March 2015, members of the United States Armed Forces have
been introduced into hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the
Houthis, including providing to the [Saudi-led coalition aerial
targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial
refueling]{.underline}.\" 228If Congress wishes for its conception of
\"hostilities\" to [**serve** as the **standard** and act as a
**constraint** on the **President**]{.underline}, it would be worth
redefining the term as it exists in the WPR.

Second, [**redefining** \"hostilities\" is **important** in order to
**realign** the modern practice of presidential **war powers** with the
**original intent** of the resolution]{.underline}, which was [to ensure
that **Congress** had a **role** in regulating **decisions** to commit
U.S. **armed forces abroad**.]{.underline} 229[Placing more **oversight
power** with Congress, a larger deliberative body, would act as a
**constraint** on **rash decision-making**]{.underline}. 230Reform of
the [WPR]{.underline}, with clearer legislative mandates, would \"[help
to constrain military **adventurism**\"\--Congress is **slower to act**,
**more sensitive** to **costs**, and faces more **procedural
hurdles**]{.underline}. 231Moreover, [congressional oversight may not
simply produce slower decisions, but **better-reasoned
decisions**]{.underline}. In other areas of law, the conventional wisdom
is that [interbranch deliberation is an advantage, as the process of
**consensus-building** creates \"**consistent** and **sustainable**
security policy]{.underline}.\" 232

Thus, [a better definition of \"hostilities\" would serve as a **more
robust check** on the President\'s **unilateral uses of
force**.]{.underline} For one, clearer language would [allow Congress to
more **easily identify** when the President\'s actions are
**inconsistent** with the **WPR\'s requirements** and **raise** the
**political costs** of making **shaky legal arguments** that **stretch**
the meaning of \"**hostilities**\" to an unrecognizable
degree]{.underline}. Moreover, [clearer guidance on \"hostilities\"
would allow Congress to more **forcefully shape public dialogue** over
**military policymaking**.]{.underline} A more coherent definition of
activities that constitute \"hostilities\"\--and trigger the WPR\'s
withdrawal mandate\--would mean that [in public debates, Congress would
**no longer** have to **defer** to a meaning defined by decades of
**executive** branch practice.]{.underline}

#### Prohibiting NATO security cooperation is key to [overcome past precedent]{.underline} in favor of [unliteral executive action]{.underline} through [joint-coalitions]{.underline}

i\. Libya and the Executive Branch Interpretation of \"Hostilities\"

In March 2011, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
[along with]{.underline} a **[NATO]{.underline}** coalition,
[began]{.underline} enforcing [a **no-fly zone** over
**Libya**]{.underline} in order [to end]{.underline} the [Gaddafi
regime\'s attacks]{.underline} on Libyan civilians. 179Over the next
several months, these forces launched a series of airstrikes over Libya.
180[State Department Legal Adviser Harold Koh]{.underline},
[testifying]{.underline} before Congress as [to the legality of the
Libyan operation, cited OLC precedent and presented a theory of
**limited engagement**, which he argued **barred** the **applicability**
of the \"**hostilities**\" trigger of the WPR\'s sixty-day
clock.]{.underline} 181Despite internal disagreements within the Obama
Administration about the legal arguments justifying the strikes, 182[Koh
claimed]{.underline} that situations in which the nature of a mission,
exposure of U.S. armed forces, risk of escalation, and military means
are limited do not constitute engagements in \"hostilities.\" 183In a
June 2011 report justifying the [President\'s authority to use force in
Libya]{.underline}, the Administration again argued that the [operations
were \"**distinct** from the kind of \'hostilities\' contemplated by the
Resolution]{.underline}\'s 60 day termination provision\" [because
the]{.underline} \"U.S. operations \[did\] not involve sustained
fighting or active exchanges of fire with hostile forces, nor \[did\]
they involve the presence of U.S. ground troops, U.S. casualties or a
serious threat thereof, or any significant chance of escalation into a
conflict characterized by these factors.\" 184Further, Koh noted that
the [nature of the mission in Libya was **limited** because \"U.S.
forces \[were\] playing a **constrained** and **supporting** role in a
**NATO-led**]{.underline} multinational civilian protection
**[operation]{.underline}**.\" 185

However, there were several [**dissenting voices** in
**Congress**]{.underline} that [contended \"**hostilities**\"
had]{.underline} in fact **[triggered]{.underline}** the [**WPR**\'s
sixty-day clock]{.underline}, characterizing the United States\'s role
as anything but limited. House Speaker John Boehner said at the time:
\"They\'re spending \$ 10 million a day, part of an effort to drop bombs
on Gadhafi\'s compounds. It just doesn\'t pass the straight-face test in
my view, that we\'re not in the midst of hostilities.\"
186Representative Brad Sherman argued that \"when you\'re flying Air
Force bombers over enemy territory, you are engaged in combat.\"
187Similarly, Senator Richard Lugar, during a congressional hearing on
Libya, **[resisted]{.underline}** Koh\'s [notion that]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**merely played** a
**supporting role** in the **operations**, noting]{.underline} that
\"the [broader]{.underline} range of [airstrikes being carried out by
other **NATO** forces **depend** on the **essential support** functions
provided by the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.\"
188Further, Senator Lugar [**rejected** the **argument** that U.S.
operations were **not significant** enough to **constitute hostilities**
because **NATO** flew most of the missions]{.underline}, stating:

\[t\]he fact that we are leaving most of the shooting to other countries
does not mean the United States is not involved in acts of war . . . .
[\[T\]he language of the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution **clearly
encompasses** the kinds of **operations** U.S. military **forces** are
**performing** in support of **other NATO countries**]{.underline}. 189

The [situation on the ground supported]{.underline} the [conclusions
of]{.underline} Lugar and other members of **[Congress]{.underline}**
that the U.S.\'s involvement meant that there was an engagement in
\"hostilities.\" At the time, the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO was
Admiral James Stavridis, an American officer who commanded NATO forces
from other countries to \"engage\[\] on a much more sustained basis in
\'exchanges of fire.\'\" 190Moreover, Ivo Daalder, U.S. Permanent
Representative to NATO, observed that \"[the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**led** in this **operation**]{.underline} . .
. It [led in the **planning**]{.underline} of the operation, it [led in
getting the **mandate**]{.underline} for the operation, and it [led in
the **execution**]{.underline} of the operation.\" 191[Koh\'s
reasoning]{.underline} that \"a war without United States boots on the
ground can proceed indefinitely without Congressional approval\" simply
[**stretched** the meaning of \"**hostilities**\" too far, leading
to]{.underline} the [risk that]{.underline} \"with drone warfare now
expanding . . . [national-security decision-making]{.underline} stands
to [become]{.underline} the **[sole province]{.underline}** of the
**[executive]{.underline}**.\" 192Journalist Paul Starobin remarked at
the time that [Koh\'s interpretation]{.underline} [of \"hostilities\"
had him \"stretched out on a **legal limb** so **long** and so **thin**
that one can almost hear it **cracking**]{.underline}.\" 193

One conclusion we can draw from this episode is that [regardless of
**Koh\'s** thin legal grounding in interpreting \"hostilities,\" this
**interpretation** has **become** the **accepted
precedent**]{.underline} for subsequent airstrikes. After the Libya
operations, Congress did not mount much of an attempt to resist the
Obama Administration\'s interpretation. 194In areas where practice-based
law governs, [the law changes based on **executive** branch
**practice**, and \"actions supported by **minimally plausible legal
defenses** might over time be understood to exert a **gravitational
pull** on the best understanding of the law]{.underline}.\" 195

The second conclusion is that this episode neatly illustrates Bradley
and Morrison\'s theory of how [the **law** can **constrain** the
**President** through external **sanctions** and public **legal
dialogue**]{.underline}. The [Obama]{.underline} Administration [relied
on **public justifications** of **legality**, especially its
**interpretation of \"hostilities\"** in the **WPR**]{.underline}, in
order [to defend U.S. involvement in Libya]{.underline}. 196 This is
[significant because if the law had no constraining power on the
executive branch, it is unclear why the Administration relied on legal
rather than \"humanitarian or other policy or political grounds,\"
especially as these legal arguments **imposed costs** and \"exposed the
Administration to **criticism** from those who disagreed with the
analysis.\"]{.underline} 197With top officials like Koh publicly
testifying to the legality of the operation, the Administration in fact
went to \"considerable lengths\" to defend its actions on legal grounds.
198The [law could have been even more significant in **constraining**
the President\'s actions had \"the **potential illegality** of the
**operation**]{.underline} . . . [increased its **political
costliness**]{.underline} to the Obama Administration.\" 199If U.S.
forces had become mired in Libya instead of executing limited strikes,
the [**politics** of **publicly justifying** the **operations** could
have played an even greater role in the President\'s
decisions]{.underline}. In Part III, this Article follows this thread
and argues that [**redefining \"hostilities\"** under the **WPR** would
allow Congress to **channel** external **sanctions** and public **legal
dialogue** in order to **raise the political costs** of the
**President\'s decisions** to use force.]{.underline}

#### Encompassing [US-NATO security cooperation]{.underline} within the [definition]{.underline} of [hostilities]{.underline} is key to [reverse executive interpretations]{.underline} that [circumvent limits]{.underline} on [authority]{.underline}

i\. Partner Missions and U.S. Armed Forces in Supporting Roles

Historically, [the **exec**utive branch has **cited participation** in
**partner missions**]{.underline}\--missions at the express invitation
of another state, pursuant to UN authorization, [or]{.underline} in [a
**coalition** like **NATO**\--as reason to believe that **U.S. forces**
have not been **introduced** into \"**hostilities**.\"]{.underline}
Political scientists William Howell and Jon Pevehouse note that
[Presidents often **cite obligations** to **international partners** to
bolster **domestic legal justification** for **uses of force**, as well
as to **rally public opinion**]{.underline}. 251For instance, Truman
cited UN obligations in initiating U.S. involvement in Korea, and
Clinton cited NATO obligations in launching airstrikes in Kosovo. 252

There are two ways of interpreting the meaning of the executive
branch\'s practice of citing to international authority as justification
for uses of force. First, this [practice]{.underline} could
[mean]{.underline} that the **[exec]{.underline}**utive branch [believes
that **partner missions**, which provide international legal authority
for uses of force]{.underline}, also [provide the President **domestic
legal authority** for engaging **U.S. armed forces** without
**congressional involvement**]{.underline}. For example, past
[administrations have claimed that missions at the express invitation of
another state **do not fall within** the \"**hostilities**\"
contemplated by the **WPR**.]{.underline} In a 2004 opinion justifying
the President\'s deployment of fifty Marines to protect the U.S. Embassy
in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, from political unrest, OLC argued that whether
the deployment was at the \"express invitation of the government of
Haiti\" was relevant to the question of whether the situation was one of
\"involvement in hostilities.\" 253Similarly, Presidents have also
claimed that missions authorized by the UN do not involve
\"hostilities.\" In a March 2011 forty-eight-hour report on Libya,
President Obama excluded any mention of the introduction of U.S. forces
into \"hostilities,\" and noted that U.S. forces began operations as
\"authorized by the \[UN\] Security Council.\" 254

Both the \"express invitation\" and \"UN authorization\" rationales are
exceptions under international law to the UN Charter\'s near-absolute
prohibition against the use of force. 255This prohibition stems from
Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, which bars \"the threat or use of force
against the territorial integrity or political independence of any
state.\" 256One exception to this prohibition is the use of force in the
territory of a state with the state\'s consent; 257another is the use of
force pursuant to UN Security Council authorization. 258Does having a
stronger international legal justification for the use of force affect
whether U.S. armed forces are introduced into \"hostilities\" within the
meaning of the WPR? This Article suggests that the answer is no. 259To
be sure, [having a stronger international legal justification for **uses
of force abroad** addresses one concern with **unilateral presidential
action**: **rash policymaking**]{.underline}. Coordination with another
state or international organization could result in a consensus-building
process that produces sounder missions. But justifications for the use
of force under international law [do not address the **constitutional
question** that the drafters of the **WPR** intended to
**resolve**\--**affirming Congress\'s role** in **regulating U.S. uses
of force**]{.underline}. 260Congress represents a reflection of American
public opinion, regardless of what international partners think about
policy, and the drafters\' belief was that \"the President should not
engage in ventures that will lead to protracted conflicts that the
Congress and the American people will not sufficiently support.\" 261

Instead, a better, [alternative reading of the executive branch\'s
**reliance** on international legal authority is that **partner
missions** are **proxies** for **narrow missions** that the **executive
branch** has traditionally claimed **do not constitute**]{.underline}
\"**[hostilities]{.underline}**.\" [During]{.underline} the
**[Libya]{.underline}** hearing, [Koh argued]{.underline} that [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [played a
\"**constrained** and **supporting role** in a **multinational civilian
protection mission**]{.underline}\" in part because the operation was
\"authorized by a carefully tailored U.N. Security Council Resolution.\"
262However, he agreed that international legal justification alone was
not sufficient to justify the legality of the Libya strikes, but rather,
the \"nature and degree of international support might bear on factors
that are relevant to the War Powers analysis.\" 263

This Article agrees with this interpretation of executive branch
practice and makes two contributions expanding on this idea. First, U.S.
participation in partner missions does not automatically mean that U.S.
armed forces have not been introduced into \"hostilities.\" The
President can in fact commit troops to a partner mission that
constitutes introduction into hostilities if the mission is not
sufficiently narrow. For example, in the Libya conflict, while the
Administration extensively cited NATO leading the operation as part of
the reason why the situation did not constitute active or imminent
hostilities, 264U.S. involvement was not merely in a supporting role.
[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [was]{.underline}
in fact \"[doing most of the **heavy lifting** in the **conflict** short
of **pulling** all **the triggers**.\"]{.underline} 265As discussed in
Section II.D.i, the Supreme Allied Commander, in command of NATO
military operations, was a U.S. Navy Admiral. 266Additionally, according
to a U.S. Department of Defense memo, \"\[[a\]lthough it \[was\] working
**under NATO**, the US \[was\] by far the **largest contributor** to
\[the\] operation,]{.underline}\" supplying nearly a billion dollars in
funding and \"about 75% of reconnaissance and refueling missions.\"
267Moreover, during the Libya congressional hearing, Senator Lugar
argued that [characterizing the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [as playing a **supporting role**
\"**underplays** the **centrality** of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [contributions to the **NATO
operations**]{.underline},\" noting that \"United States war planes have
reportedly struck Libya air defenses some 60 times since NATO assumed
the lead role in the Libya campaign.\" 268

Second, this Article argues that [situations in which U.S. armed forces
play a **noncombat supportive role** and are not responsible for
\"pulling the trigger\" can **still constitute \"hostilities\"** under
the **WPR**]{.underline}. [For example]{.underline}, in [supporting
**Saudi Arabia** in]{.underline} its coalition strikes in Yemen, the
United States\'s role included \"[air-to-air refueling; certain
intelligence support; and military advice]{.underline}.\" 269The Trump
Administration insisted that U.S. forces were present in Saudi Arabia
solely for support. 270Some senators, siding with the Administration,
have similarly argued that the President\'s actions were consistent with
the WPR because U.S. troops were not involved in \"direct military
action\" against rebel Houthi forces. 271Other members of Congress have
argued that U.S. activities in Yemen amounted to \"hostilities,\" with
one Senate resolution proposing to define \"hostilities\" to include
\"refueling of non-United States aircraft\" in Yemen. 272

This Article proposes to reconceptualize \"hostilities\" to encompass
situations not only where U.S. forces are participating in active
exchanges of fire, but where they use or are subject to lethal force. As
discussed in Section II.C, the executive branch has historically defined
\"hostilities\" as \"situation\[s\] in which units of U.S. armed forces
are actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile
forces.\" 273In Yemen, the **[Trump]{.underline}** Administration
[contended that U.S. support of the Saudi coalition **did not
constitute** an **introduction** into \"**hostilities**\" because **U.S.
personnel** were not **actively engaged** in **exchanges of fire** with
**hostile forces**]{.underline}. 274However, [this strays from
Congress\'s **original intent**]{.underline}, which was that the WPR\'s
withdrawal mandate would be triggered by circumstances in which no
exchanges of fire have occurred but \"where there is a clear and present
danger of armed conflict.\" 275

This Article\'s proposed definition is more consistent with the original
conception of \"**[hostilities]{.underline}**,\" which [was intended to
be much broader than how the executive branch has interpreted the
term]{.underline} through the years. Situations where U.S. forces use or
are subject to lethal force would [encompass circumstances
in]{.underline} which American soldiers face enemy forces and operate
under the danger of exchanges of fire, or in [which \"U.S. armed forces
are **equipped** for combat in **a foreign country** where an **opposing
military** might be expected to take an **adversarial stance** at some
point in the near future against such U.S. armed forces]{.underline}\"
(as in Yemen, for example). 276This definition envisions that [there
exist situations where U.S. armed forces serve **non-combat support
roles** and yet are still considered to have been **introduced into
hostilities**]{.underline}, triggering the WPR\'s countdown clock.
Importantly, in clarifying the scope of \"hostilities,\" [this
definition allows **Congress** and the **public** to **more clearly
identify** instances of potential **presidential actions inconsistent**
with the **WPR**]{.underline}, ultimately [serving as a constraint on
any attempts to skirt the WPR\'s requirements.]{.underline}

According to a congressional staff member involved in cyber oversight
deliberations at the time, the armed services committees were initially
concerned about preventing Cyber Command from exceeding its authorities
and acting like a \"bull in a china shop.\" 170However, these concerns
turned out to be unwarranted. In the first few years of its existence,
Cyber Command employed a highly cautious approach to cyber warfare. U.S.
military cyber operations remained relatively limited to theaters of
active combat, and fears that Cyber Command would assume an aggressive
cyber posture without any legal or regulatory constraints did not
materialize. 171For several years after Cyber Command\'s inception,
oversight over cyber operations thus remained an \"academic issue,\" the
staff member recalled. 172The DOD\'s incomplete efforts at articulating
a cyber strategy, limited proactive operations, and the rapid rise of
cyber adversaries explain why [Congress]{.underline} both [**empowered**
the **DOD** in **cyberspace** and simultaneously **demanded more
reporting**]{.underline}.

Over the next several years, the [armed services committees continued to
build out the legal framework for cyber operations]{.underline} through
the NDAA with two oversight goals in mind: first, [ensuring that
legislators were kept apprised of the executive branch\'s cyber
operations; and second, **compelling** the **DOD** to **articulate** a
**robust cyber strategy** and **empowering it to act** in
cyberspace]{.underline}. Regarding the former objective, [the armed
services committees mandated the DOD **disaggregate** its **reporting**
by **geographic** and **functional command** and include **relevant
legal authorities** and **limitations**.]{.underline} 173As Cyber
Command matured and the DOD assumed a more proactive cyber posture,
particularly with the advent of its \"Defend Forward\" strategy,
174these [**reporting** and **notification** requirements became
**essential** to Congress\'s efforts to **oversee** the **exec**utive
branch]{.underline}. As a staff member expressed, the NDAA has had the
greatest impact in terms of [**enabling** the **DOD** to take a more
**active role** in **defending against cyber
intrusions**]{.underline}.\" 175

[Congress]{.underline} also leveraged the NDAA process to [**urge** the
**DOD** to **increase engagement** in **cyberspace**]{.underline}.
Between 2013 and 2017, in the wake of a series of high-profile cyber
incidents, [HASC and SASC grew increasingly dissatisfied with the DOD\'s
**untransparent** and **uncoordinated** efforts to **deter cyber
aggression** by adversaries such as **Russia**, **China**, **Iran**, and
**No**rth **Ko**rea]{.underline}. 176Amendments to the NDAA expressly
required the executive branch to articulate its \"policy to deter
adversaries in cyberspace.\" 177During the FY 2017 NDAA drafting
process, SASC expressed that [DOD policy reports were **delayed** and
**inadequate**.]{.underline} 178The next year, the FY 2018 [NDAA
**imposed** a **spending restriction** on **DOD funds** until
**submission** of a **national policy** on **cyberspace**,
**cybersecurity**, and **cyber warfare**]{.underline}. 179Importantly,
[the President was required to transmit this report - and a subsequent
report required by the FY 2019 NDAA - not only to the **armed services**
committees, but also to the **foreign relations**, **judiciary**, and
**homeland security** committees.]{.underline} 180[Congress also
required the executive branch to conduct an interagency **cyber posture
review** for the next five to ten years to \"clarify\" U.S. cyber
deterrence \"policy and strategy]{.underline},\" 181which later became a
quadrennial requirement. 182

B. Empty Executive Branch Constraints

[Congressional action to **reform** the **WPR** is **necessary** because
**current** **self-imposed** **exec**utive branch **limits** on **war
powers** have **not resulted** in **actual**, **meaningful limits** on
the President.]{.underline} When the President commits U.S. armed forces
abroad, the [initial inquiry]{.underline} of whether the President can
do so pursuant to his Article II authority alone without congressional
authorization stems from an Obama Administration OLC opinion on the
March 2011 Libyan airstrikes. The opinion [describes a **two-part
framework** for analyzing whether a **military intervention** rises to
the level of \"\'**war**\' in the **constitutional sense**\" that would
require **congressional authorization**]{.underline}: (1) [whether the
**military action** is in \"**the national interest**\" and (2) what the
\"**nature**, **scope** and **duration**\" of the conflict is
like]{.underline}. 145

As scholars have noted, [**neither part** of this test **meaningfully
constrains** the President]{.underline}. The [**first part** of the
**test** is an **inquiry** into whether the President could
\"**reasonably determine** that such **use of force** was in the
**national interest**.\"]{.underline} 146If so, then it is more likely
that the military activity was within the President\'s constitutional
powers. This reasoning echoes the rationale supplied in the first
mention of a national interest test in a 1941 OLC opinion by Attorney
General Robert Jackson. Jackson noted that pursuant to his
constitutional authority, [the **President** \"has **supreme command**
over the **land** and n**aval forces** of the **country** and may
**order them** to **perform** such **military duties** as, in his
opinion, are **necessary** or **appropriate** for the **defense** of the
**United States**.\"]{.underline} 147Moreover, [the President may
**extend his authority** \"to the **dispatch** of **armed forces**
outside of the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates . . .
for the purpose of protecting American lives or property or American
interests.\" 148[Subsequent **exec**utive **branch practice** **adopted
this standard**.]{.underline} 149According to OLC, [the **national
interest** is relevant because the **President** has \"**independent
authority**\" and \"**unique responsibility**\" as Commander in Chief to
take military action]{.underline} \"\'for the purpose of protecting
important national interests,\' even without specific prior
authorization from Congress.\" 150In the case of the Libyan airstrikes,
OLC found at least two national interests at stake: \"preserving
regional stability and supporting the UNSC\'s credibility and
effectiveness.\" 151

As Curtis Bradley and Jack Goldsmith argue, [this national interest test
**does not constrain presidential action** in **any meaningful
way**.]{.underline} 152In a 1992 opinion asserting the President\'s
authority to provide humanitarian assistance in Somalia, OLC refers to
historical practice and the \"American interests\" mentioned in
Jackson\'s 1941 opinion to identify two national interests in Somalia:
\"protecting the lives of Americans overseas and upholding the recent
United Nations resolutions regarding Somalia.\" 153However, [OLC **fails
to provide** in this opinion\--or any subsequent opinion\--**criteria**
to **determine** which **interests qualify** as national interests
**sufficient** to support **presidential use of force**. The national
interest test]{.underline}, then, [is **no test at all**. Any interest
suggested by the President could satisfy the test, as \"there
is]{.underline} nothing [at all in OLC\'s analysis that would **permit
it** to **reject** an **asserted interest** by the **president** in
**using force**.]{.underline}\" 154

The [**second prong** of OLC\'s framework\--the \"**anticipated
nature**, **scope** and **duration**\" test\--is also a **weak**
constraint on the President. This test asks whether a **use of force**
constitutes a \"**war**\" within the **meaning** of the
**Constitution**]{.underline}, as [judged by the mission\'s anticipated
**nature**, **scope**, and **duration**]{.underline}. 155[If a use of
force does not rise to the level of \"war,\" then the President may
dispatch armed forces **without prior congressional
authorization**.]{.underline} However, Bradley and Goldsmith note that
[the nature of modern war]{.underline}, conducted through airstrikes and
drones, [means that military engagements abroad will **generally not
rise** to the **level of war** in the **constitutional sense** that
requires **prior authorization** by Congress.]{.underline} 156For
instance, [OLC concluded that due to their **natures**, **scopes**, and
**durations**, **neither** the Libyan nor Syrian airstrikes were
\"**wars**\" that required **congressional authorizations**, and that in
fact the Syri**an operation** fell \"**far short** of the kinds of
**engagements** approved by prior Presidents under Article
II.\"]{.underline} 157This is [despite the fact that **both operations**
had **significant consequences**]{.underline}: The Libyan airstrikes
\"cost more than \$ 1 billion, involved thousands of air sorties, and
drove a foreign leader from power\" and the Syrian airstrikes
\"threatened greater escalation\" due to the presence of both U.S. and
Russian troops in Syria. 158It certainly would have been more faithful
to the Founders\' conception of Congress\'s role in declaring war had
Congress been involved in authorizing both operations.

As the next Sections illustrate, although an existing congressional
check on the President\--the WPR\--allows Congress to regulate use of
force decisions, this too has been subject to executive branch
interpretations that have eroded its requirements.

#### Autonomous weapons systems set a [precedent]{.underline} for [unilateral Executive expansion]{.underline} that causes global [interventionism]{.underline} and [escalation]{.underline}

C. How Autonomous Weapon Systems Might Affect the War Power

U.S. military engagements take one of three forms: global wars, like
World War II; so-called limited wars, like Vietnam or the recent Iraq
War; and short-term military interventions, like Kosovo or Grenada.86
The possibility of employing **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**utonomous
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapon **[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**ystems
will [have **different implications** for the **war power** depending on
the type of **engagement**.]{.underline}

For practical and political reasons, a president will probably not take
unilateral action with the intention of embroiling the United States in
a global war without congressional support. Not only does congressional
authorization constitute "insurance" against political risk should the
war go badly, long-term engagements will require sufficient funding.87
Even when a president anticipates that a military engagement may be of a
relatively limited form but will last for an extended period of time,
the benefits of commencing it with congressional authorization will tend
to outweigh acting unilaterally.88 Accordingly, autonomous weapon
systems will likely not have much of an effect on the division of the
war power for long-term military endeavors that remain within proscribed
legislative limits.89

In contrast, [autonomous weapon systems will further [**empower
presidents** to act **unilaterally**]{.mark} when engaging [in]{.mark}
**short-term military [interventions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} in
**expanding limited [wars]{.mark}** beyond legislative
boundaries]{.underline}. Because [such weaponry [reduces]{.mark} the
need for combat boots on the ground]{.underline}, there will be fewer
flag-draped coffins returning home. Accordingly, [one of the **remaining
[incentives]{.mark}** [for **Congress** to]{.mark} take action to
[**check** the **Exec**]{.mark}**utive**---popular outrage at the loss
of American lives---will be **diminished**]{.underline}.90

Autonomous weapon systems will therefore likely have a twofold impact on
the war power. First, [autonomous weapon systems will allow a president
to [take **unilateral action** **faster**]{.mark} and [with]{.mark} a
[**lowered probability** of]{.mark} a **[congressional
check]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, over time, [these engagements will
[create **precedent** for **future**]{.mark} **Executive [unilateral
action]{.mark}**, regardless of whether those situations involve
autonomous weapon systems.]{.underline} While [a weapon may contribute
to the ability to take a certain action or a lack of critique of that
action, it may **not** be **considered** a **relevant factor** into
**later legal analyses**]{.underline}.91 For example, President [Clinton
tested the limits of unilateral uses of force by ordering the U.S.
military to continue air strikes in Kosovo]{.underline} after the War
Powers Resolution's sixty-day deadline had passed without a
congressional authorization.92 [Today, Kosovo is often cited as a
**precedent** for the Executive's **war powers authority**, usually
without **clarification** that the precedent may only be relevant to
aerial bombardment.]{.underline}93

Granted, the integration of autonomous weapon systems in U.S. armed
forces will not result in a spectacular shift in the division of the war
power. First, the Executive's ability to unilaterally use military force
for short-term engagements has already been generally accepted. 94
Indeed, some would argue that it has even been legislatively endorsed by
the War Power Resolution's sixty-day window, within which presidents can
use force without congressional authorization.95 Second, drones and
other new technologies already reduce the need for human soldiers on the
ground; weapon systems with greater levels of autonomy may not
drastically further reduce that number. That autonomous weapon systems
will be incrementally integrated into the armed forces will further
contribute to the gradual, rather than dramatic, nature of this shift.96
Finally, the potential risk to soldiers is hardly the only consideration
in a president's decision to use or expand the use of military force.
Many factors council both for and against such actions, and when
national security is on the line, this one will play only a minor
role.97

That being said, [**[any increase]{.mark}** in the Executive's freedom
to **unilaterally use** or **expand** the use of U.S. **military force**
[is **hardly insignificant**. Presidents]{.mark} may [**intentionally
induce** a war]{.mark}]{.underline}, as President Polk arguably did when
he had U.S. troops occupy land claimed by Mexico.98 Additionally,
[because new technology often [inspires **overconfidence**]{.mark},
autonomous weapon systems may [**encourage** presidents to
**underestimate**]{.mark} the military **[commitment]{.mark}** required
to **accomplish** a **foreign policy objective**]{.underline}. As a
result, [even [engagements intended to be **minor**]{.mark} may
[**escalate** into more extensive **armed
conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline}.99 Finally, [the **U**nited **S**tates
will **engage** in far more **small-scale uses** of force than extensive
wars, which means there will be more **opportunity** for the Executive
to [foster]{.mark} a **[perception]{.mark}** that its [**unilateral
action** is **appropriate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Prediction is always a risky business. But it seems likely that, as
autonomous weapon systems reduce the need for combat boots on the
ground, congressional incentives to check a president's overreach will
diminish---further concentrating the war power in the Executive's hands.

IV\. Implications for the Doctrine of Humanitarian Intervention

New [technology can affect **international law** in a variety of
ways]{.underline}. A new development may [raise novel **legal
questions**]{.underline}100 [or require **resolving** long-standing
**legal grey areas**]{.underline}.101 Should new technology permit
states to take previously impossible actions or render previous
requirements ridiculous, [new state practice may also cause
international law to **evolve** in **unanticipated
ways**.]{.underline}102 This section discusses [one possible implication
of U.S. [presidents who]{.mark} are **less restrained** in using
**military force** for **short-term [engage]{.mark}ments** due to
increasingly **[a]{.mark}**utonomous **[w]{.mark}**eapon
**[s]{.mark}**ystems: the **[develop]{.mark}ment** of the doctrine of
**humanitarian [intervention]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

If [U.S. presidents]{.underline} enjoy greater leeway in short-term
military engagements, it is entirely possible that they [will be **more
willing** to engage in **humanitarian interventions**]{.underline}.
Unlike other decisions to use military force, which will be grounded
primarily in national security concerns, [humanitarian interventions
require a state to **weigh the lives** of its **nationals** against its
**willingness** to **aid** another state's **civilians**.]{.underline}
Unsurprisingly, states are generally reluctant to engage in such actions
unless the risk to their nationals is minimal (or unless an intervention
is a fig leaf for accomplishing other objectives). Thus, [to the extent
autonomous weapon systems reduce risk to troops, U.S. presidents may be
[**more willing** to **use military force**]{.mark}]{.underline} to
protect other states' civilians.

To some degree, this is already occurring.103 As noted above, the Obama
Administration relied heavily on the argument that there would be no
"boots on the ground" to sell the American public on humanitarian
interventions in Libya and Syria.104 Drones permit relatively riskless
air strikes, but they do require considerable manpower for their
operation. [Weapon systems with greater levels of autonomy will **allow
militaries** to **do even more**--- [in the **air**, at **sea**, on the
**ground**, and in **cyberspace**]{.mark}---with less]{.underline}.

Should the United States engage in more humanitarian interventions, its
actions will affect international law. Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter
provides: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations
from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or
political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent
with the Purposes of the United Nations."105 There are two formal
exceptions to this general prohibition: states may use force against
another state pursuant to a Security Council resolution or in
self-defense.106 The doctrine of humanitarian intervention, however,
suggests that individual states may also unilaterally use force to stop
an ongoing atrocity perpetuated by a state against its citizens,
especially when the Security Council cannot or will not authorize a use
of force.107 Some scholars argue that such a customary exception to
Article 2(4) already exists.108 But these writers are in the minority.
Due to both the sacrosanct nature of Article 2(4)'s prohibition and a
lack of consistent state practice, the doctrine of humanitarian
intervention is far from established customary international law.109

[The United States, however, is a **particularly influential
international actor**. Should it engage in **unilateral** humanitarian
**interventions** more frequently, [other states may be **reluctant to
criticize**]{.mark} it---[or]{.mark} they may also feel [**emboldened**
to **engage**]{.mark} in such actions]{.underline}. Over time, [as
certain justifications are accepted and others rejected by the
international legal community, the doctrine of **humanitarian
intervention** might [evolve into]{.mark} a **third**, **customary
[exception]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} Article 2(4)'s [**prohibition** on the
**threat** or **use of force**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

I. Introduction

In War and Responsibility, John Hart Ely argues that [**Congress** has
**willingly** and **cravenly** surrendered its **rightful role** as the
**branch** responsible for **determining** when and the extent to which
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**engages** in
**armed conflicts**]{.underline}.1 Since the publication of this seminal
work on the war power, [[presidents]{.mark} have continued to [commit
troops to **hostilities** absent]{.mark} or outside of explicit
**congressional [authorizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and [the
**legislature** and the **judiciary** **rarely challenge** such
actions]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
[**investing heavily** in **unmanned**]{.mark} military weapon
systems]{.underline},2 and the U.S. **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense has [described increasing
weapons' autonomous capabilities as a "**high priority**."]{.underline}3
In its annual "Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap," the [Department
discusses its intended "continued development, production, test\[ing\],
training, operation, and sustainment of unmanned systems technology
across DoD" for the next twenty-five years.]{.underline}4 One of the
ultimate goals is to "\[t\]ake the 'man' out of unmanned \[systems\]."5
How might [increasingly **[autonomous weapon
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}---also known as "killer robots"---
[affect the **constitutional war power**]{.underline}?

Drones, cyber operations, and other technological advances in weaponry
already allow the United States to intervene militarily with minimal
boots on the ground, and increased autonomy in weapon systems will
further reduce risk to soldiers. [As human troops are augmented and
supplanted by **robotic ones**]{.underline},6 one of the [[remaining
**incentives** for **Congress** to **check** presidential
**warmongering**]{.underline}]{.mark}---popular outrage at the loss of
American lives--- [will **[diminish]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By [making
it politically easier to justify the use of military force, autonomous
weapon systems will [contribute to]{.mark} the **growing
[concentration]{.mark}** [of the **war power** in the hands of the
**Executive**]{.mark}, with potential implications for the
**international doctrine** of **humanitarian
intervention**]{.underline}.

I. The Cyber Domain & the Future of 21st Century Conflict

[**[O]{.mark}**ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yberspace
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, 1[including
clandestine collection, exploitation and attack, are likely to
remain]{.underline} an [important]{.underline} means and method [in
international relations]{.underline} over the coming decades. [Cyber
warfare offers an attacker the important **advantage** of **remote
operations**, leaving the victim with the problem of characterizing the
event as a violation under domestic or international law, and with
untangling the complex intelligence involving source
attribution]{.underline}. In the case of technologically advanced
states, such as the United States (\"U.S.\") or Israel, [there are
increased intelligence and planning requirements, but a **reduced risk**
of friendly **casualties**]{.underline} (as compared to physical
operations). Most importantly, if the victim cannot properly
characterize the event or identify the perpetrators, then [the attacker
achieves discrete **strategic objectives without risking a retaliatory
response**. Both clandestine and covert cyber actions can]{.underline},
therefore, [perform a useful role in **[furthering]{.mark}** U.S.
**national [security]{.mark}** interests, [provided]{.mark} that such
[actions comply with]{.mark} relevant domestic law to include
appropriate **executive** and **[congressional oversight]{.mark}**, are
conducted consistent with fundamental principles of international law,
and fall below a certain level of severity based upon either the nature
of the target or the degree of harm caused]{.underline}.

Several recent instances of **[cyber operations]{.underline}** indicate
that **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**ffensive
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**yberspace
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**peration[**[s]{.mark}**
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[be a **staple**]{.mark} in future
**international** armed **conflict**.]{.underline} 2Examples include
Israel\'s possible installation of a secretly kill-switch to destroy
Syrian air defenses prior to its 2007 bombing of a nuclear reactor,
3Russia\'s likely deployment of a patriotic \"cyber mob\" for a 2007
attack on Estonia, 4the possible joint U.S.-Israeli use of a thumb drive
to facilitate the 2010 Stuxnet attack against Iranian nuclear
facilities, 5and the Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. general
election. 6In fact, **[o]{.underline}**ffensive
**[c]{.underline}**yberspace **[o]{.underline}**peration[**s**
[conducted under]{.mark} conditions of **[secrecy]{.mark}** can be an
useful **force multiplier**, for a government seeking either to **avert
conflict**]{.underline} (e.g., anticipatory self-defense) [or [to
**facilitate operations**]{.mark} during war.]{.underline} In this
article, [cyber operations are understood as military-intelligence
operations using computers or computer networks either to target another
or to use that other computer or computer network as a means by which
damage or injury is caused to an adversary.]{.underline} 7[Cyber
operations, especially those [that **impair** or **degrade**]{.mark} an
**adversary\'s [systems]{.mark}**, will likely remain a **preferred
method** of attack against foreign adversaries because of problems that
victims typically experience in **characterizing** an event and in
**attributing** the attack to **state-sponsorship**.]{.underline}
8**[O]{.underline}**ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yberspace
**[o]{.underline}**peration[**s** raise]{.underline} important [national
security and foreign policy concerns that implicate U.S. and
international law]{.underline}, especially [as global political,
defense, economic, and law enforcement activity increases]{.underline}
its [reliance on computer systems]{.underline}. 9

**[O]{.underline}**ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yberspace
**[o]{.underline}**peration[**s** range from]{.underline} the relatively
benign [exploitation of a zero day vulnerability]{.underline}, 10[which
enables a **D**istributed **D**enial **o**f **S**ervice
(\"**DDoS**\")]{.underline} **[11attack]{.underline}** (e.g., a shutdown
of certain systems or services for a publicly observable effect), to a
relatively more active operation [involving]{.underline} the use of
[**disinformation** or **propaganda** to **hide** the attack\'s
**origin** or to **discredit** a **third country**]{.underline}, 12and
at the other end of the spectrum, a clear use of force operation of
destructive acts a targeted country\'s nuclear power, SCADA, 13critical
infrastructure, 14or air defense systems. Several recent examples, such
as the February 2011 attacks by the Iranian Cyber Army against the Voice
of America website 15and the 2014 power outages in North Korea that sent
a powerful message to Pyongyang, 16illustrate how [**[covert]{.mark}**
cyber [actions]{.mark} conducted through the use of **proxies** could be
used to **[warn]{.mark}** an [**adversary** about]{.mark} the
**[risk]{.mark}** of **conducting** a **cyber-attack** against the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. 17White House and
senior Russian leaders have also highlighted the gravity of the
situation; both countries have expressed the need for stronger cyber
defenses to protect against cyber-attacks from foreign state and
non-state actors. 18Indeed, the likely Russian interference in the 2016
presidential elections demonstrate that the international community
faces a pernicious security threat through the use of social media
platforms by state-supported actors. 19

Accordingly, a 2018 comprehensive cyber strategy rolled out by the Trump
Administration indicates that the United States will undertake offensive
cyberspace operations against foreign adversaries. 20Initially,
President Donald Trump signed the 2019 National Defense Authorization
Act (\"NDAA\") into law on August 13, 2018. The 2019 [NDAA]{.underline}
further [**militarizes cyberspace** by authorizing the **D**epartment
**o**f **D**efense (\"**DoD**\") to conduct a range of **clandestine**
military **cyber operations** - including when such actions would fall
short of hostilities or would occur in areas in which hostilities are
not occurring]{.underline} 21- [as a \"**traditional military
activity**\" pursuant to the covert action statute.]{.underline}
22President Trump subsequently [[rescinded]{.underline}]{.mark}
Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 20, [the **interagency** **legal**
and **[policy process]{.mark}** that had been]{.underline} initiated by
President Barack Obama and [used [for]{.mark}
\"[green-lighting]{.mark}\" cyber-[attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} 23A
House of Representatives conference report noted that [the [DoD]{.mark}
had [faced]{.mark} **interagency [problems]{.mark}** [in
**obtaining**]{.mark} mission **[approval]{.mark}** for **cyber
operations**]{.underline}, and found that [the DoD had been
**challenged** by \"the perceived **ambiguity** as to whether
**clandestine** military activities and **operations**, even those short
of cyber-attacks, qualify as **traditional** military activities as
distinct from covert actions **requiring** a **Presidential
Finding**]{.underline}.\" 24Senator Mike Rounds (D-SD), a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Cybersecurity
Subcommittee, later remarked that PPD-20 had \"[virtually
\[**incapacitated**\]]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~ the [conduct of
offensive operations by **U.S. Cyber Com**mand outside of armed
conflict]{.underline}.\" 25To remedy this problem, [Congress authorized
an increased range of offensive cyberspace operations]{.underline}, no
doubt \"[unleashing]{.underline}\" U.S. Cyber Command (\"U.S.
**[CYBERCOM]{.underline}**\") [from its defensive **shackles** to
conduct a **broader range** of **defensive** and **offensive**
operations]{.underline}. 26

This broad [[**vesting** of **authority** from **Congress** to]{.mark}
the **Secretary of [Defense]{.mark}** [leaves]{.mark} many
[unanswered]{.mark} [questions about]{.mark} the [**reach** of]{.mark}
its new **operational [authority]{.mark}** [as well as
**oversight**]{.mark} by **Congress** and the
**Executive**.]{.underline} 27First, one must distinguish among
clandestine collection, cyber exploitation, sensitive military cyber
operations, and covert operations. This problem, not clarified by the
2019 NDAA, cannot be overstated; many [[cyber]{.mark} activities **elude
characterization** under the **definitions** that **traditionally
applied** to **physical activities**.]{.underline} 28Initially, Congress
granted the DoD broad authority to conduct activity for a broad range of
purposes, as the statute\'s inclusion of [DoD
[terminology]{.mark}]{.underline} such as \"preparation of the
environment\" 29and \"information operations\" 30[was [**vague** and
**undefined**]{.mark} in other statutes]{.underline}. In turn, this
[[raises issues about how]{.mark} certain cyber [activities]{.mark}
[should be viewed]{.mark} under **domestic** and **international law**,
and raises a risk that a **collection** or an **exploitation activity**
could be **construed** by an **adversary** [as]{.mark} a
**threat**]{.underline} of force [or even a **[use of force]{.mark}** in
violation of the U.N. Charter]{.underline}.

In clandestine collection, traditional espionage involving a foreign
agent (e.g., a spy), can occur through computer networks to collect
foreign intelligence information regarding an adversary\'s computer,
computer systems, or information or communications systems, as well as
networks that may facilitate future operations. However, the term
\"clandestine\" used in the 2019 NDAA is not defined by law. 31Such
cyber collection may be even more effective than traditional espionage
activity; remote cyber operations can extract large volumes of data
without the assistance of an recruited spy or his American case officer.
32While there is no general prohibition under international law
regarding espionage in peacetime, a collection activity could constitute
a violation of foreign domestic (criminal) law 33or, more generally,
incur state responsibility as an internationally wrongful act in
violation of customary international law. 34The term \"cyber
exploitation,\" as used in this article, refers to network penetrations
that enable future operations, such as the insertion of a trap door 35or
malware 36that performs certain command functions. 37Cyber exploitation
can involve intelligence collection as well as preparations a
cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack \"refers to deliberate actions to alter,
disrupt, deceive, degrade, or destroy computer systems or networks or
the information and/or programs resident in or transiting these systems
or networks.\" 38Consequently, [a [cyber]{.mark} [exploitation]{.mark}
against **foreign critical infrastructure**, such as a **missile
development** program or **nuclear** **c**ommand **and** **c**ontrol
systems, [could be **perceived**]{.mark} by an adversary [as
**escalatory**]{.mark} in a **crisis situation**.]{.underline} 39

Cyber-attacks may range from an unacknowledged DDoS attack with
temporary effects, such as the recent service outage in North Korea,
40to a broader, more destructive conduct as in the Stuxnet attack
perpetrated against Iranian nuclear facilities. 41Cyber-attacks have the
potential to constitute a use of force, 42a threat of force, 43or an
armed attack 44under international law, depending on the circumstances
of the attack. For instance, experts disagree on whether the 2010
Stuxnet attack was both a use of force 45and also an armed attack
46under the U.N. Charter. 47[This [lends itself to]{.mark}
**considerable [ambiguity]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **statutory
[meaning]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the term \"[**military activities** in
cyberspace **short of hostilities**]{.mark} \....\"]{.underline}
48Presumably, such cyber-attacks could qualify as \"sensitive military
cyber operations\" and come under the closer - albeit ex post facto -
reporting requirements under 10 U.S. Code § 395, 49although the statute
leaves considerable room for interpretation because it does not
distinguish sensitive military operations from covert actions.

Dr. Christopher E. **Bailey 20**, Summer 2020, Article: Offensive
Cyberspace Operations: A Gray Area in Congressional Oversight, Boston
University International Law Journal, 38, 240, Lexis, added
\[incapacitated\], nihara

Next, there are new questions about the nature of presidential and
congressional oversight. The new statutory authorization allows for a
range of offensive cyberspace operations that could be properly
characterized as a covert action, but absent executive oversight
required, such as is required for a presidential finding and Memorandum
of Notification to the Congressional intelligence committees. 50The new
language creates an important change in congressional reporting
requirements; the statute provides that \"\[the Secretary of Defense\]
shall brief the congressional defense committees about any military
activities or operations in cyberspace, including clandestine military
activities or operations in cyberspace, occurring during the previous
quarter during the quarterly briefing required by section 484 of this
title.\" 51In other words, the DoD and U.S. CYBERCOM can conduct a
broader range of offensive cyberspace operations, some which may be
construed by an adversary as a hostile or wrongful act in violation of
international law, but the Secretary of Defense is no longer constrained
by the requirement of a presidential finding, 52prior or contemporaneous
reporting to Congress, 53or even reporting to the senior congressional
leadership. In one sense, the 2019 NDAA has a broader requirement for
congressional reporting than the covert action statute; the 2019 NDAA
does not include a provision that could be used to limit congressional
reporting on sensitive military cyber operations to the \"gang of
eight.\" 54

The traditional controls on uses of force, whether involving covert
actions or armed conflict, exist to ensure executive and congressional
oversight, as well as political accountability through elections, in the
conduct of U.S. foreign policy. 55There is a distinct difference between
purely defensive actions, which are either responses against an on-going
attack or the preparation of capabilities for prospective conflict, and
offensive operations that could initiate or escalate a crisis. On one
hand, it is true that the DoD experienced difficulties in obtaining
mission approval within the executive branch for peacetime cyber
operations that involved conduct beyond intelligence collection or a
response to an on-going attack. That there has been disagreement over
the propriety of certain activities is no doubt a reflection on the
unique nature of certain cyber activities and the perhaps unknowable
consequences that may result from them. Indeed, the United States has
periodically faced intelligence crises resulting from ill-advised
operations, such as the 1985-87 Iran-Contra affairs, that had been
decided within a limited group of senior officials, without the benefit
of interagency review and debate. 56Thus, the short-circuited approval
process encapsulated in the 2019 NDAA - albeit to intended to facilitate
timely responses to on-going attacks - is not necessarily a positive
development.

However, strong presidential control and prior congressional
notification perform an important function: they ensure that the United
States uses unacknowledged force only in pursuit of \"identifiable
foreign policy objectives of the United States and is important to the
national security of the United States.\" 57The need to inhibit
unintended escalation with a foreign adversary mandates high quality
intelligence to minimize the risk of misattribution and collateral
damage, as well as tight political control. Now, however, the DoD can
conduct a range of offensive cyberspace operations (i.e., \"defend
forward\" through \"persistent engagement\" 58) independent of any
explicit finding to that effect. The DoD has the authority to conduct a
broad range of activities that it may consider \"short of hostilities,\"
59but ones that an adversary may consider as a hostile or
internationally wrongful act.

It is, therefore, important to consider how offensive cyberspace
operations are regulated under domestic and international law - with
special emphasis on how clandestine, sensitive, and covert cyber actions
present special challenges for policymakers and practitioners alike.
Arguably, the 2019 NDAA has clarified the relatively innocuous notion
that military intelligence collection activities - whether styled as
clandestine, preparation of the environment, or information operations -
are exempted from the covert action statute as a TMA. 60Still, the 2019
NDAA fails to distinguish between cyber collection activities, sensitive
military cyber operations, and cyber covert actions. 61In effect, the
U.S. CYBERCOM is now preauthorized to commit internationally wrongful
acts with an attendant risk to U.S. foreign policy objectives and
national security interests, without prior interagency coordination or
presidential approval, provided that such acts are \"short of
hostilities,\" according to the DoD. 62This lack of clarity is
problematic with the ambiguity that is inherent in characterizing in
cyber activities. In other words, offensive cyberspace operations, not
intended by the United States as a hostile act, could be readily viewed
as such by a foreign adversary and could, therefore, lead to unintended
and unwanted consequences.

Effective regulation under this scheme, involving both presidential
control and congressional oversight over military cyber operations,
would help ensure that such actions serve as a viable foreign policy
tool that advances U.S. national interests without the unnecessary risk
of crisis escalation. First, the change in the characterization of
clandestine military cyber operations as a \"traditional military
activity\" is undoubtedly a useful one that reduces the need for
unnecessary interagency coordination. 63Nonetheless, when such
activities are conducted \"in areas in which hostilities are not
occurring,\" 64the DoD and the U.S. CYBERCOM should be obligated to
inform the State Department, as well as the Director of National
Intelligence, in advance of the proposed operation. In other words, the
uncoordinated conduct of military cyber operations abroad risks conflict
with U.S. relations with foreign countries and with other foreign
intelligence collection activities.

Second, the statute should be amended to clarify the terminology
involving the \"preparation of the environment, information operations,
force protection, and deterrence of hostilities, or counter-terrorism
operations involving the Armed Forces of the United States.\" 65This
language, undefined in the statute, is vague and overbroad; it not only
authorizes a wide range of defensive activities, but also many offensive
activities, from the insertion of \"malware\" to facilitate a possible
future operation to an outright attack (i.e., otherwise
indistinguishable from a covert action). On one hand, in the face of an
on-going cyber-attack against the United States, the DoD should have the
full legal authority to not only defend its own systems, but also to use
timely and proportionate countermeasures against that adversary. Thus,
the DoD should have the legal authority to conduct such defensive
operations without the need for interagency coordination or even prior
presidential approval. And, as applied to defensive activities, to
include proportionate countermeasures, the post-operational briefings to
the congressional defense committees for \"any military activities or
operations in cyberspace\" 66or a \"sensitive military cyber operation\"
67are entirely appropriate. On the other hand, planned, offensive
\"military activities or operations in cyberspace short of hostilities
\... or in areas in which hostilities are not occurring,\" 68should be
subject to interagency coordination, presidential approval, and
notification to Congress in the same manner as a covert action. 69

Finally, the statute should be clarified with respect to congressional
reporting. Thus, conduct of military cyber operations - especially ones
that may otherwise be indistinguishable from covert actions - should be
reportable to both the congressional defense and intelligence
committees. On a domestic level, offensive cyberspace operations raise a
risk of complicating foreign relations and the unnecessarily escalation
of a foreign crisis. On an international level, offensive cyberspace
operations raise a risk of an internationally wrongful act, incurring
state responsibility before an international court, as well as a
possible violation of the U.N. Charter.

[After 18 years of illegal warfare, corruption]{.underline}, and untold
numbers of innocent [people killed or made into refugees, the U.S.
[combat mission]{.mark} in **Iraq** will be declared **finished**---for
the third time. **Sort of**.]{.underline} This week, President Joe Biden
said that the United States is "not going to be, by the end of the year,
in a combat mission" in Iraq. The 2,500 U.S. soldiers officially staged
there---almost certainly an undercount, as military leaders tend to
fudge deployment numbers and reorganize troops under intelligence
authorities or noncombat roles so as to disguise the scale of our
overseas footprint---will be moving on.

But [they [won't]{.mark} necessarily [be]{.mark} **going home**, or even
**[leaving]{.mark} the region**. The change in status]{.underline},
while pleasing to anti-war advocates and to Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa
Al Kadhimi, who met with Biden this week, [is mostly a **distinction**
without a **difference**. The [U.S. will be moving into]{.mark} an
"**[advise-and-assist]{.mark}** role," as it's euphemistically
described, providing many of the **same services** it does
now]{.underline}. According to ABC News, "[the change in mission is more
of a **semantic** one]{.underline}, and [the number of U.S. troops in
Iraq will not **dramatically differ** as they shift their emphasis to
training and assisting]{.underline}." U.S. [soldiers will be [doing
"**the exact same things**]{.mark} they're already doing]{.underline},
just fewer doing it," said Wesley Morgan, author of a book about
America's war in Afghanistan.

The [**[forever wars]{.mark}** don't seem to **end**, they just
[**molt** into]{.mark} their [next **iteration**]{.mark}, as assets are
**shuffled around**, **missions rebranded**, and **local allies
reassured** that we are there to "**advise and assist**" for as long as
is needed. Relying heavily on special forces, intelligence resources,
contractors, and unmatched air power, the [U.S. continues to be involved
in]{.mark} conflicts in **[Syria]{.mark}**, **[Somalia]{.mark}**,
**[Libya]{.mark}**, **[Niger]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and other
undeclared war zones. [In Africa alone, the U.S. has at least 29
military bases and participates in operations]{.underline} against
Islamic State sympathizers and other jihadist groups in a number of
countries, particularly in West Africa. Earlier this year, making good
on a campaign promise, [Biden claimed that the U.S. would stop providing
"offensive assistance" to]{.underline} the vicious war prosecuted by
[Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates]{.underline}---with British
and American help---in Yemen. [We still don't know if anything has
changed]{.underline}, and [the U.S. continues to help **enforce** a
**devastating blockade** of a key port in a country where millions face
hunger]{.underline}.

Prolonging a process that was begun under Donald Trump, [the U.S.
hasn't]{.underline} so much [**folded its cards** in these conflicts as
it has **reshuffled the deck**. [Biden]{.mark}]{.underline} has
positioned himself as a reluctant peacemaker---so reluctant that he
sometimes brushes off questions about Afghanistan because they aren't
"happy." But in practice, he [[appears to be]{.mark} a pliant
**[imperial overseer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In [moving to
**reestablish** the relationships and treaties Trump trashed, while
**[rebranding]{.mark} U.S. [involvement]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} various
**[conflicts]{.mark}**, Biden's foreign policy looks much like a [return
to]{.mark} the [muscular liberalism of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Obama]{.underline}]{.mark} era, [[which gave us]{.mark} the **Islamic
State** and **[humanitarian disasters]{.mark}** in Yemen, Libya, and
elsewhere]{.underline}. Any reports that the forever wars are ending
miss what is really happening in U.S. foreign policy.

Consider [America's pullout [from Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline},
which has featured quietly dramatic scenes of fleets of vehicles
abandoned at Bagram Airbase and reports of the Taliban capturing
district after district. [Even in that conflict, [there's **little
sense** that]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} is about to **[abandon]{.mark}**
its foundering [efforts]{.mark} to create a **functional democracy** in
a country wracked by generations of war and outside
meddling]{.underline}. Rather than fully exit the region, [[the
U.S]{.mark}. reportedly has been considering **[reposition]{.mark}ing
its military [assets]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} surrounding **[Central
Asia]{.mark}n countries**]{.underline}, including possibly leasing
Russian military bases in places like Tajikistan. [U.S. forces have also
continued [launching **airstrikes**]{.mark} against the **Taliban** to
try to aid the teetering Afghan government and to **provide cover** for
foreign forces set to leave the country]{.underline}. (The Taliban, for
its part, promised "consequences" for the U.S. violating its agreement
to pull out of Afghanistan fully by August 31.) [The U.S.
has]{.underline} similarly [promised]{.underline}, in the words of Gen.
Kenneth McKenzie Jr., [to [provide "**intelligence**]{.mark} **sharing**
[and]{.mark} **[advising]{.mark}**]{.underline} and assisting
[[through]{.mark} **security [consultations]{.mark}** at the **strategic
level**" to the Afghan government]{.underline}---for as long as that
government lasts in the face of growing Taliban assaults.

[American military operations seem to be continuing [in **Syria** and
**Somalia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well. Trump expressed interest in
ending U.S. involvement in Somalia, but according to some reports, [U.S.
[forces were]{.mark} mostly [**relocated** to **Kenya** and]{.mark}
**other [regional bases]{.mark}**, essentially "commuting to
work,"]{.underline} as described by Air Force Magazine. Following a
six-month respite, the [[Biden]{.mark} administration **[resumed
airstrikes]{.mark}** in Somalia]{.underline}, leading several Democratic
senators to demand an explanation. "I have received no information
suggesting that these strikes are necessary to protect any U.S.
personnel and would need to understand, if this is so, why they are
occurring," said Senator Tim Kaine. The same could be said about much of
the last 20 years of America's wars of choice.

[In Syria, the [U.S.]{.mark} has **carved out** a small "**buffer
zone**"]{.underline} in the east of the country, [where Green Berets
[train]{.mark}]{.underline} and assist [[S]{.mark}yrian
[D]{.mark}emocratic [F]{.mark}orces in their battle against]{.underline}
remnants of [the Islamic State, and other U.S. assets **[provide air
support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although [their [presence is]{.mark}
probably **[illegal]{.mark}**, and occurred [without]{.mark} any
[congress]{.mark}ional debate, the [mission will go on.]{.mark} "I don't
anticipate any changes right now to the mission or the footprint in
Syria]{.underline}," an anonymous official told Politico on Tuesday.
More detailed information about the U.S. mission in Syria, including
photos, videos, and other friendly propaganda, can be found on Twitter,
where a U.S. spokesman provides regular updates with the hashtag
#defeatdaesh (Daesh being a derogatory Arabic term for the Islamic
State). The U.S.-led coalition "is committed to supporting the #SDF to
combat terrorism & ensure a long-term stability in NE Syria," said
spokesman Col. Wayne Marotto this week.

[In both **Iraq** and **Syria**]{.underline}, U.S. officials say,
[American soldiers]{.underline} no longer participate in raids or kick
down doors. They merely [do everything]{.underline} else [a long-term
**counterinsurgency** campaign requires]{.underline}. [This [shift to
more **hazily described**]{.mark} assistance [roles
is]{.mark}]{.underline} supposed to reflect a maturation and evolution
of a global war on terror. But they're also [[a way of keeping]{.mark}
U.S. [forces engaged]{.mark} in the region without **visibly occupying**
it. This strategy also [allows the U.S. to **amp up
involvement**]{.mark} any time an Iranian-sponsored militia manages to
lob some missiles a U.S. base in Iraq or Syria]{.underline}. As Marotto,
the coalition spokesman, recently said, "The U.S./Coalition has the
inherent right to self-defense. Force protection remains the highest
priority of the \@Coalition."

It's a measure of how distorted our forever-war logic has become. Why
keep U.S. soldiers parked at regional bases without any combat role,
just so they can be targets for militia drone strikes that may then
demand an escalating response? These soldiers and contractors wouldn't
require force protection if they were returned home.

According to The Washington Post, President Biden is trying "to end the
post-9/11 era." From Afghanistan to Iraq to Guantánamo, where a prisoner
was recently released after years of confinement and no criminal
charges, [[Biden **claims** to be **turning the page**]{.mark},
reorienting toward security threats emanating from China and
Russia]{.underline}.

This new eagerness to wave sabers in the general direction of Beijing
would be concerning on its own. But it also highlights how [ending
America's decades-long imperial drift will take far more than
**rearranging** some **military deployments**. It will require a
**complete reimagining** of how to engage with a world that has been
cynically reduced to a global battlefield populated with **endless
threats**]{.underline}. It requires admitting that [we live in a country
mostly safe from external enemies]{.underline}, with only a marginal
risk of terrorism. For 20 years, [our political and military leaders and
foreign policy establishment have claimed otherwise. [Judging by
**Biden's latest decisions**]{.mark}---as well as]{.underline} the
hysterically [overwrought reactions of **old neocon hands**]{.underline}
like George W. Bush and Lindsey Graham, who would be content to occupy
Afghanistan for another generation---[our [**elites** are]{.mark} still
[not ready to]{.mark} **admit the obvious**: We lost these
wars]{.underline}, and [the only way to expiate our failure is to [go
home]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### 2ac -- exec flex good

#### Executive flexibility solves [terror]{.underline} AND [prolif]{.underline} -- extinction -- Congress is [structurally incapable]{.underline} at crisis response

Institution at Stanford University, 4-13-2017, \"Trump's Syria Strike

The Framers realized the obvious. [**Foreign affairs** are
**unpredictable** and involve the **highest of stakes**, making them
**unsuitable** to regulation by preexisting
**legislation**]{.underline}. Instead, [they can demand **swift**,
**decisive action** --- sometimes under **pressured** or even
**emergency circumstances**]{.underline} --- [that is best carried out
by a branch of government that does not suffer from multiple **vetoes**
or that is **delayed** by **disagreements**. Congress is too **large**
and **unwieldy** to take the swift and decisive action required in
wartime.]{.underline} Our Framers replaced the Articles of
Confederation, which had failed in the management of foreign relations
because they had no single executive, with the Constitution's single
president for precisely this reason. [Even when it has **access** to the
**same intel**ligence as the executive branch, Congress's **loose**,
**decentralized** structure would \[**undermine**\]]{.underline}
~~paralyze~~ [American **policy** while **foreign threats
grew**.]{.underline}

[Congress has **no political incentive** to mount and see through its
own **wartime policy**]{.underline}. Members of Congress, who are
interested in keeping their seats at the next election, do not want to
take stands on controversial issues where the future is uncertain. They
will avoid like the plague any vote that will anger large segments of
the electorate. They prefer that the president take the political risks
and be held accountable for failure.

[Congress is too **large** and **unwieldy** to take the **swift** and
**decisive action** required in **wartime**.]{.underline}

[Congress's **track record** when it has opposed presidential leadership
has **not** been a **happy** one.]{.underline} Perhaps the most telling
example was the Senate's rejection of the Treaty of Versailles at the
end of World War I. [Congress's isolationist urge kept the United States
out of Europe at a time when **democracies fell** and **Fascism grew**
in their place. Even as **Europe** and **Asia** **plunged into war**,
Congress]{.underline} passed the Neutrality Acts designed to [keep the
United States out of the conflict]{.underline}. President Franklin
Roosevelt violated those laws to help the Allies and draw the nation
into war against the Axis. [While pro-Congress critics worry about a
president's foreign adventurism, the **real threat** to our **national
security** could come from **inaction** and
**isolationism**.]{.underline}

Many point to the Vietnam War as an example of the faults of the
"imperial presidency." [Vietnam]{.underline}, however, [could not have
continued without the consistent support of Congress in raising a large
military and paying for hostilities.]{.underline} And Vietnam ushered in
a period of congressional dominance that witnessed American setbacks in
the Cold War and the passage of the [**ineffectual** **W**ar **P**owers
**R**esolution]{.underline}. Congress passed the resolution in 1973 over
President Richard Nixon's veto, and [**no president** has ever
**accepted** the **constitutionality** of its 60-day limit on the use of
troops abroad. **No federal court** has ever **upheld** the resolution.
Even **Congress** has **never enforced it**.]{.underline}

Despite the record of practice and the Constitution's institutional
design, critics nevertheless argue that we should radically remake the
American way of war. They typically base their claim on Congress's power
to "declare war." But these observers read the 18th-century
constitutional text through a modern lens by interpreting "declare war"
to mean "start war." When the Constitution was written, however, a
declaration of war served diplomatic notice about a change in legal
relations between nations. It had little to do with launching
hostilities. In the century before the Constitution, for example, Great
Britain --- where the Framers got the idea of declaring war --- fought
numerous major conflicts but declared war only once beforehand.

Our Constitution sets out specific procedures for passing laws,
appointing officers, and making treaties. There are none for waging war
because the Framers expected the president and Congress to struggle over
war through the national political process. In fact, other parts of the
Constitution, properly read, support this reading. Article I, Section
10, for example, declares that the states shall not "engage" in war
"without the consent of Congress" unless "actually invaded, or in such
imminent danger as will not admit of delay." This provision creates
exactly the limits desired by anti-war critics, complete with an
exception for self-defense. If the Framers had wanted to require
congressional permission before the president could wage war, they
simply could have repeated this provision and applied it to the
executive.

Presidents, of course, do not have complete freedom to take the nation
to war. Congress has ample powers to control presidential policy, if it
wants to. Only Congress can raise the military, which gives it the power
to block, delay, or modify war plans. Before 1945, the United States had
such a small peacetime military that presidents who started a war would
have to go hat in hand to Congress to build an army to fight it. Since
World War II, Congress has authorized and funded our large standing
military, one primarily designed to conduct offensive, not defensive,
operations (as we learned all too tragically on 9/11) and to swiftly
project power worldwide. If Congress wanted to discourage presidential
initiative in war, it could build a smaller, less offense-minded
military.

[Congress's check]{.underline} on the presidency lies not just in the
long-term raising of the military. It [can]{.underline} also
[block]{.underline} any [immediate **armed conflict** through the
**power of the purse**.]{.underline} If Congress feels it has been
misled in authorizing war, or it disagrees with the president's
decisions, all it need do is cut off funds, either all at once or
gradually. [It can **reduce** the **size** of the **military**, shrink
or **eliminate units**, or **freeze supplies**.]{.underline} Using the
power of the purse does not even require affirmative congressional
action. [Congress can just sit on its hands and refuse to pass a law
funding the latest presidential adventure, and the war will end
quickly]{.underline}. Even the Kosovo war, which lasted little more than
two months and involved no ground troops, required special funding
legislation.

The Framers expected Congress's power of the purse to serve as the
primary check on presidential war. During the 1788 Virginia ratifying
convention. Patrick Henry attacked the Constitution for failing to limit
executive militarism. James Madison responded: "The sword is in the
hands of the British king; the purse is in the hands of the Parliament.
It is so in America, as far as any analogy can exist." Congress ended
America's involvement in Vietnam by cutting off all funds for the war.

Our [Constitution has succeeded because it **favors swift presidential
action** in war]{.underline}, later checked by Congress's funding power.
If a president continues to wage war without congressional
authorization, as in Libya, Kosovo, or Korea, it is only because
Congress has chosen not to exercise its easy check. We should not
confuse a desire to escape political responsibility for a defect in the
Constitution.

[A **radical change** in the system for making war]{.underline} might
appease critics of presidential power. But it [could]{.underline} also
[**seriously threaten** American **national security**.]{.underline} In
order to forestall another 9/11 attack, or take advantage of a window of
opportunity to strike terrorists or rogue nations, [the executive branch
needs **flexibility**.]{.underline} It is not hard to think of
situations where [congressional consent **cannot be obtained** in time
to act. Time for congressional **deliberation**]{.underline}, which [can
lead to **passivity** and **isolation** and not **smarter decisions**,
will come at the price of **speed** and **secrecy**.]{.underline}

The Constitution creates a presidency that can respond forcefully to
prevent serious threats to our national security. [Presidents can take
the initiative]{.underline}, and Congress can use its funding power
[to]{.underline} check presidents. Instead of demanding a legalistic
process to begin war, the Framers left war to politics. As we [confront
the new challenges of **terrorism**, **rogue nations**, and **WMD
prolif**eration]{.underline}, now is not the time to introduce sweeping,
untested changes in the way we make war.

PRESSURE POLITICS --- [Something]{.underline} quite [**striking** has
happened in Washington since Russia invaded Ukraine.
**[Congress]{.mark}** --- which typically takes a **back seat** on
foreign policy matters --- [has]{.mark} **repeatedly [driven]{.mark}**
the [**White House** beyond]{.mark} its [**comfort zone** with]{.mark}
**bipartisan [demands]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} more **[assertive]{.mark}
[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[It started with calls for **tougher [sanctions]{.mark}**, then
escalated to an appeal for a larger **military** and **humanitarian
[assistance]{.mark}** package]{.underline}. Members of both parties then
clamored for [a U.S. **[ban on]{.mark} [Russian]{.mark}
oil**]{.underline}, which the White House saw as politically risky given
the effect on gas prices at home. And they insisted that the U.S. end
permanent normal trade relations with Russia.

The [[tactics]{.mark} have **[worked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And this
week, [[lawmakers]{.mark} will be at it again]{.underline} --- this time
[[nudging]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration [to go **further than it wants** [in]{.mark}
facilitating]{.underline} the [[**transfer** of]{.mark} **fighter
[jets]{.mark}**]{.underline} from Poland to Ukraine.

The White House POV: The [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} White House ---
[[worried about **ratcheting up tensions**]{.mark} with the
Kremlin]{.underline} --- has rejected Poland's offer to move their
Soviet-style planes. Indeed, [[Russia]{.mark} over the weekend
[warned]{.mark} that [it would view]{.mark} any such [**delivery**
as]{.mark} an **[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and signaled that
any such convoys (even American-delivered ones) would be considered
"legitimate targets."

Alex Ward, who anchors POLITICO's National Security Daily newsletter,
noted Sunday that [the [administration has gone **out**]{.mark} [**of
its way** to **avoid**]{.mark} **any [moves]{.mark}** [that could
**trigger**]{.mark} **further [conflict]{.mark}** with **Russia**. It
has even taken steps back to **ease tensions**]{.underline}, such as
canceling special operations training and delaying missile tests. Our
colleagues also scooped Sunday that a "Pentagon push to send more
trainers to Ukraine was scrapped in December amid White House fears of
provoking Russia."

The supporters' POV: Supporters of approving a transfer of fighter jets
argue that Russia has drawn multiple lines that the West has already
crossed --- and that VLADIMIR PUTIN is the aggressor here. Sen. ROB
PORTMAN (R-Ohio), speaking from the Ukraine-Poland border, noted on
CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday that Putin had also called
sanctions an "act of war" and warned the U.S. against providing
stringers and helicopters.

"What we've heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly,"
Portman said of the planes. "They want the ability to have better
control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. I don't
understand why we're not doing it."

The build-up: While [Republicans led the charge]{.underline} calling for
the transfer last week, over the weekend we saw some [Hill Democrats
join the fray]{.underline}. Ex-military Democratic Reps. JASON CROW
(Colo.), JARED GOLDEN (Maine) and CHRISSY HOULAHAN (Pa.) and a couple of
others [signed a bipartisan letter backing the move]{.underline}, as we
first reported in Playbook PM on Friday. By Sunday, [the
58-member-strong bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus --- half Democrats
--- had joined them]{.underline}.

"With Russia's alarming disregard for Ukrainian civilian casualties, the
U.S. must ... help supply more comprehensive air defense systems to
defend Ukraine and its people," the letter read.

Meanwhile, Sen. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minn.) --- who doesn't break often with
President JOE BIDEN --- said the U.S. shouldn't rule out making the
transfer: "I have made clear to them --- I spoke to the president
himself about 10 days ago about this --- I'd like to see the planes over
there," she said on "State of the Union," floating the idea of other
types of air defense assistance that could also work. "I still don't
rule out having planes at some point."

So is it just a matter of time before the Biden White House flips and
moves on the Poland transfer? Perhaps. What is clear is that [[Congress
has]{.mark} [had **success** with]{.mark} this type of [**vocal**,
**bipart**]{.mark}**isan [push]{.mark}** before]{.underline}. WaPo's Amy
Wang has more on the bipartisan movement on the plane issue. (Read on
for more on Ukraine below.)

As more information comes out about the proximate causes of the
Taliban's swift takeover of Afghanistan, AEI's Kori Schake has a good
op-ed in the New York Times reminding everyone (including Trump
administration officials hoping for national amnesia) about the February
2020 deal that the Trump administration negotiated with the Taliban that
set the table for the horrible meal we are all digesting now.

That agreement led to "the release of 5,000 combat and political Taliban
prisoners" and bypassed the Afghan government entirely. As Schake
writes, "For someone who prided himself on his abilities as a dealmaker
and displayed an 'I alone can fix it' arrogance, the agreement he made
with the Taliban is one of the most disgraceful diplomatic bargains on
record."

The deeper point to Schake's op-ed, however, is that President Donald
Trump's debacle is simply the most recent and most prominent example of
a U.S. president believing that personal diplomacy can solve everything.
Instead, "presidents should return to the practice of persuading their
fellow Americans of the merits of agreements with foreign powers."

If they do not, [Schake advises Congress to reclaim its powers over
foreign affairs]{.underline}:

Congress can begin by [reasserting its role in diplomacy and requiring
specific authorizations for the use of military force rather than
continuing to acquiesce to claims that existing executive authorizations
can be endlessly expanded. It should refuse the shifting of funds
previously authorized and appropriated for other purposes]{.underline}
(Mr. Trump made such shifts to construct the border wall). It should
reject foreign policy changes enacted by executive order rather than
congressional approval, [and it should force the Supreme Court to
clarify the extent of the president's war powers.]{.underline}

[Agreements with foreign powers]{.underline}, whether states,
international institutions or organizations like the Taliban, [should be
submitted to Congress for a vote. The best way to prevent catastrophic
foreign policy mistakes is to require the 535 representatives of the
American people to put their jobs on the line, become informed, and
support, reject or modify a president's program]{.underline}. Congress
tried to slow or block Mr. Trump's planned drawdown of U.S. forces.
Members who supported the Taliban deal should be explaining why they
thought the outcome would be different than the tragedy unfolding in
Afghanistan now. Apathy and unaccountability are the real enemies of
good foreign policy. [Presidents get around oversight by offering
unilateral policy actions or claiming international agreements aren't
formal treaties. Congress shouldn't let a president from either party
get away with that.]{.underline}

As an analyst, I agree wholeheartedly with Schake's diagnosis of the
problem. One of the running themes in my own long-form writing on
American foreign policy --- see here, here, here, here and here --- has
been that a variety of factors has led to everyone treating the
president as the last adult in the room. This is a real problem when
Americans elect a petulant child to occupy the Oval Office.

Nor is this argument original to me. It begins with Arthur Schlesinger's
"The Imperial Presidency," continues with Andrew Rudalevige's "The New
Imperial Presidency," proceeds with Linda Fowler's "Watchdogs on the
Hill" and so forth.

The [diagnosis makes sense --- but Schake's proposed remedy does
not]{.underline}, for two reasons. First, most members of [**Congress**
[have **little incentive** to **act responsibly**]{.mark} on **foreign
affairs**]{.underline}. As Helen Milner and Dustin Tingley note in
"Sailing the Water's Edge," [what motivates Congress is the distribution
of concentrated **costs** and **benefits**. Foreign affairs, which is
mostly about advancing the **national interest**, has **very little of
this outside** of the defense budget]{.underline}.

As a result, [most **individual members** of [Congress **do not care**
about **foreign policy**, except as]{.mark} an [**exercise in
partisanship**. Neither do]{.mark} their
**[constituents]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The result is that [[when
Congress does get involved]{.mark} in foreign affairs, [it is]{.mark}
mostly [through displays of]{.mark} **self-sabotaging
[symbolism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as passing JASTA or impulsively
flying to Kabul in the middle of a rescue mission or, as I noted in
Foreign Affairs, imposing economic sanctions [so that they "can tell
their constituents that they are doing something about a problem even if
that something **isn't working**]{.underline}."

Now it could be argued that if Schake's proposed reforms were enacted,
the shared sense of responsibility would focus the mind of Congress,
[leaving lawmakers]{.underline} no choice but [to act
responsibly]{.underline}. Alas, that [is **highly
unlikely**]{.underline}, for two reasons. First, [even if
[Congress]{.mark} was **blamed collectively** for **inaction** in
**foreign affairs**, individual members [**would not be punished**
by]{.mark} their **[constituents]{.mark}**. Ordinary [Americans **barely
consider foreign policy**]{.mark} when voting for the
president]{.underline}, much less their House representative.

Second, [[when]{.mark} a foreign policy **[crisis]{.mark}** does
[emerge]{.mark}]{.underline}, attention naturally gravitates toward 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue. [Congress has **535** individual voices; the
president is a **singular voice**]{.underline}. During a crisis, the
[[**president** will always have]{.mark} the **[incentive to]{.mark}
act** [us]{.mark}ing **[exec]{.mark}utive [power]{.mark}** []{.mark}in
the face of congressional **gridlock**]{.underline}. Furthermore, that
very [[gridlock]{.mark} will **[enable]{.mark} the president** to get
away with **[power grabs]{.mark}** more often]{.underline} than not. [So
long as a president's party provides **backup**, [there is
**little**]{.mark} that [Congress can do]{.mark}]{.underline} as an
institution [[to **constrain exec**]{.mark}**utive
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This is normally the point in the column when the hard-working staff
here at Spoiler Alerts offers a better solution. [This is a
[problem]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [that **[cannot]{.mark}**
necessarily [**be fixed** given]{.mark} the [current]{.mark} **political
[incentives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The best I can offer is to try to
further institutionalize consultations with congressional leadership in
a manner akin to reading in the Gang of Eight on intelligence matters.

I grant that this is weak beer. [The [problem is **structural**]{.mark}.
Presidents care about foreign policy because of the **national
interest** and]{.underline} also [because it's the arena where
presidents have the most **latitude**]{.underline}. Members of [Congress
**do not care** most of the time]{.underline}. And [the reason they do
not care is that their **constituents** really **do not
care**]{.underline}. Until something changes in that last sentence, [the
[status quo will **persist**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What does it mean to say that the United States suffers from an
"[Imperial Presidency Problem]{.underline}?" For at least the last fifty
years, it [has defined a]{.underline} line of [critique of]{.underline}
the [**Presidential power** to make war without the **consent of
Congress**]{.underline}.

The [vast expansion of]{.underline} the [standing military
establishment]{.underline} in World War II [meant that post-war
Presidents had the means to **wage war** at the **times** and **places**
of their choosing]{.underline}. The [development of nuclear weapons
meant that [Presidents **need**]{.mark}**ed the [authority]{.mark}** [to
make decisions]{.mark} of **war** and **peace** [**immediately**,
without]{.mark} the **advice** and **consent** of
**[Congress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, there is a long history
of Presidents waging wars without Congressional intervention, but the
advent of the Cold War raised the stakes immensely. In 1950, President
Truman's decision to intervene in the civil war on the Korean Peninsula
seemed a harbinger of a vast expansion of Presidential power over war
and peace.

The problem was seen as so serious at near the end of the Vietnam War
that Congress passed the War Powers Resolution in 1973 in an effort to
limit Presidential prerogative with respect to warmaking. Congressional
critics of Presidential warmaking power have continued their efforts to
restrain imperial Presidents down to the present day; a bipartisan
coalition of lawmakers attempted to constrain President Trump's support
for the Saudi war in Yemen, albeit with little success. More recently,
Senators Bernie Sanders, Mike Lee, and Chris Murphy proposed a sweeping
overhaul of the national security prerogatives of the President that
would significantly expand upon and clarify the War Powers Resolution.

But what if the [Imperial Presidency is]{.underline}, at least
partially, [a **myth**]{.underline}?

Patrick Hulme, a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University
of California at San Diego, has work circulating about the importance of
the precedent of the Korean War in Presidential thinking. As Hulme
argues, "[Truman's successors took a specific lesson away from the
Korean War: by failing to have members of **Congress publicly commit**
to **armed intervention** via a **formal vote ex ante**, they left
themselves **vulnerable** to highly damaging congressional action
**ex-post** if the **use of force** did not end in **victory**."
[Presidents]{.mark} don't [seek]{.mark} Congressional [approval
for]{.mark} every mission, but for [interventions that may last a **long
time** or have]{.mark} the [potential to **go badly**]{.mark}, they
**want Congress** on board]{.underline}.

We can see this with respect to President Obama's decision not to strike
Syria in 2013. Obama's initial instinct, testified to by many with
access to the deliberations, was to launch an attack on Syria as soon as
possible. At the same time, it seems that Obama became less certain that
US involvement could be limited to a few airstrikes. The Syrian
government was weak but in no danger of imminent collapse, and Obama
worried that initial strikes would require a follow-up if Assad
continued to use chemical weapons. This makes sense in the context of
Hulme's model; [a [President]{.mark} who may be **entirely willing** to
conduct a **quick**, **one-off strike** without **Congressional
approval** [will find it]{.mark} altogether [**less pleasant** to
launch]{.mark} a **[long-term]{.mark} military [operation]{.mark}**
**[without]{.mark} bringing [Congress]{.mark}** on board]{.underline}.

The real danger would be for a President to decide upon war without
consulting Congress and then earn public adulation for acting
effectively as a lawless warlord, or assume that Congress will
eventually be forced to support them. [Presidents do not launch wars in
**anticipation** that they will become **more popular** over time. The
**more engagement** the conflict requires, the more a President wants to
begin the war with **clear [Congressional
support]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this sense, [Congress
[provides]{.mark} the [President with]{.mark} a degree of **[protection
against critics]{.mark}** in case a military operation goes
bad]{.underline}.

The belief that launching and waging a war independently of Congress
would result in popularity would be truly dangerous to both America and
the world. Fortunately, [Presidents]{.underline} don't tend to act in
this way. Rather, they [see [unilateral war]{.mark}, especially when the
chance of a prolonged engagement [is]{.mark} high, as [too **politically
risky**. Even when Presidents claim that they do not **need**
Congressional authority]{.mark}]{.underline} to launch a war, [[they
seek such]{.mark} authority [because they want]{.mark} **political
[protection]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And in truth it is unclear that
Congressional approval did much to protect Johnson from the verdict of
Vietnam or George W. Bush from the verdict of Iraq; both Presidents bore
the brunt of public criticism for the decision to go to war,
notwithstanding the approval of Congress.

Thus, the problem is less that the "imperial" President launches wars
without the authorization of Congress. [The [problem is]{.mark} that
[Congress]{.mark} has [displayed]{.mark} **all-too-much
[willingness]{.mark}** [to go along with]{.mark} even the **[worst
wars]{.mark}** that a President seeks to undertake]{.underline}. None of
this means that reforming Presidential warmaking powers isn't a good
idea. In particular, giving Congress more control over presidential
power at low levels of escalation (arms sales, for example) clearly
seems to be a good idea. Moreover, we should not underestimate the
ability of a President to control the public discourse, and especially
to control the flow of intelligence. Both the Vietnam War and the Iraq
War were launched with a faulty intelligence frame; the executive
characterized and distorted existing intelligence to paint a picture
favorable to war. But as always, resolving the problem requires careful
analysis of the extent of the problem.

### 2ac -- flex good -- renewables

#### Biden's using [executive wartime powers]{.underline} to secure [critical minerals]{.underline} to develop clean energy -- [broad national security flex]{.underline} is key

The [[White House is]{.mark} weighing [using]{.mark} **wartime
[exec]{.mark}utive [powers]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} boost U.S. battery
production to help [secure]{.mark}]{.underline} supplies for the growing
market for electric vehicles and power storage on [the **electric
grid**]{.underline}, according to two people familiar with the Biden
administration's thinking.

President Joe [Biden would use the Defense Production Act to help secure
U.S. sources of **[critical minerals]{.mark}** [that
are]{.mark}]{.underline} deemed [[key components of **clean
energy**]{.mark} technology]{.underline}. While the U.S. possesses many
of those minerals, industry and some lawmakers of both parties contend
[**regulations** have **deterred development** and forced the U.S. to
**rely on supplies** from nations like **China**, **Russia**, **South
Africa** and **Australia**]{.underline}.

"[As we [break]{.mark} our [**dependence** on
foreign]{.mark}]{.underline} sources of [[**oil** and]{.mark} **natural
[gas]{.mark}**, we must ensure]{.underline} that we [[secure]{.mark} the
materials necessary for]{.underline} the **[[clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** economy [in a way
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} holds to our strong environmental, labor,
Tribal engagement standards and [[does not leave us **reliant**
on]{.mark} **unreliable** and [**unsustainable** **foreign supply
chains**]{.mark}]{.underline}," one of the people said.

The [move to use an **emergency national defense law**]{.underline}
dating to the Cold War [comes as]{.underline} the [prices of battery
minerals like nickel, lithium and cobalt, have **surged**
during]{.underline} Russia's war in [Ukraine]{.underline}. [Russia is a
**leading producer**]{.underline} of nickel, copper and other minerals.
[[Prices were already rising]{.underline}]{.mark} before Russia's
invasion [[because]{.mark} of forecasts that [**global supply** won't
keep up with]{.mark} surging **[demand]{.mark}**]{.underline} expected
from electrifying economies.

Influential lawmakers led by Democratic Sen. Joe
**[Manchin]{.underline}** (D-W. Va.), chair of the Energy Committee,
[and]{.underline} Sen. Lisa **[Murkowski]{.underline}** (R-Alaska)
[called]{.underline} last month [for]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [to invoke the Defense Production Act
to boost]{.underline} the [**production** and **processing** of
**critical minerals**, citing the ongoing supply chain crisis and the
vulnerability of]{.underline} depending on [Russian mineral
supplies]{.underline}.

"It's a nice start. If you are going to go whole hog on electric and you
don't have the minerals, you ought to do something," Sen. Bill Cassidy
(R-La.), who signed a letter with Manchin and Murkowski prodding the
Biden administration to take the action, said in an interview. Several
Democratic senators wrote to Biden two weeks later expressing concern
over supply chain issues related to the Ukraine crisis, too.

Rich Nolan, CEO of the National Mining Association, said the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [is sending a "strong signal" to the
marketplace by taking action]{.underline}.

"[It's going to incentivize getting]{.underline} some of these
[materials to the marketplace]{.underline} right when we need it," Nolan
said in an interview.

The effort Biden is considering would not circumvent or speed up
permitting and environmental reviews, one of the people familiar with
the plan said, a likely nod to the fact that some Democrats and green
groups are wary of expanding mining on U.S. soil.

Instead, [the [actions would act]{.mark} almost [as]{.mark} an
**[investment vehicle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the person said. [Adding
minerals like nickel, lithium, graphite, manganese and cobalt to a list
of covered materials under the [D]{.mark}efense [P]{.mark}roduction
[A]{.mark}ct's Title III program could [help companies **secure money**
from a **fund**]{.mark} designed to ensure the U.S. maintains an
**industrial base** for **wartime capabilities**. Those dollars would
finance **feasibility studies** along with productivity and safety
improvements]{.underline} rather than directly buying minerals.

A 2019 Congressional Research Service report found the [U.S. **relies
wholly on imports** for 14 critical minerals]{.underline}, including
manganese, graphite and rare earths.

The move is in line with previous uses of [the Defense Production Act,
which **[explicitly grants]{.mark}** the [president authority]{.mark}
[to address]{.mark} the [**mining** and]{.mark} production of
**[minerals]{.mark}** that are [considered **essential** to]{.mark} the
[nation's security]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was invoked in the 1950s to
ensure an adequate supply of steel for use in the Korean War and again
during the Cold War to establish domestic aluminum and titanium
industries and reduce reliance on foreign sources.

"[[These are]{.underline}]{.mark} all [[things that]{.mark} the [U.S.
needs to]{.mark}]{.underline} help [[build]{.mark} up the]{.underline}
U.S. [**[mining industry]{.mark}** into something that is [capable of
navigating]{.mark} the **[energy transition]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
said Jordy Lee, a program manager at the Payne Institute for Public
Policy at the Colorado School of Mines. "Demand estimates show 1000
percent increases in lithium demand, 200 percent increases in nickel
demand, etc, and the U.S. mining industry is struggling."

Efforts to expand domestic mining production have already hit roadblocks
at the state and local level, as litigation, state mining laws and
environmental opposition have stymied some projects. The Biden
administration itself canceled the leases for a major proposed
copper-nickel mine in Minnesota earlier this year.

#### Decarbonizing the grid is sufficient to mitigate the catastrophic effects of global warming \-- top predictive studies conclude [it's the only way]{.underline}

A similar [mobilization will be necessary for the US to
[decarbonize]{.mark} its economy]{.underline} **[[fast enough to
avert]{.mark} the [worst of climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To do
its part in limiting global temperature rise to between 1.5° and 2°
Celsius, [the US must reach net-zero carbon emissions by
2050]{.underline} at the latest. To achieve this, the full resources of
the US economy must be bent toward manufacturing the needed clean-energy
technology and infrastructure. FDR began with two questions. First, he
asked not what was politically feasible but what was necessary to win
the war. He also asked not how much funding was available in the federal
budget but how much productive capacity was available in the economy ---
what was possible. [Saul Griffith is trying to answer those same
questions on climate change]{.underline}: what is necessary, given the
trajectory of global warming, and what is possible, given the resources
in the US economy. [A physicist, engineer, researcher, inventor, serial
entrepreneur]{.underline}, and MacArthur "genius" grant winner,
[Griffith's recent work spans two organizations]{.underline}. First, [he
is founder]{.underline} and chief scientist [at Otherlab, an independent
research]{.underline} and [design lab that has mapped the energy
economy. And]{.underline} alongside Alex Laskey, co-founder of Opower,
[he]{.underline} recently [started Rewiring America, which will
develop]{.underline} and advocate for [policies to rapidly decarbonize
the US]{.underline} through electrification. (The organization is going
to release a book called --- be still my heart --- Electrify
Everything.) Last week, Rewiring America made its big debut with [a jobs
report show]{.underline}ing [that rapid]{.underline} [decarbonization
through electrification]{.underline} **[would create]{.underline}** 15
million to **[20 million jobs]{.underline}** in the next decade, with 5
million permanent jobs after that. For the most part, the media covered
it as just another jobs report, saying basically what other clean-energy
jobs reports have said. But the jobs are, in many; ways, the least
interesting part of the work. Much more interesting is Griffith's larger
project the model he's built and its implications. In a nutshell, he has
shown that [[it's possible to eliminate]{.underline}]{.mark} 70 percent
to **[[80 percent of]{.mark} US [carbon emissions]{.mark} by
2035]{.underline}** [[through]{.mark} rapid [deployment
o]{.mark}f]{.underline} existing [electrification
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}, [with little-to-no carbon capture
and sequestration]{.underline}. **[[Doing so would slash]{.mark} US
[energy demand]{.mark} by]{.underline}** around **[half]{.underline}**,
[[save consumers money]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and keep the country on a
1.5° pathway]{.underline} without requiring particular behavior changes.
Everyone could still have their same cars and houses --- they would just
need to be electric. "[The report reinforces a key
finding]{.underline}," says Leah Stokes, an environmental policy expert
at the University of California Santa Barbara. "**[[Cleaning up]{.mark}
the [electricity]{.mark} system [solves the lion's share]{.mark} of the
problem.]{.underline}** [It allows us to electrify]{.underline} our
[transportation]{.underline} and [building sectors and]{.underline}
parts of [heavy industry]{.underline}, [which [would address **more than
70 percent of**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}total
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**." Some of Griffith's conclusions
run contrary to conventional wisdom in the energy space. And they are
oddly optimistic. Despite the titanic effort it would take to
decarbonize, [the US doesn't need any new technologies and it doesn't
require any grand]{.underline} national [sacrifice]{.underline}. [All
[it needs]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this view, [is a
**[serious]{.mark}**]{.underline} commitment to building the necessary
machines and creating a **[[regulatory]{.underline}]{.mark}** and policy
**[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** that supports their rapid
deployment. In this post, I will walk through the energy data he's
assembled, what the data reveals about the fastest way to decarbonize,
how fast that decarbonization could be accomplished, why it's doable,
its political challenges, and its political promise. Griffith's work is
among the most interesting contributions to the climate discussion in
ages. There's a lot here, but it is worth your time. Let's start with
how he built the model. How energy is used in the US economy, explained
In 2018, after applying for years, Otherlab was finally awarded a
contract from the Department of Energy's Advanced Research Projects
Agency-Energy to assemble in one place, for the first time, all publicly
available data on how energy is used in the US. As it happens, [the US
has great energy data]{.underline}. In response to the oil crisis of the
1970s, presidents created the Energy Information Administration, the
Department of Energy, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Those
agencies began gathering data on how energy is generated, transported,
and used in various parts of the economy, and since have accumulated an
enormous catalog. [Oddly, all that data has never been]{.underline}
gathered, harmonized, and [put in a single database]{.underline}. So
Griffith and colleagues spent years poring over agency output from the
last 50 years --- he ruefully cops to being "the only person on the
planet who has read every footnote of every DOE report since 1971" ---
and assembling it in a massive dashboard, which you can view here. It
tracks where every unit of energy enters the economy and how it is used
as it passes through. This is not a model, per se, it's just lots and
lots of data visualized, a close-up "machine-level" view of energy flows
in the US economy. But having the data in one place provides the raw
material for Rewiring America to build a high-resolution model of what
it would actually take to decarbonize --- how many machines must be
built, what kind, and how fast. "[Where most studies look at
decarbonization in specific]{.underline} individual
[sectors]{.underline} such as transportation, the electricity grid, or
buildings --- and mostly only on the supply side," the Rewiring America
report says, "[we build a model of the **interactions of all
sectors**]{.underline}, both supply and demand, [in a **rapid and
total** decarbonization]{.underline}." [[The fastest way to decarbonize
is to **electrify everything**]{.mark}]{.underline} Griffith begins with
a core assumption: [We need to make a plan]{.underline} to solve the
problem [with the tools available]{.underline}. [It is
**unwise**]{.underline}, for instance, [to bet on a large amount of
carbon capture]{.underline} and [sequestration]{.underline} coming
online in time to make a difference. [The technologies are **still in
the early stage**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} there are strong
arguments [they will **never pencil out.**]{.underline} Griffith takes a
"yes, and" approach. If carbon capture sequestration works out, great.
If next-gen nuclear reactors work out, great. If hydrogen-based fuels
work out, great. But [we shouldn't rely on any of them **until they are
real.**]{.underline} We need to figure out how to do the job with the
technology available. On that score, [Griffith's modeling reaches two
key conclusions.]{.underline} First, it is still possible to reduce US
greenhouse gas emissions in line with a 1.5°C pathway. Specifically, [it
is possible to reduce US emissions]{.underline} 70 percent to **[80
percent]{.underline}** by 2035 (and to zero by 2050) **[through rapid
electrification]{.underline}**, [relying on]{.underline} five already
well-developed technologies: wind and [solar power plants,]{.underline}
rooftop solar, [electric vehicles, heat pumps, and
batteries]{.underline}. Think of those technologies as the
infrastructure of 21st century life. If everyone uses carbon-free energy
to heat their homes and get around, the bulk of the problem will be
solved. Second, to decarbonize in time, [[substitution of clean-energy
tec]{.mark}h]{.underline}nologies for their fossil-fuel counterparts
[[must ramp up]{.mark} to 100 percent **[as fast as
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, after a brief period of industrial
mobilization. Every time a gas or diesel car is replaced, it must be
replaced with an EV; every time an oil or gas furnace is replaced, it
must be replaced with a heat pump; every time a coal or gas power plant
goes offline, it must be replaced with renewable energy. There is no
room left in a 1.5° or 2° scenario for more fossil fuel infrastructure
or machines. We need to radically ramp up production of electrification
technologies and implement the policy and financing tools that will
enable 100 percent substitution. Clocking the maximum feasible
transition to clean energy Griffith and his colleagues set out to model
a "maximum feasible transition" to carbon-free energy, limited only by
the country's production capacity. They describe it like this: The
maximum feasible transition (MFT) involves two primary stages: (i) an
aggressive WWII--style production ramp--up of 3--5 years, followed by
(ii) an intensive deployment of decarbonized infrastructure and
technology up to 2035. This includes supply--side generation
technologies as well as demand--side technologies such as electric
vehicles and building heat electrification. When it says production
ramp-up, it's no joke. Within three to five years, production of
electric vehicles would have to increase four-fold, batteries 16-fold,
wind turbines 12-fold, and solar modules 10-fold.
[[Accommodating]{.mark} all those new [electricity
loads]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[mean]{.underline} **[expanding]{.underline}**]{.mark} the size of
**[[the grid]{.mark} by three- or four-fold]{.underline}**. "Today, we
deliver about 450 gigawatts constantly," says Griffith. "[In the model
of the future]{.underline} --- where everyone's house is the same size,
everyone's car is the same size, but it's all electrified --- [you need
to deliver 1,500 to 2,000 gigawatts]{.underline}." (To be clear,
Griffith doesn't necessarily think Americans should keep driving giant
cars and living in giant houses. He supports urbanism and cycling and
downsizing generally. He spent many years running a radical downsizing
experiment on his own life. But he wants the public to know that
changing their lifestyle is not necessary for decarbonization.) [[Almost
all]{.mark} the [heavy lifting]{.mark} in the]{.underline} maximum
feasible [transition [is done by
**electrification**]{.mark}]{.underline}, "the exception being 5-10
Quads of non--electrical energy sources coming from \[biofuels\]" the
Rewiring America report says. "Hydrogen or other synthetic fuels (which
are generated from electricity) are deployed for a few high--temperature
applications. The scenario does not rely on any deployment of carbon
capture and storage, and all primary energy sources are net zero." [In
terms of generation, **wind and solar do the bulk of the
work**]{.underline}, "along with a doubling of the current nuclear
electricity fleet from 100GW to 200GW." In particular, **[[distributed
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** (rooftop and community solar and
batteries) **[plays a huge role]{.underline}**, "[accounting for around
25% of energy supply]{.underline} and a high degree of the storage
capacity" [**[would reduce]{.mark} the amount of [energy]{.mark} the US
[needs]{.mark} by half.** One key aspect of electrification makes this
transformation possible]{.underline}, and it represents perhaps the most
astonishing finding in Griffith's modeling: **[[Large-scale
electrification would slash]{.mark} total US [primary energy demand in
half]{.mark}]{.underline}**, from around 100 quads to about 45-50.
**[This a huge deal]{.underline}** --- [it means America only needs to
produce about half the energy with renewables that it is currently
producing with fossil fuels.]{.underline} And [that massive drop in
demand assumes no behavior change, no insulated buildings]{.underline}
or double-glazed windows, [no]{.underline} traditional ["efficiency"
measures of any kind]{.underline}. The transition from fossil fuel
combustion to electricity, in and of itself, is the largest demand-side
climate policy available. How is that possible? The simple answer comes
down to the fact that [electric motors are more efficient than fossil
fueled motors at converting primary energy]{.underline} into useful
work. The somewhat more complicated answer is this. You cut almost 10
percent off of energy demand right off the bat, says Griffith, because
the Energy Information Administration has been overestimating, due to
the way it accounts for nuclear and hydroelectric energy. (It's too
complicated to get into here.) Another 10 percent of energy used in
today's economy goes toward "finding, mining, refining, and transporting
fossil fuels," Griffith says, and that demand goes away in an
electrified economy. So it's down to 80 percent left to replace.
Shifting from fossil fuel power plants to renewable energy saves another
15 percent, because carbon-free, non-thermal power sources rely on fewer
energy conversions than thermoelectric sources. Electrifying
transportation gets another 15 percent, because electric vehicles (EVs)
are more efficient than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.
Electrifying buildings gets another 6 percent to 9 percent. To be clear,
the US could reduce demand even more if it continued to better insulate
buildings and other efficiency measures, if it downsized homes, drove
less, and relied more on walking and electric cycling to get around. But
it is worth emphasizing, again: [The biggest demand-side policy by far
is electrification, which could slash US energy demand by
half.]{.underline} "You can't efficiency your way to zero," Griffith
says. "You have to transform." [Industry is **not as big a carbon
problem** as it appears The alleged difficulty of decarbonizing heavy
industry has been a major topic]{.underline} in carbon circles lately.
(I have written about it myself.) It is one of the reasons often offered
for why large-scale negative emissions will be needed. **[Griffith
disagrees]{.underline}**. [He points out that a big chunk
of]{.underline} the [[carbon emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} attributed
to industry [are devoted to fossil fuels]{.underline} **[and [will
disappear]{.mark} as they do]{.underline}**. For instance, 4 percent to
5 percent of US energy is used to turn oil into gasoline, a subcategory
of industry that will decline along with ICE vehicles. As for the rest,
"[steel is tiny, and we can **use hydrogen to make
steel**]{.underline}," he says. "Aluminum traditionally makes a lot of
CO2 because we use carbon electrodes for the smelting process; Alcoa and
Rio Tinto already have carbonless electrodes for aluminum. Cement is
still hard, but that's only 1 percent. And [the rest of industrial heat
can mostly be done with induction for high-temperature heat or heat
pumps]{.underline} for low-temperature heat." In short, [industry is a
problem, but a **relatively small one**]{.underline}. "It's the last 5
percent of emissions," Griffith says. "It's hardly the thing that should
stop us."

nonviable]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the dry subtropics. [Most
regions]{.underline} in the world [see]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
significant [drop in food production]{.underline} and increasing numbers
of extreme weather events, **[including [heat waves, floods and
storms]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Food production is inadequate to feed the
global population and **[[food prices skyrocket]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
as a consequence of a one-fifth decline in crop yields, a decline in the
nutrition content of food crops, [a catastrophic decline in insect
populations, desertification, monsoon failure and chronic water
shortages]{.underline}, and conditions too hot for human habitation in
significant food-growing regions. The lower reaches of the
agriculturally-important river deltas such as the Mekong, Ganges and
Nile are inundated, and significant sectors of some of the world's most
populous cities --- including Chennai, Mumbai, Jakarta, Guangzhou,
Tianjin, Hong Kong, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Lagos, Bangkok and
Manila --- are abandoned. Some small islands become uninhabitable. Ten
percent of Bangladesh is inundated, displacing 15 million people.
According to the Global Challenges Foundation's Global Catastrophic
Risks 2018 report, [even for 2°C of warming, more than a billion people
may need to be relocated]{.underline} due to sea-level rise, and In
high-end scenarios "**[the [scale of destruction is beyond]{.mark} our
[capacity to model]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with a high likelihood of
human civilisation coming to an end".22 National security consequences:
For pragmatic reasons associated with providing only a sketch of this
scenario, we take the conclusion of the ​Age of Consequences 'Severe' 3°C
scenario developed by a group of senior US national-security figures in
2007 as appropriate for our scenario too: [Massive [nonlinear
events]{.mark} in the global environment [give rise to]{.mark} ​massive
nonlinear societal events]{.underline}​. In this scenario, [nations
around the world **will be ​overwhelmed**]{.underline} [by the scale
of]{.underline} change and pernicious [challenges, **such as [pandemic
disease]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The **[internal cohesion]{.underline}**
of nations **[will be under great stress]{.underline}**, including in
the United States, both [as a result of]{.underline} a dramatic rise in
[migration and changes in agricultural patterns and water]{.underline}
availability. The **[[flooding]{.underline}]{.mark}** of coastal
communities **[around the world]{.underline}**, especially in the
Netherlands, the United States, South Asia, and China, [has the
potential to challenge regional]{.underline} and even national
[identities]{.underline}.​ **[[Armed conflict between nations]{.mark}
over resources]{.underline}**, such as the Nile and its tributaries,
**[[is likely and]{.mark} nuclear [war is
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The social consequences range from
increased religious fervor to ​outright chaos​. In this scenario, climate
change provokes ​a permanent shift in the relationship of humankind to
nature​'.23 (emphasis added)

[**Multiple parties** have sought to **litigate** the **W**ar **P**owers
**R**esolution]{.underline}. 59 The [War Powers Resolution has proven
resistant to litigation.]{.underline} 60 The first problem is standing
discussed in Part II.B.1.a. 61 Beyond standing are other judicial
doctrines barring litigation in Part II.B.1.b. 62

a\. Standing for Plaintiff to a Lawsuit, whether member of Congress or
not

[Standing is a fundamental **constitutional concept**.]{.underline} 63
[If **plaintiffs** **lack standing**, **courts dismiss** the
**lawsuit**.]{.underline} 64 [Standing means that plaintiffs can show
**particularized injury** in their complaint]{.underline}, and does not
include taxpayers. 65 [**Two types** of **plaintiffs** have brought
**lawsuits** over the War Powers Resolution and military force: (1)
members of **Congress** and (2) **everyone else**]{.underline}. 66

Members of the military, part of the everyone-elses, can also bring suit
like Captain Smith, whose complaint recited his injuries to show
standing. 67 His presumed legal injuries, however, did not grant
standing, and the courts have found other reasons to dismiss on standing
for military members. 68 Therefore, [standing is the **initial**
**constitutional hurdle** that **plaintiffs must
overcome**]{.underline}. 69

[**Member of Congress** have also **tried to litigate** the War Powers
Resolution]{.underline}. 70 Similarly, [members of Congress must also
have standing]{.underline}. 71 Likewise, [the **courts** have
**dismissed** Congressional members\' suits for **lacking
standing**]{.underline}, even claims of standing based on stewardship of
taxpayer dollars. 72 Although often lacking standing and thereby access
to the courts, members of Congress also have access to Congressional
fora to disagree with military action which they should utilize rather
than the courts. 73 Moreover, the [**courts** will typically **find**
that **Congress cannot litigate** the War Powers
Resolution]{.underline}. 74

#### 2 -- [doctrinal]{.underline} -- [mootness]{.underline}, [political question]{.underline}, [Feres]{.underline}, AND [court deference]{.underline} to the military lead to dismissal of suits -- if they [fiat through it]{.underline}, breaks the [state secrets doctrine]{.underline} AND [causes leaks]{.underline}

Lexis, nihara

b\. Dismissal Unattached to Standing

Beyond standing, [courts have other **doctrinal reasons** to **dismiss**
any **litigation** involving the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution
beyond simply standing]{.underline}. 75 One doctrine is [**mootness**,
and]{.underline} another is **[political question]{.underline}**. 76 The
[courts also have a **favored disposition** toward the **military** and
**national security**]{.underline}. 77 Finally, [the **Feres Doctrine**
**bars civil suits** against the military.]{.underline} 78 [All of these
doctrines lead to **dismissal**]{.underline}. 79

[Mootness means that a **controversy** is **no longer ripe**, and a
**recurring injury** **does not counter** mootness]{.underline}. 80
[Even if plaintiffs had standing to bring a case, **military action**
may **move too swiftly** for the courts to react]{.underline}. 81 In
short, [sometimes the **military action** has already **achieved its
purpose**, **removing** the **impetus** for the **lawsuit**, hence the
**problem of mootness**]{.underline}. 82

[Certain controversies are, by]{.underline} their nature, [**outside**
of **what** the **courts** will **entertain**]{.underline}; as Justice
Douglass noted [\"\[u\]sed to bar from]{.underline} the courts questions
which . . . the Constitution . . . left to the other two coordinate
Branches to resolve, viz., the so-called **[political
question]{.underline}**.\" 83 The political question doctrine is a
narrow doctrine and relates to the enumerated powers of the various
branches. 84 The [War Powers]{.underline} are enumerated powers, and the
[courts]{.underline} have [dismissed]{.underline} various [lawsuits
based on the **p**olitical **q**uestion **d**octrine]{.underline}. 85
For instance, the court noted the political question doctrine was an
alternative reason to dismiss Captain Smith\'s suit. 86 Thus, the
[**political question doctrine** is also a **bar** to **litigating** the
**War Powers** and **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution.]{.underline} 87

One [other ground for dismissal is]{.underline} general [**deference**
to the **military** and **national security**.]{.underline} 88 The
[**state secrets** doctrine is an **evidentiary privilege** which keeps
information related to state secrets or national security **out of the
courts** for **fear of disclosure**]{.underline}. 89 The states secrets
doctrine also has an example of false invocation, such as United States
v. Reynolds. 90 Moreover, in recent years the [state\'s secrets doctrine
has **transformed** from an evidentiary privilege to a **dispositive
privilege** to **dismiss suits**]{.underline}. 91 Additionally, [the
courts have shown a **degree** of **deference** toward the **military**
and military policy **underscoring** the **President\'s authority** as
**Commander-in-Chief**]{.underline}. 92 One example is the Koramatsu
decision, where the Court found that military necessity was an adequate
reason for the internment of Japanese-Americans. 93 Taken together,
[state secrets and deference to the military are additional **bars** to
**litigation**]{.underline}. 94

Finally, specific to military members, is the [Feres
Doctrine]{.underline}, which [grants **civil suit immunity** to the
military in a wide variety of causes of action]{.underline}. 95 The end
result is that the [courts dismiss these suits]{.underline} under the
Feres Doctrine. 96 Because Captain Smith\'s [suit]{.underline} is
[against the **Commander-in-Chief**]{.underline}, such a suit [could
also be **barred** under the **Feres Doctrine**]{.underline}, although
the Feres Doctrine has primarily been a torts doctrine. 97 Thus, the
[Feres Doctrine could act as a bar to litigants]{.underline}. 98 In
short, [**multiple judicial doctrines** exist, such as **standing**, or
**mootness**, or **political questions**, which **bar litigation** of
the **War Powers** doctrine]{.underline}. 99

2\. Congressional Abdication

If the War Powers are truly a political question, as the courts
maintain, then [part of the **blame** lies with
**Congress**.]{.underline} 183 [Part of the problem is that Congress has
**only toyed** with **fixing** the **W**ar **P**owers **R**esolution
using its **normal legislative capabilities**, or considered **outright
repeal**]{.underline}. 184 Other [members of Congress have settled for
**incremental modification**, requiring the President to consult
Congress more frequently and return to a more consultative system for
using military force, but with**out results**.]{.underline} 185 [Nor
have **Congressional-led lawsuits** led to anything]{.underline};
moreover, [many of these lawsuits have **partisan roots**.]{.underline}
186

[Congress also deserves a **degree of blame** for the **current AUMF
status** via **continued funding** of the use of military
force.]{.underline} 187 [Funding war is a **Congressional
power**]{.underline}, one [which Congress could **potentially withhold**
and end]{.underline} some use of [military force]{.underline}, even
while troops are engaged. 188 Yet, [to contend plausibly that Congress
would **cease funding**]{.underline} with deployed troops in the field,
for instance, [**utterly ignores** the **political problems** of that
choice and **ignores** the **political costs** associated with funding,
making **sole control** of **funding** an **ineffective check** on the
**Executive Branch**]{.underline}. 189 Moreover, [Congress continues to
**vote for funding** for military operations, **tacitly approving** the
**President\'s actions**.]{.underline} 190 [Between continuing to **fund
wars** and **lack of legislative initiative** on the **war powers**,
Congress has **effectively abdicated** its position, and has not adopted
a way that would make the use of military force a more **consultative
act** between **Executive** and **Legislation**]{.underline}, which this
Note proposes. 191 Therefore, [Congress\' supine **stance**,
**partisanship**, and other **maladies** do not auger that
**Congressional action** will **change** the **policy** of **perpetual
war**]{.underline}. 192

#### Exec circumvents AND Courts strikedown the CP

By Erica H. **Ma 21**, J.D., 2020, New York University School of Law;
B.A., 2015, University of Pennsylvania, \"Article: The War Powers
Resolution and the Concept of Hostilities,\" Northeastern University Law
Review, 13, 519, pp. 535-537, May 2021, Lexis, nihara

In line with the purpose of the resolution, the Senate report of the WPR
noted that Section 5(b) is the \"heart and core\" of the resolution and
\"represents, in an historic sense, a restoration of the
constitution\[al\] balance which has been distorted by practice in our
history.\" 87[[Exec]{.mark}utive]{.underline} branch
[officials]{.underline}, however, [have **[challenged]{.mark}** this
[provision]{.mark} in particular [as]{.mark} an
\"**[unconstitutional]{.mark} infringement** on the President\'s
authority as Commander in Chief.\"]{.underline} 88Moreover, the
[executive branch has argued that this provision \"[**interferes**
with]{.mark} **successful [action]{.mark}**, **[signals]{.mark}** a
**[divided nation]{.mark}** and **[lack of resolve]{.mark}**, gives the
enemy a basis for hoping that the President will be forced by domestic
opponents to stop an action, and **[increases risk]{.mark}** to **U.S.
forces** in the field.\"]{.underline} 89While [Section 5(c) of the WPR
allows Congress]{.underline}, through a concurrent resolution, [to
**direct the President** to **remove** U.S. **armed forces** from
situations of **hostilities**,]{.underline} the [[Supreme
Court]{.mark}\'s 1983 decision **INS v. Chadha**]{.underline}, which
**[[struck down]{.underline}]{.mark}** one-house [**legislative
[vetoes]{.mark}** not presented to the President]{.underline} for
signature, has [[cast doubt on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[constitutionality]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Section 5(c). 90

Because of the dispute over the constitutionality of Section 5(b), [the
**meaning** of \"**hostilities**\" under the WPR has become
**contested** through the years]{.underline}, as the sixty-day
termination clock is only triggered when U.S. armed forces are
introduced \"into hostilities or into situations where imminent
involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances.\"
91At the time of the WPR\'s passage, a report of the House [Foreign
Affairs Committee defined \"hostilities\" **broadly**]{.underline}: It
noted that \"hostilities\" is [\"broader in scope\" than an \"armed
conflict\"]{.underline} (a term with legal meaning under international
law), [and]{.underline} that \"hostilities\" c[an include a \"state of
confrontation in which no shots have been fired.\"]{.underline}
92[However]{.underline}, as Section II.C elaborates, [subsequent
**presidential [administrations]{.mark}**]{.underline}\--including the
Ford Administration, the first to submit a forty-eight-hour report
pursuant to the hostilities/imminent hostilities prong of the
WPR\--[interpreted \"hostilities\" **narrowly**]{.underline} to
encompass only situations where \"units of the U.S. armed forces are
actively engaged in exchanges of fire with opposing units of hostile
forces.\" 93[This [narrow interpretation of]{.mark}
\"[hostilities]{.mark}\" has [allowed Presidents]{.mark} through the
years [to claim that there is a **greater range** of]{.mark}
**[situations]{.mark}** in[to which he can **send**]{.mark} **U.S.
[armed forces without triggering]{.mark}** the **[WPR\'s]{.mark}
withdrawal mandate**]{.underline}.
