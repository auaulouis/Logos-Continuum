Increasingly, "power" grasps the subjects of algorithmic governmentality
no longer through their physical body, nor through their moral
conscience -- the traditional holds of power in its legal discursive
form \[13\]

\[13\]

As well as its disciplinary form -- to use Foucauldian models of... --
but through multiple "profiles" assigned to them, often automatically,
based on digital traces of their existence and their everyday journeys.
Algorithmic governmentality is quite close to what Foucault already had
in mind with his concept of security apparatuses:

[14The fact of power having a **digital** rather than a **physical
"grasp**" in no way means that individuals are **ontologically and
existentially reducible** to networks of data]{.underline} that can be
recombined by apparatuses, nor that they are totally under the grip of
these apparatuses. It simply means that, irrespective of their capacity
for understanding, [willpower and expression, "power" approaches them no
longer on the basis of these capacities, but rather on that of their
"**profiles**" (as a potential fraudster, a consumer, a potential
terrorist, a student with high potential, etc.).]{.underline}
Algorithmic governmentality further exacerbates the ambivalences of the
time regarding the question of individualization. [Our era is often
considered as that of the **victory of the individual**, in the sense
that an individualization of services is observed, due to the
possibility afforded by **statistical practices** to **closely target**
the needs and **dangers** specific to each individual. At]{.underline}
the same time, it is also seen as an era in which individuals are
jeopardized, as their intimacy, privacy, autonomy and self-determination
are threatened by those very practices. Some even write about the risks
of pure desubjectification. Both hypotheses -- that of the individual at
the centre of everything, and that of desubjectification -- are, in our
opinion, equally wrong. Let us see why.

Is personalization really a form of individuation?

15IBM presents "individualized" marketing -- "smart marketing" -- as a
revolution that is turning marketing and advertising into
"consumer-oriented services", sounding the great return of the
customer-king who, placed at the heart of companies' concerns, no longer
has to even conceive of or express his or her desires, which are
commands. In the words of Éric Schmidt, the CEO of Google: "we know
roughly who you are, roughly what you care about, roughly who your
friends are \[in other words we know your 'school of fish'\] the
technology will be so good it will be very hard for people to watch or
consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them" (in
other words a seemingly individualized prediction would be possible). In
fact, this form of individualization resembles more of a
hyper-segmentation and a hyper-plasticity of commercial offers than
comprehensive consideration of the needs and desires specific to each
person. In fact the aim is of course precisely not so much to tailor the
offer to individuals' spontaneous desires (assuming such a thing
exists), as to adapt those desires to the offer by tailoring sales
strategies (the way of presenting the product, of pricing it, etc.) to
each person's profile. Thus, "dynamic pricing" strategies or the
adaptation of certain goods' or services' price to each potential
customer's "willingness to pay" appear to already be in place on certain
airline ticket sales websites. This is not only about individualization:
it is indeed market segmentation. Here is a rather trivial example: you
go onto the website of an airline whose name we shall not mention (call
it Company Y) and find out about the price of a flight to Pisa from
Brussels, leaving in three days. Say that the price shown is €180. As
this is a bit too expensive for you, you go onto another company's
website (Company Z), or you look elsewhere online, to find a cheaper
ticket. Suppose that you do not find better. You return to Company Y's
website and -- surprise surprise -- you realise that the ticket price
has increased by €50 within less than half an hour, just the time for
you to do your research. This is simply because you have been attributed
a "captive traveller" profile: based on your online browsing and your
desired departure date, the website has detected that you really need
this airplane ticket and that you will therefore be prepared to spend an
extra €50 to get it, especially since you will have the impression that
if you do not hurry up to buy it, the price will only increase. If,
instead of reacting "logically" and buying the ticket as fast as
possible, you change computer and IP address and visit the airline's
website once again, your ticket will cost you €180 instead of €230. Why?
Because the vendor relies on your first reflex being to buy as soon as
possible following the "alert" raised: the price is increasing, and
fast. In this case, the consequences are relatively trivial. But this
example clearly shows how, [rather than scrupulously respecting each
singular consumer's individual desires, the approach automatically
detects certain (purchase) propensities and the (in)elasticity of
individual demand regarding a price variation to trigger a
purchase]{.underline}. The latter will then be based on a reflex
response to an alert stimulus short-circuiting individual reflexivity
and the formation of singular desire.

[16The aim is therefore to prompt individuals to act **without forming**
or formulating a desire. Algorithmic governance thus seems to signal the
culmination of a **dispersal of the spatial**, temporal and linguistic
conditions of **subjectification and individuation.**]{.underline}
[These are being replaced by objective, operational regulation of
possible behaviours, based on "**raw data"** that carry **no meaning**
on their own and whose statistical processing is primarily designed to
accelerate flows -- avoiding any form of "detour" or subjective
"reflexive suspension" between "stimuli" and their "reflex responses".
The fact that what thus "flows" is a-signifying is of no
importance \[1]{.underline}4\]

Because digital signals "can be computed quantitatively irrespective of
their possible meaning" (Eco, 1976: 20 cited by Genosko, 2008),
everything happens as though meaning were no longer absolutely
necessary, as though the universe were already -- independently of any
interpretation -- saturated with meaning, as [though it were therefore
no longer necessary for people to connect to one another through
meaningful language,]{.underline} nor through any symbolic,
institutional or conventional transcription[. It consequently seems that
the apparatuses of algorithmic governmentality consecrated both
signifiers' emancipation from the signified]{.underline}
(quantification, algorithmic recombinations of profiles) and the
substitution of signifiers with the signified (production of reality
within the world itself -- the only reality that "counts" for
algorithmic governmentality is digital reality) (Rouvroy, 2013b). This
assignation of human action to a preconscious stage has everything to do
with what Bernard Stiegler calls proletarianization:

17

"Historically, proletarianization was the loss of workers' knowledge to
machines, which absorbed this knowledge. [Today, proletarianization is
the **standardization of behaviours** through **marketing and
services**, and the mechanization of minds through the **externalization
of knowledge** in systems, such that these 'minds' no longer know
anything about these information processing devices, of which they
merely set the parameters.]{.underline} This is precisely what the
electronic mathematization of financial decision making shows, and it
affects everyone: employers, doctors, designers, intellectuals, leaders.
[More and more engineers take part in **technical processes** whose
functioning they know nothing about, but which are ruining the
world".]{.underline}

(Stiegler, 2011)

18Maurizio Lazzarato sums up quite well how a-signifying semiotics,
exemplified by digital behaviourism, produce machinic enslavement rather
than subjective alienation:

19

"If signifying semiotics have a function of subjective alienation, of
'social subjection', a-signifying semiotics have one of 'machinic
enslavement'. A-signifying semiotics synchronize and modulate the
pre-individual and pre-verbal elements of subjectivity by causing the
affects, perceptions, emotions, etc. to function like component parts,
like the elements in a machine (machinic enslavement). We can all
function like the input/output elements in semiotic machines, like
simple television or Internet relays that facilitate or block the
transmission of information, communication or affects. Unlike signifying
semiotics, a-signifying semiotics recognize neither persons, nor roles,
nor subjects. \[...\] In the first case, the system speaks and generates
speech; it indexes and folds the multiplicity of pre-signifying and
symbolic semiotics over language, over linguistic chains, by giving
priority to its representative functions. In the second case, however,
the system does not generate discourse: it does not speak but it
functions, setting things in motion by connecting directly to the
'nervous system, the brain, the memory, etc.' and activat\[ing\] the
affective, transitivist, transindividual relations that are difficult to
attribute to a subject, an individual, a me."

(Lazzarato, 2006)

The paradoxes of personalization: an algorithmic governmentality without
subjects but compatible with contemporary hyper-subjectification
phenomena

[20However "impressive" it may be, the hypothesis of desubjectification,
of "the jeopardization of the individual", of the individual diluted in
networks]{.underline}, [is in no way **self-evident**]{.underline}. One
could even say that social networks and so on produce "hyper-subjects"
-- probably because for their users, [they are full of signifying
**semiotics** --,]{.underline} [that many people have become
**obsessed** with **producing subjectivity**,]{.underline} and that it
has even become some individuals' reason to live. It therefore seems
[too simplistic to us just to claim that the **transformations**
underway produce **desubjectification only**, on the grounds that they
weaken the bastions of intimacy]{.underline} (even this is debatable:
certain devices in the information society, on the contrary, reinforce
individuals' isolation, sparing them from interacting with others...)
and of privacy, and that they perhaps affect the conditions of autonomy
and free choice (how this happens remains to be seen: intelligent
environments sparing us from constantly having to make choices in
perfectly trivial areas of life can also free our minds, make us
available for more interesting intellectual tasks, make us more
altruistic, etc.). Yet laws protecting privacy and personal data,
essentially motivated by risks of personal, private or sensitive
information being revealed, of inappropriate disclosures, of individuals
losing control over "their" profiles and of infringements of the
principles of individual autonomy and self-determination, have focused
on erecting a series of essentially defensive and restrictive "barriers"
around the individual.

21Without considering this as pointless, we would like to strongly
emphasize this "algorithmic governance's" indifference to individuals,
insofar as it simply focuses on and controls our "statistical doubles",
in other words combinations of correlations, produced automatically and
using big data, themselves constituted or collected "by default". In
short, what we are, "roughly", to use Éric Schmidt's term, is precisely
no longer ourselves (singular beings) in any way. And that is precisely
the problem, a problem which as we shall see is more the result of a
rarefaction of subjectification processes and opportunities, of a
difficulty to become subjects, than the product of a
"de-subjectification" or jeopardization of the individual.

With this in mind, let us return to the question of the subject, or
rather of "avoidance" of the subject in the three-stage normative
process described above. [The first thing to point out is the
**difficulty** to produce **algorithmic subjects** who conceive of or
think about **themselves** as such.]{.underline} First of all, as we
have seen, the [subject's consent is weak when they share
information]{.underline} (these data can often be used while still
remaining anonymous, [but this could just as well **no longer** be the
case]{.underline}, as the meaning of their anonymity has become
relative). That is not to say that this information is "stolen", which
would allow the subject to oppose it, to stand as a subject resisting
such theft. [Rather, we are witnessing a considerable decline in the
"**deliberate**" nature of information disclosures]{.underline} -- most
of the time trivial, insignificant, segmented and decontextualized
information [--, of these "traces" whose subsequent trajectory and uses,
for the "subject", are **unpredictable and
uncontrollable**]{.underline}, [even if significant research investment
is currently going into developing technical tools to allow computer
service "users" to better control "their" data]{.underline}. Second, in
terms of its processing, [the main characteristic of the "knowledge"
produced is that it appears to emerge directly from **big
data**]{.underline}, [**without** the hypothesis leading to this
knowledge being pre-existent: the hypotheses themselves are
"**generated" from** the data.]{.underline} Finally, the normative
action deriving from these statistical processes will always be closer
to action on / and therefore by the environment than to action on the
individual themselves. The latter's action no longer arises in direct
confrontation with an external norm -- law, average, definition of
normality --; their realm of possibilities is directly organized within
their environment.

23For these three reasons, we argue that both the force and the danger
of the generalization of the statistical practices that we are
witnessing lies not in these practices' individual nature, but on the
contrary in their autonomy or even their indifference to the individual.
To put this as clearly as possible, our problem is not being stripped of
what we considered as our own, or being forced to give up information
that would violate our privacy or our freedom[. Far more fundamentally,
it stems from the fact that our statistical doubles are **too detached**
from us, that we have **no "relationship**" with them]{.underline},
[when at the same time **contemporary normative actions** are directed
towards these **statistical doubles** in order to be
effective.]{.underline} The confessional constructs the subject of the
introspection which probes his/her soul, virtue, desires and deepest
intentions, for through the process of confession "he who speaks
promises to be what he affirms himself to be, precisely because he is
just that" (Foucault, 2014: 16); the [law produces subjects of law
intent on their **equality** and the **impartiality of
procedures**]{.underline}; and the average man once seemed too average
compared to the singular subject likely to contradict this average.
[**Algorithmic governance**, however, neither produces nor provides an
affordance for any active, consistent and reflexive **statistical
subject** likely to lend it **legitimacy** or resist
it \[15\]]{.underline}

\[15\]

Our analysis claims a more nuanced stance regarding the trends.... [That
is precisely what we must now be attentive to, essentially through
**knowledge** (even technical) and recognition of the **discrepancy**,
the difference between these **statistical representations** and what
constitutes individuals in their individuation processes, with the
moments of spontaneity, the events and the sidesteps from possibilities
**anticipated** that prevail in these processes.]{.underline}

#### Cybernetics isn't conclusive\-\--war machine isn't a direct result of cybernetics 

**Hagmann 17** \[Jonas Hagmann, 2017, "Security in the Society of
Control: The Politics and Practices of Securing Urban Spaces,"
International Political Sociology (2017)\][\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

Fourth and finally, the control society is associated with implicit and
potential political projects and/or drivers. [There is a widespread
understanding that the perfection of control is fueled by neoliberal
politics]{.underline}, the privatization of services, technological
advances, and alarmist threat discourses---fear of terrorism especially
(Munro 2002; Coaffee, O'Hare and Hawkesworth 2009). These elements
stimulate an expansion of security dispositives that is uncontrolled and
organized at the same time. Security instruments are seen growing
horizontally in rhizomatic ways and with little strategic coherence
(Rose 2000, 321--322), yet the advent of the control system is
nonetheless deemed systematic and thus top-down overall (Coleman and
Agnew 2007).2 [And indeed, capitalism is recurrently identified as the
one authority that, albeit rarely subjected to popular approval,
orchestrates the control society and its apparatuses of security, which
is why they are often associated with an implicit neoliberal agenda
(Reid 2014).3]{.underline} This political agenda is not the only one
possible, of course, and following diagnoses of security dispositives
encroaching on democratic politics, it is also not deemed desirable.
That is to say that the comprehensiveness, exclusionary practices,
totalizing aspirations, and implicit neoliberal inspirations of current
security dispositives motivate scholars to critically engage the new
control ensembles. Indeed, calls to problematize, resist, or even reject
the new control systems abound in the literature (Lacy 2008). And
although the components of such strategies or tactics are rarely
specified in the scholarly literature (as opposed to activist writings
elsewhere; see The Invisible Committee 2009), it is clear from the
literature that followed the Postscript that new security dispositives
should be met with resistant activities of some sort (Newman 2009;
Deseriis 2011; Lundborg 2016). Taken together, it seems no exaggeration
to state that with these analytical components, the Deleuzian control
thesis advances an impressively rich, integrative, and topical research
agenda. Even if [the postulation of a neat paradigm shift from
"discipline" to "control" seems **overstated (**]{.underline}Poster
2009)4---the control thesis directs attention to evolving varieties of
functionally diverse security actors, the continuing recomposition of
material and immaterial security assemblages, the multiple and evolving
linkages between security and democratic politics writ large, and novel
deterritorialization processes, as well as normative dimensions inherent
in 2 It goes without saying that the postulation of a rhizomatic, yet
systematic, expansion of security dispositives makes it difficult to
identify the precise drivers of the latter process. Deseriis (2011)
considers this challenge, to whose clarification Deleuzian scholarship
contributed little, to reflect a deeper ambivalence in Marxist
theorizing, namely the core question of whether capitalism organizes
itself (a rhizomatic perspective set out in Marx's Grundrisse) or
whether it is orchestrated by a "capitalist general" (a systemic reading
suggested in Das Kapital). 3 Seemingly, it is also the globalized nature
of capitalism that motivates Deleuzian scholars to conclude a global
control system---thus confusing characteristics of a driver of control
with the nature of security dispositives' own operation. 4 Since some
"Deleuzian elements" had been anticipated or called for by Foucault
already, such as the necessity to overcome institution-centric analyses
of societal steering (Foucault 2004, 116-118, on the "crisis of
disciplinary societies"; also Foucault 1978). Overall, and with the
exception of Deleuze's more explicit concerns with digitalism,
privatization, and society's ability to influence security dispositives
perhaps, it thus seems useful to conceive of "control" more as an
intensification and spatial expansion of the security arrangements set
out by Foucault. Control is not a fundamental rejection of discipline,
even if it is defined in relation to the latter. contemporary security
management. Doing so, the Deleuzian framework advances a fairly
integrative "critical" perspective on the interrelations between
security dispositives, democratic politics, and emancipatory
practices---indeed, more holistic maybe than the division of academic
labor between Foucaultian/Bourdieuan, Arendtian, and Marxist approaches
to security research ("Paris, Copenhagen, Aberystwyth") allows. As
important, the control framework allows a variety of highly current
empirical observations to be engaged: Deleuzian control studies can
address concerns about societies becoming governed ever more intimately
in the name of security and about security dispositives becoming more
intrusive and ubiquitous (Valverde 2010). It can situate the evolution
of such logics and dispositives in broader contemporary processes such
as technological innovation (evolving "infrastructural powers"),
globalization (the reconfiguration of enclosures and borders), and
urbanization (the intensification of the Foucaultian problem of
population, or "coexistence")5; and it can examine these through
interscalar lenses (Delaney and Leitner 1997; Brenner 1999), addressing
the variegated ways in which international security narratives become
localized and local security dispositives transnationalized. Seen this
way, the control thesis empowers highly topical and comprehensive
accounts of the interplay between security ensembles, democratic
politics, and normative choices and allows decidedly empirical
"genealogies of governmentality" (Bevir 2010; Joseph 2010) across
clinical levels of analysis. This said, a look at the contributions made
thus far suggests that the control oriented literature has, in its
applications to security, not exploited this potential very
systematically. While the literature has offered sophisticated case
studies and played a pioneering role in popularizing the control
framework in the first place, [some of its analyses appear surprisingly
incomplete and little differentiated, if not outright overdrawn. Whether
security dispositives indeed came to draw so strongly on private agents,
for instance, clearly deserves further enquiry (Coleman and Agnew 2007),
and so does their alleged reliance on digital instruments and pronounced
flexibility (Blomley 2007; Bonelli and Ragazzi 2014; Meiches 2015).
Whether the new security ensembles might reformulate democratic politics
(Loader and Walker 2007), as opposed to closing it down, has not been
answered conclusively, seemingly because the authoritarian penchant of
security is considered wellproven among control scholars. The purported
presence of global control warrants further analysis---not only because
of the mere grandiosity of this statement but also given the
literature's strong reliance on insights from the United Kingdom and
North America (e.g., Newman 2009; Vlcek 2010; Hallsworth and Lea 2011),
that is, its **narrow empirical base.**]{.underline} The postulated
linearity of the described shifts is counterintuitive, considering the
genealogical method and ethos on which Deleuzian work draws, and the
emphasis on terrorism as the most immediate justification for new
control arrangements points to an exceedingly rapid reduction of
security affairs to 9/11 discourses. Whether resistant practices are
still to come, finally, is also a point to explore further, for most
security studies applications of Deleuze's control argument derive such
need from the technical intrusiveness of new security instruments, not
from an empirically verified absence of opposition to control ensembles
(Merlingen 2006).Considering these limitations, it is important to
challenge the Deleuzian control literature for its selectivity, its
merits notwithstanding (Valverde 2010). Instead of providing holistic
and contextualized accounts of contemporary security management and its
variation across time and space, as its analytical set-up would permit
(Goldstein 2010), its empirical contributions still emphasize some
actors, instruments, and processes and ignore others. Today, such
partial engagement with evolving security assemblages is little
conducive to fostering a grounded understanding.

#### Cybernetic information capitalism is inevitable

**Zuboff 19** \[Shoshana Zuboff, 2019, "Surveillance Capitalism and the
Challenge of Collective Action," New Labor Forum,
[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1095796018819461\]\\\\pairie](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1095796018819461%5d\\pairie)

The Challenge to Collective Action How do they get away with it? [Dozens
of surveys conducted since 2008 attest to substantial majorities in the
United States, the European Union, and around the world that reject the
premises and practices of surveillance capitalism, yet it persists,
succeeds, grows, and dominates, remaining largely uncontested by either
existing or new forms of collective action]{.underline}.28 In other work
I have detailed sixteen conditions that enabled this new logic of
accumulation to root and flourish.29 Here I want to underscore two of
these conditions: The first is the absence of organic reciprocities
between surveillance capitalist firms and their populations. This
absence produces the second condition, in which dependency replaces
reciprocity as the fulcrum of this commercial project. A first answer to
the question "How do they get away with it?" concerns a novel structural
feature of this market form that diverges sharply from the history of
market democracy. For all the failings, injustice, and violence of
earlier forms of modern capitalism, the necessity of organic
reciprocities with its populations has been a mark of endurance and
adaptability. Symbolized in the twentieth century by Ford's five-dollar
day, these reciprocities reach back to Adam Smith's original insights
into the productive social relations of capitalism, in which firms rely
on people as employees and customers. Smith argued that price increases
had to be balanced with wage increases "so that the laborer may still be
able to purchase that quantity of those necessary articles which the
state of the demand for labor ... requires that he should have."30 By
the 1980s, globalization and neoliberal ideology, operationalized in the
shareholder-value movement, went a long way toward destroying these
centuries-old reciprocities between capitalism and its communities.
[Surveillance capitalism completes the job. Instrumentarianism is a
market project that converges with the digital to achieve its own unique
brand of social domination. First, **surveillance capitalists no longer
rely on people as consumers**. Instead, the axis of supply and demand
orients the surveillance capitalist firm to businesses intent on
anticipating the behavior of populations, groups, and individuals. The
result is that populations are conceptualized as undifferentiated
"users," who are merely the sources of raw material for a digital-age
production process aimed at a new business customer.]{.underline} Where
individual consumers continue to exist in surveillance capitalist
operations---purchasing smart appliances, digital assistants, dolls that
spy, or behavior-based insurance policies, just to name a few
examples---social relations are no longer founded on mutual exchange. In
these and many other 12 New Labor Forum 00(0) instances, products and
services are merely hosts for surveillance capitalism's data extraction
operations. For example, the concept of the "smart home" has become
emblematic of this new asymmetry. By 2018 the global smart home market
was valued at \$36 billion USD and expected to reach \$151 billion by
2023.31 The numbers betray an earthquake beneath their surface. Consider
just one smart home device: the Nest thermostat owned by Alphabet, the
Google holding company, and merged with Google in 2018.32 The Nest
thermostat collects data about its usage and environment. It uses motion
sensors and computation to "learn" the behaviors of a home's
inhabitants. Nest's apps can also gather data from other connected
products such as cars, ovens, fitness trackers, beds.33 Such systems
can, for example, trigger lights if an anomalous motion is detected,
signaling video and audio recording, and even sending notifications to
homeowners or others. As a result of the merger with Google, the
thermostat, like other Nest products, will be built with Google's
artificial intelligence capabilities, including its personal digital
"Assistant."34 The thermostat and its brethren devices create immense
new stores of knowledge and therefore new power---but for whom?
Wi-Fi-enabled and -networked, the thermostat's intricate personalized
data stores are uploaded to Google's servers. Each thermostat comes with
a "Privacy Policy," a "Terms of Service Agreement," and an "End-User
Licensing Agreement." These reveal oppressive privacy and security
consequences in which sensitive household and personal information are
shared with other smart devices, unnamed personnel, and third parties
for the purposes of predictive analyses and sales to other unspecified
parties. Nest takes little responsibility for the security of the
information it collects and none for how the other companies in its
ecosystem will put those data to use.35 A detailed analysis of Nest's
policies by two University of London scholars concluded that were one to
enter into the Nest ecosystem of connected devices and apps, each with
its own equally burdensome and audacious terms, the purchase of a single
home thermostat entails the need to review nearly a thousand so-called
contracts.36 Should the customer refuse to agree to Nest's stipulations,
the Terms of Service indicate that the functionality and security of the
thermostat will be deeply compromised, no longer supported by the
necessary updates meant to ensure its reliability and safety. The
consequences can range from frozen pipes to failed smoke alarms to an
easily hacked internal home system.37 The absence of consumer
reciprocities is complemented by the absence of employment
reciprocities. By historical standards the large surveillance
capitalists employ relatively few people compared to their unprecedented
computational resources. This pattern, in which a small, highly educated
workforce leverages the power of a massive capital-intensive
knowledge-production infrastructure, is called "hyperscale."38 The
historical discontinuity of the hyperscale business operation becomes
apparent by comparing seven decades of General Motors (GM) employment
levels and market capitalization to recent post-IPO (initial public
offering) data from Google and Facebook. (I have confined the comparison
here to Google and Facebook because both were pure surveillance
capitalist firms even before their public offerings.) Nest takes little
responsibility for the security of the information it collects and none
for how the other companies in its ecosystem will put those data to use.
From the time they went public to 2016, Google and Facebook steadily
climbed to the heights of market capitalization, with Google reaching
\$532 billion by the end of 2016 and Facebook at \$332 billion, without
Google ever employing more than 75,000 people or Facebook more than
18,000. General Motors took four decades to reach its highest market
capitalization of \$225.15 billion in 1965, when it employed 735,000
women and men.39 Most startling is that GM employed more people during
the height of the Great Depression than either Google or Facebook
employs at their heights of market capitalization. Zuboff 13 The GM
pattern is the iconic story of the United States in the twentieth
century, before globalization, neoliberalism, the shareholdervalue
movement, and plutocracy unraveled the public corporation and the
institutions of what historian Karl Polanyi called "the double
movement," a network of "measures and policies ... integrated into
powerful institutions designed to check the action of the market
relative to labor, land, and money."40 Polanyi's studies led him to
conclude that the operations of a self-regulating market are profoundly
destructive when allowed to run free of such countervailing laws and
policies. It was the institutions of the double movement that tamed GM's
employment policies with fair labor practices, unionization, and
collective bargaining, emblematic of stable reciprocities during the
pre-globalization decades of the twentieth century. The societal result
was predictable. In the 1950s, for example, 80 percent of adults said
that "big business" was a good thing for the country, 66 percent
believed that business required little or no change, and 60 percent
agreed, "the profits of large companies help make things better for
everyone who buys their products or services."41 \[A\]...survey in 2015
found 91 percent of respondents disagreeing that the collection of
personal information "without my knowing" is a fair tradeoff for a price
discount. Although some critics blamed GM's institutional reciprocities
for its failure to adapt to global competition in the late 1980s,
leading eventually to its bankruptcy in 2009, analyses have shown that
chronic managerial complacency and doomed financial strategies bore the
greatest share of responsibility for the firm's legendary decline, a
conclusion that is fortified by the successes of the German automobile
industry in the twenty-first century, where strong labor institutions
formally share decision-making authority.42 Nearly seventy years later
and in the absence of democratic checks on the power of surveillance
capitalists, the picture is very different. For example, a major 2009
survey found that when Americans are informed of the ways that companies
gather data for targeted online ads, 73 to 86 percent rejected such
advertising.43 Another substantial survey in 2015 found 91 percent of
respondents disagreeing that the collection of personal information
"without my knowing" is a fair tradeoff for a price discount. Fifty-five
percent disagreed that it was a fair exchange for improved services.44
In 2016 PEW Research reported only 9 percent of respondents as very
confident in trusting social media sites with their data and 14 percent
very confident about trusting companies with personal data. More than 60
percent wanted to do more to protect their privacy and believed there
should be more regulation to protect privacy.45 Hyperscale firms have
become emblematic of modern digital capitalism, and as capitalist
inventions they present significant social and economic challenges,
including their impact on employment and wages, industry concentration,
and monopoly.46 In 2017 there were 24 hyperscale firms operating 320
data centers with anywhere between thousands and millions of servers
(Google and Facebook are among the largest). One hundred more data
centers are expected to be online by late 2018. Microsoft invested \$20
billion in 2017, and in 2018 Facebook announced plans to invest \$20
billion in a new hyperscale data center in Atlanta. According to one
industry report, hyperscale firms are also building the world's
networks, especially subsea cables, which means that "a large portion of
the global internet traffic is now running through private networks
owned or operated by hyperscalers." In 2016 Facebook and Google teamed
up to build a new subsea cable between the United States and Hong Kong,
described as the highest-capacity transpacific route to date.47 The
surveillance capitalists who operate at hyperscale or outsource to
hyperscale operations dramatically diminish any reliance on their
societies as sources of employees, and the few for whom they do compete
are largely drawn from the most-rarified strata of data science. The
absence of organic reciprocities with people as sources of either
consumers or employees is a matter of exceptional importance in light of
the historical relationship 14 New Labor Forum 00(0) between market
capitalism and democracy. In fact, the origins of democracy in both
Britain and America have been traced to these very reciprocities. Even a
brief glance at these histories can help us grasp the degree to which
surveillance capitalism diverges from capitalism's past, a divergence in
which an extreme structural independence from people lays the foundation
for surveillance capitalism's unique approach to knowledge that we have
called "radical indifference." In Britain, the rise of volume production
and its wage-earning labor force in the nineteenth century contributed
not only to workers' economic power but also to a growing sense of
labor's political power and legitimacy. This produced a new sense of
interdependence between ordinary people and elites. Economists Daron
Acemoglu and James A. Robinson show that the rise of democracy in
nineteenth-century Britain was inextricably bound to industrial
capitalism's dependency on the "the masses" and their contribution to
the prosperity made possible by the new organization of production.48
Acemoglu and Robinson conclude that the "dynamic positive feedback"
between "inclusive economic institutions" (i.e., institutions defined by
reciprocities) and political institutions was critical to Britain's
substantial and non-violent democratic reforms. Inclusive economic
institutions, they argue, "level the playing field," especially when it
comes to the fight for power, making it more difficult for elites to
"crush the masses" rather than accede to their demands. Reciprocities in
economics produced and sustained reciprocities in politics. "Clamping
down on popular demands," they write, "and undertaking a coup against
inclusive political institutions would ... destroy ... \[economic\]
gains, and the elites opposing greater democratization and greater
inclusiveness might find themselves among those losing their fortunes
from this destruction."49 The spread of democracy also depended on the
reciprocities of consumption, and the American Revolution is the
outstanding example of this dynamic. Historian T.H. Breen argues in his
path-breaking book, The Marketplace of Revolution, that it was the
violation of these reciprocities that set the American Revolution into
motion, uniting disparate provincial strangers into a radical new
patriotic force. Breen explains that American colonists had come to
depend on the "empire of goods" imported from England, and that this
dependency instilled the sense of a reciprocal social contract: "For
ordinary people, the palpable experience of participating in an
expanding Anglo-American consumer market" intensified their sense of a
"genuine partnership" with England. Eventually, the British Parliament
famously misjudged the rights and obligation of this partnership,
imposing a series of taxes that turned imported goods such as cloth and
tea into "symbols of imperial oppression." Breen describes the
unprecedented inventiveness of a political movement originating in the
shared experience of consumption, the outrage at the violation of
essential producer--consumer interdependencies, and the determination to
make "goods speak to power." The translation of consumer expectations
into democratic revolution occurred in three waves, beginning in 1765,
when the Stamp Act triggered popular protests, riots, and organized
resistance finally expressed in the "nonimportation movement." (Today we
would call it a consumer boycott.) As Breen tells it, the details of the
Act were less important than the colonists' realization that England did
not perceive them as political or economic equals bound in mutually
beneficial reciprocities. "By compromising the Americans' ability to
purchase the goods they desired," he writes, "Parliament had revealed an
intention to treat the colonists like secondclass subjects," levying a
heavy price "on the pursuit of material happiness." [In the absence of
the organic reciprocities between producers, customers, and employees
that bind populations in a shared fate, "user" dependency is the fulcrum
of the surveillance capitalist project. Surveillance capitalism spread
across the internet just as digital communications became the salient
means of social participation.]{.underline} A 2010 BBC poll found that
79 percent of people in twenty-six countries considered internet access
to be a fundamental human right.50 Six years later in 2016, the United
Nations Human Rights Council would adopt specific language on the
importance of internet access.51 In the United States, many people call
the emergency services number, 911, on those rare occasions when
Facebook is Zuboff 15 down.52 [Most people find it difficult to withdraw
from these utilities, and many ponder if it is even possible.53 The
result has been an involuntary merger of personal necessity and economic
extraction, as the same channels that we rely on for daily logistics,
social interaction, work, education, health care, access to products and
services, and much more, now double as supply chain operations for
surveillance capitalism's surplus flows. The result is that effective
social participation leads through the means of behavioral modification,
eroding the choice mechanisms that once adhered to the private
realm----exit, voice, and loyalty.]{.underline} [**There can be no exit
from processes that are intentionally designed to bypass individual
awareness and on which we must depend for effective daily life**. Users
lack reliable channels for voice. Loyalty is an empty suit, as
participation is better explained in terms of necessity, dependency,
helplessness, resignation, the foreclosure of alternatives, and enforced
ignorance.]{.underline}

#### Data is good for policymaking 

**Reiter 15** \[Dan Reiter, 08-27-2015, "Scholars Help Policymakers Know
Their Tools,\" War On The Rocks,
[https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/\]\\\\pairie](https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/scholars-help-policymakers-know-their-tools/%5d\\pairie)
\\\\iris

A third critique is that much of this academic work on foreign policy
tools is unusable by policymakers because it is too quantitative and
technically complex. Here, echoing a point made by Erik Voeten, [there
is a danger in not appreciating the importance of rigorous
research]{.underline} [design, including sophisticated quantitative
techniques, for crafting effective policy]{.underline}. Sophisticated
research design is not the enemy of effective policy, it is critically
necessary for it. Certainly, the current academic focus on building
research designs that permit causal inference speaks exactly to what
policymakers care about the most: if implementing a certain policy will
cause the desired outcome.

Or, put differently, [bad research designs make for bad public
policy]{.underline}. A classic example is school busing. In the 1960s
and early 1970s, some cities adopted voluntary integration programs for
public schools, in which families could volunteer to bus their children
to schools in neighborhoods with different racial majorities.
Policymakers used the favorable results for the voluntary programs to
make the improper inference that mandatory busing policies would also
work. The result was bad public policy and violence in the streets.

[Sophisticated technical methods]{.underline} can [improve our ability
to make causal inferences, and can help solve other empirical
problems]{.underline}. Consider that [the heart of successful
counterinsurgency is, according to U.S. military doctrine, winning the
support of the population. Assessing whether certain policies do win
**public support requires collecting opinion data**.]{.underline} A
conventional method for measuring popular opinion is the survey, but of
course, individuals in insurgency-stricken areas may be unwilling to
reveal their true opinions to a survey-taker out of fear for their
personal safety. Methodologists have crafted sophisticated techniques
for addressing this issue, improving our ability to measure public
support for the government in these areas. These techniques have been
used to assess better the determinants of public support in
insurgency-affected countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India.

Going forward, [we will continue to need advanced methodologies to
address pressing policy questions]{.underline}. Consider the U.S.
military's commitment to gender integration. The implementation of this
commitment will be best informed if it rests on rigorous social science
that address outstanding questions. Is [there a Sacagawea
effect]{.underline}, in which mixed gender units engaged in
counterinsurgency are more effective than male-only units? [How might
mixed gender affect small unit cohesion in combat? How might mixed
gender units reduce the incidence of sexual assault, both within the
military and of assault committed by troops against
civilians?]{.underline}

Certainly, other areas of public policy understand the importance of
rigorous research design. [Economic and development policy communities
read the work of and employ economics Ph.D.s. Policymakers **incorporate
the findings of sophisticated studies** on policy areas]{.underline}
such as microfinance, gender empowerment, and foreign aid, [knowing the
best policy decisions must incorporate these studies'
findings.]{.underline}

Or consider [public health]{.underline} policy. Lives are literally on
the line as decision-makers must make decisions about issues such as
vaccinations, nutritional recommendations, and air quality.
[Policymakers know they must use sophisticated technical studies
executed by epidemiologists and other public health academics to craft
the best policies.]{.underline}

Critics will argue that some U.S. policymakers remain alienated from
contemporary academic IR work, with the suggestion that if IR academics
let go of an obsession with technique, they will then be better able to
connect with policymakers and help them craft better policy. I agree
that [IR academics need to find ways to communicate their results in
clear, non-technical language. But the **technical components of the
work need to be there**.]{.underline} [Stripping them out directly
undermines the ability of the research to give the right kinds of policy
recommendations.]{.underline}

Let me conclude by noting that I am sympathetic to the concern that IR
academics should think about the big picture as well as smaller
questions, the forest of grand strategy as well as the trees of foreign
policy tools. [IR academics have the potential to make real
contributions to big picture debates]{.underline}, to think hard about
the essence of grand strategy by assembling a framework that effectively
integrates foreign policy means and ends. The nature of the IR subfield
and its integration of political economy and security, and its ability
to think about structure as well as units, make it especially well
positioned to consider these broad questions. [The ability of IR
academics to contribute to contemporary foreign policy debates is one of
many reasons why political science should retain the subfield of IR and
**resist the temptation to replace the traditional empirical subfields**
of IR]{.underline}, comparative, and American with new subfields of
conflict, political economy, behavior, and institutions.

### 2AC\-\--Link\-\--AT: Death?

#### Bifo's theory is wrong -- collapse has been empirically disproven

Inquiry, Writer and Editor for Sharable, "I Sure Hope Bifo Doesn't Count
Vibrators as Tools of Estrangement", Destructural, 2-20,

I just finished Franco Berardi's The Soul at Work, and though there's a
lot to agree with in there, the conclusion left me feeling
argumentative. In reviving Baudrillard's critique of the politics of
desire[, Berardi argues that horizontalism and affirmation -- two
cornerstones of Deleuze and Guatarri's]{.underline} schizo [thought --
have been irredeemably co-opted by capital.]{.underline} Our social
pathology is no longer Freudian repression, but overabundance of
affirmation, of injunctions to consume and desire that produce panic and
depression. When our very affective expressions have been colonized, the
multitude is nothing but a robotic swarm:

"The multitude can speak hundreds of thousands of languages, but the
language that enables it to function as an integrated whole is that of
the economic automatisms embodied in technology. Seized in a game of
mirrors of indeterminacy and precariousness, the multitude manifests its
dark side and follows automatisms that turn its wealth into misery, its
power into anguish and its creativity into dependency."

"The effective exercise of politics (that is to say of political
government) presupposes a conscious possibility of elaborating of the
information collectively shared by the social organism. But the
information circulating within digital society is too much: too fast,
too intense, too thick and complex for individuals or groups to
elaborate it consciously, critically, reasonably, with the necessary
time to make a decision. Therefor the decision is left to automatisms,
and the social organism seems to function ever more often according to
evolutionary rules of an automatic kind, inscribed in the genetic
cognitive patrimony of individuals. The swarm now tends to become the
dominant form of human action."

As the ultimate horror, Berardi looks to a biotechnological
post-humanism as described by Bill Gates. [The idea of a literal
hive-mind, a freely flowing general intellect, is too much for Berardi;
he offers the only solution he can think of to this dangerous
acceleration of affective communication: slow down]{.underline}. In a
more recent article[, he calls]{.underline}, in the middle of the
largest wave of global youth insurrection in over forty years, for a
process of growing old. ["\[T\]he process of senilization may open the
way to a cultural revolution based on the force of exhaustion, of facing
the inevitable with grace, discovering the sensuous slowness of those
who do not expect any more from life than wisdom]{.underline}---the
wisdom of those who have seen a great deal without forgetting, who look
at each thing as if for the first time." [The assumption underlying this
call to inaction is that the system of semiocapital is nearing its
inevitable collapse]{.underline}. [Berardi sounds like an aged and
depressive Saint-Simon when he writes]{.underline} a hopeful narrative
in which the machines will make stuff for us which, combined with income
delinked from employment, will give us all the necessary time we need to
play mahjong and dominoes, which is the goal of life. Actually, to be
fair, Berardi never ceases to use sex as the goal, the time necessary to
fuck is what we must carve away from capitalist control.

Baudrillard's critique of Foucault and Deleuze that Berardi revives was
prescient in some ways. He saw the appropriation of affirmation by
capital coming, and he asks essentially how we can stand to read Deleuze
while wearing Nike. "Affirm your desires" is an advertising slogan, and
it could handle even the queer negation of Gregg Araki which it
transformed into Hot Topic. In the final scene of Araki's breakout film
The Living End, two HIV-positive lovers are entangled half-fighting
half-fucking in the desert. While one sucks off a pistol, the other
yells at him to "just do it!" -- four years after it became a shoe
slogan. [Berardi thinks we've been overtaken and the only solution is
switching into reverse.]{.underline} ([Which is going to happen whether
we like it or not because semiocapital is collapsing
anyway]{.underline}.) Always already co-opted, the multitude has no
choice but to break down its constitutive links and start over. The only
thing left is catastrophe: made by us, but not done by us.

Okay, my issues:

1\. Berardi should be the last one to think a brain of any sort is
univocal. He's horrified by Bill Gates's idea of business at the speed
of thought, but what is the speed of thought really? Brains can be and
are used to produce value for the market, but any friend of Felix
Guattari should know [brains are chaotic. They produce ideas for the
boss, but they inevitably produce jokes and nightmares as well. Just
because capital has organized a social brain -- transcending more
spatial and interpersonal barriers than ever before -- **doesn't make it
the hive's necessary owner**.]{.underline} [The processes that Berardi
outlines]{.underline} ("wealth into misery, power into anguish,
creativity into dependency") [present the possibility that it could be
otherwise, that there could be a reverse movement. What capital offers
is this impoverished multitude, but we ought not treat this as an offer
to be either accepted or refused.]{.underline}

2\. I feel pretty derisive about this fear of speed. Certainly a lot of
his critiques about the schizogenic nature of contemporary
knowledge-work are valid, but [**the worry that society is not able to
deliberate "reasonably"** at these speeds **is misplaced**]{.underline}.
[The swarm has been empirically capable of making decisions contrary to
its instructions]{.underline} in Egpyt, Tunisia, [The UK, Wisconsin,
etc., and these actions have been successful to the degree that they've
been fast and unreasonable. Crisis calls on creativity and innovation,
and sabotage requires the multitude to seize the boss' networks. In
Madison, WI, the Capitol occupiers are engaged in the sabotage of the
labor of citizenship, which is, as Tahrir Square was/is in Egypt,
productive of new relations and subjectivities]{.underline}. Berardi
points to the role of prescription drugs in pacifying and anesthetizing
young people as intrinsically related to the speed technology requires,
but I'm willing to bet there are a bunch of students in Madison who may
be on Twitter, but haven't needed to take their ADD meds.

#### Bataille is a fascist who views war as an aesthetic\-\--reading his cards justifies mass violence\-\--reject it

**Wolin 96** \[Richard Wolin, 1996, "Left Fascism: Georges Bataille and
the German Ideology," The Inheritance of the German Right,
Constellations, Volume 2, Issue 3,
[https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8675.1996.tb00037.x\]\\\\pairie](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8675.1996.tb00037.x%5d\\pairie)

Moreover, [the cultural attitudes of both Spengler and **Bataille are
linked** by **an aesthetics of violence** that is highly characteristic
of the "front generation.]{.underline}" In a key passage in The Decline
of the West, Spengler, depicting the "life-world" of blood and instinct
that had been repressed by the Faustian spirit of modernity, observes:
"War is the primary politics of everything that lives and so much so
that in the depths battle and life are one, and being and will-to-battle
expire together."2' Similarly, for Junger, "War is an intoxication
beyond all bonds. It is a frenzy without cautions and limits, comparable
only to the forces of nature."29 Bataille (the meaning of his name in
French should be recalled), too, is convinced, that "conflict is life.
Man's value depends upon his aggressive strength. A living man regards
death as the fulfillment of life; he does not see it as a misfortune. .
, , I MYSELF AM WAR."30 As Jay observes in this connection: "on a deeper
level, the war \[World War I\] seems to have exercised a certain
positive fascination \[on Bataille\]. [For it is striking that many of
Bataille's obsessive themes would betray an affinity for the experiences
of degradation, pollution, violence and communal bonding that were
characteristic of life in the trenches.]{.underline} In the worldview of
both Bataille and that of German young conservatives, war plays an
essential, positive role. It serves as a means of dissolving the
principium individuationis: the principle of bourgeois subjectivity, on
which the homogeneous order of society - a world of loneliness and
fragmentation - depends. For, according to Bataille, "the general
movement of life is . . . accomplished beyond the demands of
individual\^.\"\^\^ [It is in precisely this spirit that he celebrates
the nonutilitarian nature of "combat" or "war" as a type of aestheticist
end in itself:]{.underline} "Glory . . . expresses a movement of
senseless frenzy, of measureless expenditure of energy, which the fervor
of combat presupposes. Combat is glorious in that it is always beyond
calculation at some moment."33 For the same reasons, Bataille eulogizes
those premodern "warmer societies in which pure, uncalculated violence
and ostentatious forms of combat held sway." For [under such conditions,
war was not made subservient to the vulgar ends of enterprise and
accumulation, as is the case for modern-day imperialism, but served as a
glorious end in itself. Yet, in the early 1930s, it was precisely this
aestheticist celebration of "violence for violence's sake," or "war for
war's sake," that Benjamin viewed as the essence of **modern
fascism**.]{.underline} As he remarks in a well known passage : "Fiat
ars - pereat mundus," says fascism, and, as Marinetti admits, expects
war to supply the artistic gratification of a sense perception that has
been changed by technology. . . . Mankind, which in Homer's time was an
object of contemplation for the Olympian gods, now is one for itself.
Its selfalienation has reached such a degree that it can experience its
own destruction as an aesthetic pleasure of the first order. This is the
[situation of politics which fascism is rendering
aesthetic.\~]{.underline}

#### Bataille is wrong... living is probably good.

**Johnson 03** \[David Johnson, 2003, "Why View All Time from the
Perspective of Time's End? A Bergonsonian attack on Bataillean
transcience," Time & Society\][\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

Existential Aspects [Life is a **serious business** of highly charged
temporal stakes]{.underline}, involving a being's struggle to secure for
itself the experience of pleasure time/free time rather than pain
time/slave time. Since lived time is a living stake, [death is **not the
profound phenomenon that Bataille thinks it is**]{.underline}. For one
who is racked by drawn-out pain, the pain of death situated at the end
of time is an irrelevance. And for one who is caught up in the throes of
extended pleasure, the dubious pleasure of death is likewise irrelevant.
Death, far from being profound, may simply provide a pragmatic escape
from a life of pain and toil, or a simple halt to a life of pleasure and
freedom. We can see death as important to time in that it is the end of
the great game of time, the great flow. But death is relative in
importance to time for the same reason; it is simply the end of the
great game of time, a game without which it would be pure abstraction.
However, [we are not suggesting that death has absolutely no importance
for living beings]{.underline}. On the contrary. By countering
Bataille's view of death, which tries to domesticate death through
attempting to engage it in 'intimate' dialogue, and which tries to make
political gain out of death, [we can see death as a real, non-negotiable
phenomenon. Death can no longer be thought of as an ambiguous but
essentially accessible deity]{.underline}, but must instead be seen as
that which wipes out real substantial time with no hope of appeal.
[Death can now be viewed as a certain element in the game of time, as
something to be dreaded or desire as the end of time, but which has no
fixed moral or political meaning in itself]{.underline}. By affirming
the reality of time we are in fact affirming the reality of death, and
so we are proposing a more tragic philosophy than the one Bataille
proposes -- which is ironic, given that Bataille is considered by most
postmodernist/post-structuralist philosophers to be perhaps the
cruellest thinker.

#### Let's cheer up\-\--cybernetic capitalism is sustainable and Bifo is wrong

**Sayarer 15** \[Julian Sayarer, 06-15-2015, "Cheer up 'Bifo'---history
hasn't ended yet," openDemocracy,
[https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/cheer-up-bifohistory-hasnt-ended-yet/\]\\\\pairie](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/cheer-up-bifohistory-hasnt-ended-yet/%5d\\pairie)

Verso's new Futures series was put together, so states the inside page,
to assess the "outer limits of social and political possibility." So
it's disappointing to find [in Franco 'Bifo' Berardi's]{.underline}
contribution Heroes: Mass Murder and Suicide, such a lack of the
possible. Indeed, the book [often seems little more than a lament for
the impossible scale of the task facing advocates of progressive
politics in an age of neo-liberalism.]{.underline}

[From Virginia Tech to Norway's Anders Breivik, mass shootings **are
mashed together** with collateralised debt obligations and credit
default swaps to create an antediluvian collage of the variety used to
caricature leftists as disgruntled losers with a dislike of
progress.]{.underline}

By the closing chapters, when Berardi seems to disown his own 'horrible'
miscellany of bloody mental health disasters as only a form of purging,
the reader is somewhat confused as to what the author was meaning to
achieve in the first place. [Misleadingly, there is very little of the
'future' in the book at all.]{.underline}

Rather, Heroes is more the presence of a man looking constantly for
answers to problems as they would have manifested [in the past. Berardi,
aged 66, has created a rich nostalgia, often very eloquent, but
possessing an internal consistency that **unravels with the gentlest
application of the world and events outside his theory.**]{.underline}

It being far easier to criticise than create, however, it's important to
recognise the value of Berardi's offering: the absolutism of his ideas
on the destructive relationship between mental health and modern
capitalism. These ideas, at the very least, present a strong blueprint
from which the issues can be examined in the future with less dogma and
more light.

Berardi is at his most insightful when asking compassionate, human
questions rather than enjoying his platform for polemical rhetoric. Is
it problematic for humans and our ability to communicate with one
another that children are now exposed to more speech and dialogue via
media and screens, so that language is learned without direct need for
human interaction? Does the market-logic of neo-liberalism---the
all-pervasive idea of competition and optimisation---encourage behaviour
in which the spectre of competition destroys our sense of self and our
ability to be amongst others as relaxed, non-economic beings? Since
human labour inputs have become mental rather than physical, is the
mechanisation of our brain some sad inevitability?

Heroes reads more as an impassioned, despairing plea for reason than its
grand, academic tones suggest, and the book would likely be less
frustrating if read as such. Its pages are fit to bursting with a sense
of end-of-history, though Berardi seems to date this varyingly---1978
and David Bowie's release of 'Heroes;' 1977 and a mass suicide in Japan;
1492 and the expulsion of the Moors from Spain, along with Columbus'
landing in America; the Berlin Wall; Paris 1968; and the death of
Charlie Chaplin.

Most of all, Berardi seems determined to create an emblem of suicide as
the triumphant, self-obsessed pinnacle of some orgiastic misanthropy.
The Germanwings plane crash in the Austrian Alps occurred tragically
close to his book's publication, perhaps giving the author an ugly
validation as he toils to present the death of society and a diminishing
love for our fellow humans. [And yet more than an explanation of the
world, Berardi seems in thrall to writing some stoic but **cherry-picked
portrait of despair**, taking an obvious enjoyment in a mode of
theorising that seems to assuage any misery, or even genuine engagement
with the perils he proclaims now engulf us.]{.underline}

His concluding remarks summarise a book that's trying hard to stand for
something. Berardi proscribes joy as the antidote to despair (despite
providing many reasons for the latter and none for the former),
suggesting vaguely that what he terms "neuro plasticity" will be the key
asset in twenty-first century liberations. He concludes in praise of
irony, while instructing his readers not to believe or take-seriously
the previous 225 pages of (by now we must presume) recreational
doom-harbinging.

Indeed, were it not that [Berardi's logic were so
**selective**]{.underline} and its perspective so narrow, the book would
be all the more disheartening. Fortunately, also conspicuous is an
author who is himself struggling with the present, soothing his concerns
with an easy, leftist lament that envisages no greater role for humans
than that of the happy worker.

He raises objections to algorithms (rather than---more
helpfully---arguing that these tools might serve human ends), and wishes
for a time when humans made 'real objects.' The book also advances an
elementary critique of monetary systems that rightly illustrates the
economy of faith that is currency, but seems only to conclude that some
finite resource (such as gold and the gold standard it once underpinned)
might in some way be an improvement.

All of this is profoundly unfortunate, for few would deny that modern
work patterns must be made fairer and more human. Early on, Berardi
writes:

"History has been replaced by the endless flowing recombination of
fragmentary images... frantic precarious activity has taken the place of
political awareness and strategy."

[The ironic missed opportunity of Heroes is that in it, the author has
produced only one further recombination: a pastiche of graphic events,
mass shootings and assorted corporate abuses that **fall victim to the
same shallow lust for spectacle that Berardi devotes such worthy efforts
to decry**.]{.underline} Anders Breivik, Virginia Tech, the Aurora
Killings, Japanese suicide patterns and much else besides---modern
capitalism has had an enormously detrimental effect on the lives of
billions, and yet a statistically irrelevant number of these sorrows and
grievances culminate in either mass shootings or suicides.

Berardi identifies the existence of an iceberg, and yet contents himself
with describing only its very tip. He eschews the banal and the human to
focus on the fast-sell of the sensational, prophesising some coming end
rather than taking on the more trying but rewarding task of explaining
how things persist when so much suggests they might fall apart. He
explains exceptions delightfully, while seldom troubling himself with
the rule itself, or the norm he condemns.

[It is this very tendency that must be redressed, as Berardi probably
would agree. **He affords no attention** to peer to-peer lending, fossil
fuel divestment, credit unions, ethical banking growth, worker co-ops,
fair tax certification, communication expansion through cell phones and
the internet, or innovations in mobile currency.]{.underline}

All of these changes are potentially problematic developments that are
of course vulnerable to the replication of old injustices. No less
certainly, however, they offer evidence that the status quo Berardi
describes is neither static nor condemned only to change the world for
the worse.

Heroes reads like a man eloquently giving up, and, in the last event,
trying hard to assure the reader that this was never his intent. [In
this and many other regards, **Berardi does not convince.**]{.underline}

#### Bifo is wrong\-\--he doesn't cite any data and is incoherent

[According to Berardi, the system is immune to transformative criticism
because it entertains all positions and allows every voice to be
heard]{.underline}. Serious criticisms mix and mingle with absurd
conspiracy theories, apocalyptic scenarios, and fake news.

How do we begin to bring about the solution, the second coming of
communism? Berardi reinterprets Marx's Eleventh Thesis on Feuerbach,
stressing the importance of interpretation as a form of political
praxis. He claims, 'It may be that Marx's famous eleventh thesis on
Feuerbach -- the central pillar of the revolutionary methodology of the
last century and a half -- simply needs to be overturned. Marx wrote
there that 'Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in
various ways; the point is to change it' -- and the philosophers of the
last century tried to do so. The results are catastrophic' (3).

We need to develop radical interpretations of our contemporary situation
that open up possibilities for genuinely liberating action in a world
that is meticulously interpreted, ranked, rated, and prepackaged for us.
There is a wealth of knowledge, potential, and possibility in what
Berardi refers to as the 'General Intellect,' that stock of global
knowledge which we all, in principle, have access to. In the more
prosperous societies it seems possible to realize Marx's ideal of
self-development as outlined in The German Ideology, each person
becoming fully human by doing many different things without becoming any
one of those things. However, the system is so relentless in its
production of what is probable that it becomes difficult to see what is
possible.

Turning to a few criticisms[, Berardi's text is a loosely-woven
collection of insights, many of which have appeared in previous
publications. As such, it **suffers from a coherent** method and
structure.]{.underline} Although his rhizomatic approach is suggestive
and useful, he often falls back on conventional and unconvincing methods
of analysis. He is especially fond of positing inverse relationships
similar to those employed by Marx in The Economic and Philosophic
Manuscripts, 'The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he
produces . . .the worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more
commodities he creates. The devaluation of the world of men is in direct
proportion to the increasing value of the world of things.'

[Berardi employs the same logic throughout the text, like an hourglass,
one part of life fills up in proportion to the other part emptying
out]{.underline}. 'Technological potency has steadily expanded while
social consciousness has decreased proportionately' (12).

[Berardi also tends to use **anecdotes instead of evidence** when it
suits his purpose.]{.underline} For example, he claims that two factors
responsible for our inability to interpret our way out of the
labyrinthine system are sensory overload and a decline in the quality of
education. 'The expansion of the infosphere has forced the acceleration
of the mental reaction to info-nervous stimulation. But the critical
mind is unable to function in conditions of info-nervous saturation,
while the rate of education and the quality of education have fallen and
deteriorated' (19).

[Both of these assertions are problematic. Regarding sensory overload,
which Berardi refers to as the inability of the 'psychosphere' to keep
up with the 'infosphere,' humans have always been challenged by
information rich environments. **We adapt quite rapidly to large
quantities of stimuli** that remain constant in our environment and we
learn quickly how to focus our attention on the essential aspects of a
complex situation.]{.underline} However, as the demand for screening out
information increases we do probably become less empathetic and
sensitive, which is one of Berardi's important points.

Rather than brute information overload, it seems more likely that part
of the problem is total absorption. We are like fish who don't recognize
the water, and the water is the ubiquitous complexity of prepackaged
social relations expanding in open-ended structures, paths, and
networks. The system works so well because the overall feel is not
constriction and limitation, but expansive freedom and endless novelty.

[The other problem is that it is not clear that we are becoming
dumber]{.underline}. This is a form of Golden-Age thinking. Berardi
claims that, 'Idiocy is spreading worldwide as a revolt against the
mathematical rationality of financial plundering: a blackout of reason,
as revenge does not listen to reason' (5). [Yet the data suggests
otherwise. The **global literacy rate has increased by 4%** every 5
years for the past 65 years, increasing from 42% worldwide in 1960 to
86% in 2015.]{.underline}

[On the other hand, if Berardi's concern about the spread of 'idiocy'
refers to racism, sexism, xenophobia, and other forms of retrograde
thinking, it is unlikely that this is a reaction to the unassailable
machinations of the international financial system, as he claims. It
seems more likely that our awareness of social injustices, as well as
our **capacity for empathy has increased,** while the phenomena
themselves have not become more widespread or barbaric.]{.underline}

#### Bifo's apolitical understanding of communism ensures the continued existence of capitalism

**Lear 12** \[Ben Lear is an underemployed researcher living in
Manchester, UK. He recently co-authored an article in Occupy Everything!
Reflections on Why it\'s Kicking off Everywhere, and is a member of Plan
C. "Lifeboat Communism -- A Review of Franco "Bifo" Berardi's After the
Future"//ASherm\]

What does the end of the future mean for radical politics? It is at this
point that [Bifo's argument becomes problematic.]{.underline} In an
argument that intersects with groups such as Tiqqun, [Bifo argues that
we must see "Communism as a necessity in the collapse of capital."
Distant from the voluntarism of previous forms of Communist
politics]{.underline}, this "[post-growth Communism" will be best
understood as a necessary response to capital's refusal of
labour]{.underline}. Cut adrift from the "opportunity" to work, with
welfare systems dismantled, Bifo argues that we will witness the
proliferation of zones of autonomy responding to the needs of an
increasingly precarious and superfluous social body. Communist politics
will emerge from an exodus, both voluntary and compulsory, from a
stagnating and increasingly predatory state-capital nexus. This exodus
is both social, in the development of an alternative infrastructure, and
personal, in the withdrawal from the hyper-stimulation of the semiotic
economy. [Bifo abandons hope in collective contestation at the level of
the political. Bifo's politics could be described as a kind of "lifeboat
communism." As the crisis ripples, mutates, and deepens, Bifo sees the
role of communism as the creation of spaces of solidarity to blunt the
worst effects of the crisis of social reproduction]{.underline}. Gone is
the demand for a better world for all, the liberation of our collective
social wealth, or the unlocking of the social potentials of technology.
Rather, [Bifo's politics are based around insulating a necessarily small
portion of society from the dictates of capital.]{.underline} [By
withdrawing from the political sphere, we]{.underline} accept the
likelihood of losing the final scraps of the welfare state and [concede
the terrain of the political to zombie politics and predatory capital.
Rather than seeking new forms of organization]{.underline} to re-enter
the political stage, Bifo seems to suggest that we seek shelter beneath
it as best we can. This shying away from the political stage is the
weakness at the heart of the book. [Recent eruptions of political
struggle have captured the collectiveimagination because they
demonstrate that political contestation is still possible today, in
spite of the obstacles Bifo has described]{.underline}. The
[Occupy]{.underline} movement [and the uprisings in the Middle East and
North Africa have resonated with all those who still have hope in
collective struggle. Although these movements have encountered varying
problems, to which we must develop solutions, they dispel the idea of an
unchangeable present]{.underline}. The current blockages to successful
organising have been shown to be strategic and tactical, not terminal.
[Misdiagnosing the current inertia of post-political public life as a
terminal condition leads the left towards an evacuation of the
political, while we should instead reassert its primacy. If we abandon
any hope of fighting]{.underline} in, against, and beyond the existing
architecture of [the]{.underline} [state and capital]{.underline}, and
instead seek refuge in small communes, and go-slow practices, [we
abandon all real hope of a generalized, or generalizable, emancipatory
politics]{.underline}. Although Bifo's analysis of the difficulties of
collective action resonates with all of us who have attempted to
organize struggles in the past few decades, the proposal for a simple
withdrawal from capitalism is a bleak politics indeed -- which, at its
most optimistic, calls for an orderly default by portions of the
proletariat. [The horizons of communist politics appear much narrower
when capitalism is no longer seen as the repository of a vast store of
social wealth awaiting collective redistribution, but rather redefined
as an unassailable site of universal and permanent austerity combined
with widening social redundancy.]{.underline} It is hard to imagine a
network of self-organized projects and systems supporting the majority
of the population in the context of an increasingly predatory
capitalism. Emerging from the and isolated leftist scenes, this lifeboat
communism will by its very nature have a limited carrying capacity, as
the anarchist experience in post-Katrina New Orleans attests. [The
lifeboats that Bifo calls for will undoubtedly be too small and
makeshift to harbor us all.]{.underline} The crisis is twofold. It is a
crisis of capitalist profitability, and of an increasingly precarious
and surplus global proletariat whose reproduction (as both labour and
body) is under threat. [It is unlikely that the proliferation of
communes, squats, food co-ops, file sharers, urban gardeners, and
voluntary health services will bring forth a new, better
world]{.underline}. But while the current seemingly post-political
situation throws up massive obstacles to organizing, there is still a
potential for collective contestation. [The capitalist state, racked by
its own legitimacy crisis and weekly political scandals, is more
vulnerable than it appears.]{.underline} We need only recall the period
of unexpected hope built by students in Britain, occupiers in Oakland,
and vast swathes of North Africa and the Middle East during the past two
years. These movements were mobilised through the betrayal of a vision
of the future -- but alongside their rage, they put forth a hope which
can guide our politics. The task at hand is to unlearn old behaviour and
to forge new tactical and organisational weapons for struggle. Bifo's
contribution is a timely and challenging one, but it ultimately leads us
back towards a DIY culture and "outreach" politics. As our movements
come to terms with these limits, we must also hold onto the belief that
luxury for all is possible. The social potential of unfilled blocks of
flats, emerging technologies like 3D-printing, and the desires of the
millions of underemployed, should remind us of this. This will not be
possible without a collective struggle against the state and the demands
of capital, one which simultaneously defends what we have and attempts
to move beyond it. A retreat to lifeboat politics is both premature and
a self-fulfilling prophecy. [While Bifo correctly analyses the current
conjuncture]{.underline} -- clearly identifying the post-political
state, the weakness of the Left, the crisis of profitability and new
forms of labour, and their impact on the subject -- [his political
prescriptions lead us in the wrong direction. Just as Bifo does, we
place the struggle against work at the center; but we can also seek to
liberate social wealth,]{.underline} rather than insulate a lucky few
from the ravages of capital. [Rather than "No Future," we must raise a
different banner: "The future's here, it just needs
reorganizing."]{.underline}

#### Bifo's theory justifies the massive violence done by contemporary capitalism

**Keefer 11** \[Lucas Keefer is currently a graduate student studying
philosophy and psychology at Georgia State University. "Review - The
Soul at Work" //ASherm\]

Of course, some Marxist theorists have already been aware of this need
for a critique of contemporary consciousness and have suggested
important alternatives. Berardi follows Deleuze and Guattari in adopting
a therapeutic approach, though we might also follow Lefebvre (1943/2009)
and suggest that [a critique of semiocapitalism might also depend on
returning to an analysis of the reality of alienation in the everyday
lives of those oppressed.]{.underline} If the "soul" oppresses itself
under semiocapitalism, it does so only by investing all meaning in the
symbolic reality of simulations. [Marxist-scientific critique remains,
therefore, one way of returning this oppressed symbolic consciousness to
the reality of its oppression]{.underline} (see also e.g. Martín-Baró,
1994). Berardi also notes the ways in which semiocapitalism pathologizes
(and medicates) reactions against alienation (207). The increased rates
of depression and availability of anti-depressants, Berardi suggests,
are an indication of humanity's resistance to a system of symbolic
production that exploits subjectivity. As a result, [no medicalization
of depression can ever hope to successfully treat the root cause of
depression, which lies in the alienated existence of
postmodernity]{.underline}. The problem here is striking: treatments for
depression cost money and only further demand that people labor under
semiocapitalism to afford their medications and therapy. It is a race to
the bottom in which exploitation and treatment perpetuate each other
indefinitely. Berardi suggests a therapeutic shift towards
schizoanalysis, following Deleuze (214-219), which suggests that
therapeutics must be an ongoing project of restoring autonomy in the
face of capitalism's control over desire. One noteworthy omission from
this text is the absence of any consideration of semiocapitalism's
relationship to other capitalisms. [While Berardi illustrates the
process of alienation in semiocapitalism, these analyses must be
tempered by a recognition that cognitive labor is not the norm. While
globalization may change this over time, we should recognize that
semiocapitalism itself depends upon the more concrete alienation of the
physical laborers who provide food]{.underline} (e.g. de Botton, 2009),
etc. [For semiocapitalism to be]{.underline} [parasitic]{.underline}
upon the "souls" of human laborers, [it must also be parasitic upon the
bodies of others to perpetuate the physical existence that underlies the
alienation of the soul.]{.underline}

#### Calling for the ballot re-affirms the status quo

**Campbell 98** \[David, "Performing Politics and the Limits of
Language, Theory & Event"\]

[Those who argue that]{.underline} hate [speech demands juridical
responses assert that not only does the speech communicate, but that it
constitutes an injurious act.]{.underline} This presumes that not only
does speech act, but that \"it acts upon the addressee in an injurious
way\" (16). [This argumentation is]{.underline}, in Butler\'s eyes,
[based upon a \"sovereign conceit\" whereby speech wields a sovereign
power, acts as an imperative, and embodies a causative understanding of
representation.]{.underline} In this manner, hate speech constitutes its
subjects as injured victims unable to respond themselves and in need of
the law\'s intervention to restrict if not censor the offending words,
and punish the speaker: [This idealization of the speech act as a
sovereign action]{.underline} (whether positive or negative) [appears
linked with the idealization of sovereign state power]{.underline} or,
rather, with the imagined and forceful voice of that power. [It is as if
the proper power of the state has been expropriated, delegated to its
citizens, and the state then rememerges as a neutral instrument to which
we seek recourse to protects as from other citizens, who have become
revived emblems of a (lost) sovereign power]{.underline} (82). Two
elements of this are paradoxical. First, the sovereign conceit embedded
in conventional renderings of hate speech comes at a time when
understanding power in sovereign terms is becoming (if at all ever
possible) even more difficult. Thus [the juridical response]{.underline}
to hate speech helps [deal with an onto-political problem:]{.underline}
\"The constraints of legal language emerge to put an end to this
particular historical anxiety \[the problematisation of sovereignty\],
for the law requires that we resituate power in the language of injury,
that we accord injury the status of an act and trace that act to the
specific conduct of a subject\" (78). The second, which stems from this,
is that (to use Butler\'s own admittedly hyperbolic formulation) \"the
state produces hate speech.\" By this she means not that the state is
the sovereign subject from which the various slurs emanate, but [that
within the frame of the juridical account of]{.underline} hate spee[ch
\"the category cannot exist without the state\'s ratification, and this
power of the state\'s judicial language to establish and maintain the
domain of what will be publicly speakable suggests that the state plays
much more than a limiting function in such decisions; in fact, the state
actively produces the domain of publicly acceptable speech, demarcating
the line between the domains of the speakable and the unspeakable, and
retaining the power to make and sustain the line of consequential
demarcation]{.underline}\" (77). [The sovereign conceit of the juridical
argument thus linguistically resurrects the sovereign subject at the
very moment it seems most vulnerable, and reaffirms the sovereign state
and its power in relation to that subject at the very moment its
phantasmatic condition is most apparent.]{.underline} The danger is that
the resultant extension of state power will be turned against the social
movements that sought legal redress in the first place (24)

#### Bifo's analysis is reductive and over-totalizing

**Pursley 10** \[Mike, "From Alienation to Autonomy by Franco \"Bifo\"
Berardi"//ASherm\]

Here's a taste of some of the most abstract: "The infinite capacity of
replication of the recombining simulator device erases the originality
of the event." Or how about: "[The productive finalization of technology
ends up subjugating the thinking process from the standpoint of its own
epistemological structures]{.underline}." Indeed. [Capitalism, and his
absolute distaste for it, is where Bifo makes himself absolutely
clear.]{.underline} It's the catch-all cause for all modern strife, a
"pathogenic mechanism" that is the ruin of everything. Preaching
"liberation from capitalism" is where the author will most likely loose
all but the most radical of readers. [The capitalist system is clearly
not without faults, but presenting it as scapegoat for every ill we face
may be too simple]{.underline}. At times [Bifo seems a cranky old
curmudgeon madly shaking his fist at the present]{.underline}. This is
the Bifo that bemoans "collective mental pollution" and says of the
world: "too many signs, too fast, too chaotic." [His qualms with
hyperreal society are at times a good diagnosis of our problems, but the
prescribed anti-capitalist panacea remains questionable. For all the
theory involved to make his case, Bifo's solution is]{.underline}
strangely and kind of awesomely [underwhelming]{.underline}. [We are
urged to reconsider how wealth is defined, to focus more on friendships
and an easygoing life rather than profits. Who but Henry Ford himself
could argue with that]{.underline}? The volume ends with a few thoughts
on the current Great Recession, where the collapse of the economy "can
be read as the return of the soul." For that, we will have to see.

### [2AC\-\--Link\-\--AT: Diplomacy]{.underline} 

#### Cybernetics hasn't eliminated the effectiveness of diplomacy 

**Unker 17** \[Akin Unker, 06-11-2017, "Computational Diplomacy: Foreign
Policy Communication in the Age of Algorithms and Automation," Cyber
Governance & Digital Democracy,"
[https://edam.org.tr/en/computational-diplomacy-foreign-policy-communication-in-the-age-of-algorithms-and-automation/\]\\\\pairie](https://edam.org.tr/en/computational-diplomacy-foreign-policy-communication-in-the-age-of-algorithms-and-automation/%5d\\pairie)

[**Automation doesn't change the fact that diplomats** and embassies
still **matter.**]{.underline} [Foreign policy,]{.underline} like all
politics, [is a factor of human condition, including sense, gut feeling
and cultural cues, along with its imperfections]{.underline}. However,
there is a clear trajectory whereby states that can best adapt to
automation -- in war, foreign policy and economy -- will develop more
efficient ways of dealing with the challenges of an interconnected,
data-centric world. [Diplomacy too, can retain its relevance and
influence over politics between nations, so long as it can properly
designate areas where automation can help and where it
can't.]{.underline} Although all states will come up with their own
answers to these questions, based on their own individual interests and
needs, the common direction in which automation and foreign policy is
headed is more or less similar for all countries. In the future,
diplomacy has to build data processing and management capabilities, with
dedicated departments and scientists supporting diplomats and
negotiators on the ground. The structure of this new framework will also
heavily depend on regime type, scope of foreign interests and alliance
behavior.

The structural shadow of uncertainty over diplomacy is stronger than
ever. Some communicative rituals and practices of diplomacy are growing
more obsolete, as modern political communication slides increasingly to
short and sharp rhetoric, coupled with automation tools that bombard
audiences at unprecedented levels. [Diplomacy itself is hardly obsolete
however, as the task of mediating and negotiating power relations is
perhaps as important as it was during the Cold War]{.underline}. New
power centers -- in the form of technology companies and big data
brokers -- are changing the state-centric parameters of classical
realism perhaps, but the inherent dynamics of power realignment still
render diplomacy a crucial [endeavor. To rise to the challenge however,
modern diplomacy has to develop a strong computational capacity, able to
**adapt to the changing nature** of digital communication and advances
in automation.]{.underline}

### [2AC\-\--Impact\-\--AT: Dystopia]{.underline}

#### It won't cause a dystopia\-\--surveillance capitalism isn't strong enough\-\--err aff assume that all of their evidence is biased

**Dupont 08** \[Benoit Dupont, August 2008, "Hacking the Panopticon:
Distributed Online Surveillance and Resistance," \<\<Benoit is the
holder of the Canada Research Chair in Cybersecurity and the Research
Chair for the Prevention of Cybercrime\>\>, D_Sociology of Crime Law and
Deviance\][\\\\pairie](file:///\\pairie)

I offer an additional interpretation inspired by Gary Marx's (2007)
techno-fallacies article and the heuristics' theory of Tversky and
Kahneman (1982). [Just like technophiles often succumb to the false
belief that there is a technological fix for every security problem,
surveillance scholars (as an epistemic community, not as individuals)
are not immune to **biases** that lead them to assume that the
monitoring technologies embedded in virtually every aspect of our lives
are a clear indicator of our inexorable fall into a 1984
reality.]{.underline} Three biases are particularly salient in this
belief system. The first bias is the [initiative bias, which leads
people to attribute less initiative and less imagination to others than
to themselves]{.underline} (Kahneman & Tversky, 1993, p. 3), especially
if they belong to a lower socio-economic group. While surveillance
scholars are able to offer elaborate narratives of the hidden power of
the electronic panopticon and its significance, they frequently discount
the interpretive capacities and agency of surveillance subjects and the
resistance strategies that ensue. The loss aversion bias refers to the
asymmetrical evaluation of positive and negative outcomes, where losses
are systematically overestimated and gains are underestimated. This bias
seems particularly pronounced ''when the reference point is the status
quo, and when retention of the status quo is an option'' (Kahneman &
Tversky, 1993, p. 14). This bias corresponds in surveillance studies to
the reticence manifested toward the study of positive developments
(Haggerty, 2006, p. 35) such as the accountability produced by
meta-surveillance applications or the independence afforded to elderly
patients by monitoring systems that let them stay at home. The tendency
to predict widespread erosions of freedom has also been a prominent
feature of surveillance studies, despite the lack of empirical and
historical data to support this claim. [Democracies **have not
crumbled** since advanced monitoring technologies have invaded our
lives, and the lack of sophisticated surveillance tools has never
prevented authoritarian states to enroll thousands of informers to
control internal dissent]{.underline} (Pfaff, 2001). Finally, the third
heuristic is the probability bias whereby a confusion is made between
what is possible and what is probable (Ohm, 2007). This bias is very
closely connected with the previous one, because on contentious subjects
such as surveillance and privacy, people tend to focus on disastrous
outcomes and neglect the role played by randomness (Taleb, 2004),
complexity, and contested rationalities (Espeland, 1998) among
supervisors. [Surveillance scholars **frequently present what may happen
as what will happen,** obscuring the mechanisms that so often derail the
best plans. Perhaps, the fact that Bentham's **panopticon was actually
never built** and that the British government preferred instead to
deport its prisoners to Australia, an open-air prison where convict
supervision was deliberately kept at a minimum (Kerr, 1989; Jackson,
1998), should **serve as a reminder that dystopias are about as likely
to materialize as utopias.**]{.underline}
