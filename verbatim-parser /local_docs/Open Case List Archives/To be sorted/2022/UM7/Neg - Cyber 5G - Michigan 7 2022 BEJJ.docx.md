#### Despite US pressure, EU-China [telecommunications cooperation]{.underline} is expanding.

**Ligang '21** \[Xiang; 12/28/2021; Director of the Information
Consumption Alliance; \"Huawei is not afraid of rules-based competition
in Europe,\" https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1243599.shtml\]

[Although the US keeps **ratcheting** up **pressure**, only a
**handful** of countries in Europe]{.underline} like the UK and Sweden
[have succumbed to the US pressure and imposed **arbitrary bans** on
Huawei\'s **5G** under a baseless \"security\" guise]{.underline}. In
response to this political maneuver, Huawei has resolutely resorted to
legal options to defend its legitimate rights and interests.

It\'s certain that [Huawei\'s determination to **expand operation** in
Europe will not be **shaken** by any political crackdown]{.underline}.
The US suppression in the past months has fully reflected Huawei\'s
resilience. Huawei generated 320.4 billion yuan (\$49.7 billion) in
revenue in the first half of the year, despite COVID-19 impacts and the
US government assault. [Huawei is not afraid of]{.underline} arbitrary
[political crackdown, let alone healthy competition]{.underline} based
on defined rules.

[For European countries]{.underline}, it is obvious that [following the
US\' lead to impose political suppression]{.underline} on Huawei\'s 5G
[is]{.underline} just [unaffordable]{.underline}. British operator
Vodafone and British Telecom warned that [it would **cost
billions**]{.underline} of pounds [to remove]{.underline} Huawei
[equipment from]{.underline} their [networks, and the operation would
drag on]{.underline} for up to [five to seven years]{.underline},
according to media reports.

To make Huawei decision at the expense of its own economic interests,
but serving the interests of the US government, the result is destined
to be sad for the UK and Sweden \-- delayed rollout of their 5G networks
and higher cost of the taxpayers\' money. When these countries lag in 5G
development, they will realize their mistake.

[Regarding]{.underline} the [development]{.underline} of Huawei [in the
European market, another important issue is the **reciprocal opening**
of]{.underline} the [Chinese and European markets]{.underline}.

Even after Sweden imposed an arbitrary ban on Huawei\'s 5G, for Swedish
company Ericsson and other European companies, [the Chinese government
has been **following** the rules of **free trade** and **investment**,
fully protecting the **legitimate rights** of the development of
European companies within the Chinese market]{.underline}.

Moreover, [China keeps **expanding** its **opening up** and reducing its
negative list of **foreign investment** access]{.underline}.

[Huawei is the]{.underline} world\'s [leading 5G technology provider. To
allow it]{.underline} to participate [in the construction of 5G networks
in Europe is]{.underline} fully [in the **interest** of European
countries and the broad consumers]{.underline}. Europe should also abide
by the principles of free trade and investment and protect the
company\'s proper rights.

At the end of last year, the [leaders of China and Europe completed
**negotiations** on EU - China Comprehensive Agreement on
Investment]{.underline} (**[CAI]{.underline}**). Although there emerged
some uncertainties this year, [the deal is in the **interests of
enterprises** of both sides like Huawei and Ericsson to promote
**reciprocal opening-up** to one another]{.underline}, and now it\'s
time for the ratification of the agreement.

#### Success on 5G cooperation [broadens the scope]{.underline} of BRI coordination, investment, and trade.

The EU digital strategies and recovery plan shows a strong ambition for
the EU to become one of the most advanced digitalized economies in the
next 10-15 years by creating European digital \"champions\" and setting
international standards and certification.

**[Key technologies]{.underline}**, [such as]{.underline} IoT,
**[5G]{.underline}**, cloud, and AI, [are a constant theme in the EU
digital strategies]{.underline}, the EU recovery plan, [and ongoing
**EU-China** digital dialogue]{.underline}. Therefore, [the EU and China
should aim at creating synergies]{.underline} and strong
complementarities in enabling conditions for a new EU-China digital
dialogue and agreement. [This should lead to a **constructive
cooperation**]{.underline} in creating the necessary trust mechanisms.
[Harmonization]{.underline} of technical standards, certification and
other international cyber norms [will be crucial in order to achieve
**legal certainty,** **transparency** and **inter-operability** of
technical equipment.]{.underline}

[This dialogue of **mutual interest** could support a more balanced
**trade** and **investment** pattern, while it could also contribute
to]{.underline} **[broaden the scope of the BRI]{.underline}** to
include digital services and technologies.

For the EU and China, their main objective should be to jointly
accelerate transition towards a digital economy through sustained
digital dialogue on policy and trust mechanisms for digital technologies
in key industrial sectors such as transport, environment, aerospace,
medical and health sector, bio-economy, and finance.

Over the next decade, in order to deliver a strong recovery from the
COVID-19 crisis, European digital investment strategies should enable
synergies and complementarities with the \"Made in China 2025\"
strategy. In this context, [it is clear that **5G technologies** and
software for ultra-fast data transmission and elaboration are expected
to play a **key role**]{.underline}.

As digitalization technologies and processes will have a dual-use,
especially in a geopolitical context, [EU security and other strategic
considerations need also to be taken into account in the overall
selection and decision-making process.]{.underline}

On the other hand, it would be difficult to achieve a de-coupling of the
European economy vis-à-vis the Chinese economy and its economic cycle,
given consolidated and well-developed relations and partnerships in
mutual interest in the field of trade, investment, manufacturing and
regulatory matters.

As [the **transition to a digital economy** is a **strategic objective**
of both Europe and China, it is in the interest of both to]{.underline}
put the emphasis on complementarities to establish an EUChina digital
dialogue and [advance **agreement**]{.underline}.

The rise of [the B]{.underline}elt and [R]{.underline}oad
[I]{.underline}nitiative [is **symptomatic** of the **broader inevitable
rise of China**]{.underline} as a player on the global stage. As such,
it is [fraught with]{.underline} both [**challenges** and
**opportunities for the EU**]{.underline}.

China's Belt and Road Initiative has multifaceted aims that are both
domestic and external in nature and that are inextricably linked to
China's bid for a global leadership role. It is often promoted as an
economic initiative, and, of course, it aims to improve infrastructure
and connectivity, redirect the drivers of Chinese growth from external
to internal factors, and develop the inland areas of China that have
been lagging behind the coastal areas. Nevertheless, the BRI is about
much more than economics: it is inherently geopolitical in nature. The
BRI serves to reassert China's geopolitical influence in Eurasia and the
Indian Ocean; to balance the US presence in these areas; to gain
political leverage over partner countries; and to diversify China's
trade routes, thus shielding them from dependence on key vulnerable
chokepoints. Thus, the BRI is at once economic and geopolitical and the
key to the personal agenda advanced by Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

While those are the BRI's goals, the initiative's challenges are
numerous. The first risk concerns the sustainability of a financial
model dependent on Chinese stateowned banks, the finances of which are
deeply affected by non-performing loans and which lack transparency.
Another key problem is the sustainability of the debts incurred by
partner countries: indeed, while the BRI has many successful
achievements, it sports both "white elephant" projects that have not
materialized and debt crises in countries that have, as a result, seen a
growing backlash against Chinese interests. This highlights the fact
that neither Chinese stateowned enterprises nor many BRI partner
countries possess the expertise and management skills to implement
projects of this scale. On an international level, meanwhile, the
business model of the BRI has challenged the rule-based lending model
advanced by Western development cooperation and thus weakened the
leverage of Western donors and international organizations.

Meanwhile, the EU has adopted a complex and thoughtful approach to the
territories to its east, seeking continuously to manage the inherent
tension between the logic for greater engagement, on the one hand, and
the growing enlargement fatigue within the union, on the other. The EU
has divided Eurasia up according to its own main key parameter -- the
extent to which countries are considered to be candidates for EU
accession in the near or distant future. In other words, [**trade** has
**not** been a **major consideration** for the EU]{.underline} in its
categorization of Eurasian states. In fact, it could be said that trade
played a more significant role in EU thinking in the early 1990s,
whereas, subsequently, an array of other factors have gained prominence.

This creates the problem that the EU has not articulated concrete
interests in its approach to these countries. It is not only trade that
has been secondary to EU activity: [to an even greater extent, the EU
has **ignored geopolitical interests** in developing its **relations
with Eurasia**n states]{.underline}. This study finds that, given the
changing nature of world politics away from the rule-based international
order that the EU was designed to promote, [the EU can **no longer rely
solely** on the power of its **normative values**. It must act more as a
**power**]{.underline}, not an integration project. The EU has begun to
move in this direction with the launch of the Global Strategy and more
specifically the Connectivity Strategy, but [it will succeed **only** if
a more **interest-based approach** that takes geopolitics firmly into
account is adopted across the board in EU ties with countries involved
in the **BRI** project]{.underline}.

[This applies very **directly** to the EU's **approach to China**'s role
in Eurasia, where the EU must **determine its course of
action**]{.underline} on the basis of hard interests. Thus, for example,
the BRI supports an EU interest in weakening Russia's dominance over the
Eurasian continent and makes available resources that the EU itself
cannot muster. Meanwhile, its implications for certain countries' debt
burden and its lack of transparency and implications for the rule of law
oppose the EU's interests in the stability and political development of
these countries. [Weighing]{.underline} these [positive and negative
implications]{.underline} against each other [must be the **guiding
light** for EU approaches to the BRI]{.underline}.

[For future EU policies, this reality calls for **engagement** with
**China** and the **BRI** that is driven by these
interests]{.underline}. Writing from an American perspective, Job
Henning called for [a strategy of "**disruptive
collaboration**]{.underline}" with China as regards the BRI. In essence,
instead of a hostile policy towards Chinese initiatives, Henning
recommended a policy that [recognize]{.underline}s the [common interests
furthered by the BRI]{.underline}, seeking [to encourage Chinese
activities and take a role in the region that **cooperate**s with
**specific** Chinese **initiatives**. At the same time]{.underline}, he
argued, the US should attempt to [disrupt the possibility of
**collusion** among]{.underline} American [**adversaries** in Eurasia
and simultaneously]{.underline} to [influence the manner in
which]{.underline} America's [allies **frame**]{.underline} their
**[ties to Beijing]{.underline}**.140 [Such]{.underline} an approach
[would]{.underline} also [make sense for the EU, which has a **more
structured** and **less conflictual relationship** with
China]{.underline} as it is [while also having close to **20 Member
States** in the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Such]{.underline}
an approach [would mean engaging China prominently in the BRI but,
equally importantly, engaging the states in which the initiative is
being implemented. The EU would **tailor** its own **policies** to the
impact that Chinese activities might have -- **encouraging** and
**supporting China in some cases** while **countering** the possible
**downsides** of Chinese investments **in other cases**]{.underline}.

Such an approach could mean close cooperation with Beijing and local
states, where [the EU could complement China's focus on hard
infrastructure with an emphasis on **rule of law**, **capacity
building**, and **institutional reforms**]{.underline}. In fact,
[Chinese voices have indicated that they actually see such EU programmes
to be **in China's** long-term **interest**]{.underline}, not least
because Chinese SOEs themselves incur risks based on the political risk
derived from the absence of rule of law in many countries in which they
seek to invest.

This approach could mean supporting European investment banks to promote
infrastructural projects that are not in China's interest but that are
in the interest of the EU and the local state in question. It could also
mean directly targeting Chinese companies for sanctions if, for example,
they violate EU legislation in EU countries. [Such an EU
approach]{.underline}, ideally but not necessarily coordinated with the
US, [would send a **clear signal** to Beijing that the EU and China have
**common interests** and that the EU is prepared to **support China's
efforts** to realize what is a key priority for Xi]{.underline} Jinping.
[However, it would also indicate that the EU is prepared to stand up for
its own interests and that it is prepared to take steps to **defend**
them against Chinese **encroachments**. Such an approach]{.underline},
if successfully implemented, [could be in the long-term interest of the
BRI]{.underline}, aiding it in avoiding the embarrassing type of failed
large-scale projects known as "white elephants". It would certainly be
in the interest of countries across Eurasia that welcome China's
presence, but they are simultaneously wary of growing dependence on
China. [Additionally, it would be in the interest of the EU and its
Member States, which would be able to promote a more secure and
developed neighbourhood]{.underline}.

#### EU norm-setting prevents [global conflict]{.underline} and [transnational]{.underline} threats\-\--extinction. 

**Balfour '19** \[Rosa; 2019; Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German
Marshall Fund of the United States; The Progressive Post, "The European
Foreign Policy in a Hostile Environment,"
https://progressivepost.eu/debates/next-economy/european-foreign-policy-hostile-environment\]

[In a **brittle world** without enduring strong international
alliances]{.underline}, the debate on [Europe's 'strategic autonomy' has
gained **new resonance**, but it should not shadow the EU's **unique key
international assets** in the **global economy** and **multilateral
order**. Working with **global networks** to **promote norms** and
**public goods** is key to **push back on nationalism**, the rise of
**geopolitics** and **transactionalism**.]{.underline}

Strategic autonomy' and 'complementarity with NATO' usually appear in
the same sentence in the European debate -- the latest doctrinal
iteration to be found in the EU Global Strategy of June 2016. The
ensemble reflects Europe's need to rely on its transatlantic
relationship for security and territorial defence, empowering it to
carry out foreign policy too. The EU's greatest foreign policy
achievement of enlarging to Central Europe after the Cold War, pursued
in tandem with NATO expansion, is testimony to this pairing.

Since the end of 2016, the US President's international preferences
undermine directly or indirectly Europe's security. Whether it is the
insistence on greater burden-sharing, US action in the Middle East, or
trade disputes with China, current US policies put Europe's security --
already challenged by Russian action in Eastern Europe and the Middle
East -- at risk.

European leaders have started to question whether the transatlantic
relationship needs to be preserved no matter what, or whether Europe
should emancipate from it. [The debate on 'strategic
autonomy']{.underline} is animating recent efforts in the field of
security and defence. It [refers to the ability to make and carry out
decisions on **defence**, to conduct **military operations**
autonomously, and to have the **industrial capabilities** to do so. Even
if]{.underline} this level of strategic autonomy were [agreed upon, it
would take a **generation** for Europe to affect the world
stage]{.underline}.

[The focus]{.underline} on strategic autonomy [speaks to]{.underline}
present [insecurities in Europe]{.underline}an societies, [but not to
the EU's **international legitimacy** where]{.underline}, possibly, [the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [has **better
opportunities** to develop **means of political autonomy** which befit
its **history** and **international identity**]{.underline}. The
emerging debate on economic sovereignty is addressing for the first time
the degree to which the EU can make political use of some of its
economic and financial tools, such as the Euro as an international
currency. After all, the EU and its Member States remain the world's
largest trade bloc and donor.

[On the multilateral stage, Europe faces an **increasingly hostile
environment** but remains the **best hope** to pursue **universal
principles**, such as **human rights** and the **rule of law**, which
**underpin the resilience** of that **multilateral system**. How to
**partner with other countries and actors** around the globe to **push
back on attacks to international order** is no longer a second order
priority.]{.underline}

If the way ahead appears clear, achieving it is a tall order. The
rationale for collective action for the EU seems obvious -- the
'politics of scale', or to be stronger together rather than weaker apart
-- but historically difficult to achieve. [The multiple threats and
risks]{.underline} on Europe's doorsteps [have only minimally bridged
the strategic divergence that continues to beset the
continent]{.underline}, and the rise of the populist radical right is
beginning to undermine existing European external policies, not to speak
of a higher level of ambition.

Looking at global politics from a non-European perspective, how Europe's
friends and partners around the world will welcome a bid for greater
autonomy -- politically, economically, and strategically -- still needs
to be seen. The EU's worldview that it has acted as a 'force for good'
is not uncritically accepted. After all, that ethical stand was also
possible thanks to the EU's belonging to a stable and hegemonic West.

If Europe wants to engage with the world and simultaneously strengthen
its strategic identity it needs to square some circles. [Without giving
into the **facile critique** that realism and geopolitics render
multilateral principles obsolete and warrant hard-nosed politics, Europe
should **leverage its assets**, which are irrevocably embedded in
multilateralism and **cooperation**. **Climate change**, **conflict
prevention and mediation**, and an **open and fairer international trade
system** are among the assets that the EU can concretely work towards
globally]{.underline}.

To do so it needs to engage flexibly with global actors, focusing more
on multilevel networks including civil society rather than on the
traditional partnerships between governments, some of which are no
longer benign or useful. Both will require a dose of humility in
listening to non-European world views and of pragmatism in seeking
appropriate strategies and paths forward.

Last but not least, if [Europe]{.underline} wants to imagine its own
history of prosperity, democracy and peace as still relevant to the
debates taking place in the rest of the world, it also [needs to think
about the **global future sustainability** of welfare]{.underline},
taking progressive politics outside national boundaries and [engaging in
a more global]{.underline} and open [debate about public common
goods]{.underline}.

### !\-\--Central Asia

#### Europe is key to [BRI effectiveness]{.underline} in Central Asia.

[China's]{.underline} Belt and Road Initiative ([BRI) is]{.underline}
often [seen as a **rival** to the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion['s]{.underline} (EU) [take on
connectivity]{.underline}. This has to do with the fact that [China's
approach]{.underline} to infrastructure lending and engagement in other
countries [does not have the **EU political value
component**]{.underline}. Poorly governed and non-transparent projects
are eligible as long as they subscribe to the narrative of BRI. The
motives of China's infrastructure lending are criticised as driven by
the will to increase political and security influence, especially in its
neighbouring Central Asia, and for such drivers good governance is not a
requirement.

However, next to the strategic logic and security logic there is a
component of [the BRI]{.underline} that [is under risk if the loan
recipient is **poorly governed**]{.underline} -- namely, the investment
logic. As long as this logic does not directly clash with China's
"national interests", China will not be prone to disrupt the involvement
of actors that actually contribute to a better investment environment.
[This provides an opportunity for the EU to **actively engage** and
**shape China's activities** in **Central Asia**]{.underline}.

In order [to achieve that, the EU needs to stress that **good governance
in Central Asia** is key to China because it increases the chances of
**successful returns on investment**]{.underline}. According to D.Dollar
(2019), the Central Bank of China "is giving \$50 million to the IMF as
a grant for training officials in Belt and Road recipient countries on
debt sustainability analysis." This means that China is willing to learn
from the West when it comes to money lending management because down the
line, forgiving debts or obtaining assets of low liquidity can make
China's leadership look bad domestically. [Therefore, China would not
**impede EU investments** in **good governance promotion** in Central
Asia]{.underline}n countries. Admittedly, this argument does not
automatically mean that China has an interest in combatting corruption
in the region since certain levels of corruption are bad for society,
but do not necessarily endanger investment.

[This is a chance for the EU to work towards better governance in
Central Asia by persuading China that the European experience in
institution-building benefits not just the societies of the Central
Asian countries, but also China's chances for higher returns from
long-term investment and]{.underline}, ultimately, [from the broader
Eurasian connectivity. The EU needs to **lend** its **expertise** to
China through]{.underline} the implementation of **[existing
programmes]{.underline}** such as the Regional Cooperation Instrument
[which promote the **rule of law** and **good governance** in Central
Asian countries. These programmes could be widened to include **all
sectors** involved in **BRI projects**, starting from **legal
support**]{.underline} with contract terms negotiation, [to **cost
assessment**, to **institutional oversight**]{.underline}. In order [to
avoid harsh reactions from China, the EU memberstates that have joined
the BRI could be included]{.underline} in such exchanges. As the
mounting external debt to China is causing worries in Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan, it is likely that the [Central Asian countries would agree
to **accept such expertise** coming from the EU]{.underline}.

There is one problem, however. Securing China's Western border has been
named to be another leading motivation behind China's engagement in
Central Asia through the Belt and Road Initiative. This can be observed
in China's army drills in Kyrgyzstan and the reported Chinese military
facility in Tajikistan, among others. Security logic becoming the main
reason for China's engagement in Central Asia would undermine the need
for good governance, and the return on investment for BRI projects would
become secondary.

To conclude one can say that [the leading motive of EU]{.underline}'s
[engagement in Central Asia is to **increase Eurasian connectivity** and
to **build ties** with the region]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the EU
aims to create a **better operating environment** for EU investors in
the region and **better conditions** for the **transit of
goods**]{.underline}. The motivation behind China's involvement, on the
other hand, more likely centres around strategic logic, security
cooperation and investment protection. Still, [common ground can be
found between the EU and China in promoting **good governance** and
**financial responsibility** in the region. China will support the EU's
engagement in Central Asia because it is a way to guarantee a smoother
operating environment for the BRI. The EU]{.underline}, in turn, [can
benefit from China's involvement in infrastructure building in Central
Asia because, if managed properly, BRI could contribute to EU-Asia
connectivity]{.underline}. As the involved countries come to terms with
the risks brought about by the BRI, [this is the **right time** for the
EU to be **proactive**]{.underline}.

#### Central Asian instability goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

Ivan **Lizan 15**. JD, National University Odesa Law Academy. "Three
Fronts For Russia: How Washington Will Fan The Flames of Chaos In
Central Asia." Information Clearinghouse. February 23.
<http://tinyurl.com/pn3kpgy>

[The first way to destabilize Central Asia is to create **problems on
the borders**]{.underline}, along with the threat that Mujahideen will
penetrate the region. The testing of the neighbours has already started;
problems have arisen in Turkmenistan, which has even had to ask Kabul to
hold large-scale military operations in the border provinces. Tajikistan
has forced the Taliban to negotiate the release of the border guards it
abducted, and the Tajik border service reports that there is a large
group of Mujahideen on its borders. In general, all the countries
bordering Afghanistan have stepped up their border security. [The second
way is to send **Islamists** behind the lines]{.underline}. The process
has already begun: the number of extremists in Tajikistan alone grew
three-fold last year; however, even though they are being caught, it
obviously will not be feasible to catch all of them. Furthermore, the
situation is aggravated by the return of migrant workers from Russia,
which will expand the recruiting base. If the stream of remittances from
Russia dries up, the outcome may be popular discontent and managed
riots. Kyrgyz expert Kadir Malikov reports that \$70 million has been
allocated to the IS military group Maverenahr, which includes
representatives of all the Central Asian republics, to carry out acts of
terrorism in the region. Special emphasis is placed on the Fergana
Valley as the heart of Central Asia. Another point of vulnerability is
Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections, scheduled for this fall. The
initiation of a new set of color revolutions will lead to chaos and the
disintegration of countries. Self-supporting wars Waging war is
expensive, so the destabilization of the region must be self-supporting
or at least profitable for the U.S. military-industrial complex. And in
this area Washington has had some success: it has given Uzbekistan 328
armored vehicles that Kiev had requested for its war with Novorossiya.
At first glance, the deal isn't profitable because the machines were a
gift, but in reality Uzbekistan will be tied to U.S. spare parts and
ammunition. Washington made a similar decision on the transfer of
equipment and weapons to Islamabad. But the United States has not been
successful in its attempts to impose its weapons systems on India: the
Indians have not signed any contracts, and Obama was shown Russian
military hardware when he attended a military parade. Thus the United
States is drawing the countries in the region into war with its own
protégés -- the Taliban and Islamic State -- and at the same time is
supplying its enemies with weapons. So [2015 will be marked by
preparations for widespread **destabilization in Central
Asia**]{.underline} and the transformation of AfPak into an Islamic
State subsidiary [on the borders of **Russia, India, China, and
Iran**]{.underline}. The start of **[full-scale war]{.underline}**,
[which will inevitably follow once chaos engulfs the
region]{.underline}, [will lead to a bloodbath in the "Eurasian
Balkans," automatically involving more than a third of the world's
population and almost all the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[geopolitical rivals. It's an opportunity **Washington** will find too
good to miss.]{.underline} Russia's response to this challenge has to be
multifaceted: involving the region in the process of Eurasian
integration, providing military, economic, and political assistance,
working closely with its allies in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
and the BRICS, strengthening the Pakistani army, and of course assisting
with the capture of the bearded servants of the Caliphate. But the most
important response should be the accelerated modernization of its armed
forces as well as those of its allies and efforts to strengthen the
Collective Security Treaty Organization and give it the right to
circumvent the highly inefficient United Nations. [The region is
extremely important]{.underline}: [if Ukraine is a fuse of war, then
**Central Asia is a munitions depot**. If it blows up, **half the
continent will be hit**]{.underline}.

great Chinese nation**]{.underline}. [The election of]{.underline}

#### Instability causes Chinese lashout. 

**Tepperman '18** \[Jonathan; 10/15/18; editor at large at Foreign
Policy; \"China's Great Leap Backward,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/15/chinas-great-leap-backward-xi-jinping/\]

On the domestic level, [Beijing's **policymaking** is already becoming
**less agile** and **adept**. Examples of this]{.underline} more
[**rigid** approach, and its **downsides**, aren't hard to
find.]{.underline} Consider last winter, when the government decided to
force an abrupt nationwide switch from the use of coal to gas in heating
systems. It sounded like a smart move for a country as polluted as
China. But the edict was enforced suddenly across the country, with no
exceptions. Thus in China's frigid north, many coal-burning furnaces
were ripped out before new gas ones could be installed---leaving entire
towns without heat and forcing villagers to burn corn cobs to survive.

[If China **continues** down its **current course**, expect many more
cases where even **well-intentioned** policies are **implemented** in a
**rash** and **clumsy** way, leading to]{.underline} still more
[**harmful consequences**. Since **personalized dictatorships** are
necessarily **bad at admitting fault**]{.underline}---for nothing can be
permitted to damage the myth of the omnipotent leader---[China will also
likely become **less adept** at **correcting mistakes**]{.underline}
once it makes them. [Or at **confronting** the **underlying problems**
that are dragging down its **economy**, such as an **overreliance** on
bloated]{.underline} and inefficient state-owned enterprises
(**[SOEs]{.underline}**), [which have]{.underline} only [grown
**bigger** and more **powerful** since Xi took office; dangerously
**high debt levels**]{.underline}, especially among local governments;
[and a tendency to react]{.underline} to every downturn [by **pumping**
more **cash**]{.underline} into the system, [especially for unnecessary
**infrastructure projects**]{.underline}. In fact, [China is not only
unlikely to address any of these **shortcomings**; it's likely to
**compound** them]{.underline}. That is just what it did on Oct. 7, when
the People's Bank of China announced yet another costly stimulus
program: a \$175 billion plan to shore up small and medium-sized
businesses.

With each new budget-busting move, and in the absence of reform, the
odds that China will experience a seriously destabilizing economic
crisis---which China bears such as Ruchir Sharma, the head of emerging
markets at Morgan Stanley, have been predicting for years---keep rising.
"The big question is whether one of the ticking time bombs---bad debt,
overheated property markets, oversized SOEs---will explode," Gabuev
says. "Because of Xi's concentration of power, no one will give him
advance warning if one of these bombs is about to go off. And because he
doesn't actually understand macroeconomics very well, and everyone is
afraid to contradict the emperor, there's a huge risk that he'll
mismanage it when it does." Indeed, the government's response to any
instability is likely to be ugly. As Schell explains, "Xi has really put
China at enormous risk. And because his only tool is repression, if
things go wrong we're likely to see even more crackdowns."

Such predictions should worry everyone. [China is the world's **largest
economy** by some measures, so if it **melts down**, the **entire
planet** will **pay** the price]{.underline}. But the history of other
autocracies, such as Vladimir Putin's Russia or Kim's North Korea,
suggests that [Xi's relentless power play could produce even **worse
consequences**]{.underline}. Since taking power, [Xi has charted a far
more **aggressive foreign policy** than his predecessors, **alienating**
virtually every **neighbor** and the **U**nited **S**tates by pushing
China's claims in the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea, threatening
**Taiwan**, and]{.underline} using the military to assert Beijing's
[claims to **disputed islands**]{.underline}.

Should China's economic problems worsen, [Xi could try to **ratchet up
tensions** on any of these fronts in order to **distract his citizens**
from the **crisis**]{.underline} at home. That temptation will prove
especially strong if U.S. President Donald Trump keeps poking China by
intensifying the trade war and publicly denouncing it.

[And things could get **scarier**]{.underline} still, Pei warns, [if
China's economic problems **spin out of control**]{.underline}
completely. In that case, [the Chinese **state could collapse**---a
typical occurrence among **typical dictatorships** when faced with
**economic shocks**, **external threats** (]{.underline}especially a
defeat in war), [or **popular unrest**---but one that, given China's
**size**, could have **cataclysmic consequences**]{.underline} if it
happened there.

#### Absent [continued growth]{.underline}, China will ignite [global war.]{.underline}

Hal **Brands 22**, professor of global affairs at the Johns Hopkins
School of Advanced International Studies, "The Dangers of China's
Decline," <https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/04/14/china-decline-dangers/>,

[Decline is a tricky concept.]{.underline} The term makes us think of a
country that is falling like a rock---one whose power and capabilities
are dropping across the board. But [a country can be in relative decline
vis-à-vis a fast-growing adversary]{.underline} even if its own power is
still increasing. [It can be surging forward in some areas]{.underline},
such as military might[, even as its underlying economic strength starts
to wither.]{.underline} And [**decline** doesn't]{.underline} always
[lead a country to scale back its objectives---the sense of urgency it
creates can **cause ambitious powers** to **grab what they can** before
the **clock runs out.**]{.underline}

[Xi Jinping's China is about to give the world an education in the
nuances of decline.]{.underline} Since the onset of its economic reforms
in the 1970s, China has long defied predictions that it would soon
stumble or collapse. Its spectacular growth challenged prevailing views
about the sources of national success in the modern world. [In some
ways, China is still soaring: Its military power grows more
formidable]{.underline} every year. When Xi declares that "the East is
rising and the West is declining," he gives voice to this sense that
China is a country on the make.

Yet [military power is]{.underline} often [a lagging
indicator]{.underline} of a country's trajectory: It takes time to turn
money into military muscle, and massive buildups often persist even
after a country's economic fortunes begin to flag. And today, for
reasons including demographic disaster and the lingering effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic, [China is facing the end of]{.underline} the
[stunning economic growth]{.underline} that made it possible for Xi to
assert that the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" was at hand.
[The China of the 2020s will be a country whose **coercive
capabilities** are **more intimidating** than ever as its **economic
dynamism fades**. That could be the **worst possible combination** for
the world.]{.underline}

Any country that rises as impressively as China is bound to make fools
of some prophets of decline along the way. In recent decades, Beijing
has repeatedly confounded those who predicted it was about to hit the
wall.

In the aftermath of Mao Zedong's death, some Western observers were
skeptical that China---a country that U.S. diplomat George Kennan once
called a "vast poorhouse"---could put together the policies necessary
for sustained growth. After the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, it
was common to wonder whether the resulting political crackdown would
stifle the country's prosperity. Through the early 2000s, social
scientists and U.S. officials predicted that China could be rich or
autocratic---but not both. A few prominent analysts made careers for
themselves by heralding China's collapse.

It hasn't happened---yet. From 1978 to the onset of the global financial
crisis three decades later, China's constant-dollar GDP grew by a factor
of 17, without the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) losing control. That
growth enabled the decades-long military buildup and sprawling economic
influence that made China a force to be feared on the global stage.

As Tufts University's Michael Beckley and I argue in our forthcoming
book, Danger Zone: The Coming Conflict With China, this economic miracle
required good luck and good policy. China seemed to have hit the
demographic jackpot in the 1980s and 1990s; the unlikely combination of
warfare and famine in the 1930s and 1940s, a regime-sponsored baby boom
after the CCP took power, and then the institution of the one-child
policy in 1980 left the country with a huge working-age population
unencumbered by lots of young or old dependents. China was nearly
self-sufficient in food, water, and other resources. And it had the
fortuitous timing to start its reforms as globalization went into
overdrive, making it easier to integrate the country into complex supply
chains and thereby make China the workshop of the world.

Good policies were also crucial. Mao's one-man rule and economic
illiteracy had condemned China to serial, self-created disasters. Once
he died, Deng Xiaoping and his successors moved toward a ["socialist
market economy."]{.underline} They [opened China to trade and
investment, overhauled the tax and regulatory systems, shrank bloated
state-owned enterprises, and encouraged private business.]{.underline}
Accompanying political reforms limited the power of China's rulers and
enlarged the space for nonideological competence within the regime. The
CCP relaxed its grip enough to permit economic spontaneity---and reaped
the benefits in the form of prosperity that reinforced its political
control.

China's ascendance shook the world intellectually as well as
geopolitically: It undermined post-Cold War Western beliefs that
prosperity would lead inevitably to political liberalization, that
democracies produced higher rates of growth than autocracies, and that
tyranny was incompatible with sound economic management. As China became
a global heavyweight, a new orthodoxy solidified---that a hegemonic
transition was approaching as Beijing surpassed the United States.

One dissenter was the political scientist David Shambaugh. In 2015,
Shambaugh argued that China was suffering from a deep internal malaise
and that Xi's increasingly repressive rule was a sign of insecurity, not
confidence. "\[F\]or all the Western views of it as an unstoppable
juggernaut," he wrote, China's economy "is stuck in a series of systemic
traps from which there is no easy exit."

Shambaugh struck a discordant note at a time when Beijing was tightening
its control of the South China Sea and spreading its influence across
multiple continents. He also happened to be right. Not least of the
oddities surrounding contemporary China is that much of the world deemed
its ascent inevitable just as its prospects started to dim.

This may sound absurd, given all the hype surrounding China's rise.
After all, that country is supposedly destined, as the Harvard
University political scientist Graham Allison (channeling legendary
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew) has written, to become "the
biggest player in the history of the world."

It's true that [China does boast many apparent advantages.]{.underline}
It has an enormous **[domestic market]{.underline}** and is the
[**leading trade partner** of roughly 130 countries]{.underline} around
the world. It is making concerted investments in artificial intelligence
(AI), semiconductors, and other critical technologies. If the United
States doesn't up its game, a national commission chaired by former
Google CEO Eric Schmidt warned in 2021, China could become the premier
"AI superpower." But look closer, and China's trajectory starts to seem
more tenuous.

For one thing, many of China's technological achievements are narrower
and less impressive than they first appear. For example, Beijing has
made great strides in AI applications focused on surveillance (no
surprise there), but the United States still leads significantly across
the wider expanse of AI subfields and uses. Despite vast state
subsidies, China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. is
years behind in the creation of cutting-edge semiconductors that make up
the foundation of advanced economies in the information age.

Just this year, Peking University published a candid assessment---which
the CCP then predictably censored---of China's progress in science and
technology. The verdict was that China is "following \[the United
States\] in most fields, running side by side in a few, and leading in
very few." And while China's other strengths are not illusory, neither
can they hide a reality that Beckley and I discussed last year: The
magic that made China's economic miracle is unmistakably fizzling.

While China's other strengths are not illusory, neither can they hide
reality: The magic that made China's economic miracle is unmistakably
fizzling.

The country's resource abundance is old news: Overuse devastated much of
China's arable land; industrialization and pollution left the country
with severe water scarcity. More damaging still, China's abundance of
human resources is also a thing of the past.

The one-child policy was a devil's bargain that is now causing
demographic implosion. China's total population is set to peak by 2028
(or perhaps as soon as this year, by some estimates) and then plummet by
as much as half by century's end. Its working population crested in
2015; it will fall by 70 million between 2020 and 2035 and even faster
after that. China will soon combine an enormous geriatric population
with a rapidly shrinking workforce. It will experience one of the worst
peacetime demographic crunches on record, a formula for stagnation at
best and catastrophic economic contraction at worst.

Making matters worse, [the era of **enlightened economic policy** is
**over**. The **reform** agenda **has been stalled**]{.underline} for
more than a decade because further liberalization---necessary to make
the leap to a more innovative, knowledge-based economy---would threaten
the privileges of entrenched elites. If anything, Xi has thrown the
country into reverse. Politically, he is taking China into
neototalitarianism through pervasive repression and indoctrination. And
economically, his policies have a decidedly retrograde feel.

Xi's agenda has featured a preference for state-owned enterprises at the
expense of the more vibrant private sector; the imposition of severe,
politically motivated restrictions on wide swaths of the economy;
attacks on the autonomy of relatively technocratic institutions such as
the central bank; and the empowerment of political minders in companies
of nearly all sizes. China's leaders may talk about the need to
transition to a high-tech, services-based economy, but Xi's policies are
stifling the competence, creativity, and spontaneity necessary to make
that shift. It all constitutes a "great leap backward"---a reversion to
pre-Deng-era policies that condemned China to stagnation.

There is also the question of what Xi's consolidation of power means for
the country's long-term resilience. As the political theorist Francis
Fukuyama has written, for nearly 40 years after Mao's death China
avoided the "bad emperor" problem---the worst pathologies that accompany
authoritarian rule---by imposing term limits on its rulers and making
them more accountable to other CCP elites. Yet Xi has systematically
disassembled this system by purging rivals, sidelining potential
successors, and entrenching himself in power. By doing so, he is
enabling China to move faster and more decisively. But he is also
leaving the country vulnerable to impulsive or unwise
decision-making---a perpetual problem of one-man rule---and creating the
potential for terrible instability when his reign finally ends. Xi's
centralization of authority, while seemingly impressive, is setting the
country up for a fall.

Finally, it doesn't help that a more assertive China is now facing more
international resistance. Trade barriers against Chinese companies and
products proliferated in the decade after the global financial crisis.
Washington has waged a technological cold war against Huawei, seeking to
deprive that Chinese firm of high-end semiconductors and keep it out of
the world's 5G networks. Dozens of countries are more carefully
scrutinizing their economic, financial, and technological ties with
Beijing; the Japanese government is offering to pay companies to reduce
their China exposure. China is still central to the global economy, but
the days when the United States and other powerful countries eagerly
abetted its ascent are over. Indeed, Xi's effort to cultivate the
domestic market is an implicit admission that China, which rose on the
strength of an export-focused economy, now confronts a very different
world.

China's predicament has been thrown into relief, ironically, by
COVID-19. Early on, the pandemic seemed to herald an epochal global
shift. Prominent U.S. analysts saw it as a "Suez moment," the terminal
crisis of the U.S. empire. Xi touted his regime's success in containing
COVID-19 at home (albeit after allowing it to escape to the world) as an
advertisement for Chinese authoritarianism. Two years later, it's clear
that COVID-19 was a turning point but not in the way that Xi hoped.

The pandemic hypercharged global anti-China sentiment, after Beijing
concealed the initial outbreak and then exploited the resulting chaos to
bully nations from Australia to Germany and the United Kingdom. It
thereby encouraged a host of efforts---through multilateral institutions
such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, AUKUS, and the G-7, as well
as the United States' bilateral alliances in the Pacific---to counter
Chinese power. "A Cold War mentality" had reemerged, a spokesperson for
China's foreign ministry complained, as the United States and its
friends pursued "anti-China encirclement."

COVID-19 also confirmed how patchy China's rise had been: The country's
biotechnology sector couldn't produce anything like the revolutionary
vaccines that democratic innovation economies in the United States and
Europe churned out. Even China's heavy-handed success in containing
COVID-19 at home became a trap: The combination of "zero-COVID"
policies, low levels of natural immunity, and vaccines that proved weak
or worthless against highly contagious variants condemned the country to
recurring lockdowns of major cities, with all the accompanying
disruptions.

Even before COVID-19, in fact, China's economic vital signs were
worrying. The government claimed a growth rate of 6 percent, but Chinese
insiders and academic research indicate that the true number is
considerably lower---and even that growth is inflated by the relentless
injection of capital into a less and less efficient economy. As a
result, overall debt grew eightfold between 2008 and the end of 2020,
reaching 335 percent of GDP. In other countries, this combination of
slumping productivity and growing debt usually presages sharp crises
that turn into lasting economic quagmires.

[Xi's Chinese dream involves catching up to the United States. In
reality, his country is slowing down.]{.underline}

[China is not,]{.underline} however, [slowing down in all areas at
once.]{.underline} This isn't unusual: The Soviet Union hit the apex of
its military power in the 1980s, when its economy was in a death spiral.
In the early 20th century, Britain ruled a global empire at a time when
its economic supremacy had already slipped away. Today, [China is
**stagnating economically**, but its **drive for world power** is
**accelerating.**]{.underline}

Chinese leaders and propaganda organs now openly tout the country's
designs: In the coming decades, the official state news agency Xinhua
proclaimed, China will "re-ascend to the top of the world." Beijing is
creating new international organizations and co-opting others. Its
marquee projects, namely the Belt and Road Initiative and the Digital
Silk Road, aim to project economic and political influence across
Eurasia and beyond. China also fashions itself as an ideological role
model for other countries: Its style of governance, Xi has said, offers
a "new option for other countries and nations that want to speed up
their development while preserving their independence."

Most notably, [China is building and wielding the tools of geopolitical
coercion.]{.underline} Countries such as Australia, Lithuania, Norway,
and South Korea have felt China's economic bite after they opposed its
policies or criticized its internal practices. Chinese military
spending---having already grown tenfold in real terms between 1990 and
2016---continues to rise, funding a dramatic expansion of the
capabilities needed to conquer Taiwan, overawe Beijing's neighbors, and
perhaps even take on the United States in the Western Pacific.

What the United States will face in this decade is a China whose ability
to batter its enemies and challenge the global order is growing, even as
leaner economic times loom ahead.

The statistics are simply astounding: Beijing put as many ships to sea
from 2014 to 2018 as were in the navies of Britain, Germany, India,
Spain, and Taiwan combined. And having long avoided a nuclear arms race
with Washington, [**Beijing** is now **sprinting forward** and could be
the United States' nuclear peer by the 2030s. **Threats to use force**
against enemies have also become ubiquitous: **Anyone who obstructs**
China's plans, **Xi warned** in 2021, will "**have their heads bashed**
bloody against **the Great Wall of Steel."**]{.underline}

It is sometimes hard to believe that such a country is running out of
gas. But perhaps [China's **strategic urgency** is **increasing**
because its **economic outlook** has turned grim.]{.underline}

China's "hide and bide" strategy---the approach it followed for a
generation under Deng and after---was one of patient confidence. If time
was on a rising Beijing's side, then it made sense to gradually build
the country's power and delay confrontation with the United States.
Today, [China's strategic mindset is **darker and more
insistent**]{.underline}

In many areas, Xi acknowledges, "the West is strong, and the East is
weak." China must race to make itself "invincible" so that "nobody can
beat us or choke us to death." What the United States will face in this
decade, then, is a China whose ability to batter its enemies and
challenge the global order is growing, even as leaner economic times
loom ahead

[This **China** is **unlikely** to be **benign or
peaceful**.]{.underline} [History has seen many once ascendant countries
lash out violently rather than accept a disappointing future as a
second-tier power.]{.underline} This fear is what [led Germany
to]{.underline} take the risks that helped ignite [World War
I.]{.underline} It [prompted **Japan** to undertake the **expansionist
rampage** that helped bring on **World War II.**]{.underline}

[Xi has grand ambitions, from **capturing Taiwan** to establishing
**China's primacy** in Asia and, eventually, the world. **If he loses
faith** that the patient accumulation of economic power will bring
Beijing these rewards, he may become more inclined to **take risks** and
**use China's coercive tools** to secure them instead.]{.underline} This
means that the task of dealing with [China could prove **quite
ticklish** in the years ahead.]{.underline}

#### Sustained EU cooperation with China is [key]{.underline} to combat [climate change.]{.underline}

Barbara **Pongratz '21**, Associate climate policy analyst for Merics,
"EU-China climate policy -- balancing cooperation and pressure,"
<https://merics.org/en/short-analysis/eu-china-climate-policy-balancing-cooperation-and-pressure>,
cy

[Chinese reactions to EU measures show a largely constructive
approach]{.underline}, says Barbara Pongratz. [Europe has to build on
this momentum]{.underline} and avoid triggering backlashes.

[Chinese reactions to three key European climate-policy measures show
that the **EU** is **in a position** to **motivate China** to accelerate
its **climate mitigation** efforts.]{.underline} The EU's [Carbon Border
Adjustment Mechanism]{.underline} (CBAM), [Emissions Trading
Scheme]{.underline} (ETS) and its [green finance frameworks have sparked
co-operative]{.underline} and critical reactions [from Chinese
commentators in]{.underline} academia and [politics]{.underline}. To
avoid damaging disputes, [the EU has to maintain the right
balance]{.underline} between working together with China and putting
pressure on it to speed up climate action. [With both sides' **combined
efforts**, it may be **possible** to]{.underline} more effectively
[reach the common goal of **keeping** the global **temperature rise
below 2.0 degrees** Celsius.]{.underline}

Chinese critics say the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is
protectionist

Perhaps the most controversial EU measure is the Carbon Border
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which from 2023 is meant to impose tariffs
on carbon-intensive imports to counter carbon leakage. CBAM can be seen
as an instrument of fair competition within the EU -- it ensures foreign
companies bear the same environmental costs as European competitors.
Zhao Lijian from the Carbon Trust China Office says many Chinese
stakeholders view CBAM as a trade barrier. Some even regard it a
protectionist move. Chinese experts are unsure about the EU's motivation
for CBAM and criticize its scope, design, risks and compatibility with
the Paris Agreement and the World Trade Organization. The EU needs to
communicate CBAM better.

The EU still has to decide crucial details of the scheme. A recent
YouGov-E3G survey shows that the European public is generally in favor
of CBAM, regardless of potential obstacles to trade. Experts at Chinese
government think tanks have been discussing the possibility of
introducing counter-measures should the EU not compromise on critical
issues such as the use of revenue, exemptions and a link to Emission
Trading Scheme (ETS) reform. A key question about CBAM revenues is
whether they will be used for the EU's own budget or whether they will
be earmarked for other climate-change mitigation measures.

Chinese negotiators are pushing for creation of a global carbon market

[CBAM is closely related to another important issue in EU-China
discussions]{.underline}, the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). [Chinese
policymakers want to accelerate development of a Chinese scheme with the
EU's help.]{.underline} The EU ETS is the largest and most advanced
emissions trading market. [The EU and Germany have been helping China
develop its own **ETS**, a good example of **constructive cooperation**.
Chinese **commentators** have **urged** the **EU** to link CBAM to ETS
reform and allow exemptions for China's developing economy to avoid
double burdens for its companies. Chinese negotiators]{.underline} have
also ambitiously [suggested increasing EU-China cooperation to
**create** a **global carbon market**]{.underline} as an alternative to
Europe's CBAM.

The EU has set a higher carbon price in its ETS than China and could use
it as a benchmark for determining the carbon tax within CBAM, posing a
risk for EU-China trade relations. Steel, for example, is not covered by
the Chinese ETS and would be included in the current EU CBAM proposal.
Chinese commentators criticize this could seriously hurt China's
sizeable steel exports. However, the actual impact of CBAM on trade with
the EU is disputed -- in recent EU-China discussions, EU stakeholders
said CBAM at least initially would not affect trade that much. But the
EU's announcement that it might phase in CBAM for steel and some other
sectors in 2023 has put pressure on China to push on with ETS sector
coverage.

[**EU** approaches to **green finance** are **praised** by **Chinese
observers**]{.underline}

However, the open [debate between the EU and China about CBAM and ETS
shows the general direction of EU climate action to be
cooperative.]{.underline} Indeed, [Chinese reactions to EU]{.underline}
moves in [green finance show a **willingness to
reciprocate**]{.underline}. Chinese observers have praised EU moves to
mobilize financing for sustainable growth. They see the EU as a
pioneering market for investment guided by environmental, social and
governance (ESG) criteria. Bankers and experts praise its sustainable
finance classification scheme and other ESG frameworks for being
comprehensive and practical -- and note that China still has a way to
go.

Chen Yulu, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), is
often quoted in the green finance context. In a speech at a green
finance forum last year, he called on China to continue promoting green
finance and named increased international cooperation as one of three
crucial steps to take. This year, a number of government ministries
published important new policies about ESG investment. Both sides are
stepping up their efforts to devise regulations for green finance, and
this suggests that cooperation can also be the name of the game in this
context -- if it is coordinated well.

[China's drive for more green finance guidance for Chinese companies
is]{.underline} not just politically motivated, it is [meant to increase
EU-China investment flows.]{.underline} Although only 11 percent of
Chinese investors consider ESG in practice, China ranks first globally
in terms of outstanding green loan value. With its developing green
business sector, China can leverage the increased interest in green
investment and the EU's stricter green finance rules. In a Ministry of
Commerce-affiliated magazine, Chinese commentators have emphasized that
the EU and China "need to add concrete and actionable commitments" and
harmonize existing approaches on both sides.

[**EU measures** can motivate **moves towards climate action** in
China]{.underline}

[China's response to the three key European climate-policy
measures]{.underline} is striking in that many government-affiliated
analysts and experts have called for the accelerated implementation of
Chinese measures. This [shows that EU measures can motivate China to
move towards accelerated climate action.]{.underline} Brussels' approach
of pursuing climate cooperation and applying pressure is proving
effective.

[Both the EU and China have committed to achieving net zero
emissions.]{.underline} The willingness to act and implement
climate-action measures exists on both sides. [The EU would be well
advised to **further build** on the debate in China and **use this

[​**Ecosystems** consist of **living** and **non-living** components, and
their **interactions**. They work like a **super-complex engine**: when
some **components** are **removed** or **stop**]{.underline} working,
[knock-on **consequences** can **lead** to **system
failure**]{.underline}. Our study is based on measured data and
observations, not modeling or predictions for the future. Encouragingly,
[not all ecosystems]{.underline} we examined [have
collapsed]{.underline} across their entire range. We still have, for
instance, some intact reefs on the Great Barrier Reef, especially in
deeper waters. And northern Australia has some of the most intact and
least-modified stretches of savanna woodlands on Earth. [Still,
**collapses are happening**, including in regions **critical** for
growing **food**]{.underline}. This includes the Murray-Darling Basin,
which covers around 14% of Australia\'s landmass. Its rivers and other
freshwater systems support more than 30% of Australia\'s food
production. [The effects of **floods**, **fires**, **heatwaves** and
**storms** do not stop]{.underline} at farm gates; [they\'re felt
equally in agricultural areas and natural ecosystems]{.underline}. We
shouldn\'t forget how towns ran out of drinking water during the recent
drought. [Drinking **water** is also **at risk** when ecosystems
collapse]{.underline} in our water catchments. In Victoria, for example,
the degradation of giant Mountain Ash forests greatly reduces the amount
of water flowing through the Thompson catchment, threatening nearly five
million people\'s drinking water in Melbourne. [This is a **dire**
wake-up call]{.underline} --- not just a warning. [Put bluntly,
**current changes**]{.underline} across the continent, [and their
potential **outcomes**, pose an **existential threat** to our
**survival**, and other life we share]{.underline} environments with. In
investigating patterns of collapse, we found most [ecosystems experience
multiple, **concurrent pressures** from]{.underline} both [**global
climate change** and regional **human impacts**]{.underline} (such as
land clearing). Pressures are often additive and extreme.

#### AT: China Tech Leadership

**Toner '22** \[Helen; 3/22/2022; Director of Strategy at Georgetown's
Center for Security and Emerging Technology, former Senior Research
Analyst at the Open Philanthropy Project; \"Will China Set Global Tech
Standards?\"
https://www.chinafile.com/conversation/will-china-set-global-tech-standards\]

For countries seeking to respond to Chinese standards activities, the
primary challenge will be to not overreact. Despite an increasingly
prevalent narrative that China has figured out how to "dominate" or
"manipulate" international standards-setting processes, the reality is
much more mundane. The primary effect of the Chinese government's
growing emphasis on the importance of standards is that Chinese
organizations are more empowered and incentivized to participate in
standardization than they have been in the past. The simplest and most
effective way for competing nations to keep pace will be to ensure that
their own domestic participants are similarly empowered.

The coordinated efforts of Chinese companies in the development of 5G
standards looms large in discussions of undue Chinese influence on
standards, but this case represents far more the exception than the
rule. China's technical advantage over other countries in 5G, which gave
companies such as Huawei and ZTE significant leverage in standards
discussions, is not the norm in most technologies. What's more, the
voluntary nature of international standards-setting processes means that
in most cases, countries or companies are able to opt out of standards
that cause them concern; rarely is interoperability as non-negotiable as
it is in telecommunications. Increased Chinese engagement in
international standards bodies is certainly a reality; sudden Chinese
supremacy in these bodies is not.

A recent study run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
gave U.S. companies and industry organizations the opportunity to weigh
in on how concerned the United States should be about Chinese
participation in standards development. As the Carnegie Endowment
summarized, only a small minority of private sector respondents
expressed concerns. Far more prevalent than alarm about undue Chinese
influence was consensus that the U.S. government could do more to
support U.S. engagement. Relevant measures could include subsidizing the
participation of companies or industry organizations in standards
development processes---an expensive undertaking for which the Chinese
government provides significant support. At least as important is to
remove barriers to participation that currently prevent or deter some
U.S. organizations from participating in standards development
processes, for instance export control-related restrictions that prevent
U.S. companies from engaging in any discussions where blacklisted
foreign companies are present.

China is sure to continue pursuing its own interests in international
standards bodies, and other countries should stand ready to counter
this. But a productive response needs to be based on an understanding of
how standards processes work and in what ways they can be skewed, not on
a kneejerk reaction to fears that China is suddenly pulling all the
marionette strings. Many of the ways in which China could unduly benefit
from standards are continuous with long-standing concerns about Chinese
involvement on the international stage, such as Chinese domestic
regulatory structures that hinder international firms' market access.
Others are only outgrowths of other trends, such as China's increasing
sophistication in scientific and technological research and development.
A holistic approach to technology competition must recognize and address
how these challenges are interconnected, not overestimate how important
(or susceptible to influence) standards development processes are on
their own.

**GT 7/18**; "EU should care for own interests, not to be \'exploited by
US\': Chinese experts;" Global Times; July 18, 2022;
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1270833.shtml

Against the background of ricocheting regional tensions, such as the
Ukraine-Russia conflict, [**China and Europe** deliver a signal
of]{.underline} maintaining economic **[cooperation]{.underline}** by
reportedly planning to hold a high-level dialogue on Tuesday.

Chinese experts said that [the EU should not be \"exploited by the US\"
and hold a hostile policy toward China,]{.underline} at a time when the
EU is mired in severe inflation, malfunctioning supply chains and
economic slowdown.

According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), [the trade EU will
hold a high-level dialogue with China]{.underline} on Tuesday after
months of delay.

Valdis Dombrovskis, the European commissioner for trade, and Chinese
Vice Premier Liu He will co-chair the virtual dialogue, which will also
include representatives from the trade and economic ministries of both
sides, according to the SCMP report.

The report cited a European Commission representative as saying that [a
number of global economic challenges will be discussed]{.underline}
during the dialogue, [including food security and energy
prices,]{.underline} supply chains, financial services, and bilateral
trade and investment concerns.

Experts said that holding [the **meeting reflects** the two sides\'
**shared willingness** to keep China-Europe **relations stable and
resilient** despite a volatile geopolitical situation,]{.underline} by
striving to [keep the bilateral mechanism running]{.underline} normally.

\"[The more difficult the situation]{.underline} is, [the more
significant the two sides hold discussions]{.underline}. Otherwise, both
sides will become victims of international political wrestling,\" Cui
Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China
Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times.

According to Cui, [**China** and **the** EU need to]{.underline} join
hands to [tackle the]{.underline} negative economic impact of the
[Ukraine crisis]{.underline}. In particular, [they should **work
together** to address some **urgent problems**]{.underline} facing them.

For example, [the EU has been **talking** about the urgency of **supply
chain** security]{.underline}, but the achievement of such a goal
shouldn\'t be equated with excluding China from the EU\'s supply chains,
like some have proposed, Cui said.

As [China and Europe have **deep economic ties**]{.underline} in many
aspects, [the two sides will need to **support** each other]{.underline}
on many economic issues. For example, at a time when global grain prices
are fluctuating, China and the EU should make sure that the two sides
cooperate to stabilize grain supply.

And, they should think of ways [to ensure global grain
security]{.underline} by jointly addressing the negative impact of
current conflicts on global grain prices, which will also bring benefits
to many countries.

#### Economic integration is at an all time high.

The publication of the China-EU 2020 Strategic Agenda for Cooperation in
2013 also has spoken volumes about the encompassing and growing nature
of China. In 2014, President [Xi called for **China** and the **EU** to
build **partnerships** for peace, growth, reform and
civilisation]{.underline}, recognising growth and development as the
driving force of relations but also [adding a civilisational and
**global dimension** to China-EU relations]{.underline}.

Throughout the past decades, [**economic** and **trade** relations have
stayed the most important pillar of China-EU relations.
Although]{.underline} it has [never]{.underline} been [friction or
complaint free, the economic and trade link continues to provide both
the **basis** and **impetus** for the **bilateral
relations**]{.underline}. Compared with 1975, when two-way trade volume
registered a mere 2.4 billion US dollars, it is a different world
nowadays. [Benefitting from China's continuous **reform efforts**,
**opening-up** and **integration** into the global economy, as well as
European **entrepreneurship** in exploring the Chinese market, the
**economic link** has grown **immense** and **resilient**]{.underline}.

In terms of volume, [trade between China and the EU reached a **record
high** of US \$800 billion in **2021**, China remains the **largest
trading partner** of the EU, and the EU is China's **second largest**
trading partner. The **bilateral trade** structure has continued to
**improve**, with trade in **aerospace**, **biology**,
**optoelectronics**, **electronics** and **materials**
growing]{.underline} by [more than 30%.]{.underline} In 2021, an
agreement on geographical indications between China and the EU came into
force.

[Two-way investment]{.underline} between China and the EU [has exceeded
\$270 billion]{.underline}, with active investment and cooperation in
finance, new energy, electric vehicles and logistics. [China's
investment in Europe **continues to grow**]{.underline} against the
trend.

According to a 2021 survey of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in
China, [60 percent of the companies]{.underline} surveyed [plan to
expand]{.underline} their [operations in China]{.underline}, and nearly
half of the companies surveyed have enjoyed higher profits in China than
the global average. [The conclusion of the]{.underline} Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment (**[CAI]{.underline}**) [is the epitome of a
**win-win** arrangement and reflects **huge potential** for China-EU
**economic cooperation**]{.underline}.

### UQ\-\--Ext

[China views Europe from a **long-term** and **strategic** perspective
and believed]{.underline} their [relations are **vital**
for]{.underline} world peace, [stability and development and
that]{.underline} their [importance will **only increase**]{.underline}
in a world beset by uncertainty. There are two things China would do.
First, do its own homework and let deeds speak for themselves.
[Recently]{.underline}, The Standing Committee of [the National
People\'s Congress of China]{.underline} has [ratified the International
Labour Organisation's Forced Labour Convention]{.underline} of 1930
[and]{.underline} the 1957 [Convention on the Abolition of Forced
Labour, showcasing China's **real progress** in
**reforms**]{.underline}.

[China has continued its **step-by-step** approach, providing **better
access**, a level playing field, and **more transparency** to foreign
companies. The **unwavering commitment** to reform and **opening up**
will continue to be a **powerful pull factor** for
Europeans]{.underline}.

Second, to have a frank and honest dialogue with Europe on the state and
the future direction of the bilateral relation. [The EU has
said]{.underline} repeatedly that [it does not want to be part of a new
cold war with China and the two should agree on how to prevent a new
cold war and re-set "peace and development" as]{.underline} the theme of
our time [despite the]{.underline} on-going [Ukraine
conflict]{.underline}. The two can and should address the emerging
factor of Russia, our shared neighbour, on our bilateral relations, and
start constructive discussion on rebuilding Ukraine after the conflicts.

### UQ\-\--BRI\-\--2NC

#### Majority of NATO nations are supporting the BRI.

**Fortier 22** \[Meadow Fortier, Turkish Heritage Organization, 2022,
\"China's 5G Technology in the NATO Alliance: A Case Study on Italy\",
accessed 7-16-2022,
https://www.nato2030fellowship.org/china-s-5g-technology-in-nato\] Lex
IT

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aims to modernize its
security and defense strategies amidst the changing nature of global
cooperation and defense. Pertinent to this modernization campaign is the
challenge posed by China. While China poses a challenge in a myriad of
ways, its competence and dominance in technology is undeniable and
pressing. Its technological innovation has produced enumerable benefits,
but the increasing claims of China using it as emerging and disruptive
technologies (EDTs) against NATO members propels us to consider the real
scope of its benefit and threat. [The growing popularity of the Chinese
company Huawei and its provision of fifth-generation (5G) technology
throughout NATO member states serves as an example]{.underline} to
assess China's challenge and its use of EDTs. [Huawei]{.underline} is a
private telecommunications company that supplies 5G infrastructure, or
networks and devices with notably high rates and easy connections. Its
[international supply of 5G is part of a larger Chinese initiative known
as the Belt and Road Initiative and its Digital Silk Road]{.underline},
a campaign other countries join to receive Chinese investments in
infrastructure such as 5G, roads, oil pipelines, ect. [Currently, **18
of 35 NATO countries have joined the BRI**. These memberships have
**visibly led to the spread of Huawei's 5G throughout NATO
territories**, with **28 of the 50 global Huawei commercial contracts
signed with European countries**. In fact, **many European countries
find it difficult not to engage with Huawei** given its superior ability
to meet the demand for 5G technology (1), as opposed to European 5G
companies such as Nokia and Ericsson]{.underline} (2). In the context of
technological challenges posed by China, the concern over Huawei stems
from its access to sensitive information and China's 2017 National
Intelligence Law. Passed two years after the launch of the Digital Silk
Road and 5G infrastructure, the law grants the government power to
"require relevant organs, organizations, and citizens to provide
necessary support, assistance, and cooperation," with state intelligence
work. The government further incentivizes cooperation by granting itself
the power to "reward individuals and organizations that contribute to
national intelligence work," (3). As a telecommunications company,
Huawei can access a wide array of transactions and communication that
could be relevant to a government's security. Coupling the information
Huawei has access to with China's Intelligence Laws, a serious challenge
arises for countries who become involved with the BRI. NATO allies have
already attributed a wide number of intelligence-related EDT threats
like cyber-attacks, intellectual property theft, and disinformation
campaigns to actors based in China (4). Aside from the PRC's
Intelligence Law, Huawei's relationship with the BRI and its Digital
Silk Road situates the company within a larger geopolitical struggle
that inherently triggers security concerns. The BRI is arguably China's
attempt to translate its international economic influence into political
influence (1), pulling any company apart of the initiative, such as
Huawei, into to NATO's radar. This speculation of the BRI's geopolitical
intentions is supported by the current nature of global competition and
dominance, where power comes from non-traditional means like diplomatic
and economic relations as opposed to traditional military strength. The
NATO 2030 Reflection Group highlights China's geopolitical tactics as
they write how China is now "dedicating significant and increasing
resources to this domain in effort to outpace the West" (4). [Italy and
its engagement with Huawei provide an interesting case study to better
understand China's potential technological challenge to
NATO]{.underline}. While countries such as France or Germany may offer
interesting insight due to their overall larger economic relations with
China, [Italy is relevant in that it has the **largest market for
Huawei's 5G**]{.underline} (5) and is the only G7 country to officially
join the BRI. In other words, the fact [that it is a **core NATO member
with** not only economic but **BRI-based diplomatic ties**]{.underline}
lends a geopolitical lens to observe the potentially negative intentions
behind Huawei's 5G. The limits of this assessment should be made clear,
in that Italy's relationship with Huawei is only judged upon publicly
available information. [When observing the initial development of Huawei
in Italy, it looks strong and widespread. After Italy officially joined
China's BRI in 2019]{.underline}, the [Huawei Italian CEO]{.underline}
Thomas Miao [revealed the tech company will invest more than **\$3.1
billion in Italy over the next three years**]{.underline}. [By **2020,
Italy was the largest market in pursuit of Huawei's supply of 5G**
technology and infrastructure, with over 800 people employed for
research and development alone]{.underline} (2).

### UQ\-\--AT: Ukraine\-\--2NC

US\': Chinese experts;" Global Times; July 18, 2022;
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202207/1270833.shtml

Some experts stressed that [China-EU cooperation is significant for
Europe]{.underline}, [whose economy]{.underline} is facing severe
problems and has [risks of falling into a deeper recession if it blindly
follows in the steps of the US]{.underline} by countering China.

[The EU is facing grave challenges]{.underline}, Li Yong, deputy
chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of
International Trade, a think tank affiliated with the Chinese Ministry
of Commerce, told the Global Times on Monday.

[Global inflation is elevated]{.underline}, driven by surging energy and
food prices. Against the background of interest rate hikes by the US
Federal Reserve, [a European debt crisis has emerged]{.underline} and
the euro has depreciated, Li said.

Hu Qimu, chief research fellow at the Sinosteel Economic Research
Institute, told the Global Times on Monday that the [EU is very likely
to slide into recession]{.underline} by relying on its own economic
cycle. Therefore[, it is **necessary for EU to strengthen cooperation
with China**.]{.underline}

As for why the trade dialogue was delayed for several months, Chinese
experts said that the main reason is that the EU believed in the US
energy commitment, stood firmly on the US side and held high the banner
of sanctions against Russia.

\"It should be said that the outbreak and continuation of the conflict
between Russia and Ukraine is a strategic mistake made by the EU. The EU
was exploited by the US and lost everything. In the end, it must return
to the road of cooperation and negotiation with China,\" Hu said.

[China and EU have already **enhanced communication** recently
over]{.underline} multiple issues. On Sunday, Chinese State Councilor
and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter
Szijjarto talked over the phone about [bilateral ties and the **Ukraine
crisis.**]{.underline}

Wang said that the Ukraine crisis has not only seriously affected
Europe - its negative spillover has also affected the world.

[The lessons from the Ukraine crisis are]{.underline} profound and
[worth learning for all sides,]{.underline} Wang noted, saying that in
the long run, [the parties should discuss building a balanced,
effective, and sustainable European security framework]{.underline}, so
as to realize lasting peace and security.

### UQ\-\--AT: Thumpers\-\--2NC

#### "Thumpers" open a window for rapprochement\-\--China's trying to improve relations, but the plan wrecks their attempts.

Indeed, [projects around]{.underline} the Belt and Road Initiative
([BRI]{.underline}) [have been disrupted in Eurasia and Europe **due to
the war in Ukraine**]{.underline}. Freight trains from China crossing
into Central Asia have been prevented from reaching Ukraine, a country
described in January by Xinhua News Agency as having "broad prospects
for BRI cooperation with China."

Ukraine-related projects are now at standstill, and even projects
between China and Russia may be in jeopardy due to Western economic
sanctions against Moscow. As for projects in Central and Eastern Europe
(CEE), a sub-region long coveted by China, [CEE countries are now
largely focused on the Ukrainian situation, welcoming refugees and
sending assistance to their neighbor. CEE governments are now less
likely to conclude agreements with China]{.underline}, which is seen as
an apologist for Russian actions. In addition, the 16+1 format,
initiated by China 10 years ago as a mechanism to interact with the
region through infrastructure projects in the energy and transport
sectors, is currently being challenged in its very existence. The
majority of CEE states have had relatively low trade with China and run
a trade deficit worth \$75 billion. [The five non-EU countries ---
Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Bosnia and Herzegovina
---]{.underline} have warmly [welcomed China-funded projects worth about
\$6.3 billion in sectors such as highways, energy stations, and railways
in the Western Balkans.]{.underline}

But as pointed out in a recent Observer Research Foundation report,
[none of the infrastructure projects announced for the remaining 11
countries, who are EU members, went beyond paper and political
declarations.]{.underline} Projects signed as early as 2013 have not
even begun, with the Belgrade-Budapest railway being the only exception.
Last year, six CEE leaders out of the 16 members chose to send their
foreign ministers to the 16+1 meeting rather than attend themselves.
While Lithuania has fully withdrawn, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Bulgaria,
Slovenia, and the Czech Republic are also questioning the format's
usefulness.

For now, [the future of the BRI remains uncertain.]{.underline} China
may now refocus on the BRI\'s Central Asia-West Asia corridor, moving
more Chinese exports across Central Asian countries, Iran, and Turkey,
but those logistics are challenging as they involve transport via the
Caspian Sea. The cheapest and easiest way is still the maritime route,
all the way from Chinese ports to the Mediterranean Sea, but sea lanes
have also been affected by serious delays.

Overall, [Sino-European relations are **reaching a tipping point**.
Following the pandemic and acrimonious exchanges over human rights in
Xinjiang and Hong Kong, as well as economic and trade
issues]{.underline} (Europeans are still complaining about market access
for their companies in China), there is a risk that the Ukraine war and
Beijing's stance might deeply affect the long-term relationship. But
with US-China relations at an all-time low, [it would be]{.underline}
[**surprising if China did not want to try to improve its relationship**
in particular with Berlin and Paris, offering these two capitals a
window of opportunity once the Ukraine situation becomes less
tense]{.underline}.

**[Trade, investment and scientific cooperation]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} **[Europe and China]{.underline}** are [at risk of
taking a "**big step back**"]{.underline} [as the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [considers banning
Chinese telecom giant Huawei]{.underline}, analysts said. [Beijing has
hinted at retaliation]{.underline} should the European Union go ahead
with the ban. The 28-member bloc is planning ways to ban Chinese firms
from work to develop its 5G networks, and [that might spell trouble for
joint efforts to test 5G in China and Europe]{.underline}. Last week, EU
officials said they were in the early stages of making plans to
strengthen procurement rules, or change the legal definition of critical
infrastructure. [Such plans]{.underline}, if enacted, [would effectively
**exclude Chinese telecom providers** from development of European
high-speed information networks.]{.underline} "[The global economic
implications of comprehensive bans on major Chinese tech firms almost go
without saying -- they would **have enormous effects**]{.underline},"
said Cui Hongjian, a senior fellow with the China Institute of
International Studies. "[It would definitely **affect trade relations**
as well.]{.underline}" The EU is China's biggest trading partner,
averaging more than €1 billion (US\$1.14 billion) per day, while China
is the EU's second-largest after the United States. Cui said that
[Beijing might also **cancel scientific cooperation**]{.underline}, or
close doors on future plans, [if it felt Europe was targeting China's
technology companies. Huawei is building a strong presence in European
markets]{.underline}, and Chinese telecom firms have been working with
their European counterparts on 5G networks for years. [China and the EU
signed an agreement on 5G cooperation in 2015, pledging to conduct joint
research and promote standardisation]{.underline}. The agreement was
signed as a part of a public-private partnership launched by the EU,
with the bloc pledging €700 million in government funding by 2020, and a
further €3 billion to be raised by industry. Huawei said it was playing
a "major role" in cooperation, according to the company website, and was
working with European telecom companies such as Nokia and Ericsson, as
well as European research institutions, to explore 5G. This year, [the
EU began a two-year programme with China to develop 5G under the 2015
agreement]{.underline}, and is prepared to spend millions of euros. In
November, [the EU and China began a **20-month collaboration** under the
5G-Drive project for joint research and trials agreed between the bloc
and the China Mobile Research Institute]{.underline}. The Chinese side
of the project is coordinated by China Mobile, where project partners
include Huawei. The project will focus on sites in Italy, Finland and
Britain, and five in China -- in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Wuhan, Suzhou and
Guangzhou. [Chinese and EU **scientific cooperation** stretches back
**more than two decades** and includes **agriculture, biotechnology,
space and human health** research.]{.underline} A co-funding mechanism
for scientific cooperation has mobilised more than €500 million from the
EU, and 1 billion yuan (US\$148 million) from China from 2016 to 2020.
But the [**momentum for cooperation may be lost** if European national
security concerns over Chinese companies, especially **Huawei, take
precedence**.]{.underline} At least five EU governments -- France,
Germany, Poland, Britain and the Czech Republic -- have said they are
investigating whether to bar Huawei from 5G infrastructure developments.
One of the concerns cited by European nations is that Chinese law
demands private companies and individuals cooperate with national
intelligence agencies -- meaning Huawei could turn sensitive data over
to the Chinese authorities. Tim Rühlig, an analyst of EU-China relations
at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, said rivalry between
China and the US had put Europe in an "awkward position" because of its
extensive cooperation with both sides. "[Both the US and China perceive
the conflict over 5G infrastructure as a matter of geopolitics," he
said]{.underline}. "[China **cutting supply chains** to Europe in
**information and communication technology** would be a serious problem
for the region's technological development, as they are heavily reliant
on China.]{.underline} "China has leverage, but I am not sure it is
willing to utilise it." The concern intensified last month when European
Commission vice-president Andrus Ansip, who is in charge of digital
affairs in the union, said that all Chinese companies were "under
suspicion" as possible security risks. But Zhang Ming, head of the
Chinese mission to the EU, said [banning Huawei from European 5G
projects would **risk "serious consequences**" for **global economic and
scientific cooperation**.]{.underline} German telecoms company Deutsche
Telecom warned that a ban on Huawei would put European firms behind US
and Chinese firms, and set back the release of 5G technology in Europe
by at least two years. "At this moment, I believe that Europe tends to
side with the US. If China wants to prevent Europe from taking this
decision, it is well advised in trying to tone things down and not try
to blackmail Europe. The most likely result would be the EU's complete
turn to the US," Rühlig said. But Shi Zhiqin, who studies European
affairs at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy, said the EU
as a whole would not ban Chinese tech companies. "If they do take
action, [**China-EU relations**, on the whole, are **likely to take big
steps back**]{.underline}. But Huawei's market share in Europe, and the
existing scale of joint research, make it very difficult to imagine a
full ban on Huawei," Shi said.

[**Until** late **last year**, most **Europeans only knew Huawei** as
one of many smartphone manufacturers gaining ground in stores across the
continent.]{.underline} But in recent months, [the tech giant has turned
into a symbol of a **high-stakes wrestling match between** the world's
premier superpower, the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, and its
increasingly ambitious and capable challenger, [**China**.]{.underline}
Indeed, the impending rollout of 5G infrastructure [has become a key
battleground in a broader struggle for control over the industries of
the future]{.underline}. Europe has meanwhile been caught on its back
foot and urgently needs to develop a strategy to not only guide it
through the current 5G debate, but also the tech rivalries that are
still to come.

With dramatically higher data transfer speeds and decreased latency, 5G
carries the promise of revolutionizing all spheres of daily life: from
self-driving vehicles to health­care to the "internet of things" and the
digi­tali­zation of industrial production processes and so-called smart
cities. Huawei currently leads the field in 5G infrastructure and as
such, for the first time in modern history, [China is in a prime
position to lead the world in the rollout of a potentially game-chang­ing
technology. This prospect has caused **fierce pushback from Washington**
and jit­ters across Europe and much of the West.]{.underline}

For months, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
been pressuring its European allies to enact an outright ban of
Huawei]{.underline} from the rollout of 5G infrastructure on the
continent. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo even warn­ed that allies who
deal with the com­pany will no longer be privy to American intelligence.
[China]{.underline}, in turn, [threatened retaliation against European
countries inclined to give in to US demands]{.underline}. China's
ambassador to the Euro­pean Union (EU), Zhang Ming, spoke of "[**serious
consequences" for** eco­nomic and scientific
**cooperation**]{.underline}, whereas [China's am­bassador to Poland
warned of "steep costs" for Poland if it decided to ban
Huawei.]{.underline}

Caught between the two powers, [Europe's **vulnerability** is clearly
visible]{.underline}: On the one hand, European countries depend on
Chi­na's central position in the value chain for information and
communication technology (ICT), in particular regarding hardware; on the
other hand, the United States dominates software development and remains
Europe's prime security guarantor.

Complicating matters further, the Trump administration announced on May
15 that Huawei would figure on the "Entity List" of the US Department of
Commerce, effectively placing sanctions on the Chinese tech giant and
banning all access to US technology (from microchips to critical
software). This decision constitutes a major blow to the com­pany that
has the potential to severely affect its operations. It is also a clear
signal to Western allies that the United States is serious in its
campaign to stop Huawei's grow­ing influence. For its part, China has
responded with its own broadly defined "unreliable entities list" of
countries, com­panies, or persons that "seriously damage the legitimate
interests" of Chinese com­panies.

In this situation, [Europeans risk becoming mere objects in a
geopolitical struggle for technological leadership that will
significantly shape our future]{.underline}. The defense of European
interests and values in this context will require Europeans to develop
a common political strategy -- based on sound principles and objective
criteria -- for navigating the geopolitical conflicts that new
technology will bring. [The 5G debate adds a sense of urgency to this
quest]{.underline}.

COVID-19 has emerged as a catalyst of troublesome trends in
international relations. It has revived the US-China rivalry and further
put international institutions under stress[. **EU-China relations**
have not been unscathed. **China** has emerged as a **necessary
partner** in times of need and there is space for **cooperation in
global issues**]{.underline}, but COVID-19 has also fostered a process
of disenchantment of several EU member states and societies towards
China. COVID-19 has highlighted the risks of overdependency towards a
single major supplier and the normative gap between both parties have
been exposed. The crisis has underlined China's lack of transparency as
well as a its assertive diplomacy at times involved in disinformation.
China's Human Rights record is also in the spotlight due to the adoption
of Hong Kong's security law and the situation in Xinjiang which have
both raised concerns. In addition the negotiations on the EU-China
Comprehensive Agreement on Investment and [**EU member states'**
decision on the role of **Huawei** in the development of their 5G
networks are **pending** issues that are not evolving favourably to
**China**]{.underline}. Regarding 5G, this is illustrated by the recent
French decision to move away from the Chinese provider and of Telefónica
choosing to reduce its dependency to Huawei's 5G core technology. Across
the Channel, UK has decided to ban it by 2027.

Chinese authorities may want to introduce a transactional approach to
reverse this trend. [That is, if the **EU would limit Huawei's access**
in its market, **China** would **retaliate** against **European firms.**
**Chinese** diplomacy may call for an 'open, fair, and
**non-discriminatory** \[...\] environment' but these claims have
**little normative ground**. EU firms face **restricted access and
unequal treatment** in the Chinese market resulting in **unfair
competitive advantages** for their Chinese **competitors**.
**Benefiting** from **open market rules** requires to **abide**
them]{.underline}. This would not be a case of discrimination, but
indeed of equal treatment. Amid COVID-19 China has recently displayed
its commitment to greater openness and trade liberalization.
Nevertheless, those prospects remain irrelevant until substantive
progress materializes.

Moreover, stakes go well beyond economic interests. In fact, [**UK**'s
decision on Huawei has been taken despite **additional economic costs**
and **delays** in its **5G rollout.**]{.underline} Huawei's involvement
in EU's 5G network raises security and strategic concerns, including
possible risks of espionage and sabotage and a deterioration of
trans-Atlantic links. In reaction, EU and EU member states have embarked
in the adoption of new and upgraded investment screening mechanisms to
better monitor foreign involvement in critical infrastructures and the
EU has adopted a security-driven approach on 5G. In that respect, the
main issue is that Huawei does not appear as a very trustworthy
provider. The firm's corporate structure remains opaque, and its
independency unclear due to the financial support it has received and
the characteristics of the Chinese state which 'could compel anyone in
China to do anything'. Japan's and France's de facto bans have taken
into account this lack of trustworthiness and the higher risks posed by
foreign (Chinese) providers. [The centrality of this security and
strategic dimension should proscribe ending up in a bargaining over EU
and China's respective companies.]{.underline}

[**China's possible retaliation** would push the EU to face
**difficult** choices. If China were to target EU firms, this would be a
reminder that **economic interdependency** and **need for cooperation**
do/should not preclude **power politics**.]{.underline} The EU may be an
international actor with significant soft 'presence' and capabilities.
But it will have to better deal with power, i.e. to better mobilize
these capabilities to achieve intended outcomes --level-playing field--
and prevent unwanted ones --security risks-- in its relations with
China. In fact, levering market access would turn to be a necessary
instrument to do so[. For the last year and half the **EU** has dodged
difficulties by **postponing** concrete decisions to **ban or not
Huawei**, and by focusing on mitigating security risks to ensure
strategic autonomy. Now that EU members may start taking more **concrete
action,** they will likely face **hard pressure from
China**.]{.underline} They should not be blinded by commercial
trade-offs in this issue as the role of Huawei in Europe´s 5G networks
has implications well-beyond this field.

As the world enters the 4th industrial revolution, the era of Artificial
Intelligence, the Internet of Things and faster and more powerful 5G
telecommunications networks, [the **EU** and **Huawei** have a **unique
opportunity** -- to be **partners** in leading the world's **economic
growth** through **digitalisation**]{.underline}.

[Huawei, the]{.underline} world's [foremost supplier of]{.underline}
information and communication technologies (**[ICT]{.underline}**)
[equipment, has been **based in** Europe since it set up a first
**research lab**]{.underline} with a small number of employees in
Stockholm [in 2000]{.underline}.

Now, [two decades later, Huawei employs nearly **15 000 people** across
**Europe**, 70 %]{.underline} of [these locally hired, in all the **EU
countries** and **beyond**]{.underline}. Some 2 400 of [these staff work
in highly **skilled jobs**, dedicated entirely to **research**,
**development** and **innovation**, at Huawei's European research
facilities, which]{.underline} now [number 23 across the
continent]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, as EU per capita income has nearly doubled over the past 20
years, so Huawei's contribution to European GDP has soared. You could
say [the EU and Huawei have **grown hand in hand** in this respect,
especially in the **technology sector**, where Europe is well positioned
to become a **leader** globally]{.underline}.

Huawei's most spectacular growth in Europe has taken place over the past
four years. According to the global forecasters, Oxford Economics, the
company's contribution to Europe's GDP in 2018 was €12.8 billion, having
grown at an average annual rate of 19 % since 2014. In the same period,
employment supported by Huawei grew by 13 % per year to nearly 170 000
jobs, and the €5.8 billion tax revenue the company paid to European
countries in 2018 has increased by 17 % a year since 2014.

Huawei, a European company

[Huawei is **committed** to Europe. The company sees Europe as its
**second home base** and wants to contribute to European **growth** and
towards Europe's **technology leadership** in the world. It wants to
help Europe achieve **true digital sovereignty** in terms of **data
protection**, citizens' **privacy**, **cyber security**, and the ethical
considerations of the **applications** and **equipment** used on
European soil.]{.underline} And Huawei is more than committed to making
a decisive contribution to Europe's economic recovery. Already today,
[Huawei has **manufacturing sites** on European soil. Further
**significant investments** in 5G manufacturing will
**follow**]{.underline}.

To ensure [Huawei]{.underline} is able to contribute fairly and equally
to the European ICT ecosystem, the company [has established thousands of
**win-win partnerships** with European **telecoms carriers**,
**industrial companies** and **industry associations**, **top
universities** and **research institutes**, and local and regional
**authorities** beginning to introduce smart technologies]{.underline}.

[Huawei is]{.underline} now [a part of the European fabric, an **active
player** in shaping the digital economy]{.underline} for the future,
contributing innovative technology to EU research projects and
broad-ranging industryled cooperation initiatives such as those for
connected vehicles, digital transformation and smart agriculture.

[The EU's approach to free, fair and open competition]{.underline} in
the ICT sector, protecting innovation and consumer choice, and [ensuring
equal opportunities for companies to compete in the European
marketplace, makes Europe an **attractive base** for companies
developing high-end intellectual property]{.underline}.

**[Backlash against the Backlash?]{.underline}**

Europe is in a very different place. Although senior officials in
Brussels, Paris, and Berlin may bemoan what they see as a lack of
interest in Washington in cooperating with Europe on China (last year
when French president Emmanuel Macron urged closer cooperation, [Trump
reportedly told him that the EU was worse than
China](https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-emmanuel-macron-eu-worse-than-china-trade-tariffs-57f53e00-8b5c-4931-9d05-97ee0b510fd5.html)),
[it is unclear whether European leaders would really welcome a
full-blown, **institutionalized transatlantic agenda directed against
Beijing**]{.underline}. [This **would give the impression that the EU
was taking sides** in the dispute]{.underline}, a step European
officials say in private that they want to avoid. [It could endanger
European commercial interests in China]{.underline}. And it would be a
difficult sell to European publics. Indeed, as the Trump
administration's confrontation with China becomes more ideological and
urgent, **[there is a risk that we see a backlash against]{.underline}**
the China backlash in **[Europe]{.underline}**, with the political
momentum behind robust pushback against Beijing fading. How a new
European Commission positions itself on China and whether a fragile
German government is willing to pay a price in order to forge a more
united European and transatlantic stance will be key in this regard. So
too will be [Britain's positioning on China
post-Brexit](https://www.merics.org/en/blog/brexits-false-eastern-promise).
Once outside the EU, will the British government feel it can't afford to
put its economic ties with China at risk? Without London, Berlin, and
Paris pulling together, it is difficult to imagine a loose European or
transatlantic consensus on how to handle China.

[The PR China had opened wide door to European military technology to
invade into PR China's defence sector since **the economic embargo was
lifted to transfer advanced military technology.**]{.underline}
Financial dynamic invested into PR China's defence sector had completely
changed situation over the past five years into military modernization
process of the PR China's army. Chinese President [Xi]{.underline}
Jinping has [**put an end to the practice of making any progress on
international security cooperation with Europe conditional** on the
lifting of the embargo.]{.underline} This is the result of the PR
China's arms industry's progress (Duchatel, 2018). The PR China had
access to critical technologies that had speed up modernization process
for ten years, and beside it had created main conditions for advanced
innovation and leadership for the next generations of arms toward C4I
updated technology. The PR China had paid off for some advanced hi-tech
licensed equipment -- those are being incorporated into Chinese military
helicopters, ships and submarines, and were needed to speed up
modernization process of China army but it seems that the EU thoughts
ongoing into direction to prevent all transfers of dual-use technology
to the PR China as to protect Europe's critical technology. China's
economic intensions became doubtful about financial influence to invest
more money by spending into common hi tech military projects together
with Europe champions into defence sector as the PR China tries to
increase pressure by lifting economic barriers to arms transfers and
export controls. [The **main barrier to deepening of the EU-PR China
defence cooperation is the will of NATO allies**]{.underline} and
especially of the US [to preserve sensitive hi-tech military technology,
whilst the PR China is still accused for industrial espionage and
steeling military patents.]{.underline} Arms control measures among
transferring hi -- tech military technology to third states could not be
secured by NATO protocol of regime export mil technology or under the
PESCO projects carried out by the EDA control. The PR China may use
hi-tech military projects to benefit itself to modernize own army into
all military branches by following up European modernization process
under Horizon 2020 projects. [The defence companies from the EU shall
take decision, if cooperate or not cooperate into the joint EU-PR China
defence cooperation.]{.underline} The PR [China had pleased the EU
member states to fully participate into the Eurasian megaproject and
**invest more money to rebuild the Silk Road strategy**]{.underline}
toward the western part of Heartland. This invitation was referred on
the defence cooperation too if EU states did not decide for
protectionism. [It was likely seen that the **EU had been stuck between
US and PR China's economic influence from foreign geoeconomic
investments.**]{.underline} The PR China, meanwhile, "is leveraging
military modernization, influence operations, and predatory economics to
coerce neighbouring countries to re-order the Indo-Pacific region to
their advantage," the Strategy declares. And the Chinese military
modernization program, it adds, is designed to achieve "regional
hegemony in the near-term and displacement of the USA to achieve global
pre-eminence in the future" (Morgan, 2018). "The EU and China signed a
'strategic partnership' in 2003, and adopted 2020 strategic agenda for
cooperation in 2013. These agreements resulted from a mutual commitment
to cooperation and signal an interest to further advance ties"
(Dorussen, 2017: 2). Prominent role from [EU states]{.underline} those

[The **industrial agreement** between the EU's 5G PPP Association and
China's IMT-2020 (5G) Promotion Association will **enhance cooperation**
in this feld. This agreement marks another stage in their cooperation
(**EU-China partnership** on 5G 2015]{.underline}). It was based on
other agreements already signed between the European Commission, Japan,
and South Korea during 2015.18

The agreement was very opportune in the light of the countdown for the
World Radiocommunication Conference 2019, because [the **two countries**
have started together in the **5G standardization race** and discussions
on spectrum requirements for 5G]{.underline} (Liu 2016).19 Europe wants
to ensure that it does not lag behind in 5G adoption by reaching deals
with countries that are at the forefront of its development. [**China**
is becoming one of the **major players** in the **development of 5G**
and one of the largest markets for 5G technologies, products, and
services]{.underline} (MWL 2015[). The **agreement facilitates** an
**environment for cooperation** between Sino-European telecoms and ICT
companies by trying to increase higher access to both markets,
facilitated through development and innovation initiatives and publicly
funded **5G research**.]{.underline}20 However, the reality is that the
European market is fully open whereas the Chinese market is not. Despite
offcial talks, there are no joint private projects between European and
Chinese companies.

The areas of cooperation were defned as having fve components: 1. Come
to an understanding on the concept, basic functionalities, key
technologies, and time plan for 5G 2. Examine the possibilities for
joint research actions, including participation of enterprises on the
services and applications for 5G 3. Popularize global standardization
for 5G through relevant organizations such as the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) and the International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) 4. Cooperate in identifying the most promising radio frequency
bands to meet the new spectrum requirements for 5G 5. Investigate the
services and applications for 5G linked to the IoT (EU--China
partnership on 5G, 2015)

[The joint **EU--China projects** will be funded by a **co-funding
mechanism** (CFM) for research and innovation for both
partners.]{.underline} An investment of over €640 million from 2016 to
2020 is expected. In this regard, at the end of 2015, the MOST made its
frst annual call under the CFM to provide €28 million support for
Chinese organizations (Huawai 2016).

[Under this cooperation, it seems that **many doors could be opened** at
all levels. Yet, at the **institutional level**, **governments** need to
promote **global standardization** for **5G** by improving
infrastructure networks and facilities such as the ITU21 and the
3GPP2]{.underline}.22 This task will not be simple because some of the
new spectrum requirements for 5G, such as the most appropriate radio
frequency bands, are complex to achieve. This challenging situation
gives rise to the possibility for SinoEuropean cooperation; for example,
research centers and universities could work together in implementing
joint research actions, and businesses could develop 5G research
projects. The question is how to fnd those partners, sit them down
together, and make them understand that by working together they could
obtain better results. Even if President Xi Jinping has called on
scientists, entrepreneurs, scholars, and technicians in the industry to
work together toward the goal of welcoming foreign collaborations to
pool together more human, material, and fnancial resources (New China
internet strategy unveiled 2016), these actors do not know where to fnd
potential European partners. At the same time, the European industry
still has doubts about the benefts that can be obtained by sharing
knowledge and expertise if local markets are still closed to them.

On the brighter side, [there are **wishes to jointly** explore services
and applications for **5G**, especially in the area of the IoT, smart
cities, e-health, intelligent transport, education, entertainment, and
media.]{.underline} The case of e-banking is another signifcant
application area because the shift to a digital economy has changed the
customers' use of fnancial tools such as e-wallets, e-payment, and
touch-pay systems (Yang 2016). [Moreover, **Sino-European**
organizations, research centers, and private companies fostering
**cooperation** in terms of **reciprocity** and **access** to **5G**
network research funding could provide openness in terms of market
access]{.underline} (European Commission 2015c). [European companies
could increase access to and participation in China's public funds for
5G research, while Chinese enterprises are already involved in EU's 5G
activities]{.underline} (EU-China partnership on 5G 2015; EU, China sign
key partnership on 5G 2015). Yet, experience shows that these intentions
have not been adopted at the time of writing this chapter.

[Some **Chinese and European universities** are joining to prepare a
formal launch of the **China--EU Digital Research Center** at the end of
2016]{.underline}.23 This research center aims at systematically
monitoring and comparing Chinese and European regulatory frameworks,
e-commerce,cloud services, data protection, cyber security, 5G and
future networks, copyrights, and patents to achieve better synergy
between Europe's Digital Agenda and China's Internet Plus (New China
internet strategy unveiled 2016). Because both the European Commission
and Chinese national government are now reviewing their rules and
eliminating requirements that stife e-commerce, [this type of joint
project could be very **complementary** at the **institutional
level**.]{.underline}

In contrast to the EU, which has a dedicated agency (ENISA)24 to promote
and coordinate cyber security policies, China has not yet developed a
comprehensive cyber security strategy. However, as President Xi recently
mentioned, cyber security will be a focal point for the national
government. China's cyber security strategy builds on recent steps.
Following the establishment in 2014 of the Central Cyber Security and
Informatization Leading Group, the Cyber Security Association of China25
was founded on 25 March 2016. It conforms to academic institutes,
individuals, and internet companies (including Tecent and Qihu360).
Cyber space management and security is a prerequisite for increased
internet usage everywhere. The organization aims to establish industry
standards and cyber security studies, but also will promote
"self-discipline" in the industry, a practice unwelcome in Europe (China
launches the cybersecurity association of China 2016).

The protection of private data and the prevention of cyber attacks have
become the main points in cyber security strategy in Europe and China.
For this purpose, both partners wish to speed up legislation and
surveillance measures to avert cyber threats (New China internet
strategy unveiled 2016). [This area of cooperation is described as
"**CyberRealpolitik**" and is tackled by the **EU--China cyber
taskforce**.]{.underline}

[The success of the **Sino-European cooperation** for **5G
standardization** depends on the ability of **businesses and research
institutes** to join forces to **cooperate** and implement projects
together. It is also necessary for **offcial institutions** to
**facilitate policies, instruments, and mechanisms** to carry out joint
projects.]{.underline} At the time of writing this chapter, there was no
transposition from the top level to the bottom. However, large potential
avenues have been acknowledged in the digital feld, particularly with
the development of 5G technology

As the Chinese idiom goes, 抛砖引玉 (pāo zhuān yǐn yù), literally
meaning "cast a brick to attract jade," this chapter offers a few
remarks to set the ball rolling. Similarities in the B&R initiative and
the Juncker Plan have been identifed. [Both **economic initiatives** and
the **confdent offcial relationship** between the EU and China provide a
**favorable environment** for develoment of the EU--China Investment
Cooperation.]{.underline} It remains to be seen how this cooperation
will play out once both initiatives have been fully developed. In the
meantime, the ability to explore joint investment projects other than
infrastructure is recommended to strengthen numerous opportunities for
business, research, and services in both China and Europe.

The digital age is here and has not yet arrived at an impasse. Both the
EU and Chinese governments are making efforts to adapt to the changing
technical environment created by the internet, IT systems, and data
analysis. Digital transformation is underway in both regions, which must
catch up fast with the leaders of the digital world to avoid lagging
behind. Research, innovation, and a new generation of infrastructure
must be put in place in order to be on the frontline of the advances in
cyber space and technology, as well as to adapt to the requirements of
users and services.

[In this regard, the **EU and China** have plenty of room for
**cooperation** in the **5G market**. Their intentions are still in an

This strategic initiative has been reshaped and enlarged with new routes
and projects. The Belt and Road initiative now concerns 4.4 billion
people in sixty fve countries with a collective GDP of US\$2 trillion.
[The initiative aims to address primarily the infrastructure investment
needs of Asia.]{.underline} The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates
that about US\$8 trillion is needed for infrastructure investment in the
Asian region between 2010 and 2020. Based on an implementation guideline
for the Belt and Road initiative released by China's National
Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in March 2015[, development
plans along the Belt and Road routes aim to improve connectivity in fve
areas: policy, infrastructure, trade, currency, and people.]{.underline}
Priority is given to development of transport infrastructure such as
roads, railways, and ports. Another area of focus is connectivity of
energy infrastructure, such as power grids, oil and gas pipelines,
liquifed natural gas terminals, high-voltage power lines, nuclear power
reactors, renewable energy installations and other energy projects.
[Construction of communication line networks and IT infrastructure links
across Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, and Europe is also
important.]{.underline}

East Asia is the fastest growing and most dynamic area of global
economy, followed by the strong growth of South Asia. Central Asia lags
behind in many aspects, although it is richest in natural reserves. [The
goals of the Belt and Road initiative address this particular point
because Central Asia is probably the frst and nearest area where
projects regarding energy, transport infrastructure, and introduction of
common standards will be implemented. Properly implemented, the projects
that comprise the **Belt and Road initiative** could signifcantly boost
**regional economic growth**, **development**, and **integration**. They
can also **promote political cooperation**, better understanding, and
**stability**, which could **reduce** the roots of and felds for
**terrorism and extremism** in the region, going hand in hand with set
of strategic policies and goals of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization
(SCO).]{.underline} On the other side of the continent and China's
borders, [ASEAN countries have **high levels of energy defciency** and a
critical need for **energy infrastructure investment**, coupled with a
desire for increased regional energy connectivity.]{.underline}

[The ASEAN countries are also expected to be high on the agenda of the
Belt and Road initiative's list of projects (SIEW 2015). Experience of
**East Asia's economic rise** has shown that economic success has had a
positive impact on **domestic social** and **political stability**, as
well as on **regional interstate relations**, although there are
limitations resulting from historical, ideological, and other invisible
and deeply rooted obstacles. Domestic needs refected at, and strategic
goals and gains coming from, the Belt and Road initiative are
numerous]{.underline}. [Considering China and her domestic needs, the
initiative is intertwined with a range of challenges related to
**sustainable growth** of the Chinese economy.]{.underline} China has
been facing many problems in trying to switch to a new model of economic
growth, some of the most grave being the need to access resources and
markets for fnal products; reduce or reallocate part of its industrial
overcapacity; deleverage some crucial sectors of the economy; and
diversify and safely and effciently deploy its enormous US\$3.51
trillion in foreign reserves (Wei 2015).

[The **Belt and Road initiative** is an opportunity to s**olve some of
these problems**. By building or upgrading infrastructure relating to
transport, energy, and communication along the Road and the Belt and
connecting it with existing infrastructure, China can create a new and
vibrant network.]{.underline} This brings the opportunity to export
technologies, creativity, management skills, materials, and labor, which
will reduce the pressure of overcapacity in sectors such as steel and
cement manufacture, and maintain high and sustainable economy growth. It
can also absorb and diversify China's fnancial surplus and help increase
capitalization and control extensive domestic investment. Economic
structural reform is an urgent issue for China in order to overcome the
steady decrease in its workingage population and the consequences of
excessive domestic investment and overreliance on export-driven growth
in recent decades.

Nevertheless, President Xi Jinping said he hoped that annual trade
between the countries involved in Beijing's plan to create a modem Silk
Road would surpass US\$2.5 trillion within a decade (Wei 2015), which
shows the importance of revitalizing exports as a growth engine for the
Chinese economy. This should ease the process of structural change in
the domestic economy. [Furthermore, continuing economic growth would
give the chance for China's "Reform and Opening Up" program to once
again become inclusive. Further results in **alleviating poverty**
confirm the legitimacy of the Communist Party's leading role, proving
its continuing ability to provide a share of global wealth to the
Chinese nation, more equally distributed than ever in the long history
of the Chinese state.]{.underline} In that sense, economic growth is
inseparable from national security. Also, China could and should further
promote internationalization of the renminbi.

Beijing also hopes that improved connectivity between its less developed
southern and western provinces, its richer coast, and the countries
involved in the Belt and Road initiative will improve China's internal
economic integration and competitiveness and spur more regionally
balanced growth. [Regarding domestic security in China, the Belt and
Road initiative offers an opportunity for central government to
intensify its policy of **economically upgrading** the **Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region,** which is the **epicenter** of the **country's
secessionist and terrorist threats**.]{.underline} Xinjiang, which
borders Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, is strategically important for the
infrastructure network of the Belt and Road initiative, which will pass
through the region and connect China with relevant neighbors. This is
particularly true for Central Asian countries that will be connected
with western China through Xinjiang as the gateway. Such a position has
already been provided with several infrastructure projects, such as a
high-speed railway between Urumqi and Lanzhou, and initiatives for
investing in Xinjiang's banking sector, manufacturing, tourism,
transportation and commercial hubs, and other sectors that should create
work for locals and stimulate growth of the region's economy and general
well being. [**Beijing** is counting on the calming effect that economic
development and **elimination of poverty** should have on **ethnic
issues** and **political dissatisfaction** on the part of the **local
Uyghurs.**]{.underline}

External goals that China could achieve through the Belt and Road
initiative are plentiful and inseparable from domestic goals. [There is
no doubt among the majority of decision-makers and analysts from the
interested sides that implementation of the Belt and Road initiative
could assist in deepening regional economic integration. This would come
through increased cross-border trade, benefting from improved
transportation and legal infrastructure, simplifed procedures, and
unifed standards for trade and investments.]{.underline} For China, this
initiative is the most rational way to exert its growing potential as a
rising power and increasingly infuential international player,
especially because the USA's Asia Pivot has strengthened US military
alliances in East Asia and the Pacifc. Maritime and border issues in the
South China Sea showed China's gained military strength and
self-confdence, but were counterproductive in terms of deepening mutual
trust and maintaining good neighborly relations. Furthermore, Washington
has been pushing two major economic initiatives on both points of its
global dominance: the Atlantic and Pacifc Oceans. The Trans-Pacifc
Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership
(TTIP) both exclude China. [Certainly, containment of China's rise has
so far proved unsuccessful, but it has pushed China toward its western
geostrategic vector and perhaps reassured its leaders that "peaceful
rise" and "win--win" economic cooperation are better options than
security and military pressure or confrontation. The Belt and Road
initiative benefts China's geopolitical and security interests by tying
other countries into very close and interdependent economic
relations.]{.underline}

However, this is also where the weaknesses of the EU approach are laid
bare. The EU defined its approach, and indeed the relatively artificial
boundaries that it created when grouping countries, on the basis of a
single criterion: EU integration. It appears that, with the launch of
the EU Global Strategy, a new and more interest-based approach may be
developing in Brussels. Still, it is the EU's understanding of a
particular country's prospect of integration into EU structures that
forms the guideline for the EU's policy. Geopolitical, economic, or
trade factors have been secondary at best in this regard. This may have
made sense in the immediate post-Cold War era, when the power of
attraction of the EU was at its strongest and the geopolitical tensions
in Eurasia at their weakest. However, since at least 2008, it has become
clear that [the EU's relationship with the countries to its east cannot
rely solely on the power of its normative values and the prospect of
association with the EU]{.underline}. This reality stems from the EU's
growing aversion to enlargement as well as its reduced appeal following
a succession of internal crises from the euro crisis to Brexit. The EU's
recent experience in the western Balkans and in the Eastern Partnership
area is a clear indication that [a **new approach** is needed -- one
that will focus to a much greater extent on **European interests**, not
solely European norms and values. The EU must **act** not only as a
European project but as a **European power**]{.underline}. 135 What,
then, are the [European interests in this area]{.underline}? Simply put,
they [range from **stability** and **development** in the political and
economic fields to securing **energy** supplies and developing **trade**
and **transport** links]{.underline}. Importantly, [the EU's interest in
political and economic stability implies that the development of the
**rule of law** and the consolidation of **participatory** forms of
**government** are not simply European values but also concrete EU
interests]{.underline}. In this sense, [China's rise presents
**important opportunities**]{.underline}. For all the talk of a
Russian--Chinese alliance, it is a fact that [Beijing's involvement in
Central Asia has helped to strengthen the **sovereignty** and
**independence** of the region's countries. The US and EU support for
oil and gas **pipelines**]{.underline} linking the South Caucasus states
to European markets [broke Russia's hegemony in that region and helped
to secure the economic independence of Azerbaijan and Georgia in the
early 2000s. China's lead in the construction of pipelines linking
suppliers east of the Caspian to itself in the latter part of the decade
had exactly the **same effect** in Central Asia]{.underline}. In this
sense, [China contributed to a long-standing Western policy goal in the
former Soviet space: the securing of sovereignty and independence that
makes countries across this space full international citizens and thus
**potential partners** not only for China but for Europe as
well]{.underline}. In more recent times, [against the background of a
Western and particularly **American disengagement** from **regional
security** issues, it is instructive to witness how countries closer to
the EU]{.underline}, such as those of the Eastern Partnership, [seek
**closer ties to China** with the objective of counterbalancing their
dependence on Russia]{.underline}. Furthermore, [there is no question
that China's investments answer a **direly felt need** across
Eurasia]{.underline}. As noted, the **[infrastructural
needs]{.underline}** of Eurasian and Asian states [are enormous, and
neither the EU nor Western development banks are in a position to fulfil
those needs. In supporting infrastructure for trade and transport, China
is providing a **public good** that will be beneficial for **local
states** as well as **business entities in Europe**]{.underline}.

if China is to meet the commitment, 'a lot remains to be done', but, as
one US commentator noted, '[Almost all of China's climate and energy
targets in recent years have been met or exceeded, so anything President
Xi Jinping announces in such a public forum is **not just

[EU-China Cooperation for a Green Partnership]{.underline}

In 1998, the EU and China established a long-term, stable and
constructive relationship for the 21st century, then established a
comprehensive partnership in 2001, followed by a comprehensive strategic
partnership in 2003. The two sides further proposed four major
partnerships -- \"Peace, Growth, Reform and Civilization\" -- between
China and the EU in 2004. Overall, China, in its relations with the EU,
has always favored cooperation, innovating new partnerships and, through
them, enhancing the well-being of the people of both sides. Nowadays,
China and the EU maintain deep intertwined economic relations. The
volume of China--EU bilateral exceeded US\$700 billion for the first
time in 2019, with the EU as China's largest trading partner for 16
consecutive years. China also continues to be the EU's largest trading
partner, the largest source of its imports, the EU's third-largest
export market. At the same time, bilateral direct investment remains
strong. By the end of 2020, the EU's real investment stock in China had
reached US\$118 billion. Finally, on 30 December 2020, after 7 years and
35 rounds of negotiations, the EU--China Comprehensive Agreement on
Investment was completed, which was the first investment agreement the
EU has concluded with another party since it was granted exclusive power
to conclude investment agreements by the Lisbon Treaty (2009). The
demand for capacity cooperation is rising, and cooperation in third
markets is also on the agenda. [China and the EU agreed to **develop a
green partnership** and a partnership on digital cooperation by
establishing high-level dialogue mechanisms in September
2020]{.underline}. The EU--China green partnership is another important
addition to the four major partnerships of \"Peace, Growth, Reform and
Civilization\". [It **builds on the EU--China Partnership on Climate**
Change and the EU--China Blue Partnership]{.underline}. This new dynamic
element in bilateral partnership also fully [reflects the commitment of
both sides to **uphold multilateralism**]{.underline}, to [work together
to **tackle global environmental challenges** and to provide an
**international cooperation model** for achieving the 2030
Agenda]{.underline}. Various mechanisms exist for and around the
EU--China green cooperation. Over the years, [the two sides have carried
out pragmatic exchanges and cooperation in **air pollution control**,
**climate change**, **green growth**, circular economy and other fields,
and have made significant contribution towards promoting environmental
governance and sustainable development in China and Europe and at the
global level.]{.underline} In addition to the Union level, China has
concrete bilateral environmental cooperation mechanisms with several
major member states in the EU, such as Germany, France, Italy and
Norway. For instance, bilateral mechanisms include: (with Germany)
China--Germany Environment Forum (ministerial level), the China--
Germany Working Group on Environment and Climate Change (bureau level)
and expert seminars; (with France) the China--France Year of the
Environment, the China--France Beijing Initiative on Biodiversity
Conservation and Climate Change; (with Italy) Cooperation Management
Office of the China--Italy Environmental Cooperation Projects and so on,
not to mention all those co-financed and co-implemented bilateral and
trilateral programs and projects.

On the foundation of the green partnership and these various mechanisms,
the bilateral exchange on cooperation informed by the EU's Green Deal
may be brought to a range of high-level dialogue tables. For instance,
the first High-level Environment and Climate Dialogue between China and
the EU was held on 2 February 2021. Besides, the EU Green Deal
communication actually indicated that the EU will bring forward the
discussion to multilateral floors such as G7, G20 and WTO. It is
therefore reasonable to foresee relevant discussions and even
negotiations taking place at these round tables. The completion of the
investment agreement negotiations between China and the EU sends a
positive signal to the international community and the global market
that, it is hoped, will be influential in getting international
supply-chain cooperation back on track soon after the COVID-19 pandemic.
At the same time, the principles of sustainability, intellectual
property protection mechanisms and codes of conduct for different
ownership enterprises incorporated within the Agreement represent the
new paradigm shift of international investment agreements, creating a
cooperation model for emerging economies and developed countries to
reach similar investment agreements. It can therefore play a leading
role in the reform and upgrading of global investment governance.

Green Partnership Respecting Multilateralism and Interdependence:
Concerns about the EU\'s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

The European Green Deal is a new decarbonizing growth strategy as a
response to climate and environment related challenges. In this regard,
China and the EU share similar values and policy objectives. China is
vigorously implementing the new development concept of \"innovation,
coordination, green, openness and sharing\", while the EU is looking for
a green and digital transformation of the economy, with both sides
putting the concept of sustainable development to the fore. The Green
Deal widens the policy window for cooperation, against the backdrop of
COVID-19 pandemic, to consolidate global governance mechanisms, and to
take the green recovery as the lever for Building Back Better and
promoting the 2030 Agenda, while respecting existing UN norms. There is
no doubt that the confidence and determination of the EU--China green
leadership are manifested in all high-level dialogues. The next step is
to adopt a mutually respectful, reciprocal and fair approach in
practice. A controversial element, however, is the Carbon Border
Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), also described as Carbon Border Tax (CBT).
It goes way beyond the technicalities of enabling a global green growth
towards imposing unilateral coercive border tax with \"much pain and
little gain\", as critics note both in Europe (7) and China. Since the
EU\'s Green Deal is clearly communicated as a \"new growth strategy\"
and the EU\'s growth is embedded within a global post-COVID development
agenda (with other countries also demanding growth), the Global
Difference Principle (a western political philosophy concept) should be
respected when growth and development are discussed. The EU carbon
border tax could frustrate developing countries\' export trade,
resulting in the EU\'s so-called \"new growth\" based on the economic
frustration and trade disruption of developing countries as a result of
green trade barriers. In that case, the EU could achieve the expected
\"new growth\" after the introduction of a carbon border tax, but could
fail to \"play a role as part of a plan to raise the expectations of the
worst-off\" in line with the \"difference principle\", losing its
creditibility of justice. Besides, several concerns are particularly
relevant to the carbon border tax: First of all, while the Green Deal
Communication is framed in terms of continued EU support for the Paris
Agreement, the CBAM seems to be at odds with the core of the Paris
Agreement, namely the \"bottom-up\" INDC approach, with all countries
declaring their own ambitions. CBAM deviates from the self-determined
contribution framework to an approach that features \"coercive pressures
from some nations towards other\". From a critical perspective, the
EU\'s assertion that imposing a CBT could encourage other countries to
raise their decarbonization ambition might result in a \"slippery
slope\", as it is not convincing that the CBTdriven result will be
better than the INDC-driven counterfactual result. Besides, it may imply
that a \"sovereignty-seeking\" EU places little trust in the efforts of
NDCs from other nations, not to mention that many academic researchers
have questioned the so-called \"carbon leakage\" that serves as the
asserted reason for a CBT (8).

The CBT is understood by and large as a protectionist policy which is
not yet compatible with WTO legislation. It violates the principle of
\"common but differentiated responsibilities and respective
capabilities\" which is endorsed by Paris Agreement and UNFCCC.
Therefore, it is understood that if the EU wishes to take the lead in
climate policy respecting WTO and UNFCCC principles, then the CBAM
should only target developed countries. Second, the EU Green Deal is
generally seen as EU\'s initiative to reclaim global climate governance
leadership. Nevertheless, global leadership in the multilateral system
must respect existing UN rules and norms. Analysts have raised two major
concerns: 1. 2. A third concern is that the potential EU--USA alliance
on CBT (6) risks becoming a source of conflict on a global scale. In the
EU\'s New EU--US Agenda for Global Change, the EU proposes to
re-establish a close and open transatlantic partnership. In the new
agenda, the EU affirms the \"unique\" nature of EU--US relations,
arguing that if Europe and the US join forces, their global influence
will be unmatched in terms of both total economic volume and
technological innovation capacities. Some analysts raised the concern
that if the Biden administration supports the Clean Energy Security Act,
the US--EU consensus on a carbon border tax may also become a new
trade-protection tool for developed countries against developing
countries. If most developing countries practice solidarity in rejecting
the CBT, the world economy might split into parallel systems, namely a
lower-carbon-intensity economic system (of developed countries) and a
higher-carbonintensity economic system (of developing countries). There
seem to be other obstacles in the way of the EU implementing the Green
Deal. First, implementing the CBT faces many practical barriers, such
as 1) the difficulties and costs of carbon-footprint tracking and data
access across the whole supply chain, 2) the risk of unjust treatment
towards countries with heterogeneous carbon-tracing capacities, 3) the
possibility of causing trade deviation that bypasses decarbonization
paths etc., which are discussed by the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel
(9) and are well covered in Chinese opinions and discussions. Second, it
is observed that the Green Deal meets certain opposition from the
Visegrad Group (Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia), and it is
yet to be seen how the Just Transition Mechanism works to harmonize the
conflicts of interest within EU.

Conclusion

The Chinese vice-premier addressed the first High-level Environment and
Climate Dialogue between China and the EU, stating that \"\[t\]he two
sides should uphold multilateralism, safeguard the international system
with the United Nations at the core, abide by the principle of common
but differentiated responsibilities, and promote the construction of a
fair, reasonable, and win--win global environmental governance system\".
[Should the EU and China pursue a win--win cooperation and uphold
multilateralism, there is huge potential for cooperation in a long list
of diverse fields]{.underline}, such as green automobiles, digital
technology, big data technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
**[renewable energy]{.underline}**, the **[i]{.underline}**nternet
**[o]{.underline}**f **[t]{.underline}**hings, circular economy,
**[smart grid]{.underline}**, Carbon Capture and Storage
(**[CCS]{.underline}**), battery and storage technology, **[green
investment and green standards]{.underline}**. The EU and China should
work together to consolidate the green partnership for better global
governance.

among the 17+1 summit members, have signed various memoranda with China
to enhance cooperation, such as the Siemens-CRRC cooperation and the
financial investment memorandum between the Netherlands and China. It
means most EU countries have participated in the BRI, which will bring
about more cooperation in different areas between them. Beijing is
unlikely to speed up the phase two talks this year but will prefer
waiting for the outcome of the US presidential election. EXPERT OPINIONS
The flow of capital and technology in Europe and China's experience can
be combined for work on new projects such as the Pelješac Bridge in
Croatia. The funds are from EU, the technology is German, the labour
force is from Croatia and construction is Chinese. We know that although
China is exceptionally capable at building infrastructure, its ability
to provide supervision and consultant services is relatively weak, and
[**many rules have been set by Europe.** So such cooperation is an ideal
model.]{.underline} This is also the reason why China has signed
memoranda with many financial and multilateral organisations to perfect
the BRI. On the other hand, [it]{.underline} also [helps interconnect
European countries and narrow its \'inner development\'
gaps.]{.underline} For example, currently many EU products are
transported east from Rotterdam and Antwerp. Now with the BRI harbour
project in Greece and Italy in the south, the flow of trade can be more
balanced. [Projects such as the railway from Luxembourg to Zhengzhou
have **expanded Europe's scope of influence.**]{.underline} ["Four
levels in one]{.underline}" (land, air, ocean, internet)
[interconnection is essentially different from what exists now. It
**upgrades regional integration to yield global interconnection.** This
systematic connection **will bring about leveraging
effects**]{.underline}.

International Order,"

China's role in international order

In the post-Cold War era, China has to adapt to the changing
international order, find out its place in international order. In
recent years, [China's role in international order has become a hot
topic]{.underline}, whether in Munich Security Conference or in Valdai
Forum. It is true that China officially rarely use the term "world
order", "international order" (alternatively international system) is
widely used in official documents and speeches, as Madam Fu Yin pointed
out in her address in Munich Security Conference two years ago. China
draws distinction between world order and international order, as the
world order always equals to the US-led world order. Madam Fu assumed
that the US-led world order rests on three pillars: first, the American
value system, which is also accepted as the western values; second, the
U.S. military alignment system, which is claimed to be the security
foundation for US leadership; third, the international institutions
including the UN system\[vii\]. In china's opinion, the international
order is the UN based system including the international institutions
and norms. Fu Yin emphasized that [China has a **strong sense of
belonging** to this order, as China is one of its **founders** and is a
**beneficiary**, a **contributor**, as well as **part of its reform
efforts**]{.underline}\[viii\]. President Xi Jinping explained China's
role in his speech in Seattle in 2015 in this way, "as far as the
existing international system is concerned, [China has been a
**participant**, **builder** and **contributor**]{.underline}. We stand
firmly for the international order and system that is based on the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter". He stated "a great number of
countries, especially developing countries, want to see a more just and
equitable international system, but it doesn't mean they want to unravel
the entire system or start all over again. Rather, what they want is to
reform and improve the system to keep up with the times. This would
serve the common interests of all countries and mankind as a
whole"\[ix\]. What China envisions the international order is not fully
compatible with the America-dominated world order. [China does not fully
embrace the US-dominated world order]{.underline}. One the one hand,
China is a contributor of current international order, [on the other
hand]{.underline}, [China is a **reformer**]{.underline} of current
international order. [The collapse of the current international order is
**not in the interests of China**]{.underline}, therefore, China seeks
to defend current international order find out its place. In this sense,
Mr. Xi Jinping highlighted in his address in 19th party congress last
year that [China will be a **staunch upholder** of the international
order]{.underline}.

[China's vision over the world order demonstrates in the conception of
building a community with a **shared future**]{.underline} for mankind.
President Xi put forward the idea of building a community with a shared
future for mankind, the conception is the continuation of the previous
ideas in post-Cold War era, for example, building new political and
economic order, pursuing the path of peaceful development and building
harmonious world. Mr. Xi Jinping elaborated China's vision in 19th
Congress of CPC, he stated that "We call on the people of all countries
to work together to build a community with a shared future for mankind,
to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys
lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity"\[x\]. To large
extent, the ruling party's evaluation of the international situation
determines the orientation of foreign policies. Mr. Xi Jinping deemed
"The world is undergoing major developments, transformation, and
adjustment, but peace and development remain the call of our day. The
trends of global multi-polarity, economic globalization, IT application,
and cultural diversity are surging forward; changes in the global
governance system and the international order are speeding up; countries
are becoming increasingly interconnected and interdependent; relative
international forces are becoming more balanced; and peace and
development remain irreversible trends"\[xi\]. Based on the vision of
building community of shared future for humankind and judgement about
international situation, Mr. Xi Jinping sent the message to the world
what kind of role China will play in international order. The message is
quite clear, [China will be an **architect of world
peace**]{.underline}, China will be [a **stalwart of global
development**]{.underline}, China will be [a **staunch upholder of the
international order**]{.underline}. As for the way of diplomacy, [China
seeks **communication** rather than **confrontation**]{.underline},
China seeks [**partnership** rather than **alliance**. China pursues
**independent** and **peaceful foreign policies**, defends its
legitimate interests, dedicates to construct **stable** and **balanced
framework** for relations with great powers.]{.underline}

After 18th National Congress of CPC, [China has introduced **proactive
foreign policy** away from the policy of "**keeping a low profile** and
**never taking the lead**"]{.underline} set by Deng Xiaoping in the
early 1990s. China's emergence as the economic powerhouse is a shock for
global economic order based on Bretton Woods system, the idea of new
Bretton Woods system never has the chance to be tried. China realized
that the current global economic order does not fit well for itself, the
transition of global economic order should accommodate its needs.
[China's notion of global governance is based on the principle of
achieving shared growth through discussion and collaboration in engaging
in global governance. China pledged to play its part in global
governance, take an active part in reforming and developing the global
governance system, and keep contributing Chinese wisdom and strength to
global governance. One of the **most important policy initiatives** is
the]{.underline} One Belt and One Road Initiative (Belt and Road
Initiative, in short, **[BRI]{.underline}**). [This is regarded as the
public goods that China **provides for the world**. The BRI is a
comprehensive initiative]{.underline}, including political
communication, policy coordination, infrastructure building,
connectivity, trade and investment, financial integration and
people-to-people exchange. The BRI is a geo-economic conception rather
than a geo-political strategy. [The BRI is **not based on geopolitical
rivalry**, rather than it is based on **economic cooperation**, **mutual
trust** and **mutual benefit**]{.underline}. If we examine the official
discourse and narrative, geopolitics is beyond consideration. As one
senior decision-maker for foreign policy pointed out in Boao Forum in
2014, "[Chinese leaders have made it clear that in implementing the
initiatives, China will uphold the spirit of '**amity**, **sincerity**,
**mutual benefit** and **inclusiveness**', which **guide China's
diplomacy** regarding its neighbors, and China **will not interfere** in
other countries' internal affairs or **seek dominance** over regional
affairs or sphere of influence. The Belt and Road initiative is for
**open cooperation**, with **economic** and **cultural cooperation**
being the focus. They are **not aimed at creating exclusive blocks** or
**compromising existing multilateral mechanisms**]{.underline}\[xii\]"
[The BRI is **not intended to undermine** and **destabilize current
global economic order**. China]{.underline} as one of the beneficiaries
of the globalization, **[strongly supports the globalization
process]{.underline}**, opposes different kinds of protectionism.
President Xi's speech at World Economic Forum last year showed that
[China is a **strong supporter of free trade** and **economic
globalization**]{.underline}\[xiii\]. In essence, [the BRI is the
continuation of opening policy. The BRI may be regarded as China's
**regional integration initiative** with wide-ranging countries. The BRI
is a **loose**, **flexible arrangement**]{.underline}, it contrasts
sharply with the usually treaty-based or rule-based integration model.
The AIIB and the Silk Road Fund are complementary to the global and
regional multilateral development bank rather than substitutes. The new
financial institutions established by China, for example, AIIB and Silk
Road Fund operate under current global economic and financial order.
[The BRI]{.underline} is one of the most important initiative in the
last 3 decades, if it is implemented adequately, it [will **shape the
global economic order**]{.underline}.

will likely [want to wear a bulky]{.underline} augmented reality
[headset]{.underline} for eight to ten hours per day or during tactical
operations. [Equipment will **need to get smaller**]{.underline} and
reduced to the optimal size, weight and power (SWAP). [Soldiers will
also need to **train** to understand that the benefits of using the
equipment will]{.underline} ultimately **[overshadow the
drawbacks]{.underline}**, regardless of SWAP.

[There will also be **organizational cultural hurdles**]{.underline} [to
overcome, particularly among IT teams that are **used to** doing things
"a **certain way**" because they've proven **reliable**]{.underline} in
the past. But 5G is rewriting those rules since it is combining the IT,
applications and communication/network capabilities. [This requires
**new skills, responsibilities and perspectives**]{.underline}. The DoD
must begin laying the groundwork today, start thinking of ways to train
these individuals on the technology and work with them to ensure they
are comfortable with the impending changes.

#### Military 5G-networking is expensive, complex, and challenging.

John **Keller 20**, Editor-in-chief at the Military & Aerospace
Electronics Magazine, 12/2/2020, \"What 5G means to the military,\"
Military Aerospace,
<https://www.militaryaerospace.com/rf-analog/article/14188341/military-5g-communications>,
RMax

Drawbacks and tradeoffs

[High-band **5G signals**]{.underline}, which will operate in the
millimeter wave range, [hold the brightest potential for new military
capabilities, but]{.underline} the ability to operate in [these
frequencies will come **at a price**]{.underline} --- namely [the need
to build **many more**]{.underline} fixed-site and mobile [antennas and
towers]{.underline} than today's 3G and 4G cell services require.

"[5G frequency bands do **not** penetrate walls very well]{.underline},
or rain or foliage very well," says Persistent Systems's Robenhymer.
"The way it is architected [you need a lot of towers]{.underline}, or
radiators, in your office or home. It adds to the complexity of 5G, but
[it is]{.underline} still [a limiting factor in coverage and the number
of towers you would need]{.underline}."

[The **stationary nature** of]{.underline} most of the [cell tower
infrastructure may necessitate **sizable investments** in]{.underline}
building new [5G towers]{.underline} --- **[especially for the
military]{.underline}**, which must operate in challenging environments,
such as the leading edge of the battlefield, in urban areas with terrain
masking and multipath interference, in the air at various altitudes, and
in the world's oceans.

"Our customers are seeing the base stations for 5G that will operate at
a significantly higher speed, but at shorter ranges," says
Curtiss-Wright's Southworth. "The military will have to implement many
more base stations to get the coverage they need."

The military, especially, ultimately will need a new kind of mobile 5G
infrastructure to ensure that the next-generation infosphere will be
available wherever the military operates. "It's a question of the
reliance on these systems," points out Persistent Systems's Robenhymer.
"That could be a problem unless we can cut the cord and really start
moving these systems around."

[5G antennas must be **complex designs**]{.underline}. "All the 5G bands
use multiple-element antennas," says Pentek's Hosking. "Each antenna is
connected to its own transceiver; there are 64 elements --- each of
which is a small antenna itself, but arranged in a grid so they act in a
phased array for beam steering."

[Designing the 5G antennas]{.underline} themselves [in the small size
and rugged packaging that the military needs also will be a
**challenge**]{.underline}. "One of the key things in 5G is the ability
to manage these antennas," Hosking says. "You have to think about the
dimensions of these 64-element antennas, because the space between the
elements gets tighter as you go up in frequency. You could have an array
in a fairly small area, but the electronics still must fit in that area.
Getting the electronics of the transmit/receive antennas integrated into
that space is a challenge."

To help the U.S. telecommunications industry win the battle of the
networks, the military has offered its bases as testing grounds for U.S
companies and launched other programs to accelerate 5G development.

[Several **technical hurdles remain** on the road **to broad 5G
deployment** inside and outside the military]{.underline}: [apportioning

Democratic Chief Counsel and Deputy Staff Director for the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee (2015-2018). "What Congress Is (And Isn't)
Doing on 5G" 08/28/19
https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-congress-and-isnt-doing-5g) ☺

But it is [doubtful that]{.underline} the 116th [Congress will muster
any [broad-based
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/dealbook/huawei-5g-national-security-trade.html) that
will materially change the trajectory of the United States's deployment
of 5G technology or the security of the network. Because 5G will remain
a private-sector-led initiative in the United States, the government's
role is limited largely to debating regulatory issues. There is no broad
consensus on whether or how federal regulation should preempt local
regulations on sensitive local issues like infrastructure installation,
nor any consensus on how to make available the resources necessary to
bridge the financial gap so that rural areas in the United States get 5G
coverage.]{.underline} And while most observers agree that the
aggressive implementation of 5G by Chinese companies around the world
poses serious security concerns for the United States[, Congress is
still holding out hope that simple moves like banning the Chinese
company Huawei will solve the security problem. It will
not.]{.underline}

More broadly, the reality is that [**adequate political will does not
exist** on Capitol Hill **to tackle the complicated, multifaceted and
resource-intensive issue of 5G** in a meaningful way]{.underline}. In
the current political environment, it may take a Sputnik moment---when
the Soviet Union launched the first satellite into space, spurring the
United States to redouble efforts to catch up in the space race---to
capture the interest and concern of everyday Americans and, by
extension, their elected representatives.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has employed impressive rhetoric on
5G but has no real plan and lacks both leadership and interagency
coordination on the issue. The executive branch is also making
moves---like trying to reduce regulations at the local level and using
the Chinese technology company Huawei as a tool in a trade war with
China---that have uncertain outcomes and could end up hurting the effort
to deploy 5G quickly and securely.

The 116th Congress will accomplish the minimum incremental steps needed
to make the claim that Congress is doing something on 5G. But it likely
will not unlock the resources needed to securely deploy 5G in the United
States in a timely way or to assure a technological edge over
international competitors on 5G. Instead, Congress's principal
achievements this year and next will be to provide oversight of the
Trump administration's actions related to 5G and lay the groundwork for
serious consideration of this issue in 2021.

Background

Several [useful](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/technology/personaltech/5g-what-you-need-to-know.html) [primers](http://www.politico.com/sponsor-content/2018/11/5g-explained) have
been published explaining what, exactly, 5G is and [why it poses new and
different
challenges](https://www.brookings.edu/research/5g-in-five-not-so-easy-pieces/) compared
to older-generation networks. Mobile service providers are currently in
the process of deploying 5G networks throughout the United States, and
some providers have already launched 5G services in certain cities. Some
telecommunications
companies [estimate](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-downside-of-5g-overwhelmed-cities-torn-up-streets-a-decade-until-completion-11561780801) the
full rollout of 5G will take a decade or longer. The Congressional
Research Service offers research on various [technical
aspects](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11251) of the
5G challenge as well as broader
contextual [analyses](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45485) for
congressional consideration. Meanwhile, my Brookings colleagues have
outlined a number of 5G challenges and opportunities, including how 5G
could be used to [advance environmental
sustainability](https://www.brookings.edu/research/achieving-sustainability-in-a-5g-world/?utm_campaign=Governance+Studies&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=38469658) and
help cities [manage scarce resources
efficiently](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2016/11/30/5g-technologies-will-power-a-greener-future-for-cities/),
how 5G will [impact the future of health
care](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2016/07/14/how-5g-networks-can-shape-the-future-of-health-care/),
and how 5G rollout [could impact communities of
color](https://www.brookings.edu/research/enabling-opportunities-5g-the-internet-of-things-and-communities-of-color/) in
the United States.

In addition, Lawfare has published multiple articles addressing the
security challenges associated with 5G. Jim
Baker [summarized](https://www.lawfareblog.com/5g-networks-must-be-secure-and-reliable) the
situation:

5G promises to revolutionize how people use technology. From
transportation to health care to entertainment, the way people interact
with wireless internet devices will change substantially. And as 5G
enables data to be transmitted much more quickly, the number of devices
connected to the internet will likely explode, producing massive
economic benefits for those who can quickly take full advantage of the
new technology.

But 5G poses huge risks for society as well. As people become more
dependent on wireless communications and generate even more data about
what they are doing, the adoption of 5G will bring with it substantial
national security, cybersecurity and privacy risks. These risks must be
mitigated appropriately in order to protect the interests of the United
States and its allies.

[Others](https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk) on Lawfare [debated](https://www.lawfareblog.com/risks-huawei-risk-mitigation) the [best
way](https://www.lawfareblog.com/risk-mitigation-and-huawei-response) to
manage the technical security risks presented by Huawei's dominant
position in 5G. My colleagues Tom Wheeler and Robert Williams [pointed
out](https://www.lawfareblog.com/keeping-huawei-hardware-out-us-not-enough-secure-5g) that
the Trump administration's imposition of export restrictions on Huawei
and other Chinese companies will not be sufficient to stem the security
threat from China, and that the Trump administration has in fact killed
or missed opportunities to increase the security of the network.

Congress began taking a serious look at 5G issues in 2018 and passed a
number of laws in the prior Congress aimed at facilitating aspects of
5G---including, for example, laws aimed at making [more
spectrum](https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1752) (the
range of radio waves used for communications
purposes) [available](https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1752) to
telecommunications companies to support 5G. How countries make spectrum
available to telecommunications providers plays an important role in
how, and on what timeline, new networks and services are rolled out. In
the United States, spectrum traditionally is auctioned to
telecommunications providers, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury.

Spectrum issues will be a perennial issue and will [continue to
percolate](https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1876).
But Congress is also considering a range of other issues related to 5G
and is weighing a range of approaches---some of which have more merit
than others.

Bipartisan Pushback on Nationalization of 5G

In theory, government control of the 5G network could increase security
and ensure that 5G reaches rural markets where there is currently little
profit incentive for private industry to build infrastructure and
provide services. Congressional responses to proposals to nationalize
parts of the 5G network offer a window into the political aspect of the
5G issue.

The nationalization idea has been advanced twice, each time for a
different reason. First, in [early 2018, a [leaked National Security
Council
memo](https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html) proposed
that the U.S. government pay to build a single 5G
network]{.underline}---an unprecedented nationalization of private
infrastructure---in [order to compete with China and protect the system
from malicious cyber actors]{.underline}. Second, in March [2019,
Politico [reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/trump-campaign-5g-1230276) that
Trump 2020 campaign officials supported a proposal]{.underline}---which
reportedly "spark\[ed\] wireless industry fears of
nationalization"---[under which the government would take over spectrum
designated for 5G and develop a system to share the spectrum with
wireless providers on a wholesale basis.]{.underline} According
to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/trump-campaign-5g-1230276),
this was a bid by Trump campaign officials to woo rural voters who have
lacked adequate internet service in the absence of financial incentives
for wireless companies to offer affordable broadband. The plan
was [reportedly](https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/confusion-reigns-trump-2020-s-5g-wholesale-vision) backed
by Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale and Adviser [Newt
Gingrinch](https://www.facebook.com/newtgingrich/videos/newt-live-the-american-5g-failure/2262549377351710/).

**[Congressional pushback was clear and bipartisan]{.underline}**.
[Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., twice
introduced the thoroughly named [Eliminate From Regulators Opportunities
to Nationalize The Internet in Every Respect (EFRONTIER)
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/918/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22e+frontier%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=3)]{.underline}.
It would [prohibit the president and federal agencies from constructing,
operating, or offering wholesale or retail service on a broadband
network "unless a duly enacted Act of Congress signed into law by the
President provides the President or the agency ... with that
authority."]{.underline} An [[identical bipartisan
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2063/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22e+frontier%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=3) was
introduced on the House side.
And [another](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/893/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=3&s=2) [pair](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2881/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=1) of
bipartisan, bicameral bills calling for the Trump administration to
produce a strategy report contains an explicit limitation that the
report "shall not include a recommendation or a proposal to Federalize
5th or future generations mobile telecommunications systems or
infrastructure."]{.underline} Yet another [[bipartisan Senate
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1625/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1) is]{.underline}
broader in scope but [includes a **statement that** it is the policy of
the United States that "the **Federal Government should**]{.underline}
... [**support but not build or operate 5G networks**."]{.underline}

The pushback worked. Some
commentators [speculated](http://fortune.com/2019/04/12/trump-ajit-pai-5g-wireless-auction-rural-internet/) that
the real reason the administration hastily put together a 5G event in
April 2019---purportedly to announce two Trump administration efforts to
promote 5G---was so the president could publicly calm fears about
nationalization. And Trump did, [stating at the
event](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-united-states-5g-deployment/),
"In the United States, our approach is private-sector driven and
private-sector led. Government doesn't have to spend lots of money....
We had another alternative of doing it that would be through government
investment and leading through the government. We don't want to do that
because it won't be nearly as good, nearly as fast." Bipartisan
congressional opposition, along with opposition by the major
telecommunications providers, seemed to have forced the president to
publicly rebut his presidential campaign and state his position clearly.

Bipartisan Agreement About the Threats Posed by China

The most common issue addressed in proposed legislation is the challenge
posed by China both as an economic competitor to the United States in
the "race" to deploy and dominate 5G and as a national security
espionage and cyberattack threat. China is the current leader in less
expensive technologies for 5G and is likely to deploy the world's first
5G wide-area network. According to the [Congressional Research
Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11251), Huawei
has signed contracts for the construction of 5G infrastructure in around
30 countries, including U.S. allies like Turkey and Iceland. American
companies, which lack the technology and the financial incentive to seek
these contracts, are not currently joining the competition.

The 5G national security issue for the United States
is [multifaceted](https://www.ft.com/content/8b48f460-50af-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49).
In April, four former high-level military officials issued
a [statement](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-former-military-and-intelligence-officials-letter-5g-risks) expressing
"grave concerns about a future where a Chinese-developed 5G network is
widely adopted among our allies and partners." The concerns were
threefold: espionage, the security of future military operations, and
the vulnerability of democracy and human rights around the world.

A number of legislative proposals have sought to articulate the problem.
A bipartisan Senate [concurrent
resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-concurrent-resolution/10/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=11&s=2) states
that "Chinese telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE pose
serious threats to the national security of the United States and allies
of the United States" and that "the United States should reiterate to
countries that are choosing to incorporate Huawei or ZTE products in
their new telecommunications infrastructure that the United States will
consider all necessary measures to limit the risks incurred by entities
of the United States Government or Armed Forces from use of such
compromised networks." Among other things, it finds that "the United
States should work with the private sector and allies and partners of
the United States, including the European Union, in a regularized
bilateral or multilateral format, to identify secure, cost-effective,
and reliable alternatives to Huawei or ZTE products."

Other bills seek to gather information about national security threats
to 5G. The Senate Intelligence Committee's authorization bill, [S.
1589](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1589/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=6&s=2),
and the similar House bill, [H.R.
3678](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3678/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22network%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=7),
require the director of national intelligence to submit a report to
Congress addressing "(1) the threat to United States national security
posed by the global and regional adoption of fifth-generation (5G)
wireless network technology built by foreign companies; and (2) the
effect of possible efforts to mitigate the
threat." [Another](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/987/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=4&s=2) [pair](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2565/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=5&s=2) of
bipartisan, bicameral bills, called the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Act of 2019, address select 5G issues as part of a broader bill
to address problems posed by the rise of China as identified by
the [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/Executive%20Summary%202018%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf).
One section requires the administration to submit an annual report to
Congress on supply-chain vulnerabilities related to China, including an
"assessment of the existing procurement and security policies and
guidance of each Federal agency with respect to cybersecurity,
operations security, physical security, information security, and data
security that may affect information and communications technology,
fifth generation mobile networks (commonly known as '5G networks') and
the Internet of Things." Another section requires a one-time report from
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Commerce Department
on steps required to ensure the rapid and secure deployment of 5G
networks in the United States, with a particular focus on the threat
posed by equipment and services designed or manufactured in China, as
well as information on any new statutory authorities that may be
required to ensure the security of domestic 5G networks.

A pair
of [bipartisan](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/893/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=3&s=2), [bicameral](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2881/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=1) bills
sponsored by John Cornyn, R-Texas, in the Senate and Abigail Spanberger,
D-Va., in the House, called the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2019, goes a
small step further, requiring the administration to produce a strategy
in six months that would: (1) "ensure the security of 5th and future
generations mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure within
the United States"; (2) assist allies and strategic partners "in
maximizing the security of 5th and future generations mobile
telecommunications systems and infrastructure inside their countries";
and (3) "protect the competitiveness of United States companies, privacy
of United States consumers, and integrity of standards setting bodies
against political influence." The bill outlines 17 elements to be
included in the strategy, including a "description of such legislative
or administrative action as may be necessary to carry out the strategy."

A more comprehensive, bipartisan bill offers some concrete ideas.
The [United States 5G Leadership Act of
2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1625/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1),
introduced by Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Mark Warner, D-Va., Tom
Cotton, R-Ark., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., prohibits the purchase---from
any of the universal service funds outlined in section 254 of the
Communications Act of 1934 ([47 U.S.C. §
254](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-47-telecommunications/chapter-5-wire-or-radio-communication/subchapter-ii-common-carriers/part-ii-development-of-competitive-markets/section-254-universal-service))---of
communications equipment and services from Chinese companies, any other
entity that poses a national security risk, and "any company that is
subject to extrajudicial direction from a foreign government." It also
aims to subsidize smaller providers (6 million customers or fewer) with
a new \$700 million Supply Chain Trust Fund (funded from the sale of
spectrum) to ensure that such providers are purchasing uncompromised
equipment and services. It requires a one-time report from the
administration on steps to ensure the secure deployment and availability
of 5G networks and "any new statutory authority required to ensure the
security of 5G networks in the United States." Finally, it establishes a
"joint program to share information regarding security, risks, and
vulnerabilities with United States communication providers and trusted
suppliers" including small businesses and companies serving rural areas
and directs the prioritization of federal funds "to enhance
representation of the United States at international forums that set
standards for 5G networks and for future generations of wireless
communications networks."

Several other bills begin to address the particular security challenges
that the Department of Defense will face if 5G networks are not secure.
The Senate Armed Services Committee's National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), [S.1790](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1790/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=9&s=2),
includes two sections that address 5G directly. Section 212 requires the
secretary of defense to establish secure 5G wireless network components
and capabilities "at no fewer than two Department of Defense
installations." One, at the Nevada Test and Training Range, would allow
the Department of Defense "to explore and demonstrate the utility of
using fifth-generation wireless networking technology to enhance combat
operations." A second installation would "explore and demonstrate
infrastructure implementations of high bandwidth, scalable, and low
latency fifth-generation wireless networking technology" and
"\[a\]pplications for secure fifth-generation wireless network
capabilities for the Department." On the House side, the House Armed
Services Committee's NDAA, [H.R.
2500](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2500/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=7&s=2),
requires the secretary of defense to develop a strategy for harnessing
5G technologies to enhance military capabilities, maintain a
technological advantage on the battlefield, and "accelerate the
deployment of new commercial products and services enabled by 5G
networks throughout the Department of Defense." It proposes a \$175
million increase in funds for such research.

One bipartisan bill in the Senate, introduced by Martin Heinrich,
D-N.M., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, focuses on training personnel in the
Armed Forces in light of new technology challenges like
5G. [S.1471](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1471/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=8&s=2),
the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act, seeks to "promote and maintain
digital engineering as a core competency of the Armed Forces" and
charges the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness to
carry out "the recruitment, development, and incentivization of
retention in and to the Armed Forces of individuals with aptitude,
experience, proficient expertise, or a combination thereof in digital
engineering."

Finally, some bills address head-on the challenges posed by
international economic competition. A
Senate [resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/259/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22AIRWAVES%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1) "deems
it a national priority for the United States to lead the world in the
development and deployment" of 5G techology and "strongly urges all
entities, including Federal agencies, to work cooperatively with the
Federal Communications Commission to advance the goal of United States
leadership in 5G technology, including at the upcoming World
Radiocommunication Conference 2019." Section 103 of the
bipartisan [H.R.3407](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3407/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225G%22%5D%7D&r=8&s=4) would
require the Export-Import Bank to establish a Program on China and
Transformational Exports specifically to support the extension of loans,
guarantees and insurance to American companies that are fully
competitive with how China and other countries that use subsidies to
increase exports treat their domestic companies. The explicit aims are
to "directly neutralize export subsidies for competing goods and
services financed by official export credit, tied aid, or blended
financing provided by the People's Republic of China or by a covered
country" and "advance the comparative leadership of the United States
with respect to the People's Republic of China, or support United States
innovation, employment, and technological standards, through direct
exports" in a number of areas, including "\[w\]ireless communications
equipment (including 5G or subsequent wireless technologies)." [H.R.
3679](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3679/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=2) directs
the director of national intelligence, through the director of the
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency, to carry out a prize
competition worth up to \$5 million to competitively stimulate research
and development relevant to 5G technology.

At this point, it is difficult to say which of these many bills may
become law. The yearly NDAA is probably the most important single item
to follow: Unlike smaller stand-alone bills, the NDAA will almost
certainly become law.

Lack of Consensus on How to Address State and Local Impediments to Small
Cell Deployment

The timely rollout out 5G in the United States faces significant
hurdles. Rollout of 5G across the United States [could take a decade or
longer](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-downside-of-5g-overwhelmed-cities-torn-up-streets-a-decade-until-completion-11561780801?mod=mhp) due
to a lack of investment in low-density areas as well as a lack of
cooperation at the local level. The United States trails other
countries, most notably China, in site density of 5G infrastructure.
Many Asian countries already have far denser infrastructure for their 4G
network and, as a result, have a head start on the density required for
5G. One Chinese company called China Tower has a total of approximately
1.9 million wireless sites in China, [compared
to](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-tmt-5g-deployment-imperative.pdf) a
total of approximately 200,000 in the United States across all
companies. China has installed 350,000 cell sites since 2015, whereas
the United States has installed fewer than 30,000 during the same time
period. That means China is deploying an average of 460 cell sites a day
within the country---12 times the United States's pace.

The importance of speedy deployment of 5G in the United States is the
subject of some debate. Some observers [hold the
view](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-tmt-5g-deployment-imperative.pdf) that
network effects---in which the value of a product or service is
dependent on a high number of users---could grant a first-adopter
sustained advantage and the potential to capture a greater share of the
economic potential of 5G. Put another way, countries with the largest
and most reliable networks will have a head start in developing the
technologies enabled by faster speeds that can then be exported to other
5G markets. Others [make the
point](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/09/25/the-real-5g-race-is-to-serve-all-americans/) that
the United States was not the first to roll out 1G, 2G, 3G or 4G but
nonetheless is currently the world leader in the chips, operating
systems and software applications that run on 4G; and that the United
States should instead "race" to make 5G both secure and available to all
Americans.

The arduous and intense installation requirements for 5G mean that many
more workers---[including engineers, planners, trench diggers and
antenna
installers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-downside-of-5g-overwhelmed-cities-torn-up-streets-a-decade-until-completion-11561780801?mod=mhp)---will
need to be trained in related skills if 5G is to take place in a
competitive time frame. To address this problem, one bipartisan bill in
the House, titled the [Communications Jobs Training Act of
2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1848/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=10&s=2),
focuses on educational training requirements to support 5G deployment
and implementation. The bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 ([47
U.S.C. §
301](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-47-telecommunications/chapter-5-wire-or-radio-communication/subchapter-iii-special-provisions-relating-to-radio/part-i-general-provisions/section-301-license-for-radio-communication-or-transmission-of-energy) et
seq.) to require the FCC, in consultation with the secretary of
education, to carry out a grant program to establish or expand job
training programs in community, vocational and technical schools for
communications tower service, construction, maintenance and structural
modification. Whether this bill gains any traction remains to be seen.

But a far more important and controversial issue looms. [There is a
major **question of how** the United States's **federalist system will
handle** the challenge posed by the sheer **volume and density of the
infrastructure needed** to fully deploy 5G.]{.underline} Under China's
system of government, there are no similar impediments based on local
rules or control. If the rollout of 5G is a proxy for a great power
competition between China and the United States, China has a distinct
advantage in this regard.

Earlier generation technologies like 3G and 4G required the installation
of large 200-foot cell towers spaced relatively far apart and were the
subject of much regulatory oversight at the local level. 5G requires
high-volume, pizza-box-sized small cells that are more compact but must
be much more densely installed for 5G to achieve its full potential.

In September 2018, the [**FCC** issued]{.underline}
an [[order]{.underline}](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-18-133A1.pdf) titled
"Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to
Infrastructure Investment," [**requiring localities to consider**
applications for **siting of "small cell"** equipment---a key component
of 5G deployment]{.underline}---quickly and on a limited number of
criteria. [Twenty-five **states refused**]{.underline} to adopt the
FCC's rule. Generally speaking, these [states oppose the preemption of
state and local regulations, particularly state and local fees, time
frames for cell-siting decisions, and aesthetic requirements. A number
of **municipalities **]{.underline}[**[filed petitions]{.underline}**
[for review]{.underline}](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10265.pdf)[ in

things, that the FCC's order exceeds the commission's statutory
authority. (Several **mobile service providers**, including AT&T,
Verizon and Sprint, also **filed petitions for review in federal
appellate courts** with various other complaints.)]{.underline}

While some [**members of Congress** support the administration's effort
to cut through state and local regulatory frameworks to facilitate
quicker 5G deployment, others **oppose taking regulatory decision-making
away from local officials**.]{.underline} A January [House
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/530/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Accelerating+Wireless+Broadband+Deployment+by+Removing+Barriers+to+Infrastructure+Investment%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=5) sponsored

local regulatory control in the deployment of 5G by causing the
administration's order to have "no force or effect." Many localities are
encouraging their representatives in Congress to support local control.

are urging California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris to
introduce their own legislation or support the House bill.

Industry Pushing 5G Next Generation Technology for Citizens and Military
Operations

The Feb 6 Commerce Committee meeting was focused on "key steps to
maintain U.S. global leadership in next-generation communications
technology, spectrum needs to accelerate deployment, and new
applications and services consumers can expect with 5G deployments." The
hearing also examined current efforts to modernize infrastructure siting
policies and the security of 5G networks to grow the digital economy,
described as a "trillion dollar opportunity". It was mentioned that 5G
with quantum computing and artificial intelligence is needed to unleash
the national agenda including national defense. Ms Cantwell stated early
in the meeting, this will "will reshape the economy of the future" and
"change our modern warfare creating military advantages through
integrated military operations." She also expressed deep concern for
cybersecurity issues with this technology.

Background: FCC Pushes Industry Agenda to Fast Track "Small Cell "
Towers

The FCC has issued Policy Ruling [FCC 18-111 to speed deployment of
"small cells"]{.underline} which went into effect January 14, 2019 and
required cities to update their wireless facilities siting policies to
allow for administrative permits only for "small cells", not the usual
careful process for placement that requires planning commission and city
council hearings. The FCC Ruling allows batched permits (dozens of
permits), a rapid turnover for approval of 60-90 days and a cap on what
cities could charge for rent per pole of \$250 annually. The
telecommunications industry says it will save about \$2 Billion but the
cities state it will be taking away that money needed for vital city
infrastructure.

Jack Tibbetts, a member of the [Santa Rosa,]{.underline} Calif., **[city
council]{.underline}**, knew he had a problem. It was early 2018, and
he'd started [**getting calls from constituents at opposite ends of the
political spectrum**.]{.underline} The [common thread: cellular antennas
going up next to their homes,]{.underline} causing [concerns over
property values and health.]{.underline}

The weight of evidence suggests that if radio-frequency emissions have
any effect on humans at all, it is, [according to the World Health
Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/electromagnetic-fields-and-public-health-mobile-phones),
about on par with other ["possibly carcinogenic"
substances](https://www.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Monographs-QA.pdf),
including coffee and pickles. The Federal Communications Commission,
citing input from the Food and Drug Administration, [recently
declared](https://www.fcc.gov/document/chairman-pai-proposes-maintain-current-rf-exposure-safety-standards) that
existing limits on the amount of radio-frequency energy these antennas
put out make them safe. A senior FCC official said there is nothing
unique to 5G networks that poses additional health risks.

None of this has stopped the social-media-fueled conspiracy whirligig
that allows health scares to thrive on the internet.

[Cities and towns throughout]{.underline} Northern
[California]{.underline} are [issuing ordinances that would exclude new
5G cell sites from residential areas, ]{.underline}[[citing]{.underline}
supposed [**health
concern**s]{.underline}](https://www.sfgate.com/local/article/mill-valley-5g-antenna-tower-cell-phone-block-13221925.php).
[Residents of Portland]{.underline}, Ore., [and Whitefish]{.underline},
Mont., have also cited these beliefs while [lobbying for
restrictions]{.underline}. Legislators in [four states [including New
Hampshire](https://trackbill.com/bill/new-hampshire-house-bill-522-establishing-a-commission-to-study-the-environmental-and-health-effects-of-evolving-5g-technology/1630657/?fbclid=IwAR28psMtRFU7mBGMmA8SKxoS0AIkf8LzcQR7e7vO_MiifUzs0N4GfUNcLC4) have

For Mr. Tibbetts, it didn't matter whether or not these new "small cell"
antennas---which are used for 4G networks but can be upgraded for
5G---going up in Santa Rosa were actually dangerous. Some were attached
to utility poles a mere 20 feet from people's bedroom windows, and
residents complained Verizon had put them up without notifying them.
What mattered was that his [**constituents didn't want** these
**ungainly chunks of public infrastructure** anywhere near
them]{.underline}.

"I don't like the idea of someone being in their home and it's supposed
to be a place of security, and they are having that feeling of
insecurity," Mr. Tibbetts says. "I won't be surprised if in 10 years
there's no evidence of cancer from these towers, but my job is not to
protect Verizon, it's to protect people in their houses."

Whatever the basis for residents' objections to new cell towers, Mr.
Tibbetts---as well as [countless mayors, governors and council members
across the country---have little or no power under current rules to act
on their constituents' wishes.]{.underline} Nor do they have the leeway
they once did to set pricing for cell sites, a lucrative source of
funding for civic initiatives. [Those who do take action are creating
ordinances that put their cities at risk of being sued by the
telecoms]{.underline}, as happened this month [in Rochester,
N.Y.](https://www.scribd.com/document/421597227/Verizon-Lawsuit-Against-City-of-Rochester#from_embed)

Billed as the key to the future---of telecommunications, of global
competition, of innovation and even of municipal infrastructure---[**5G
has**]{.underline} instead **[become a bone of
contention.]{.underline}** In addition to upgrading existing towers, it
will [require an estimated half-million new towers and small-cell sites
on utility poles, lampposts and buildings. Experts also anticipate a
long rollout period, potentially of a decade or more.]{.underline}

Most cities want 5G, but they don't want to be told how, when and at
what cost. [**Rules the FCC** has already **passed**, meant to expedite
5G's rollout, might well be **creating acrimony**]{.underline} that
serves to do the exact opposite.

"My personal reason for doing this is I believe that humanity is
threatened," says Sandi Maurer, a member of the activist group [EMF
Safety Network,]{.underline} which [lobbies to reduce people's exposure
to electromagnetic fields.]{.underline}

Partly as a result of such activism, many towns in Marin County, Calif.,
have passed ordinances or resolutions that limit 5G cell sites in
residential areas. Towns like Mill Valley specify zones where towers
aren't permitted, and may also require them to be a certain distance
from each other. In 2018, Verizon withdrew its application to install
two small cells in Sebastopol, Calif., rather than sue the city or refer
the matter to the FCC.

But since then, the FCC has rolled out its [5G
Fast](https://www.fcc.gov/5G) plan requiring cities and states to
approve new 5G antennas within 60 or 90 days. It also limits what
government leaders can charge carriers for the real estate on which the
new infrastructure will hang---be it a utility pole, streetlight or even
building facade.

Carriers love this plan. A spokesman for AT&T [referred to a
statement](https://www.attpublicpolicy.com/5g/att-applauds-administration-for-commitment-to-maintaining-u-s-leadership-in-5g/) lauding
the FCC's new rules, saying they "will help ensure that, through tried
and true free-market incentives, all Americans no matter where they live
will enjoy the benefits of jobs, investment, and economic growth this
new technology will foster." A Verizon spokesman said, "We're looking
for reasonable access and reasonable prices so that we can deploy 5G
effectively and promptly to communities and the people who live and work
in them."

FCC chairman Ajit Pai and President Trump [have both
said](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-accelerate-5g-rollout-in-race-with-china-11555105017?mod=article_inline) that
widespread deployment of next-generation 5G wireless networks is
critical to winning the race with China. A spokesman for the FCC
referred to [previous
statements ](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-353230A1.pdf)by
the agency: "To enable broadband providers to enter new markets and
deploy high-speed networks, access to poles must be swift, predictable,
safe and affordable."

[**City leaders say their power** to zone and regulate infrastructure is
**being abridged**.]{.underline} More than [**90 cities and counties**
have joined together **in a lawsuit**,]{.underline} currently before the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, [arguing that the FCC has overstepped
its authority]{.underline}. A decision could happen as early as in the
spring, but it could also take much longer.

**[The next generation]{.underline}** [of wireless]{.underline} network,
[5G, has arrived and is being rolled out]{.underline} **[around the
world]{.underline}**, including in communities across the United States.
[As demonstrated by]{.underline} the fierce competition from
[Huawei]{.underline} --- the Chinese telecom-equipment giant that is
leading China's 5G effort and has been a pernicious security threat ---
[the U.S. lead]{.underline} in this critical technology [is]{.underline}
**[not guaranteed.]{.underline}**

Today [only **eight** countries have been willing to join
the]{.underline} American **[ban]{.underline}** [on
Huawei]{.underline}'s 5G equipment, [compared to]{.underline} the
**[90-plus]{.underline}** countries [that have signed]{.underline} up
[with Huawei]{.underline}, [including **NATO** members Hungary, Iceland,
the Netherlands and Turkey, as well as Saudi Arabia and the]{.underline}
United Arab Emirates ([UAE]{.underline}). [A principal reason why the
**U**nited **S**tates has had trouble persuading countries not to use
the Chinese telecom giant is that we have not offered a **viable
American alternative**.]{.underline}

[Washington must **establish a 5G architecture**]{.underline} [that
recognizes the need for stable usage of spectrum **across
industries**]{.underline}, [**expands wireless coverage** to the
entirety of the United States (including rural areas), and
**encourages** the domestic production of key components such as
semiconductors, while also **protecting the privacy and security** of
its users.]{.underline} **[Above all]{.underline}**, [that architecture
must cover a wide range of spectrum options, from]{.underline} high-end,
very **[short wavelength]{.underline}** (24-100gHz), [to **mid-band and
low band**]{.underline} (less than 1 gHz), **[including]{.underline}**
the C Band and [**sub-3** gHz spectrum where China]{.underline} and
Huawei [have **staked their claim** to **5G dominance.**]{.underline}

[In short]{.underline}, [**how the U.S. approaches access to the
spectrum** required to operate successful 5G networks **will do much to
determine the ultimate outcome** of this **technological competition**
with China.]{.underline}

[The **economic** case for embracing]{.underline} the [5G]{.underline}
revolution [is **clear**]{.underline}. The [growth of
wireless]{.underline} connectivity [has produced **real economic
gains**]{.underline}, far [beyond simply the telecommunications
sector]{.underline}. [The wireless industry supports **over 4.7 million
jobs**]{.underline} [and contributes over **\$475 billion** to the
economy]{.underline} each year. Analysts project that [increased 5G
deployment will add **\$1.4 trillion**]{.underline} [to the GDP and
create **at least 3.8 million jobs**]{.underline} [in the next
decade]{.underline}.

[Yet]{.underline}, [one of the **principal issue**s]{.underline}
[holding back U.S. dominance]{.underline} in this emerging field [is a
**policy failure** on the issue of]{.underline}
**[spectrum]{.underline}**. [After much discussion and
analyses]{.underline} across the U.S. government, [the verdict
is]{.underline} in: [Operating a wireless communications system in
**different bands**]{.underline} [avoids conflict with other systems,
provides **maximum effectiveness** to 5G]{.underline} networks, [and
provides the best balance to **support further innovation**]{.underline}
[in a sector where the **U**nited **S**tates **must remain
predominant**]{.underline}.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has decided to make spectrum
available across the high, mid, and low bands. With many countries
limiting the use of spectrum for 5G, the FCC has taken steps to provide
the U.S. wireless industry with both high- and mid-band spectrum and
determined that the regulated use of existing low-band spectrum would
not interfere with legacy systems such as GPS.

Additionally, the FCC recently voted unanimously to make the 6 GHz band
available for unlicensed use, opening up 1,200 megahertz of spectrum.
This decision will help increase connectivity at a time when we need it
most, especially in rural areas that have been particularly hard-hit by
a lack of connectivity during the pandemic. [Given the **intense
demand**]{.underline} for spectrum, [policymakers should]{.underline}
not shy away from **[encourag]{.underline}**ing [**government spectrum**
users to **share their resources**]{.underline}. As FCC Commissioner
Michael O'Reilly recently observed, [the United States needs
**significant** quantities of spectrum to lead]{.underline} the world
[in **5G**]{.underline}. [With the federal government owning
**substantial** amounts of spectrum, we must]{.underline} be creative in
**[expand]{.underline}**ing [access]{.underline} to the bandwidth needed
to bring 5G to consumers and innovators.

[At the same time, sharing spectrum will require **protecting data and
networks** from **unwarranted intrusion and attack**]{.underline},
including future large-scale quantum computer attacks. Quantum-**[safe
encryption of data]{.underline}** and networks [must also be part of an
American-led 5G effort]{.underline} --- [which]{.underline} also [will
**enhance competitiveness**]{.underline} with companies such as Huawei.

[The U.S. **cannot afford to wait** while others,
especially]{.underline} [the **C**hinese **C**ommunist **P**arty,
determine international policy on telecommunications
technology.]{.underline}

[Most mobile communication]{.underline} today [takes place at spectrum
bands below 3 GHz]{.underline}, according to mobile technology chipmaker
Qualcomm. [But 5G wireless networks in the US will operate]{.underline}
in the millimeter-wave band, [between 30 GHz and 300 GHz]{.underline}, a
part of the spectrum set aside for this use in this country, but not
worldwide.

[This issue is at the **center of today's struggle** between the **US
and China**]{.underline} [over **5G** technology and the role played by
Chinese telecommunications technology provider Huawei.]{.underline}

In the millimeter-wave band, [signals do not propagate well]{.underline}
over long distances, [which poses a problem]{.underline}: [While
acceptable for dense urban and]{.underline} crowded [indoor
areas]{.underline}, where positioning additional antennae is relatively
easy, [the higher frequencies are **ill-suited to open areas** where
frequent placement of antennae is impractical]{.underline}. There, bands
below six GHz ("sub-6") are more effective.

The trouble is, [that spectrum **isn't available** in the US
for]{.underline} general [commercial use]{.underline}---[it's reserved
for the **Defense Department**]{.underline}. **[DOD must]{.underline}**
now [determine]{.underline} if and [how to share it with **commercial
use**]{.underline}rs.

Some suggest the military should focus on higher bands. "Access to the
5G millimeter-wave bandwidth will be critical to operations in all
warfighting domains, in particular, space C2," wrote Air University
scholars in a 2018 report. "\[Electromagnetic spectrum\] experts assess
that 5G market share could be 'locked up' by US competitors in under
three years with no second chances to enter the race."

The Defense Innovation Board, however, came to a different conclusion.
It called DOD's focus on millimeter-wave spectrum "fundamentally flawed"
and "impractical."

"The United States may choose to continue down the path of mmWave, but
[the rest of the world is focused on]{.underline} building out **[sub-6
infrastructure, with China in the lead]{.underline}**," the DIB wrote.
"Although mmWave components are typically more compact than sub-6
components, [mmWave **requires many more base stations**]{.underline}
[positioned within close proximity of one another]{.underline} to
maintain connection (and [even then, there is **still the risk** that
interference]{.underline} such as objects moving in front of the base
station or weather [will interrupt]{.underline} the
[connection]{.underline})."

The board pointed to a 2010 broadband [plan that could offer a
**blueprint** for sharing]{.underline} the [sub-6]{.underline} part of
the [spectrum with non-DOD users by giving DOD **priority
access**]{.underline} [while allowing commercial users access
when]{.underline} that [spectrum is not in military use]{.underline}.

The [DIB raised concerns that crowding sub-6 could reduce]{.underline}
system [performance and create vulnerabilities]{.underline}, and that
tools built for certain parts of the spectrum would not be compatible
with tools built for the others.

"[In the current 5G competition]{.underline}, [neither DOD
nor]{.underline} the [**U**nited]{.underline} [**S**tates]{.underline}
writ large [is in a position to dictate]{.underline} the content and
[integration of the 5G supply chain]{.underline}---[our focus
on]{.underline} building a [mmWave 5G ecosystem leaves us out of the
**global supply chain** for the sub-6 5G ecosystem]{.underline}," the
DIB wrote. "[This]{.underline} mismatch [will create **serious security
risks**]{.underline} [for DOD going forward if the rest of the world
**accepts Chinese products** as the **cheaper** and **superior**
option]{.underline} for 5G."

The [DIB issued three]{.underline} public [recommendations]{.underline}
and one classified suggestion to DOD for moving forward on 5G.

First, come up with a [plan]{.underline} for sharing parts of the sub-6
GHz spectrum that lays out [how much]{.underline}---[and
which]{.underline}---[bandwidths should be shared]{.underline}, when,
[and how it may affect DOD systems]{.underline}. Stop focusing on the
more limited mmWave and instead think about how to coexist with civil
operations on the 5G network. [Prioritize]{.underline} moving to [the
most developed bands]{.underline} to make the jump faster.

"[5G capability requires larger bands]{.underline} of spectrum, [and
without that additional bandwidth, the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [will not gain true 5G capability beyond the
limited range]{.underline} that mmWave can provide," according to the
DIB. "In the next year, [DOD is in the position to enable or inhibit 5G
adoption]{.underline} in the United States [based on]{.underline} its
use of [sub-6 GHz spectrum]{.underline}."

Second, the [report predicts the US will likely **lose wireless network
dominance**]{.underline}. [DOD should **funnel research and
development** funds toward **system security and
resiliency**]{.underline}, including testing and experimenting on
technology past 5G, and must assume that all network infrastructure
could be hit by cyberattacks.

Third, the DIB wants [DOD to advocate for a **stronger supply
chain**]{.underline} that is [rewarded for its security and punished
with]{.underline} heavy [tariffs]{.underline} when faults are
discovered. The DIB said the "Five Eyes" intelligence-sharing partners
(the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand) and **[NATO should
adopt]{.underline}** [the same tariffs, and allies need to protect their
own industrial bases as well.]{.underline}

Notably, the DIB predicts [the move to 5G could]{.underline} also
[**increase** the likelihood of **offensive cyber
operations**]{.underline} [as defense gets harder]{.underline}.

[Ready or not, **5G is coming**]{.underline}---and the Pentagon's
innovation advisers aren't entirely optimistic.

"[Gaining a competitive edge over China]{.underline} \[in sub-6\] [would
require action at a rate and magnitude]{.underline} previously **[unseen
within DOD,]{.underline}**" the DIB warned. "For this reason, it is
probable that most of the world outside of the United States will adopt
a sub-6 5G solution, forcing DOD to operate on a 'post-Western' wireless
ecosystem."

[Spectrum will play a key role in the]{.underline} operation,
[**development** and roll-out of 5G]{.underline}. Peak data [rates are
driven by the **amount of spectrum** that is available to a wireless
service]{.underline}. In 4G, up to five 20 MHz channels can be bonded
together. But in 5G, up to five 100 MHz channels can be bonded together,
enabling speeds approximately 20x faster than 4G and 4G LTE. [While some
5G]{.underline} technology [will be deployed in the currently-used
cellular spectrum]{.underline} and achieve modest gains in performance
(LTE is already fairly well optimized), [full 5G development will
require **significantly more spectrum** to provide another step-change
improvement in performance for consumers, DoD or otherwise]{.underline}.
[Countries are pursuing **two separate approaches**]{.underline} to
deploy hundreds of MHz of new spectrum for 5G. [The first focuses
on]{.underline} the part of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum below 6
GHz ("Low- to Mid-Band Spectrum," also referred to as
"**[sub-6]{.underline}**"), primarily [in the **3 and 4 GHz
bands**]{.underline}. [The second]{.underline} approach [focuses
on]{.underline} the part of the spectrum between \~24 and 300 GHz
("High-Band Spectrum," or "[**mmWave**"), and is the approach taken by
the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, South Korea, and Japan (although
all three countries are also exploring sub-6 to various degrees). [U.S.
carriers are]{.underline} primarily [focused on mmWave
deployment]{.underline} for 5G [because most of the 3 and 4 GHz spectrum
being used by the rest of the world for 5G are **exclusive Federal
bands** in the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, extensively **[used
by DoD]{.underline}** in particular. [The question of **spectrum
allocation** is at the **heart of the 5G competition**]{.underline}, for
the spectrum band of choice, whether sub-6 or mmWave[, impacts nearly
every other aspect of 5G development]{.underline}. Spectrum bands in the
[3 and 4 Ghz range dominate]{.underline} global [5G activity because of
improved propagation]{.underline} (**[range]{.underline}**) [over mmWave
spectrum]{.underline}, resulting in far fewer base stations needed to be
deployed to deliver the same coverage and performance. [Because large
swaths of]{.underline} the [sub-6 bands]{.underline} in the United
States [are not available for]{.underline} civil/[commercial
use]{.underline}, [U.S. carriers]{.underline} and the FCC (which
controls civil spectrum in the US) [are betting on mmWave]{.underline}
spectrum [as the]{.underline} core [domestic 5G approach.]{.underline}
U.S. carriers may continue to pursue mmWave, but [it is **impossible to
lead** in the 5G field **without followers**]{.underline}. [Leadership
in wireless networks requires the **global market** to **subscribe** to
and **build** to the specifications of the leader's spectrum bands of
choice]{.underline}, [as these 5G]{.underline} subcomponents and
[products will ultimately **drive interoperability**]{.underline}
[across networks]{.underline}. [The **rest of the world** does not face
the same **sub-6 spectrum limitations** as U.S. carriers, and is
subsequently pursuing 5G development in that range]{.underline}. As a
result, [the **U**nited **S**tates may find itself **without a global
supply base** if it continues to pursue a spectrum range **divergent**
from the rest of the world.]{.underline} [If the future 5G ecosystem
adopted by most of the world is built on the sub-6 mid-band spectrum,
the United States will also be faced with **mmWave device
interoperability challenges** and sub-6 infrastructure **security
concerns**]{.underline}. As sub-6 becomes the global standard, it is
likely that [China]{.underline}, the current leader in that space,
**[will lead the charge]{.underline}**. [This would create **security
risks for DoD operations** overseas that rely on networks with Chinese
components in the supply chain]{.underline}. Even [if the **U**nited
**S**tates were to restrict use of Chinese equipment]{.underline}
suppliers [domestically, the **U**nited **S**tates is not a **big enough
market** in wireless to **prevent** China's 5G suppliers from continuing
to **increase market share globally,** resulting in significant pressure
on a declining set of vendors that would serve the U.S.
market.]{.underline} [These vendors will]{.underline} in turn [be
**unable to invest** R&D towards future 5G offerings due to **decreasing
market share**, limiting the number of competitive products and
**depriving** DoD and U.S. industries of better and **cheaper global
supply chains**]{.underline}. China plans to deploy the first widespread
5G network, with its first set of sub-6 services becoming available in
2020. [**First-mover advantage** will likely drive significant increases
in]{.underline} their handset and telecom equipment [vendors
market]{.underline} along with their domestic semiconductor and system
suppliers. As a result, Chinese internet companies will be
well-positioned to develop services and applications for their home
market that take advantage of 5G speed and low latency. [As 5G is
deployed across the globe]{.underline} in similar bands of spectrum,
[China's]{.underline} handset and internet applications and [services
are likely to become **dominant**, even if they are **excluded** from
the US. China is on a track to **repeat** in 5G what happened with the
**U**nited **S**tates in 4G.]{.underline}

[As the U.S. prepares for future conflict that will]{.underline} likely
**[largely hinge]{.underline}** [on accelerating decision-making with
data and modern technologies like artificial intelligence, it's
necessary that the **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense has a system for
**d**ynamic **s**pectrum **s**haring]{.underline} in place [to
facilitate that rapid flow of data]{.underline}, said one of the DOD's
top IT officials.

[There's much talk about how 5G]{.underline} mobile [networks can
**speed data flow** to enable AI and machine learning applications for
the DOD]{.underline}; [but before that can happen on a **large scale**,
the department is going to have to find a way to **share the limited
existing electromagnetic spectrum** dedicated to 5G with]{.underline}
other **[commercial]{.underline}** and non-defense
[industries]{.underline}, Dr. Kelly Fletcher, principal deputy CIO of
the DOD, told FedScoop in an interview.

"As an American consumer, I'm really excited to have 5G. I'm excited to
have it on my smartphone, on the weekend when I'm milling around my
city. And we at DOD really, really want to enable that," Fletcher said.
"We really want folks here at home to be able to use 5G. And I really
want [to use 5G for our military]{.underline} folks, we want to provide
it to them. But for all of this to work, [we're going to have to move
into **d**ynamic **s**pectrum **s**haring]{.underline}."

[That means]{.underline}, in some cases, [no one will]{.underline}
outright [**own** a piece of the spectrum]{.underline}. Instead,
[different entities will **share it**]{.underline} so as [to not
**hamstring one another**]{.underline}. The DOD is already experimenting
with different structures and technologies to accomplish this in a
smooth way in which it has freedom of action across the electromagnetic
spectrum to support its network needs within the Joint All Domain
Command and Control (JADC2) concept of operations.

satisfy the strict spectrum requirement of 5G networks]{.underline}. [It
has cognitive potential, is reconfigurable and its transmission
parameters can be adjusted according to environment
characteristics]{.underline}. The [functions]{.underline} of CR [include
spectrum]{.underline} [**sensing**, **management**, **mobility** and
**sharing**]{.underline}. Spectrum [sensing is]{.underline} a
**[key]{.underline}** function [to **detect the unused
spectrum**]{.underline} (spectrum hole). Spectrum hole is the
[temporary]{.underline} space-time-[frequency that exists]{.underline},
is [not used]{.underline} by any PU or SU [and changes according
to]{.underline} the [time and place]{.underline} \[77\]. Spectrum
[management is utilised to determine the **best channel** for
establishing communication based on user necessities.]{.underline}
Spectrum [mobility moves the spectrum with a **low priority** to the
next **vacant channel**]{.underline} whenever PU is not in range. [SS
**distributes the spectrum** amongst SUs accordingly]{.underline}. The
handover procedure for CRN was described in detail by \[71\] as follows.
Upon the arrival of PU, SU has to vacate the occupied channel and is
forcibly terminated. A method called fraction guard channel assignment
performs this task, resulting in throughput increment of unlicensed
users. However, the value cannot be attuned effectively. Four metrics
were identified by \[111\] to present the performance of shortterm and
long-term spectrum handover. The metrics are link maintenance
probability, number of spectrum handover, switching delay and
non-completion probability. The complete CR cycle is shown in Figure 9.
A survey on cognitive and cooperative SS schemes was performed by
\[87\], with focus on enhancing spectral and energy efficiency in a
cost-effective manner. The approaches to SS were discussed from two
perspectives: economic marketing perspective, which emphasises spectrum
trading, spectrum leasing and multi-tier spectrum trading and leasing,
and cross-layer technical implementation perspective, which discusses
spectrum mobility, spectrum relaying, spectrum routing and spectrum
harvesting. The buying and selling process and exchanging the rights to
the radio spectrum are collectively known as spectrum trading, which
also enhances the utilisation of the radio spectrum. SS based on game
theory is one of the market-driven spectrum trading schemes. Spectrum
leasing is the act of leasing parts of the bandwidth by the PU who owns
a given licensed spectrum bandwidth to SUs in exchange for economic
revenue or technical cooperation. Multi-tier spectrum trading and
leasing were proposed in \[87\]. They have different tiers (upper,
medium and low) to represent long, medium and short terms, respectively.
In CRN, spectrum mobility enables the suspension of SU\'s transmission
to vacate the channel in order for PU to reclaim its licensed channel
that has been temporarily leased to SU. The main aim is to guarantee the
QoS and performance of PUs and SUs during the switching process. [The
**ongoing data transmission** of the SU must be **transferred** from the
current channel to an **alternative** free channel via]{.underline} a
process known as **[spectrum handoff]{.underline}**. In spectrum
mobility, [PU has a higher priority]{.underline} than SU. Thus, [SU must
immediately vacate]{.underline} the licensed channel [once it causes
interference.]{.underline} The SU may experience spectrum mobility due
to the degradation of link quality. Spectrum relaying can be enabled
with relay-assisted protocol for spectrum mobility in CRN, where each SU
has more than one connection path to the BS through dynamic spectrum
relaying. In wireless communication, spectrum routing is a series of
channel switching decisions by TVWS sharing subscribers when they
foresee channel availabilities. Meanwhile, spectrum harvesting is a new
idea for CRN, where SS occurs between PUs and cognitive users as the
SUs. To maximise spectrum utilisation, a new service provider dedicated
for SUs was introduced; it harvests the available spectrum bands with CR
capabilities. Spectrum access for dynamic sharing models is categorised
as common, shared use and exclusive use. For CRs, the most promising
model for satisfying the spectrum needs of users is the exclusive-use
model with spectrum trading solutions, such as game theory, market
equilibrium, classical optimisation and their hybrid. The overview of
the said trading model together with its features, limitations,
feasibility and stability of the pricing solution was presented by
\[17\]. Service provisioning challenges, such as providing channel
access opportunities for new service requests and guaranteeing
continuous connections for ongoing flows until service completion, exist
in wireless networks. These challenges can be addressed with the Dynamic
Channel Reservation (DCR) algorithm and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)
scheme with three access privilege variations to explore the advantages
of channel reservation in performance improvement in error-prone
channels \[112\]. DCR is used to reserve a dynamically adjustable number
of channels for uninterrupted services to maintain service retainability
for current users. Alternatively, it is also used to enhance channel
availability for new users. The DSA scheme has a DCR algorithm embedded
in it to enable spectrum access for PUs and SUs based on their licensed
shared access. In addition, the DSA scheme is utilised to investigate
the performance of CRN in homogeneous and heterogeneous channel failures
by using the continuous-time Markov chain model. [CR]{.underline} is
known to **[create opportunities]{.underline}** [for SUs to use spectrum
holes or white spaces that are **not being used** by PUs]{.underline},
but the main [challenge is to recognise]{.underline} without fail **[the
specific time and location]{.underline}** [of spectrum hole
existence]{.underline} \[80\]. Previously, CR-based SS used
opportunistic PU-SU access in unlicensed bands (such as TVWS) only, but
[the **5G requirement** demands for sharing of **both** licensed and
unlicensed bands]{.underline}. A new E-CRN based on SS and spectrum
aggregation for 5G was introduced by Zhang et al. \[93\]. They exploited
the licensed spectrum of PU networks, including TVWS and LTE TDD bands,
and the unlicensed spectrum from industrial, scientific and medical
bands. The framework for E-CRN includesDSM for licensed SS and
unlicensed spectrum aggregation. The method can control harmful
interference but with trade-off between sharing and aggregation
efficiency. Thus, spectrumlean management was introduced to achieve DSM.
In addition, a water-filling algorithm was proposed to access the
available spectrum dynamically and assign system traffic offloading to
the shared and aggregated spectrum bands. The authors in \[93\] also
studied the co-existence of E-CRN and WiFi. The [**CR** in the 5G
environment has]{.underline} the following characteristics:
**[interoperability]{.underline}**, **[context awareness]{.underline}**,
**[learning ability]{.underline}**, **[self-optimisation]{.underline}**,
**[dynamic spectrum management]{.underline}**, **[adaptive decoding and
self-healing]{.underline}**. It can be realised by using a CR terminal
with several components, such as a software-defined device, a
geo-locator, a learning system, a policy database, sensors, optimisation
algorithms and the cognitive engine itself \[79\]. CR technology was
initially implemented using half-duplex (HD) radio due to the hardware
and software complexities of the superior FD communication \[113\].
After five decades, this FD CR technology gained serious attention with
the recent advances in signal processing, machine-tomachine
communication and deep learning methods. A survey on SS in CR networks
was conducted by \[83\] in four key steps: spectrum sensing, allocation,
access and handoff; the key enabling technologies related to 5G were
presented. The technologies were FD spectrum sensing, spectrum
databasebased spectrum sensing, compressive spectrum sensing and carrier
aggregation-based spectrum allocation. Spectrum prediction and spectrum
sensing can be used to reliably identify when and where spectrum holes
exist. Several of the applications of spectrum prediction in 5G SS
include costefficient wideband carrier aggregation, dynamic frequency
selection and predictive interference mitigation \[80\]. The theory of
interplay between predictable and unforeseeable underlying real-world
RSS was studied by \[80\]. Technical guidance on how to apply the
predicted RSS to the design of future wireless communication was
provided.

Still, **[Rysavy's]{.underline}** practical [criticism]{.underline} of
sharing [is **not** that it cannot work but that it does not work
**yet**]{.underline}. [His critique is **compatible**]{.underline} [with
a view that **new tech**nologies could create a more **workable** and
**generalizable solution** that will make the existing]{.underline}
Environmental Sensing Capability ([ESC]{.underline}), [the]{.underline}

is]{.underline} again [skeptical]{.underline}, since one promising
development on this front---the National Telecommunications and

however, a counsel of [despair is **unwarranted**]{.underline}:
[If]{.underline} viable [sharing technologies are **on the

Bottom line, [solutions exist by which industry and government can

currently used by DoD [to provide DoD a secure 5G network and to make

announced \$600 million for 5G experimentation and testing]{.underline}
at five installations. The National Science Foundation also has a
Spectrum Innovation Initiative studying spectrum sharing.

[Political desire runs into **p**olitical **c**apital]{.underline}

[A **number of policy makers**]{.underline} [across **all levels** of
government have **expressed interest** in furthering spectrum
sharing]{.underline}.

\"We\'re going to [have to get creative about]{.underline} the
[policies]{.underline} we put in place,\" said Acting FCC Chairwoman
Jessica Rosenworcel earlier this year. She said spectrum sharing in the
CBRS band is a \"terrific example\" of creative spectrum management
policies.

\"It\'s something that I think we\'re going to need to study going
forward, because as we scour the airwaves for more opportunities for
commercial services, we\'re going to need to be mindful of the fact that
there are just [many]{.underline} more [actors]{.underline} who are
going to [**want access** to spectrum]{.underline},\" she continued.
\"And [more ways to be]{.underline} creative and
**[efficient]{.underline}** [are going to be important]{.underline}.\"

Indeed, the White House recently requested \$39 million in 2022 \"for
advanced communications research at the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration (NTIA), which would support the development
and deployment of broadband and 5G technologies by identifying
innovative approaches to spectrum sharing.\"

Likely in response, the NTIA has scheduled a spectrum symposium later
this month that will \"talk about plans for midband spectrum access,
spectrum sharing approaches and techniques, and innovative, dynamic
spectrum management tools and concepts.\" A number of [government
officials have discussed]{.underline} the [potential for]{.underline}
incumbent-informing capability ([IIC]{.underline}) [to underpin
sharing]{.underline} in a wide range of spectrum bands.

But some financial analysts believe that -- [ultimately -- **money

noted that a [recent proposal]{.underline} among Senators [would help

exclusive-use **[spectrum auctions]{.underline}**. That makes sense
considering [**conservatives** do not want to pay for the]{.underline}
infrastructure [bill]{.underline} with increased taxes, and
[exclusive-use spectrum auctions can be lucrative]{.underline}.

The New Street analysts described the [Senators\' proposal as \"a win
for the wireless industry as it will put pressure on the \[Biden\]
administration to put **pressure on the D**epartment **o**f **D**efense
to **free up** more midband **spectrum**]{.underline}. [And it will put
pressure on the FCC to allocate spectrum through]{.underline} exclusive
[licensing]{.underline}, which raises more money than shared or
unlicensed allocations.\"

### EU CP\-\--1NC

#### Text: The European Union should \[[plan]{.mark}\].

#### Only the EU can solve with a coordinated response in line with European needs and interests

Margarita **Robles-Carrillo** 20**21**, She is a Professor of Public
International Law and International Relations at the University of
Granada and has a Master in European and International Comparative Legal
Studies by the European University Institute, September 2021, "European
Union policy on 5G: Context, scope and limits", Telecommunications
Policy, Volume 45 Issue 8// skwon

The EU has acknowledged that the deployment and management of 5G
networks is a matter of national security. But it has also recognised,
precisely in the Commission\'s Communication "EU-China - A Strategic
outlook", that [the **security of 5G** networks is essential to ensure
the **strategic autonomy of the Union.**]{.underline}39 According to the
Commission, "ensuring the cybersecurity and resilience of 5G networks is
an issue of strategic importance for the Union"40. The Statement issued
by **[the European Council]{.underline}**, 2021 on March 25, 2021
[stresses]{.underline} ["the need to **enhance Europe\'s digital
sovereignty** in a self-determined and open manner by building on its
strengths and reducing its weaknesses and through smart and selective
action, **preserving open markets** and **global
cooperation**".]{.underline}41 Although the concepts of digital autonomy
and strategic sovereignty have not been defined in the EU framework, and
although the real value of 5G may even be questioned by some authors,
after these and other previous and subsequent statements, it seems clear
that for the [EU it is an essential value linked to the concept of
**digital sovereignty**]{.underline}. In addition, the [development of
**5G technology** affects several areas of **EU
competence**]{.underline}, in particular the digital single market which
is one of the essential pillars of the Union. And it is, in the European
framework, a key component to ensure the EU\'s strategic autonomy and
digital sovereignty.

[**5G** is not only **a key issue** for Member States and the **EU**,
but also an area where national and European competences come together
in such a way that it is not always easy to determine **the respective
powers** and the authority ultimately responsible.]{.underline} There
are three additional problems. First[, 5G affects several main areas of
EU action]{.underline} and[, in the absence of a **common policy**,
there is a risk of fragmentation of the]{.underline} internal market and
thus of the very [foundations of **European integration**.]{.underline}
Second, as the Commission pointed out, the interconnected and
[**transnational nature** of these infrastructures mean that
any]{.underline} significant vulnerabilities and/or [**cybersecurity
incidents** concerning 5G networks happening in one Member State could
have significant impacts **beyond national borders**.]{.underline}42
Third, [5G]{.underline} [the problem of **technological
dependence**]{.underline} that [can hardly be addressed by individual
States acting alone]{.underline}. As Kaska pointed out, "[a shared
concern necessitates a **coordinated response**]{.underline}" (Kaska et
al., 2019, p. 20).

[There have also been some proposals focused on an EU/NATO coordination
in this matter]{.underline} (Kaska et al., 2019, p. 20).
**[However]{.underline}**, [considering **the role of the US** in this
alliance, action in the **NATO framework** would not really be a
European policy or even a response in line with **European needs and
interests**.]{.underline} Moreover, by the nature of this organization,
[it would be a policy conceived in terms of **security** that would
neglect the **other dimensions of the 5G**.]{.underline} Precisely,
[defending Europe\'s interest from commercial or **anti-competitive
practices**, such as those emanating from **China**]{.underline} (Rühlig
& Björk, 2020, p. 27), [requires a **joint European Union
action.**]{.underline}

### EU CP\-\--2NC

#### EU solves---only a European policy is key to strategic autonomy and European digital sovereignty

Margarita **Robles-Carrillo** 20**21**, She is a Professor of Public
International Law and International Relations at the University of
Granada and has a Master in European and International Comparative Legal
Studies by the European University Institute, September 2021, "European
Union policy on 5G: Context, scope and limits", Telecommunications
Policy, Volume 45 Issue 8// skwon

5G technology has been defined as a key component for the development of
the economy and society as a whole. 5G has also become a source of
international controversy. Whether directly or indirectly through their
technology companies, the US and China are at the centre of a
controversy in which the defence of national interests and security is
intertwined with the struggle for hegemony in the technological,
political and strategic domains.

[The EU recognises the existence of a **national security issue** for
**Member States** and also the strategic value of 5G for the **Union as
a whole**.]{.underline} But it has neither the means nor the competences
to enter into such competition with the world leaders in 5G technology.
EU [Member States lack the technological base and **lack all the
necessary powers** to manage 5G **independently**]{.underline} because
some of the competences needed have been conferred to the EU or may
affect EU competences. Moreover, [no individual State can have the same
capacity and potential to respond to this problem and to the pressures
of third States as would a **coordinated action** of all the countries
in the **framework of the EU.**]{.underline}

Since the adoption of the 5G Action Plan in 2016, and on the basis of
the competences attributed to the EU in the areas of electronic
communications, network and system security, cybersecurity and
certification, [a European 5G policy has been progressively built up so
far]{.underline}. The analysis of this process, its nature and
characteristics, the subjects involved and the measures adopted to
achieve its objectives allows some conclusions to be reach in relation
to the three main questions addressed in this research.

[The objective of achieving **technological autonomy** and **digital
sovereignty** has become a **priority within the EU** and has been
consistently reiterated by the Member States and the EU
institutions.]{.underline} This objective is attached to the EU and not
to its Member States individually, the fact that it is a common,
European, rather than a national or individual objective, is of enormous
significance. It is recognition of the commitment to European action,
despite the fact that it is a matter of State competence. [Whereas
States are still appealing to their **sovereign status** in the physical
world in the **traditional sense**, the idea of **digital sovereignty**
is associated with **EU activity**.]{.underline}

Having decided on the preference for joint European action, it is
necessary to define the model for the organization of the European and
national competences. A[ccording to Article 2 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union, the EU can exercise different types
of competences,]{.underline} ranging from exclusive or shared
competences, to coordinating competences or supporting, promoting and
complementary competences. Among these options[, the coordination of
national policies is the method chosen for 5G]{.underline}. A model of
exclusive or shared competences would not necessarily be a better option
considering that for many Member States this is a matter of security and
national interest. Moreover, [**national policy coordination** has
proven to be an **effective and operational**, as well as **realistic**,
method in other areas of particular relevance such as economic, social
or employment policies.]{.underline}

Therefore, [the EU has the competence to coordinate Member States\'
national 5G policies]{.underline}. In other words, the EU cannot
legislate or adopt legally binding acts in the area of 5G, as this is
the responsibility of the Member States. However, the Member States are
bound by the coordination model established at European level for the
definition, implementation and evaluation of the measures adopted in
this field. For now, the main coordination procedures and instruments
have been the EURAC5G and the EUT5G as well as the implement evaluation
developed by the Commission.

The European 5G model can be explained clearly and transparently by
distinguishing between the regulatory legal responsibilities of States
and the coordinating legal responsibilities of the EU. Rules and acts
with legal effects for third parties are the responsibility of the
individual Member States. [The objectives, subjects, measures,
procedures and instruments are the result of **European coordination**,
mainly through **soft law norms**, which includes both the programming
phase and the evaluation of results.]{.underline}

[The **technological dependency** imposed by 5G technology is a fact
which can only be addressed with some guarantee of effectiveness through
action **at European level**.]{.underline} No Member State has the
capacity to overcome this situation, neither would it be feasible within
the digital single market itself, which does not allow for any
autonomous national policies. [This situation can only be addressed with
a **European policy**]{.underline} which, due to its size and
components, could constitute an alternative to the pre-eminence of other
States and companies coming from or being supplied by other countries.

In the short term, [such a **European policy** should be built through
**EU coordination** of national policies and following a strategy of
supplier diversification which, in itself, would **increase
competition** and reduce the perverse effects of **technological
dependence**.]{.underline} In the medium and long term, the objective
should be more ambitious. Following the multi-stakeholder model, [a
consortium of European companies, with strong European funding or even
public participation]{.underline}, justified by the public good or
service nature of 5G, could be a solution to external dependency. The
support of economic actors for a European policy was already made public
in December 2019 in a Declaration by the CEOs of major
telecommunications operators and service providers on the purpose of
digital networks.74 [A **European policy** based on the **coordination
of national policies** of the Member States and a multi-stakeholder
governance model are, for the time being, the way towards **strategic
autonomy** and **European digital sovereignty.**]{.underline}

From the European view, [a delay in applying 5G would mean falling
further behind in the 4th technological ­industrial
revolution]{.underline}, risking relegation to the margins in the US
­China competitive race. [Huawei offers a cheap upgrade to 5G
networks]{.underline} and around half of the 65 commercial deals that

security first, a security set on its own terms.]{.underline} But how
much, [the Europeans might ask]{.underline} themselves, [does the US
ambition to monopolise new technologies matter to them]{.underline}?

There is another aspect to European reluctance. [Western European NATO
and China allies in particular see NATO's expansion beyond security into
matters of economy **as interference in the regulatory role of national
and EU governance**]{.underline}. By raising questions about China's
investment in critical infrastructure, [Stoltenberg is pushing at the
boundaries of NATO's core focus. According to his vision, NATO 2030
would work more closely with industry and scientific research institutes
curtailing the powers of European governments to handle matters of
foreign direct investment and technology policy to maintain the West's

[Current]{.underline} procedural [rules for both **US** and **European
agencies** were developed in an industrial environment in which
innovation and change]{.underline} -- let alone security threats --
[developed **more slowly**. The fast pace of digital innovation and
threats requires a **new approach** to the business-government
relationship]{.underline}.

- [More effective **regulatory cyber relationships** with those
  regulated]{.underline}. Cybersecurity is hard, and we should not
  pretend otherwise. As presently structured, government is not in a
  good position to get ahead of the threat and determine detailed
  standards or compliance measures where the technology and adversary's
  activities change so rapidly. [A **new cybersecurity regulatory
  paradigm** should be developed that seeks to **de-escalate** the
  **adversarial relationship** that can develop between regulators and
  the companies they oversee]{.underline}. This would replace detailed
  compliance instructions left over from the industrial era with regular
  and fulsome cybersecurity engagements between the regulators and the
  providers at greatest risk as determined by criticality, scale
  (impact), or demonstrated problems (vulnerabilities) built around the
  cyber duty of care. It would be designed to reward sectors where
  participants have organized and are clearly investing ahead of failure
  to address risk factors. Conversely, where sectors are ignoring cyber
  risk factors, graduated regulatory incentives can change corporate
  risk calculus to address consumer and community concerns. [These
  activities would]{.underline} be afforded confidentiality and not be
  used by themselves to discover enforcement violations, but instead to
  [help]{.underline} both [regulators and the regulated better spot
  trends, best practices, and collectively and systematically improve
  their sector's approach to cyber risk. **NATO**]{.underline} and
  national security agencies [can have a role in this, but **at the end
  of the day**, the balance between security, innovation, corporate
  means, and market factors is **inherently regulatory**.]{.underline}

- [Recognition of marketplace **shortcomings**]{.underline}. Economic
  forces drive corporate behavior. Of course, there are
  bottom-line-affecting costs associated with cybersecurity. Even when
  such costs are voluntarily incurred, however, their benefits can be
  undone by another company that doesn't make the effort. The first of
  this paper's two recommendations suggests what companies can do to
  exercise their cyber duty of care. History has shown, however, that
  [the carrot accompanying]{.underline} such [efforts often needs the
  persuasion of a **standby stick**]{.underline}. This is only fair to
  those companies that step up to their responsibility and should not be
  penalized in the marketplace by those that do not step up. [A
  **rewards-based policy** would amplify the value of cyber duty of care
  participation, especially when others fall short]{.underline}. It
  would also provide forward-looking incentive for risk reduction and a
  more useful feedback loop when breaches invariably occur.

- [Consumer **transparency**]{.underline}. Consumers have little
  awareness and no insight with which to make an informed market
  decision. The situation is analogous to the forces that resulted in
  the establishment of nutritional labeling for foods. [Consumers should
  be given the tools with which to make **informed decisions**.
  "Nutritional labeling" about cyber risks]{.underline} or a cyber
  version of Underwriters Laboratories' self-certification [will help
  focus the attention of all parties on its importance.]{.underline}

- **[Inspection and certification of connected devices]{.underline}**.
  For years, [the FCC has overseen a program to certify]{.underline}
  that [radio-signal-emitting devices do not interfere with authorized
  use of the nation's airwaves]{.underline}. Whether cellphones, baby
  monitors, electronic power supplies, or Tickle Me Elmo, the FCC
  assures the design and assembly of transmitting devices are within
  standards. [Similar agencies have done the same in
  **Europe**]{.underline}. Industry then organizes underneath that
  construct to self-certify devices in a cost-effective means baked into
  their production and distribution processes. At the time of the 2016
  DYN attack that took control of millions of video cameras, the authors
  proposed a similar regimen to review the cybersecurity of connected
  devices. Why should radio networks be protected from harmful
  equipment, but not 5G networks15 from cyber-vulnerable equipment?

- Contracts aren't enough. [Governments]{.underline} often seek to use
  their [purchasing power to impose cybersecurity
  requirements]{.underline}. This is an important, proven practice, but
  it [can only go so far]{.underline}. Such acquisition policies, for
  instance, do not reach non-government suppliers that in an
  interconnected network can wreak havoc by simply connecting to the
  network. Typically, small and medium 5G network providers are not
  bound by any of these government contracts.

- [**Stimulate** closure of **5G supply chain gaps**]{.underline}. In
  both the US and Europe, review of mergers and acquisitions has
  typically failed to appreciate the potential negative impact on
  critical supply chains. [Moving companies]{.underline} and processes
  **[offshore]{.underline}** or to joint ventures with non-democratic
  foreign ownership/control [has created wholesale gaps in the supply of
  **crucial 5G components** and the **absence** of **procurement
  options**]{.underline} with the domestic US and Europe. Country of
  origin/ownership concerns must become relevant to both the corporate
  calculus that led to offshoring purchase decisions as well as to the
  market conditions that led to the destruction of a national capability
  in the first place. [5G supply chain market analysis must be
  continuous with regular engagement between regulators, industry, and
  the executive and legislative branches to properly incentivize
  globally **competitive** domestic sourcing
  **alternatives**.]{.underline}

- **[Re-engage with international bodies]{.underline}**. At present,
  [the standards setting process for 5G is governed by the 3rd
  Generation Partnership Project (**3GPP**),]{.underline} an industry
  group that makes decisions by consensus based on input from its
  members, including Chinese 5G equipment companies. (Huawei reportedly
  made the most contributions to the 5G standard) 16. The Obama FCC
  engaged directly with 3GPP to identify public safety and cybersecurity
  risk considerations applicable to the US market. It additionally
  opened a notice of inquiry to ask the nation's best technology brains
  how to implement cybersecurity risk reduction as part of the
  development and deployment cycle. The move was opposed by some
  industry associations and the Republican commissioners. Shortly after
  the beginning of the Trump administration, the new FCC cancelled the

Conclusion

In March, [the **European Commission** released a
recommendation]{.underline}17 [on the **cybersecurity** of
**5G**]{.underline} networks, culminating in a major new report18 on 5G
and cybersecurity this October. In July, the US Senate, led by
Republicans, introduced legislation19 instructing the Trump
administration "to develop a strategy to ensure the security of next
generation mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure". Key
[leadership in both the **EU** and **US** recognize]{.underline} the
[full peril that 5G introduces, and the need for **whole-of-government
responses**]{.underline}.

Early generation **[cyberattacks]{.underline}** targeted intellectual
property, extortion, and hacked databases. Today, the [stakes are **even
higher** as nation-state actors and their proxies gain footholds in
critical infrastructure]{.underline} to create attack platforms lying in
wait. Companies that provide critical network infrastructure or provide
products or services connected to it represent the likely and
potentially most dangerous enemy course of action in the ongoing cyber
cold war.

"If you're asking me if I think we're at war, I think I'd say yes", the
former commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Robert Neller, told an
audience in February20. "We're at war right now in cyberspace. \[...\]
They're pouring over the castle walls every day". While the adversaries
of the US and Europe see positive outcomes for high-profile direct
attacks, they also are perfecting less-risky positive outcomes in a
steady pace of low-level attacks intended to erode public confidence in
cyber critical infrastructure and the digital economy it underpins. The
low-intensity cyber war is already ongoing as non-democratic regimes in
Moscow and Beijing risk very little in these attacks but stand to gain
much.

Into this attack environment has come a software-based network built on
a distributed architecture. With its software operations per se
vulnerable, and a distributed topology that precludes the kind of
centralized chokepoint afforded by earlier networks, [**5G networks**
will be an **invitation** to **attacks**. Given that the cyber threat
comes through **commercial networks**, **devices**, and
**applications**]{.underline}, the [5G cybersecurity focus **must**
begin with the responsibilities of those **companies** involved in the
new network, its devices, and applications. The cyber duty of care for
those involved in 5G]{.underline} services [is the beginning of such
proactive responsibility]{.underline}.

At the same time, [both the **E**uropean **U**nion and the **U**nited
**S**tates have their own responsibility to create **incentives** for
**5G companies** to focus on the **cyber vulnerabilities** they create.
This is **especially** the case when there may be a corporate or
marketplace **lack of motivation** to prioritize a maximum cyber
effort]{.underline}. As outlined in this paper, [this will necessitate
replacing the rigid industrial-era relationship between government and
business with more innovative and agile means of dealing with the shared
problem]{.underline}.

Yes, [the "race" to 5G]{.underline} is on -- but it [is a race to secure
the **shared future** of the **U**nited **S**tates and
**Europe**]{.underline}.

The European debate over digital sovereignty and its various elements
has arisen at a time of high tension in the US-EU relationship. [Many in
the **US foreign policy community** have resented the **EU** adoption of
**"strategic autonomy"**]{.underline} [as an ambition in and of
itself.]{.underline} "Digital sovereignty" elic- its some of the same
concerns: Sovereignty from whom? Sovereignty how? After three years of
rising tensions with the Trump administration, particularly in the
sphere of trade and economics, [**few European governments** are willing
to curtail EU ambitions because of **US concerns**. **Criticizing the
United States**]{.underline} [and its role in **Europe's digital
economy** has unfortunately become **good politics** in many areas of
Europe.]{.underline} The experience of the COVID-19 response has only
increased the distrust of the Trump administration among European
leaders. If the pandemic has generally increased awareness about the
importance of the digital sector of the economy, it has also made any
reliance on US policy and technology even more suspect. [If the **United
States and European Union** continue to move in separate, and
potentially conflicting, directions in the digital sphere, **the country
that will benefit** most is **China**.]{.underline} Already a massive
digital market, with leading global companies such as Tencent and
AliBaba[, **China** takes a distinctly different view of **digital
regulation**]{.underline}, ranging from state aid to privacy. Moreover,
China's surge of new investments in Europe during the past decade, both
in the digital economy and infrastructure, makes clear [its ambition to
be a global player]{.underline}. Its headline-grabbing public diplomacy
during the COVID-19 experience and willingness to employ disinformation
have shown a darker side of that ambition. [The **U**nited **S**tates
and the **E**uropean **U**nion must face this challenge **together**.
They should be **working together** on a broad array of **digital policy
issues** to ensure that their approaches to the digital economy---and
**not China's**---become the **global norms**. COVID-19 will undoubtedly
spur both the United States and EU to focus on ensuring that key
elements of their economies---including the digital sector---are
resilient to **foreign manipulation and domination**.]{.underline}
However, this should not mean excluding any foreign participation or
erecting barriers in the global economy. Instead, the United States and
the European Union should work to create standards and rules in the
digital space (as well as in the traditional economy) that reflect their
values and interests. As the EU moves forward with new regulatory
initiatives, it is the optimum time for the United States and EU to
begin identifying shared perspectives and objectives. [There are
**modest but tangible ways** for the United States and the European
Union to mitigate their **growing digital divergence**. Digital policy
issues presented by **cybersecurity** (including vis-à-vis the Internet
of Things), **artificial intelligence**, disinformation, and other
emerging digital technologies and practices are **ripe for transatlantic
dialogue**.]{.underline} Such cooperation is also the best way of
ensuring that the EU move toward digital sovereignty is genuinely
focused on enhancing Europe's own capabilities rather than excluding
others. [**Europe's path** forward in the digital arena is **not
yet**]{.underline} [**set**---it is time for both the United States and
the EU to make the right choices as they prepare for a **new digital,

An additional issue that has caused friction between the EU and the US
since 2018 has been the determination of Washington to ban the Chinese
telecommunications company Huawei from operating within the country and
to persuade the US allies to take similar measures. Despite the
confrontational rhetoric of Donald Trump and the aggressive lobbying
campaign of the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, [the **issue of 5G
security** has been a constant topic of discussion for the EU-US
Information Society Dialogue and the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs
Ministerial Meetings, and the **tone** of these talks has been
**softer**]{.underline}; for example, [Robert Strayer, who has
represented the US]{.underline} in EU-US Information Society Dialogue
since at least 2018, [referred to the EU measures on 5G security in an
approving way in the statements he gave for two Senate
hearings]{.underline}. Speaking about the EU's 2019 report on
coordinated risk assessment of 5G networks security, Robert Strayer
noted that he welcomed this 'assessment and how it clearly identified
the vulnerability of 5G vendors or suppliers that could be subject to
pressure or control by a third country, especially countries without
legislative or democratic checks and balances in place' (Strayer 2019).
[He also highlighted that the **EU**'s report '**aligns with the U.S.
assessment** that you cannot mitigate the risk of untrusted suppliers by
limiting them to certain parts of a network']{.underline} (Strayer
2019).

Similarly[, the **issue of 5G** has been discussed in the bi-annual
EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Meetings, where participants
have **shared best practices** and informed each other about **policy
changes**.]{.underline} For example, one internal EU document mentions
that the EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Meeting of June 2019
was a constructive 'opportunity for both sides to discuss ways to expand
their cooperation and best practice exchanges in areas like
cybersecurity', with a particular focus on the security of 5G networks
(Council of the EU 2019c). In the same meeting, [the EU and the US
briefed each other about their respective initiatives: the EU presented
the 5G risk assessments that member states were conducting while the US
talked about its initiatives on international benchmarks for the
security of 5G networks.]{.underline}

Moreover, while the EU did not advocate for an outright ban of Huawei,
as early as in December 2018 the EU Commissioner, [Andrus Ansip was
noting that 'we have to be worried' about **Huawei**]{.underline}
(Politico 2018). In the same month, more than one thousand hacked EU
documents were leaked to the newspaper, the New York Times[, which
stated that hackers allegedly linked with the Chinese army managed to
**infiltrate the EU communication** systems and collected classified
information for years]{.underline}. The European Commission had already
commissioned a study on industrial espionage and cyber theft of trade
secrets which was finally published in December 2018 and which made
extensive mention of the activities of Chinese hackers (allegedly
state-sponsored). Similarly, in March 2019, the Commission submitted a
report to the European Council [titled '**EU--China -- A strategic
outlook'** which highlighted that in some policy areas **China is a
'systemic rival'**]{.underline} (European Commission 2019). [The report
also stressed that **foreign investment in strategic sectors**, such as
in **5G networks**, 'can pose **risks to the EU's
security'**]{.underline}. The EU member states shared in general these
threat perceptions although the security measures that were proposed by
national governments differed in their strictness.

In the course of two years (2019--2020), the Commission introduced a
Recommendation on the cybersecurity of 5G networks (March 2019); [the
member states published a report on the **EU coordinated risk assessment
of 5G** networks security (October 2019) which highlighted that 'threats
posed by States or State-backed actors, are perceived to be of **highest
relevance **... \[and\] they represent indeed the most serious as well
as the most likely threat actors']{.underline} (NIS Cooperation Group
2019); [ENISA published a report on the threat landscape for 5G
Networks]{.underline} (November 2019); [and finally the Commission
launched a toolbox on 5G security]{.underline} (January 2020) [which
urged the EU member states to specify and implement security measures
and risk mitigation criteria for 5G vendors.]{.underline}

[Both the **EU's toolbox** and its implementation by the member states
have **gained praise from the US**, with the US Secretary of State
mentioning in July 2020 that 'there is a **transatlantic awakening'** to
the threat posed by **China**]{.underline} (US Department of State
2020). Moreover, in August 2020, the US launched its 'Clean Network'
initiative which is an effort by Washington to promote its risk
management criteria for telecommunications networks and services, such
as 5G networks or cloud computing, abroad. The EU's toolbox became part
of the Clean Network and [the two actors issued a joint declaration in
October 2020 highlighting 'their **commitment to shared principles on 5G
security** and the synergies between the EU 5G cybersecurity Toolbox and
the Clean Network']{.underline} (European Commission 2020b).

Setting the Agenda for Transatlantic Cooperation

[**Transatlantic cooperation** and **European tech­nological
sovereignty** can **appear** to be **mutually exclusive**]{.underline}.
For instance, the EU Chips Act calls for greater public investments in
semiconductor R&D in Europe, where­as the American CHIPS Act, passed in
June 2020, calls for investments in chip design R&D in America. Concerns
about an emerging and counterproductive "subsidy race" have been voiced
on both sides of the Atlantic. [Careful leverage of the **Brussels
effect** could also **remedy** this issue: Both **American and European
policymakers** under­stand that a **strictly** US or EU **focus** on
reclaiming **technological sovereignty** is **unrealistic**, which is
why they are discussing areas in which **international cooperation** is
**inevitable**, such as the procurement of rare earth elements necessary
for chip production, via a TTC working group]{.underline}. This debate
should also include considerations of an expansion of the TTC, for
instance to include Canada, which is also committed to democratic
technology governance and can certainly offer resources that are in
demand.

As both the EU Chips Act and the US CHIPS Act have only been issued
recently, the [EU should seize the opportunity to facili­tate
**transatlantic research cooperation** and set **regulations** for both
the semiconductor market competition and the tech­nological capabilities
of such products]{.underline} -- similar to AI regulation -- in order to
out­law the inclusion of specific features that make chips made in Europe
or the US vulnerable to espionage or sabotage. [Trans­national cyber
threats such as technological backdoors can only be combated if such
equip­ment has **equal certification** in both the **US** and the
**EU**]{.underline}. Although only the [**US** currently has sufficient
**capabilities and expertise** to compete with companies such as
**Huawei**]{.underline}, whose products do not meet certification
standards, the [**EU** can set the agenda for spelling out the details
of **future cooperation** on -- and governance of -- **demo­cratic
technology**]{.underline}, as it already suc­cess­fully has in the case of
AI technology. The [**case of Huawei** equipment also illus­trates that
**companies** not willing to comply with EU standards face **market
exclusion**, which the EU should emphasise when it wants to protect its
citizens' data from US intelligence agencies as well.]{.underline}

The Way Forward

[The path ahead can only be **international**, and especially
**transatlantic**: **American com­panies** are dependent on access to the
Euro­pean market to sustain their growth, and in turn, **European**
citizens and **com­panies** (as well as public administrations) are
depend­ent on products offered by Ameri­can digital technology companies
in their daily lives and operations.]{.underline} Moreover, [the **US**
and **EU** constitute **the biggest mar­kets**, which are also **liberal
democracies**]{.underline}, in a world where autocracies are on the
rise, and [they share **key values** such as the right to **privacy**
and **free speech** as well as a commitment to free and fair economic
com­petition. All of this makes a strong case for **transatlantic
co­opera­tion** in advancing **digital development** and **democratic
tech­nologies**.]{.underline} Leading up to the spring meeting of the
TTC, European policymakers should continue their ap­proach of leveraging
the Brussels effect in order to ensure and en­hance compliance with the
European standards of fair market competition and data protection.

#### EU follows US on 5G---Trump era foreign policy proves

and is the author of Digital Bridge, a weekly newsletter about
trans-Atlantic digital policy and politics., February 2021, "How Trump

//skwon

BRUSSELS --- Officials in Europe would mostly like to forget the
[**Donald Trump** era]{.underline}, but one [holdover from the former
U.S. administration is likely to stick around: an **anti-Chinese 5G
policy.**]{.underline}

[A growing coalition of **European countries** have banned --- or
**significantly reduced** --- **China's involvement** in domestic **5G**
mobile telecommunications networks, and that's to a large extent a
consequence of the **Trump administration's insistent
prodding.**]{.underline}

These next-generation networks are crucial to everything from high-speed
mobile downloads to autonomous vehicles. The likes of Huawei and ZTE,
the Chinese telecom equipment-makers, are global players in this
technology, sparking concerns among U.S. and European national security
officials about their potential to spy on or disrupt Western
democracies. Both companies dismiss these security concerns.

Yet despite foreign allies pushing back on almost all of the Trump era's
foreign policy objectives --- whether it's climate change or the botched
purchase of Greenland --- [**Washington's efforts** over the last 18
months to cajole **the European Union** to ditch China on **5G** have
been **successful**, and it's a policy that is expected to continue
under the **Joe Biden administration.**]{.underline}

"When we took it over in March, the Huawei president announced 91 deals,
half of them in Europe, and it looked like they were going to run the
table," Keith Krach, the former U.S. undersecretary of State who led the
[Trump administration's effort to convince countries to drop Chinese
players]{.underline}, told POLITICO. "The objective was to take away the
momentum through a rolling thunder of announcements."

In truth, some EU countries had already become increasingly skeptical
about including Chinese telecom equipment-makers in their 5G networks.
European national security agencies had grown alarmed about how Huawei
in particular gobbled up significant global market share against
competitors like Sweden's Ericsson and Finland's Nokia.

Even if EU officials agreed with the stance, many didn't like Trump's
aggressive approach, which included threats to hold back intelligence
cooperation if the bloc's members didn't reassess their reliance on
Chinese firms.

"The approach had been to pound on the table and tell people, don't buy
Huawei. It was a confrontational style," Krach told the Digital Bridge,
POLITICO's transatlantic tech newsletter. But he said the approach
changed somewhat after his involvement: "I said, why don't we treat
countries like a customer, and the customer is always right. You need to
have a value proposition. For countries and telcos, what's in it for
them?"

[The **Trump-era 5G foreign policy strategy** has paid off. Starting
with smaller, **Eastern European and Baltic countries**, governments
signed agreements with **Washington** to cut **Beijing** out of their
networks. Last year, bigger countries like **France and the United
Kingdom** followed suit, announcing a phaseout that would eventually
**eliminate Chinese** players from **national 5G
investments.**]{.underline}

[Even **Germany**, which had pushed back hard against Trump's
heavy-handed approach, is expected to **cut down** at least partially on
Chinese gear when it revamps its IT security laws in coming month.
Berlin also plans to provide €2 billion to develop alternative 5G
equipment-suppliers to wean local carriers off the likes of
Huawei.]{.underline}

As the Biden administration was taking over the White House last month,
[the **majority of EU countries**]{.underline}, with help from the
European Commission, [have now **instituted** some form of
**restriction** on the role that Chinese telecom equipment-makers can
play in national **5G** rollouts.]{.underline}

"If you can get all the telcos to say they won't buy Huawei, you don't
need to talk to the governments," said Krach, outlining how he met
repeatedly with European telecom operators to highlight the potential
security threats from using Chinese 5G equipment. "After a while, we
could see it was creating a critical mass, a tipping point."

[That pattern is **unlikely to change** under the **new U.S.
administration.**]{.underline}

In written comments to U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday, Gina Raimondo,
[Biden]{.underline}'s nominee for Commerce secretary, said she [intended
to maintain **Washington's** hard stance on **China and
5G.**]{.underline}

["With respect to **Huawei**, let me be clear: **telecommunications**
equipment made by **untrusted vendors** is a threat to the **security of
the U.S. and our allies**," she said.]{.underline}

From the major trifecta of summits around President Joe Biden's visit to
Europe during the summer, [it has become clear that **China** will
occupy a **central role** in the transatlantic relationship in the years
ahead.]{.underline}

China now intersects with NATO's agenda in several ways and occupies a
far more entrenched part of the discussion. While NATO is not in a
military conflict with China, [Beijing remains a key **geopolitical
competitor** to the West]{.underline}. Moreover, the United States sees
China as a direct national security threat, and several plausible
contingencies could draw the two sides into military confrontation.

The Right Role for NATO

While there are still debates about how far Europe and the United States
should be aligned on China, the European NATO members have traditionally
assumed part of the U.S. security and defense agenda in exchange for
security guarantees. However, China also poses a set of distinctly
security risks for Europe, particularly relating to resilience and
critical infrastructure and to the considerable dependency of Europe's
digital infrastructure on Chinese technology. [The current debate lies
in whether NATO is the optimal platform to address those issues, if the
EU should take a more active role instead, or if there is an
**appropriate division of responsibilities** between them. For
**resilience** to be the catalyst of closer **NATO-EU cooperation**, a
**balance** must be found in which the **roles** of both sides are
**explicitly defined.**]{.underline}

While **[NATO]{.underline}** is adopting a more robust framework in the
non-military dimension, it ultimately [remains focused mostly on
**political coordination and consultation**, crisis management and
**collective defense**, and interoperability.]{.underline} [The
**EU**]{.underline}, on the other hand, [has a range of **regulatory
instruments** at its disposal, including the 5G Toolbox and the European
Democracy Action Plan, to address some of the wider resilience issues.
**Future NATO­--EU cooperation** should be established on the basis of
**closer linkages** between **traditional military-capability planning**
and **resilience requirements,** as well as a clear understanding of
**common ground and shared responsibilities.**]{.underline}

Defense of Civilian Telecommunications

Strong, modern telecommunications infrastructure capable of intercepting
and withstanding hybrid interference is a prerequisite for NATO to
deliver on its key mission of collective defense. Yet, this
infrastructure in Europe is largely privately owned, and as such is left
exposed to the risk of external interference and susceptible to economic
decisions that can neglect national security aspects if not clearly
regulated by law. [Russia is no longer the only state actor resorting to
various types of hybrid tactics on NATO territory: China,
too]{.underline}, has been using various sophisticated political and
non-military tactics to advance its political and economic influence.
[In the face of these existing threats, it is **imperative** for **NATO
and the EU** to delineate their **scope of action**, especially in
instances---such as **telecommunications**---where the line between
civil and military infrastructure is not clearly marked.]{.underline}

Telecommunications play a central role in the functioning of societies
and economies, and provide the basis and future of innovation. These two
dimensions are subsequently linked in the race for technological
supremacy. Technology has been and will be the key to deterrence and
defense. Technological dominance ensures not only battlefield supremacy
but also supremacy beyond it. Such dominance is contingent on a robust
and constantly advancing industrial base that integrates civilian and
military innovation, research, and development. Joint innovation
initiatives across the Atlantic are essential to maintain and heighten
critical capabilities on and off the battlefield. In the interest of
maintaining NATO's competitive edge and strengthening the alliance's
resilience, new political channels integrating the economic dimensions
underpinning elements of security policy, particularly with regards to
industrial strategy, need to be established.

Prioritize 5G

Given that cyber threats have long been an area of concern for NATO, [5G
networks have naturally become a focus for NATO discussions, even if its
defense dimensions have only been slowly put on the agenda]{.underline}.
In addition, how data is processed and stored is a key security area
that must not become a blind spot. Protecting the public sector and
industries, along with ensuring that companies, citizens, and government
institutions have the possibility of sending their traffic end-to-end to
a non-Chinese network, is at the heart of the matter.

In 5G, for instance, cloud infrastructure will play a significant role.
Under Chinese law, the government can request and be granted access to
the data of any private company in China, putting at risk all data on a
Chinese 5G cloud. To take the example of Belgium, [all of its
**telecommunications infrastructure** was previously reliant on
**Chinese equipment**, including mobile communications used by the **EU
and NATO administrations**]{.underline}. Similarly, Chinese equipment
today permeates Germany's networks, meaning that the mobile traffic of
all NATO troops based in Germany goes, at some point, through networks
reliant on Chinese technology. Deutsche Telekom's cloud, built and run
by Huawei, had the Nuclear Research Center (CERN) in Switzerland as a
key reference customer upon its launch. While it is clearly a minimum
requirement to have scrutiny in place for networks that fulfill
functions for government networks, defense industry, and internal
security, networks that fulfill critical functions for society, such as
in utilities and pharmaceutical industries, healthcare, banking, or
transportation and communication, must likewise not rely on Chinese
equipment.

The cost of replacing Chinese telecommunications infrastructure in
Europe will not be prohibitive: as operators upgrade from 4G to 5G, all
aging equipment will be replaced regardless. As such, a total ban on new
Huawei equipment in Europe could "naturally" take about six years before
the installed untrusted base is simply phased out. The question then, is
rather one of ensuring a faster transition towards trusted technology on
national security grounds, where short-term commercial considerations
regarding phaseout times do not determine the pace. Chinese vendors are
neither more technologically advanced, nor more competitive than their
European counterparts: they simply rely on a system in which the
combination of subsidies for homegrown companies operating on global
markets and a heavily protected domestic market continue to distort the
playing field. The issue is most acute for the smaller operators across
Europe, Latin America, and Asia, which have weaker credit scores and
thus must resort to Chinese loans unless alternative financing
mechanisms are offered. [The United States and South Korea are
considered leaders in 5G network rollout]{.underline}, yet their
infrastructure has been deployed without using any Chinese equipment,
instead [relying mostly on European technology]{.underline}. One
commonly suggested long-term alternative is Open RAN, but, in practice,
Chinese presence and influence in its development structures requires a
comprehensive risk assessment.

[The EU Toolbox for 5G security offers a good framework for initial
action, but its non-compulsory nature allows for different
interpretation and implementation across EU members, leaving
vulnerabilities.]{.underline} One step in the right direction would see
the stricter implementation of the toolbox across the EU, but this is
only a starting point. Networks connecting critical assets via fiber
optics, transport, and undersea cables require the same scrutiny and
strict implementation of safeguards. The joint development of toolboxes
for these network perimeters could then be envisioned too.

China and NATO

Despite the nuanced language adopted at the NATO summit, the perceived
threat to the security interests and democratic principles of the
alliance have raised the China issue to the status of a major NATO
agenda item. The alliance's policy towards China will be solidified in
the upcoming Strategic Concept, which is expected to be adopted at the
next summit. The difficulty then will be for NATO to address the various
and diverse security threats at once: hybrid deterrence, disruptive and
emerging technologies, and vulnerable critical infrastructure. [Given
the **fast-changing security landscape** and the rapid development of
technology, its ability to **adapt to this new scenario** and act
effectively on all these fronts will be crucial to **NATO's
future.**]{.underline}

How to reshape 5G's transatlantic relations [Divided, **the EU risks**
missing the chance to leverage its **strong position** in wireless
innovation (by some measures, the EU has more core 5G patents than China
and the United States combined)]{.underline}. Stronger policy at the
EU-level by the Commission could encourage EU telecom leaders Ericsson
and Nokia to continue their strong record of innovation as wireless
architectures continue to transition to a more software-centric future.
EU divergences may also have implications on transatlantic relations,
which have suffered some setbacks in recent years in trade, competition
policy, privacy agreements, and diplomatic relations. The EU should work
towards a more consolidated approach and agreement among EU countries to
accelerate the deployment and adoption of 5G, mitigate the risks to 5G
telecommunications networks posed by certain suppliers, and enable a
stronger response to China's growing technological dominance. [To start
with, the EU should build on its **existing international cooperation
mechanism on 5G** with like-minded countries, to reach a **global
consensus on 5G** vision, standards, and spectrum requirements. As **a
security partnership**, **NATO** could potentially serve as a forum for
**further collaboration** on security standards between the **EU and the
United States**. For instance, **the Alliance** could refine its role in
**cybersecurity protection, defence, and resilience**. The **EU** is
still searching for a common certification strategy to prevent
backdoors---hidden entry points for attacking or spying---which may
**affect 5G hardware**. This strategy might help the EU to surpass
current national-based approaches, as well as to reshore its internal
production capabilities and critical infrastructures' resilience and
could **strengthen standards-setting collaboration** within **NATO**
regarding the impacts of **cybersecurity on 5G networks**.The EU, the
United States, and **like-minded partners** (such as Japan) should renew
their dialogue on the implications of state behaviour norms in
cyberspace for the protection and resilience of 5G
networks.]{.underline} China has become highly active in the
multilateral arena by proposing principles regarding the respect for
cyber sovereignty and the shaping of new AI-related uses in line with
its Belt and Road Initiative and its Digital Silk Road. This may have
significant implications on the 5G-driven connectivity of AI
applications. A common transatlantic position is therefore sorely needed
to tip the balance towards an open, fair, secure, and stable data
governance system. Such a "common" position does not refer to similar
policies and regulations but would be one through which all partners can
cooperate on critical infrastructure connectivity while respecting
common values and fundamental rights.With regards to the digital
economy, both allies can mutually reinforce each other's assets. [The EU
should work on **joint technology initiatives** with the US and other
**partners**, as well as pool resources in the many areas that are
**mutually beneficial**. In turn, the EU could use this collaboration as
a two-way street, to boost its digital credentials in areas where it has
**incumbent strengths**. The **US**, which has no major 5G wireless
equipment provider, will continue to largely **rely on the European
companies** Ericsson and Nokia]{.underline} but is aiming to accelerate
alternatives for the future. These two European firms, which remain the
second and third largest suppliers in the race for 5G, are also entering
deals with Canada's largest telecoms companies in order to build their
5G networks.[The importance of **5G systems** has taken on a
**geopolitical dimension**.]{.underline} Given its importance as a
national security asset and an economic driver, current strategies and
principles cannot be limited to national agendas. International
stability---security, peace, economy, and respect for human
rights---relies on both the effectiveness and long-term readiness of
multilateral negotiations. [Opening up a deep **transatlantic discussion
on the role of 5G** will be essential to ensure **mutually beneficial
cooperation**]{.underline}. In turn, this will contribute to subsequent
ways of dealing with models that might leave Western regulatory
standards out of the shaping of a fair and safe technological
near-future.

INTRODUCTION The June 2021 North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
summit in Brussels launched the process to develop a new allied
Strategic Concept to update its 2010 predecessor.1 As the summit
communiqué stressed, NATO remains the central vehicle for security
cooperation between the United States, Canada, and Europe.2 Leaders
noted the "multifaceted" threats faced by the alliance, including
"systemic competition from assertive and authoritarian powers, as well
as growing security challenges to our countries and our citizens from
all strategic directions." They endorsed the NATO 2030 agenda, which
seeks to ensure the alliance is equipped to face the most pressing
present and future security challenges.3 Two issues that are rising fast
on NATO's agenda are China and climate change. As they did in the 2021
communiqué, these twin challenges will feature in the new Strategic
Concept in some fashion, but how the alliance plans to address China and
climate change and what NATO's proper role is on these two issues as
member states calibrate their national positions remain far from clear.
The primary geostrategic competitor of the future --- for the United
States, at least --- is China. [But while **China** presents a complex
set of economic, political, technological, and military challenges for
which developing **common trans-Atlantic positions** is proving
challenging, it is also very **unlikely to trigger NATO's Article 5**
collective security provision.]{.underline} As French President Emmanuel
Macron flatly stated after the 2021 Brussels summit, ["NATO is a
military organization, the issue of our relationship with **China isn't
just a**]{.underline} [**military issue**. NATO is an organization that
concerns the North Atlantic, China has **little**]{.underline} **[to do
with the North Atlantic]{.underline}**."4 Meanwhile, the primary
existential threat faced by allies is climate change, which will of
course affect NATO operations (including through its impacts on
low-lying military bases) and the livelihoods --- and potentially
political systems --- of NATO nations. However, the alliance is but one
forum that ought to be utilized to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. Moreover, mitigating the impacts of climate change will
require cooperation with China even as the strategic rivalry between the
West and China intensifies. As Janka Oertel, Jennifer Tollman, and
Byford Tsang articulated in a recent European Council on Foreign
Relations paper, "Having acknowledged the fundamental systemic
differences between it and China, Europe will increasingly have to
balance the growing competitive dimension with the need to coordinate to
achieve ambitious climate protection, including engaging China on the
evolving rules of global competition around carbon."5 Although NATO has
evolved considerably since the end of the Cold War --- taking on
emerging threats like transnational terrorism and piracy, and venturing
into new arenas such as cybersecurity and space --- **[neither
China]{.underline}** nor climate change [is an issue that fits
comfortably into the **mission of an alliance** founded to **address a
direct**]{.underline} [**military threat** to Europe]{.underline}.
Indeed, the nature of these two key threats highlights that in [managing
and addressing them, particularly the **U.S.-European Union** and
**NATO-EU**]{.underline} [relationships]{.underline}. Yet the June 2021
summit communiqué made clear that NATO intends to tackle both of these
security challenges as it develops its new Strategic Concept (whereas
the 2010 iteration mentioned climate change only briefly and China not
at all). In this paper, we examine how NATO might usefully contribute to
the trans-Atlantic response to the China challenge and climate change[,
while stressing why the United States and **Europe** will need to **look
beyond NATO** as they seek to **develop trans-Atlantic**]{.underline}
[**responses** to these increasingly complex twin
challenges.]{.underline} THE CHINA CHALLENGE In 2020, Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg tasked a "NATO 2030" expert reflection group with
preparing a set of ideas for the allies to consider as they move to
develop a new Strategic Concept that addresses the alliance's main
concerns for the coming decade. The expert group put the China challenge
quite starkly, arguing that the country is "best understood as a
full-spectrum systemic rival, rather than a purely economic player or an
only Asia-focused security actor."6 This characterization went beyond
the European Union's own March 2019 designation of China as a systemic
rival, focused on trade, governance, and human rights;7 it foregrounded
that China's growing military power is not confined to the Indo-Pacific
and that its technology investments in Europe threaten NATO's ongoing
efforts to ensure a high level of military interoperability among
alliance members. At the June 2021 summit, the NATO heads of state and
government described China as presenting "systemic challenges to the
rules-based international order and to areas relevant to Alliance
security." They mentioned Beijing's "rapidly expanding" nuclear arsenal,
its military cooperation with Russia, and its "use of disinformation."
They also noted their desire for engagement with China on issues of
common concern --- such as climate change --- and called for "reciprocal
transparency and understanding" in the nuclear area.8 But the communiqué
remained vague on the question of which tools NATO should wield in
response to challenges posed by Beijing, leaving the details of alliance
efforts in this area for the Strategic Concept to be unveiled at the
Madrid summit in 2022. Other NATO experts have added their calls for the
alliance to shift more of its attention to China. Shortly after the June
2021 summit, former NATO Deputy Assistant SecretaryGeneral for Emerging
Security Challenges Jamie Shea and Syracuse University professor Michael
John Williams wrote that "the Alliance must balance Russia --- which
remains a threat --- with a new focus on Asia aimed at building
modernized Indo-Pacific partnerships. China should be top of mind
throughout all Alliance structures and a regular discussion point in all
high-level meetings."9 Seton Hall University professor Sara Bjerg Moller
has gone even further, arguing that the China challenge is precisely the
type of threat NATO was designed to tackle, and that "\[r\]efocusing
NATO to check the dangers posed by China's rise would restore it to
something closer to its original mission of safeguarding allies from
strategic competitors."10 [The challenge that **China** poses for Europe
is **very different from the Soviet threat** that NATO was originally
formed to counter.]{.underline} With the Soviet occupation of Eastern
Europe at the end of World War II, the United States, Canada, and
Western Europe feared that Josef Stalin's territorial ambitions extended
even further west. NATO was created to reassure its founding European
member states that the United States would protect them from member
states will need to strengthen other frameworks that will play a more
direct role attack. [China today is not poised to invade Europe
militarily and thus the perceived threat is **not as stark** for the
populations of NATO member states as those posed, for example, by
Russia]{.underline} for the eastern members of the alliance and by
migration (and the possibility that some of those migrants might have
links to terrorist organizations) for southern allies. In addition, the
Soviet Union created its own closed economic sphere, de facto limiting
Western Europe's economic exchange with it. [China, on the other hand,
is deeply embedded in the global economy, and in 2020, overtook the
United States as the EU's largest trading partner.]{.underline}11
Despite some calls in the United States for "decoupling," there is too
much at stake with China to keep the economies as separate as those of
the West and Soviet Union were during the Cold War.12 Not fearing a
military invasion by China as they did from the Soviets during the Cold
War, and economically intertwined with China as they never were with the
Soviet Union, means that at least some U.S. allies will be unwilling, if
asked, to choose sides between China and the United States in the
heightening competition between the two superpowers. Recognizing
European reluctance, Antony Blinken declared on his first visit to NATO
as U.S. secretary of state in March 2021, "The United States won't force
allies into an 'us-or-them' choice with China."13 China's impact on NATO
operations Since Article 5 refers to an armed attack in Europe or North
America, China's actions in the South China Sea and more broadly in the
Indo-Pacific are far outside NATO's writ in the North Atlantic, as
Macron suggested in his post-summit comments. Nevertheless, Beijing has
become increasingly active, although mostly non-militarily, in the
Euro-Atlantic area where Article 5 applies. As the co-chairs of the NATO
2030 report argued, "China's control of a growing portion of critical
European infrastructure --- from telecommunications networks to port
facilities --- directly affects NATO readiness, interoperability, and
secure communications."14 China may not pose a Soviet-style, traditional
military threat to Europe, but Chinese ships and planes operate in the
Eastern Mediterranean, the North Atlantic, and the Arctic, and the
Chinese military has conducted joint exercises with the Russians in the
Mediterranean and Baltic seas. Beijing now controls approximately 10% of
European port capacity, primarily along the Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, including Piraeus in Greece, Valencia in Spain, and
Zeebrugge in Belgium.15 China's challenge to NATO as a military alliance
arises not only from its deployments, but its technology investments,
including in 5G, as well as its role in supply chains, which could
disrupt NATO military interoperability or create a Chinese capacity to
disable weapons systems.16 As Julie Smith, Andrea Kendall-Taylor, Carisa
Nietsche, and Ellison Laskowski have argued, "NATO interoperability
requires member states to have secure and resilient telecommunications
infrastructure, which Chinese systems put at risk. Moreover, if the
allies diverged in their responses to the China challenge, the result
could be the adoption of different standards, which would also undermine
the interoperability of forces."17 In response, NATO member states
should be able to count spending on secure 5G systems toward their 2% of
GDP defense spending target.18 While the United States is restricting
Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from access to its 5G networks,
the range of reactions across the alliance is varied.19 Berlin is
continuing to employ Huawei access, and although Paris favors Swedish
and Finnish providers, it has not formally excluded the Chinese
company.20 Ottawa, the lone hold-out of the Five Eyes on banning Huawei
from its networks, has yet to reach a verdict as of mid-October 2021,21
while Warsaw is pursuing Huawei's removal from Polish 5G networks.22
NATO's tools for responding to the China challenge A decade ago,
discussions about a forum for NATO conversations on China centered on
the idea of a NATO-China Council, analogous to the NATO-Russia Council
(NRC), a structured dialogue between the alliance and Moscow initially
designed to ease the impact of NATO's enlargement into Central and
Eastern Europe on the West's relations with Russia.23 But the experience
of the NATO-Russia Council demonstrates the limits of such a body; while
presumably it should be important as a crisis management mechanism
during a major conflict, the NRC failed to perform that role during the
1999 Kosovo war, when Russia suspended its participation in the NRC's
predecessor, the Permanent Joint Council,24 and during the 2008
Russia-Georgia war, when NATO declared it could not "continue with
business as usual" in the NRC.25 NATO proceeded to "\[suspend\] all
practical cooperation" with Russia after the latter's invasion of
Ukraine in 2014, despite seeking to keep a channel for dialogue open.26
While a forum for NATO-China discussions could prove useful beyond the
military-militarystaff talks that have been held previously, NATO needs
an internal alliance forum to help member states develop greater
cohesion in responding to the myriad challenges that Beijing poses,
namely in areas like 5G and artificial intelligence.27 In their
report,the NATO reflection group suggested forming a "consultative body
modeled on the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls"
that operated during the Cold War.28 CoCom, as it was known, was a
voluntary mechanism with no formal enforcement procedures that enabled
allied conversations to develop joint policies restricting the exports
of sensitive technologies to the Soviet Union, China, and other Eastern
bloc nations.29 The Cold War fear of keeping advanced Western technology
out of the hands of the Soviet Union was a different challenge than the
current concern that Chinese technologies will prove attractive to
Western nations, giving Beijing the ability to infiltrate targets and
inhibit operations during a crisis. [To develop a **common assessment**
of the threat **China** poses to building common approaches to
technology investments within allied nations, the internal NATO forum30
could serve as a platform to **support key bodies** such as the
**European Union**, which will play **a more important role than NATO**
in European decisionmaking on technology investment.31]{.underline} NATO
countries need to guard against falling prey to China's divide and
conquer strategy facilitated through Beijing's own institutional
mechanisms such as the Belt and Road Initiative32 (BRI) that China has
pursued in Europe --- primarily through the 16+1/17+1 format that
includes countries throughout Central and Eastern Europe --- and
Beijing's bilateral economic relations with European countries.33 (In
2019, Italy signed a Memorandum of Understanding to join the BRI,
becoming the first G-7 country to do so.34) In one notable example of
China's economic power fracturing cohesion among democratic states,
Athens blocked an EU statement criticizing China's human rights abuses
in the United Nations Human Rights Council just months after the
state-owned China Ocean Shipping Company bought a 51% stake in Greece's
largest port, Piraeus.[35**Coordination on technology** investment
decisions requires building **stronger NATO-EU**]{.underline} [**and
U.S.-EU ties**. In May 2021, the EU agreed to include Canada, Norway,
and the United States in the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO)
Military Mobility project, an important sign for future U.S.-EU defense
cooperation.36 Building on a European Commission proposal,37 the United
States and European Union at their June 2021 summit announced the
creation of a U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council to set joint
standards on new technologies, "with the aim of promoting a **democratic
model of**]{.underline} [**digital governance.**"38 This council, which
convened for the first time in September 2021, fits into a broader
effort by the Commission to set forth **an EU-U.S. agenda**, creating a
**common framework for technology governance** to ensure "secure 5G
infrastructure across the globe and open a dialogue on 6G... part of
wider cooperation on digital supply chain security done through
objective risk-based assessments."39 Others have proposed a **NATO-EU
collaboration** to establish an AI Center of Excellence that would more
proactively address Chinese advances in artificial
intelligence.40]{.underline} NATO has a ready-made framework for working
with Indo-Pacific partners through its global partnership program, which
includes Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, among other
nations.41 Foreign ministers from these four partners met at the North
Atlantic Council (NAC) in December 2020 for the first time, and the NAC
should hold such meetings on a regular basis to strengthen ties between
NATO members and key U.S. democratic allies in Asia. The NATO 2030
expert group has suggested that NATO also seek a future partnership with
India.42 Chinese deployments in the Euro-Atlantic area and increasing
European (primarily U.K. and French) deployments in the Indo-Pacific
will result in greater needs and opportunities for connectivity among
U.S. allies across regions. Former U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Europe and NATO Policy Ian Brzezinski has suggested that
NATO could establish a small military headquarters in the Pacific
through United States Pacific Command (PACOM) to help coordinate allied
deployments in the region.43 One way to begin building more multilateral
interoperability in the Indo-Pacific would be to build a defense college
for civilian and military leaders in the region similar to the NATO
Defense College in Rome.44 Such a college could include not just
officers and political staff from America's Asian allies but could serve
to bring Europeans together with their Asian counterparts. The
accelerating importance of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad
(made up of the Indo-Pacific powers Australia, India, Japan, and the
United States), along with formats like the FranceIndia-Australia
trilateral forum, creates opportunities for the U.S. and its allies to
strengthen ties with India.45 The United States has long worked closely
with the U.K., France, and Germany in a NATO Quad on matters of
significance for the transAtlantic area. Under U.S. leadership, a Quad
plus Quad arrangement could bring key American allies plus one key
non-allied security partner, India, together from Europe and the
Indo-Pacific, and is a natural outgrowth of the NATO global partnership
mechanism. Such conversations would primarily be political in nature, as
key allies from these two regions could discuss the growing challenges
that China poses. A Quad plus Quad arrangement might also help ease the
tensions with France that erupted with the announcement of the AUKUS
trilateral security pact and submarine deal between the U.S., U.K., and
Australia in September 2021.46 These partnership formats could
secondarily allow allies to share information on any new European
deployments in the Indo-Pacific. A British Carrier Strike Group visited
the region in spring 2021, paying calls to India, Japan, South Korea,
and Singapore, and the British have announced that they will be
deploying two warships permanently in the region.47 Meanwhile, a French
Amphibious Ready Group voyage transited in the South China Sea twice
before its return to Toulon in July 2021.48 (The first German warship to
cross the South China Sea since 2002, a mission that has been repeatedly
postponed due to German sensitivities and limited naval capability, is
now on the docket again for later this year, but German military
activity in the region will remain minimal.49) French Minister of the
Armed Forces Florence Parly described the significance of the region to
her country in 2019: "France is not going anywhere, because we are part
of the region. We have territories here, we have more than 1.6 million
inhabitants, several islands with different statutes, vast exclusive
economic zones, and the responsibility that goes with the territory. The
evolving security order affects us too."50 A Quad plus Quad mechanism
could help the United States coordinate conversations among core
European and Asian allies plus India on key political and economic
challenges, and also provide a forum for discussion as France and the
U.K. in particular become increasingly active militarily in the region.
[Coordination is also important given that a **key U.S. goal** should be
encouraging **European "strategic autonomy**" to develop the
capabilities necessary to address security challenges in Eastern Europe,
the Middle East, and North Africa.]{.underline} While increased French
and British military deployments in the Indo-Pacific appear inevitable
given the perceived interests of those countries, [**Europe** has
significant need to **strengthen its capacity** to manage more of the
crises in **its own neighborhood**, especially as the United States
continues to rebalance its foreign policy toward Asia.]{.underline} U.S.
efforts to "pivot" depend on a more capable Europe in regions that
historically have led the United States to put off its rebalancing
efforts in favor of dealing with pressing conflicts --- as in the
Balkans in the 1990s and the wider Middle East after 2001.51 While such
European capabilities to take on greater responsibility for security
along their periphery remain largely speculative to date, the U.S. and
Europe not only have a stake in the development of those capabilities,
but should seek to coordinate any prospects for a greater division of
labor so that such activity does not weaken ties across the Atlantic.
While the United States is seeking opportunities to get Europe on board
with developing common approaches to addressing the China challenge, and
will attempt to use the Strategic Concept process to sharpen NATO's
focus on the threats posed by Beijing, [**NATO is less important** for
addressing the **Chinese economic and technological**]{.underline}
[**challenges** than the **European Union** and key bilateral
relationships across the Atlantic. As a result, **any effort** by the
United States and its allies **to respond to China** will require
**going beyond NATO.**]{.underline}

#### Security assistance pins 5G to the best guidelines to ensure [safety]{.underline} and [efficacy]{.underline}

**Kapko 22**, Matt, reporter at Cybersecurity Dive, 7-8-2022, What to
watch with 5G network security,\" Business Telegraph,

**[5G]{.underline}** operators and vendors have long claimed the latest
generation of wireless network architecture delivers security
improvements over 4G. However, it also introduces new features and
services that **[expands the threat]{.underline}** s[urface to systems
previously untouched by wireless networks.]{.underline}

Efforts such as the virtualization of radio access networks and a push
to open interfaces, allowing operators to integrate a wider pool of
software and equipment from vendors, further complicates risk
assessments.

The network architecture also allows carriers to deliver network slicing
over shared physical infrastructure, private networks and mobile edge
computing.

Three years after the first 5G networks went live, the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency in May issued a five-step security
evaluation to counter these threats, vulnerabilities and supply chain
concerns facing enterprises and government agencies.

CISA provided guidelines and 5G configurations that federal agencies
should implement to bolster security. It also placed 5G under the Risk
Management Framework, a cybersecurity evaluation system developed by the
National Institute of Standards and Technology.

CISOs, especially those engaged with government agencies on 5G networks,
should consider CISA's advice to follow zero-trust architecture
principles and implement DevSecOps pipelines that integrate
infrastructure as code capabilities, said Ron Westfall, senior analyst
and research director at Futurum Research.

"CISOs need to adhere just as stringently to CISA guidelines and could
stand out by helping **[U.S. government]{.underline}** risk managers
identify the best **[security assistance]{.underline}** programs and
best practice assessment **[framework]{.underline}**s," he said via
email.

CISA is effectively setting the bar high by [**pinning 5G** security
evaluations **to NIST guidelines**]{.underline} and aligning with what
are [generally considered **best practices in any
industry**.]{.underline}

CISOs should follow those as a baseline for their own processes, said
Michela Menting, research director at ABI Research.

The proposal marks the beginning of a long evaluation and response by
the U.S. government, and it's expected to be continuously revised as 5G
technology advances and introduces new services that present additional
risk.

"5G is still a nascent technology and common, full standalone deployment
is still some years away," Menting said. Most 5G networks today are
anchored to 4G cores, which poses limits on what operators can deliver.

Standalone 5G networks, which effectively cut the cord with older
systems, haven't materialized as quickly as expected.

As that happens, 5G operators intend to deliver advanced services riding
on cloud-native technologies and software that will extend network
infrastructure to private enterprise networks and applications running
at the edge.

How the next wave of 5G will be leveraged and deployed remains unclear
and this makes security evaluation and risk assessment difficult,
Menting said. New market players, including hyperscalers, cloud service
providers, software and application developers, cybersecurity vendors,
resellers and systems integrators are offering products and services
within the telco space for the first time.

"The most prevailing security challenge in 5G infrastructure is the
significant expansion of the attack surface in relation to pre-5G
networks," Westfall said.

The disaggregation of hardware and software and a larger vendor pool
introduces new threats to virtual machines and container service
platforms integrated across 5G network architecture. This includes the
5G core, radio access networks, mobile edge computing, network slicing,
virtualization, and orchestration and management.

[Potential threats cited by CISA include vulnerabilities and malicious
code or systems across the supply chain that can occur during the
provisioning and deployment of software and hardware in 5G networks and
services.]{.underline}

#### Diplomacy allows avoiding perception of involvement over 5G

for Europe's Future in the Digital Age" Stiftung Wissenschaft und

The analytical distinction between the two approaches is not meant to
suggest that states strictly follow one or the other. In­deed, as the
example of Germany shows, many states try to combine both. Still, the
two approaches inform policy-making in different ways: The geopolitical
approach leads to an emphasis on openly political measures; the "network
security" approach, on the contrary, focuses more on technical
solutions.

When a state approaches the issue of **[5G within a geopolitical
framework]{.underline}**, it would be highly questionable -- if not
irrespon­sible -- not to also include many of the tech­nical solutions
proposed to increase net­work security. After all, if network secu­rity is
seen as important enough to enter into serious inter-state
confrontations, states should also do everything in their power to
increase security through tech­nical measures.

In this context, it is quite remarkable that -- at least in the short
term -- the recent decisions by the US administration may actually
create new security risks. A number of rural telecommunication operators
in the United States that rely on Huawei products will not be able to
receive any software updates after the 90-day "grace period," including
security patches. Moreover, whereas Huawei never gained ground in the US
consumer market, it is not clear what will happen to millions of Huawei
mobile phone customers in Europe. They will likely not be able to update
their phones with the newest versions of Alpha­bet's Android mobile
operating system. Indeed, most likely they will have to choose between
using an outdated operating sys­tem or installing an Android variant (or
"fork") that builds on Android's open source components but is combined
with specifications and additions provided by Huawei.

On the other hand, it is possible to focus on network security without
framing the issue as one of geopolitics. States can invest to create
redundant and diverse network structures and increase the auditing and
certification of the technology used by net­work operators -- all without
explicitly taking sides in the geopolitical struggle between the United
States and China. Right now, it seems that the United Kingdom is trying
to stick to this strategy. But this approach is also political on a
higher level: It avoids geopolitics at the risk of creating
vulnerabilities in interactions with states that very strategically
pursue their own geopolitical interests.

Most crucial in this context is that China is massively financing,
designing, and con­structing as well as gaining ownership and operating
critical infrastructure on the Eura­sian landmass and beyond, namely
through the BRI. In particular, the BRI explicitly comprises a digital
component, the "Digital Silk Road." The rationale behind this initiative
is not just to promote Chinese high technology, but also to gain control
over the flows of goods, services, and -- most importantly -- data. If
one takes this Chinese ambition seriously, a short-term focus on network
security might be seen as failing to address this more long-term
strategic conflict.

In addition, not choosing a side in a con­text of increasing polarization
could in it­self be perceived as choosing China's side. The attempt to
avoid geopolitics thus bears the risk of creating a serious rift with
one of Europe's closest allies.

It is not surprising, then, that many states in Europe appear to be
attracted to a form of "geopolitics light," combining an emphasis on
network security with some more openly political measures (e.g., France,
Germany). Indeed, [this strategy is]{.underline} currently the most
promising for Europe because it facilitates a degree of political and
**[diplomatic maneuverability]{.underline}**, **[allow]{.underline}**ing
[states the **flexibility** to address the perceived geo­political risks
**without** fully **getting drawn in**to the confrontation
between]{.underline} the United States and **[China.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, independent [radiation and health scientists have published
serious concerns about the current roll-out of 5G transmission
systems.]{.underline}6--8 16--18 Their reasoning is twofold: (1) [these
systems have an unprecedented potential to create human and non-human
RF-EMF exposures orders of magnitude more intense]{.underline} (eg, in
terms of 'power flux density') than was the case only a few decades ago
(16); (2) [there is a]{.underline} remarkable dearth of evidence on the
safety of 5G-specific EMF emissions, but a [growing body of research
suggestive of harms from other RF-EMF exposures, which have been studied
for much longer]{.underline}.6--8 17 18 Moreover, a [growing number of
**engineers, scientists, and doctors** internationally have been
**calling on governments to raise their safety standards** for RF-EMFs,
commission more and better research, and **hold off on further
increases** in public exposure,]{.underline} pending clearer evidence of
safety[.]{.underline}18--21 Some politicians have listened: France,
Israel, Cyprus and Russia have banned WiFi in preschool and restricted
its use in primary schools. Belgium has banned the sale of mobile phones
to children under seven. In response to such concerns, [**several
jurisdictions** have recently **blocked the installation of 5G antennae
systems** in their communities: **Brussels, Florence, Rome**, as well as
**Glastonbury, Frome and Totnes** in the UK; and **widespread anti-5G

"Brussels halts 5G plans over radiation rules" 04/08/19

☺

The **[Belgian government]{.underline}** has decided to [**halt** a **5G
pilot project in Brussels** over concerns that the new **cellular
standard cannot meet the city\'s** strict **radiation
rules.**]{.underline}

Brussels has some of the strictest radiation regulations for telecom
equipment in the world, which has hampered the deployment of cellular
technologies in the region, including 4G LTE and 5G.

The European Commission has asked each member state to select one city
to be 5G-ready by 2020 as part of the EU's [5G Action Plan for a Digital
Single
Market](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-connected-digital-single-market/file-5g-action-plan).
But, [**Brussels**, the **unofficial capital of the EU**]{.underline}
may be left behind if it [cannot adapt its radiation
standards.]{.underline}

Last year, three of Belgium's telecom operators were able to strike a
deal with the government to relax the radiation rules in Brussels in
order to roll out a 5G pilot in the city, [according to local media
reports](http://www.brusselstimes.com/business/technology/13441/orange-selects-brussels-as-first-belgian-city-to-receive-5g).
In late 2018, Orange
Belgium [announced](http://www.brusselstimes.com/business/technology/13441/orange-selects-brussels-as-first-belgian-city-to-receive-5g) it
would deploy 5G networks in Brussels. But, [environment minister Céline
Fremault has decided to halt the project because it's too difficult to
measure the radiation exposure from the new service.]{.underline}

"I cannot welcome such technology if the radiation standards, which must
protect the citizen, are not respected, 5G or not," Fremault said, as
reported in [The Brussels
Times](http://www.brusselstimes.com/brussels/14753/radiation-concerns-halt-brussels-5g-for-now).
"[The people of Brussels are not guinea pigs whose health I can sell at
a profit. We cannot leave anything to doubt."]{.underline}

#### [Empirics]{.underline} -- Switzerland was a [leader]{.underline} in 5G, but imposed a [full-stop moratorium]{.underline} because of health concerns.

Financial Times. "Switzerland halts rollout of 5G over health concerns"

[**Switzerland**, one of the **world's leaders in** the rollout of
**5G** mobile technology, has **placed an indefinite moratorium** on the
use of its new network **because of health concerns**. ]{.underline} The
move comes as countries elsewhere around Europe race to upgrade their
networks to 5G standards amid a furious rearguard diplomatic campaign by
the US to stop them using Chinese technology provided by Huawei.
Washington says the company, which is fundamental to most European
networks' upgrade plans, presents a grave security risk. Switzerland is
relatively advanced in Europe in adopting 5G. The wealthy alpine country
has built more than 2,000 antennas to upgrade its network in the last
year alone, and its telecoms providers have been promising their
customers' imminent 5G coverage for most of the past year.  However, a
letter sent by the Swiss environment agency, Bafu, to the country's
cantonal governments at the end of January, has now in effect called
time on the use of all new 5G towers, officials who have seen the letter
told the Financial Times.  The agency is responsible for providing the
cantons with safety criteria against which telecoms operators' radiation
emissions can be judged. Under Switzerland's highly federalised
structure, telecoms infrastructure is monitored for compliance and
licensed by cantonal authorities, but Bern is responsible for setting
the framework. Bafu has said it cannot yet provide universal criteria
without further testing of the impact of 5G radiation. The agency said
it was "not aware of any standard worldwide" that could be used to
benchmark recommendations. "Therefore Bafu will examine exposure through
adaptive \[5G\] antennas in depth, if possible in real-world operational
conditions. This work will take some time," it said. Without the
criteria, cantons are left with little option but to license 5G
infrastructure according to [existing guidelines on radiation
exposure]{.underline}, which [all but preclude the use of 5G except in a
tiny minority of cases.]{.underline}  [Several **cantons** have already
**imposed** their own **voluntary moratoria** because of uncertainty
over health risks]{.underline}.  Swisscom said that Bafu's assessment
process would not halt its ongoing work to build out 5G infrastructure,
even if it meant that it would not be able to be used at full capacity.
The operator said it could still achieve high speeds for customers of up
to 2Gb/s without the full use of new masts. Swiss law on the effects of
radiation from telecoms masts is broadly in line with that of European
peers, but specifies the application of more stringent precautionary
measures in certain cases. New 5G communications technology means
individuals are exposed to more concentrated beams of non-ionising
radiation, but for shorter periods. Bafu must determine which legal
standards to apply to this. Swisscom, the country's largest mobile
operator, said it understood "the fears that are often expressed about
new technologies". "There is no evidence that antenna radiation within
the limit values adversely affects human health," the company added,
pointing out that 5G is run on frequencies similar to the current 4G
standard, which has been subject to "several thousand studies." The
company said Switzerland's regulatory limits were "10 times stricter
than those recommended by the World Health Organization in places where
people stay for longer periods of time". [Switzerland already has a
**notable anti-5G lobby**, with recent protests against its rollout in
Bern, Zurich and Geneva]{.underline}. The [Swiss Medical Association has
advised caution on 5G, arguing that the most stringent legal principles
should be applied because of **unanswered questions about the
technology's potential to cause damage to the nervous system,
or**]{.underline} even [**cancers**.  Five "**popular initiatives**" ---
proposals **for legally binding referendums on 5G** use --- are already
in motion in Switzerland. Two have already been formalised and are in
the process of collecting the 100,000 signatures needed to trigger
nationwide votes that if successful will amend Switzerland's
constitution]{.underline}.

[In 2015]{.underline}, George [Osborne hailed the arrival of
a]{.underline} "**[golden decade]{.underline}**" [of Sino-British
relations]{.underline}. "[Where some people are cautious
about]{.underline} getting more involved in [China]{.underline}, [we
say]{.underline} quite **[the reverse]{.underline}**," [the chancellor
remarked]{.underline} during a high-profile trip to Beijing. "[We want
to get]{.underline} more [involved with China]{.underline}."

[Five years later]{.underline}, [the mood has changed]{.underline}
**[dramatically]{.underline}** [following Britain's U-turn on its
decision to allow]{.underline} the Chinese firm **[Huawei]{.underline}**
[to develop]{.underline} its [5G]{.underline} network. [Although the
UK]{.underline} government has [sought to play down
accusations]{.underline} that the decision was politically motivated,
insisting it was a "technical decision", in reality [it
could]{.underline} scarcely [be]{.underline} more
**[political]{.underline}**.

[After repeatedly failing to convince British intelligence
services]{.underline} that [Huawei posed a national security
risk]{.underline}, [the US decided to force the UK's hand by
imposing]{.underline} new **[sanctions]{.underline}** [that cut off the
company from]{.underline} international [semiconductor
supplies]{.underline}. [This left the UK]{.underline}'s National Cyber
Security Centre [with little choice but to advise]{.underline} that
[Huawei equipment should not be used in the UK's 5G
network]{.underline}, **[souring relations]{.underline}** [between
London and Beijing.]{.underline}

[Washington's fears about]{.underline} **[Huawei]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[genuine]{.underline}**. [But]{.underline}
**[beneath the rhetoric]{.underline}** about national security [lies a
deeper concern]{.underline}: that [China's economic model may have
the]{.underline} **[potential]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[rival]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[productive
power]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[liberal
capitalism]{.underline}** -- [and threaten the]{.underline}
**[technological supremacy]{.underline}** [that has]{.underline} long
**[underpinned]{.underline}** [US hegemony thanks to]{.underline} its
world-leading [university]{.underline}, [military]{.underline} [and tech
sectors]{.underline}.

[After]{.underline} Deng [Xiaoping initiated]{.underline} **[China's
reforms]{.underline}** and opening-up process in 1978, [most western
economists assumed]{.underline} that [China would follow the path
of]{.underline} other [former communist societies]{.underline}:
**[economic liberalization]{.underline}** would be [followed
by]{.underline} **[political democratization]{.underline}**, [and China
would join]{.underline} the club of [liberal democracies]{.underline}.
But [not only has liberal democracy]{.underline} **[not
arrived]{.underline}** in the People's Republic, [the **C**hinese
**C**ommunist **p**arty]{.underline} has [developed a
distinct]{.underline} [economic model]{.underline} that has [lifted
nearly a billion people]{.underline} **[out of poverty]{.underline}**
[and transformed China into]{.underline} one of [the
world's]{.underline} [largest and]{.underline} most
[dynamic]{.underline} **[economies]{.underline}**.

Officially called "[**socialism with Chinese characteristics**", China's
economic model combines strategic state ownership and]{.underline}
planning with **[market-orientated]{.underline}** [incentives and a
one-party political system]{.underline}. In contrast to most western
economies, [the commanding industrial heights]{.underline} of the
economy [are owned]{.underline} and controlled [by a vast state holding
company that reports]{.underline} directly [to China's state
council]{.underline}; [the financial system is **tightly
controlled**]{.underline} and subordinated [to policy
objectives]{.underline}; and [long-term planning]{.underline} and
investment decisions [are overseen by the powerful National Development
and Reform Commission.]{.underline}

**[Huawei]{.underline}** [has become the]{.underline} **[international
poster child]{.underline}** [for the success of this model]{.underline}.
Although not a state-owned enterprise, [the company has
received]{.underline} significant [support from the Chinese state,
including a \$30bn line of credit]{.underline} from the China
Development Bank. Thanks in part to this support, [it has emerged as
the]{.underline} **[unrivalled global leader]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} the development of **[5G]{.underline}** networks,
[and]{.underline} recently [overtook Samsung as the world's largest
smartphone maker.]{.underline}

Although Huawei is the first Chinese tech company to become globally
dominant, it is unlikely to be the last. [Under the leadership of
Xi]{.underline} Jinping, [Beijing has made no secret of]{.underline} its
[ambition]{.underline} [for China to]{.underline} [achieve]{.underline}
**[self-sufficiency]{.underline}** [in strategic
technologies]{.underline} [such as]{.underline} [advanced
information]{.underline} [technology, robotics, aerospace, green
vehicles and biotechnology]{.underline}. While the US was happy to
encourage China's economic development when it provided a cheap pool of
labour for western supply chains, [the goal of achieving]{.underline}
**[technological self-sufficiency]{.underline}** has [set alarm bells
ringing in Washington.]{.underline}

[The influential thinktank]{.underline}, [the Council on Foreign
Relations]{.underline}, has [described China's plans as a]{.underline}
"**[real existential threat to US technological
leadership]{.underline}**", while the US trade representative Robert
[Lighthizer acknowledged]{.underline} [they pose]{.underline}
"[a]{.underline} very, very **[serious challenge]{.underline}**".
[Strategists fear]{.underline} that [allowing China to continue with
these plans could lead to the]{.underline} **[US losing technological
supremacy]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} key [strategic sectors such
as]{.underline} **[information technology]{.underline}**,
telecommunications [and **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline} --
[along with]{.underline} the economic, [military]{.underline} and
[geopolitical power]{.underline} that comes with it.

[For all the **rhetoric** about a trade war]{.underline}, **[rising
tensions]{.underline}** [between the US and China have]{.underline}
**[never]{.underline}** really [been about trade]{.underline}. From the
beginning, [the US has been]{.underline} **[concerned]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} **[preventing]{.underline}** [China's rise as a rival
technological power]{.underline}. In the case of
**[Huawei]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} Trump [administration's goal
is]{.underline} clear: **[to crush]{.underline}** one of [the first
Chinese tech companies to become]{.underline} **[globally
competitive]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} [prevent it
from]{.underline} [gaining a]{.underline} **[dominant
position]{.underline}** in a key [infrastructure]{.underline} of the
future. [This strategy]{.underline} is not without its risks, and
[could]{.underline} easily [backfire]{.underline}. [By pressuring
countries not to do business with Chinese firms]{.underline} and cutting
them off from global supply chains, [Washington may end]{.underline} up
inadvertently **[accelerating]{.underline}** [Beijing's efforts to
develop]{.underline} **[domestic capabilities]{.underline}** in leading
technologies, thus [**fueling** these **tensions** even
further]{.underline}.

[While talk of a new]{.underline} "**[cold war]{.underline}**" [may be
overblown]{.underline}, [it's no longer]{.underline}
**[inconceivable]{.underline}** [to imagine a future where
countries]{.underline} can [use US technology or Chinese
technology]{.underline} -- **[but not both]{.underline}**. In the longer
term, [a shift in this direction could]{.underline}
**[fragment]{.underline}** or even unwind [the integration of our
globalized economy.]{.underline}

[It's tempting to view the UK's dilemma about **Huawei**]{.underline}
[as an unfortunate consequence of being caught in the **crossfire**
between two **superpowers**]{.underline}. But in many ways [the UK's
predicament can be traced to]{.underline} **[its own domestic policy
failures]{.underline}**. [When Huawei was founded]{.underline} in the
late 1980s, [it was the UK]{.underline} -- not China -- [that was a
world leader in telecommunication technology.]{.underline} With
homegrown firms such as STC, Racal, GEC, Marconi and Ferranti, [the UK
was second only to the US]{.underline} when it came to telecoms
ingenuity. But in the following decades, [successive UK governments
allowed leading telecoms technology companies to be]{.underline}
**[taken over and sold off]{.underline}** [to overseas
firms.]{.underline} In thrall to free-market orthodoxy, [British
manufacturing and industry]{.underline} [was]{.underline}
**[sacrificed]{.underline}** [in the interests of]{.underline} the City
of **[London]{.underline}** [and the financial sector]{.underline}.

[While **Huawei's rise**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} undoubtedly [a
story of Chinese success]{.underline}, [it is]{.underline} also [a story
of]{.underline} **[Anglo-American decline]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}** [financial crisis laid bare
the]{.underline} **[underlying weaknesses]{.underline}** [of neoliberal
capitalism]{.underline}, but [without a clear alternative to take its
place the response was to]{.underline} **[double down]{.underline}** [on
a **broken** model]{.underline}. In the years since, [stagnant wages and
productivity]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} **[spiraling
inequality]{.underline}** have [fueled a surge of]{.underline}
**[political discontent]{.underline}** on both sides of the Atlantic.

[If]{.underline} **[Anglo-American capitalism]{.underline}**
[was]{.underline} already [on life support]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} catastrophic [handling o]{.underline}f [the
coronavirus]{.underline} crisis in the UK and the US [has administered
the **lethal blow**]{.underline}. Far from being viewed as successful
models to emulate, [the US and the UK are]{.underline} increasingly
[turning into]{.underline} [**cautionary tales** to avoid]{.underline}.

[None of this is to say]{.underline} that **[China's
variant]{.underline}** [of authoritarian capitalism is a desirable
alternative]{.underline}, or that governments should turn a blind eye to
the abuses of the Chinese state. But **[rebuffing Chinese
technology]{.underline}** [and stoking]{.underline} [**anti-China
sentiment** will not cure the ills of Anglo-American
capitalism]{.underline}. [The roots of these problems]{.underline}, and
therefore their solutions, [can]{.underline} instead [be]{.underline}
[found]{.underline} much **[closer to home]{.underline}**.

**[The economics of 5G]{.underline}**.

Much of [the world economy]{.underline} still [runs on]{.underline}
roughly [this]{.underline} **[price-competitive basis]{.underline}**, of
course, but [the scale of the digital economy is starting
to]{.underline} ~~dwarf~~ **[exceed it]{.underline}**, and [even in
manufacturing]{.underline} -- [where goods are]{.underline} most
obviously [still offered for sale at a specific price]{.underline} --
**[data is coming to dominate]{.underline}**, [through]{.underline} the
expanding [use of **digitized design**]{.underline} and 3D printing, on
one side, [and the provision of]{.underline} in-service [data after
production]{.underline}. In aerospace, for example, Bombardier's new
C-series jetliner is expected to generate 844TB of data on a single
12-hour flight, roughly one-fifth of Facebook's current daily global
data usage. Aeroengine manufacturer Rolls Royce generates most of its
revenue from post-production services, monitoring thousands of engines
currently in use.

**[5G]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} further [swell the]{.underline}
**[deluge of data,]{.underline}** [with the]{.underline}
**[proliferation]{.underline}** [of low-cost sensors]{.underline} in
every electronic device, [and the spread of massive]{.underline},
**[wireless communications]{.underline}** capacity [combining
to]{.underline} further **[saturate]{.underline}** both [the economy and
society]{.underline}. And [it is]{.underline} the current models of
[**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}, [reliant on]{.underline}
**[machine learning]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} vast pools of
**[data]{.underline}**, [that are poised to]{.underline} be **[exploit
this]{.underline}**, both **[to organize]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} enormous complexity of the '[**I**nternet **o**f
**T**hings']{.underline}, [and to learn from it]{.underline}.

[The economics of these two factors]{.underline} [point]{.underline},
very strongly, [to the]{.underline} **[reinforcement]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} existing tendencies in **[digital
capitalism]{.underline}**: that scale matters more than anything else,
and that ([as a result]{.underline}) it is [control of access to
**infrastructure**]{.underline} that [determines]{.underline} [who can
grab]{.underline} any value generated. [If you control]{.underline}
access to the [infrastructure]{.underline}, [you can levy access
charges]{.underline}.

But [if AI reinforces these tendencies]{.underline} -- and [the kind of
AI that we have]{.underline}, [rooted in]{.underline} massive
**[datasets]{.underline}**, [certainly does]{.underline} -- and [**5G
reinforces** them]{.underline} too, [the logic of]{.underline}
**[capitalist competition]{.underline}** [will be shifted further away
from]{.underline} the [textbook]{.underline} terrain of
[competition]{.underline} [to offer the lowest price]{.underline}. [The
more the economy becomes]{.underline} **[digitized]{.underline}**, [the
less it will be driven by price competition and the more competitive
outcomes will depend on]{.underline} claims of [ownership]{.underline},
access to [revenue streams]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, ultimately,
**[state power]{.underline}**.

This is the logic spelled out in a thought-provoking essay by Songkick
co-founder and angel investor Ian Hogarth, which he calls, rather
bluntly, '**[AI nationalism']{.underline}**. Because [the economics of
AI are dependent on the scale of its operations]{.underline}, and
[because the social impact of AI will be so great]{.underline}, Hogarth
predicts that [an]{.underline} "**[accelerated arms race]{.underline}**
[will emerge]{.underline} between key countries and [we will
see]{.underline} increased **[protectionist]{.underline}** [state action
to support]{.underline} **[national champions]{.underline}**, [block
takeovers by]{.underline} **[foreign firms]{.underline}** [and attract
talent]{.underline}." [This isn't]{.underline} an

**[global power]{.underline}** [in 5G and also]{.underline} **[enabled

[There is]{.underline} much international **[debate]{.underline}**
[about whether countries should allow Huawei's equipment into their
network]{.underline} infrastructure, particularly in developed nations
and within the Five Eyes.

[The USA has been]{.underline} aggressively **[lobbying]{.underline}**
[allies to ban Huawei]{.underline}, [citing national security

decision]{.underline}. The [UK made a **pivotal decision**]{.underline}
this spring [to remove and ban]{.underline} all [Huawei
equipment]{.underline} from its telecom 5G and legacy networks.

This summer I had the privilege of being a witness advisor to the UK
parliamentary committee on 5G infrastructure strategy on what to do next
given the recent decision to pull Huawei from their networks. Here are a
couple of clips for insight. UK Parliament 5G Committee: advice on
allies collaborating, industrial policy, China\'s system and UK
Parliament committee advice on 5G, Huawei, what to do next

[If **Huawei** is **banned** from 5G networks]{.underline}, [it
leaves]{.underline} two other primary 5G vendor choices -- [Ericsson and
Nokia]{.underline} - with [Samsung]{.underline} being a growing option.

However, [the fact that **only**]{.underline} [Huawei, Ericsson and
Nokia are]{.underline} the top three [5G network equipment
vendors]{.underline} at the moment [begs]{.underline} the global
[competitiveness questions]{.underline}: [why doesn't the USA have
a]{.underline} **[leading player]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the
[5G]{.underline} network equipment market?

[Why isn't there a USA 5G equipment vendor]{.underline} commanding a
top-ranking position in the all-important future telecom technology of
5G, [which influences]{.underline} national and economic
[security]{.underline} for years to come? [How did the USA]{.underline},
a superpower and innovation giant, **[miss this market]{.underline}**
opportunity? Did **[free markets fail America in 5G]{.underline}**?

The short answer is yes. [Western economic principles]{.underline} and
systems **[cost the USA]{.underline}** [a national security threat and a
significant loss of global power in tech]{.underline} and also
**[enabled Huawei]{.underline}** [to grow into a leading 5G
position]{.underline}.

More specifically, [free markets failed America in 5G leadership because
of]{.underline}:

- [Margin Greed]{.underline}

- [Wall St. Rules]{.underline}

- [Short-term]{.underline} [Goals]{.underline}

- [A]{.underline} hands-off government and a **[capitalism
  model]{.underline}** [that allows]{.underline} the private sector
  (**[free markets]{.underline}**) [to decide on investment
  directions]{.underline}. i.e. **[lack of industrial
  policy]{.underline}** [in critical industries]{.underline}

**[Margin Greed]{.underline}** & Wall St. Rules

O[ne primary factor contributing to the]{.underline} **[USA's
omission]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the [5G]{.underline} networks
space [is that mobile wireless network equipment manufacturing costs are
**high**]{.underline} [and the margins are]{.underline}
**[low]{.underline}** in this business. Being a mobility,
**[RAN]{.underline}** ([radio access network]{.underline}) vendor
[requires a long-term commitment, significant investment and a
complementary revenue stream to support it a]{.underline}s part of a
companywide product offer strategy. It is not very lucrative.

[Margin greed is]{.underline} likely [a]{.underline} significant [part
of why America's networking leader]{.underline}, [Cisco]{.underline},
which [was the natural]{.underline} likely [vendor]{.underline},
**[chose not to invest in]{.underline}** the mobile [radio access
network business]{.underline}.

[Cisco]{.underline} vigorously [protects]{.underline} its 65% [profit
margin targets]{.underline}, **[which shareholders love it
for]{.underline}**. [Wireless mobility does not contribute]{.underline}
well [to that goal and it has a]{.underline} long-term [sales
cycle]{.underline}. **[Capitalism]{.underline}** (free markets), high
quarterly earnings expectations from Wall St., and short-term goals
[justified forgoing this market segment]{.underline}.

[This is unfortunate for the USA's]{.underline} long run global
**[competitiveness position]{.underline}** (which is not having a 5G
position today), yet in the meantime, [Cisco made a lot of people a lot
of money for]{.underline} a couple of [decades]{.underline} with this
high-margin strategy.

[Capitalism principles]{.underline} **[failed]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} the case of [5G]{.underline} networks. [Free markets
chose to pass]{.underline} on the [5G mobile wireless
opportunity]{.underline}. [The USA Government is]{.underline} now
[realizing]{.underline} that some [elements of industrial
policy]{.underline} relating to 5G [are **required** for national
security]{.underline}, as well as economic security reasons.

[The US Government]{.underline} has [demonstrated]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} beginning of a **[shift]{.underline}** [from defense
to offense]{.underline} [in 5G]{.underline} [and are]{.underline}
quickly [working at establishing]{.underline} some form of a
[5G]{.underline} play [that would position the USA in the all-important
future telecom technology of 5G]{.underline}.

"**[Capitalism]{.underline}** [will move money to]{.underline} the most
**[efficient outcomes]{.underline}**. And that is generally the right
thing; we want that," said Senator Rubio. "But [from time to
time]{.underline}, [the most efficient outcome]{.underline} **[is
not]{.underline}** in [our national interest]{.underline}. We can do
industrial policy without abandoning capitalism." He was referring to
the PPE and pharmaceuticals shortfall at the onset of the COVID-crisis
in March, however, this applies to the 5G gap today as well.

[At the dawn of the 2020s, **5G** takes this development further,
allowing far higher speeds of data transmission, extremely low latency
and greater network capacity]{.underline}. In terms of data transfer, if
one gigabyte of data takes around 11 minutes to download on 3G, and 40
seconds on 4G, it takes 3.2 seconds on 5G. [This technological
infrastructure **is seen as the necessary underpinning that will allow
for** a rapidly expanding **'Internet of Things'**---complex apparatuses
like self-driving cars, increased machine-to-machine communication, and
the proliferation of blockchain technologies]{.underline}. [**These
emergent technologies** are sure to create major 'disruptions' that will
further entrench the abstracting power of **cybernetic
capitalism**]{.underline}, [with a pitched geopolitical struggle over
the dominant form this takes.]{.underline} [Australia has obediently
followed the United States in escalating tensions with China by banning
Huawei from making hardware for Australia's 5G network, citing
suspicions that Beijing may have control over the company. While this
correctly recognises the power of infrastructure and surveillance, it
applies extreme double standards with respect to the power the Pentagon
has over the US-based tech industry]{.underline}.

[5G requires]{.underline} three kinds of antenna to operate
simultaneously and in parallel, with [computers determining the optimal
combination of signals and sources to ensure the highest
data-transmission rate]{.underline} vis-à-vis the device and the
network. Owing to its very limited signal range, [the network requires
far more nodes to be built, installed, powered and maintained, as well
as entirely new sets of compatible machines, thus speeding up the slide
of present technology towards its built-in obsolescence]{.underline}.
Also, as [the **5G** nodes need to transmit far more intense
electromagnetic frequencies, as well as doing the automated calculations
to make the system work, such transmission **requires significantly more
electricity**]{.underline}, both for the cell towers and for the
receiving devices. Beyond mobile batteries being flattened faster,
[**this** **also means that far more electricity will have to be
generated and transmitted**. We are already on track for the
communication-technology sector to consume more than half of all
electricity generated on earth by 2030]{.underline}. One fact captures
this nicely: [streaming one hour of high-definition video consumes the
same amount of energy as running a refrigerator for two
weeks]{.underline}. Considering the vast amount of on-demand audiovisual
data being streamed, this has shocking ecological implications.

Suffice to say, [**5G will** undoubtably **mean** that far more data
will be moved around, hence **far more energy will be burned**, far
**more pollutants released**, **far more technologies fabricated in
toxic and exploitative conditions**, **far more rare-earth mining
undertaken and** far **more e-waste exported to the poorest corners of
the world**. With grim irony, we live in a moment where there have never
been more compelling arguments to consume less, to lead less
energy-intensive lives, yet here we are, at the beginning of a vastly
expanded energy usage.]{.underline}

Amid collapsing ecosystems, roiling social decay and fragmented
consciousness, the captains of industry maintain that the long march
towards a glorious future must progress. [This 'inevitable' course of
development is championed by the one-dimensional cheers of
**techno-utopians,** be they free marketeers, **techno-fascists**,
academic **celebrants of posthumanism**, or 'fully automated luxury
communists'. They all envision lifestyles of increasing technological
mastery, infinite on-demand consumption and disembodied integration, all
promoted through the mantras of 'efficiency', 'convenience' and
'connectivity',]{.underline} each term increasingly separated from any
kind of social or ecological grounding.

Yet, while some of the most powerful actors on the planet push for these
kinds of futures, not everyone is thrilled.

A burning antenna is a striking image: flames engulfing a
[5G]{.underline} antenna spewing foul smoke, dripping melting plastics,
shooting high-voltage sparks, burning away at **[the infrastructural
basis of cybernetic capitalism]{.underline}**. The image is more
striking still when the antenna is immolated by politically motivated
arsonists acting on conspiracy theories. In just one month, arsonists in
the United Kingdom burnt seventy-seven 5G antenna towers, and many other
towers were incinerated across Europe, while the US Department of
Homeland Security has issued warnings to its telecom industry advising
it to take steps to prevent such attacks. The plot thickens when it
turns out that the attackers were motivated by a conviction that the
communication towers are bound up with the coronavirus pandemic. There
are variations on the 5G conspiracy, as discussed below, but the main
claims are that 5G either causes or intensifies COVID or that the virus
is being used by elites as a way to tighten control via biotech
surveillance.

Much of mainstream liberal commentary on the 5G conspiracy consists of
snide dismissals that blame credulous individuals for inaccurate
beliefs. Yet, given how widespread the 5G conspiracies have become, it
is not enough to dismiss them; likewise, myth busting and fact checking
aren't an adequate response. This approach is ill-suited to
understanding the nature of the problem and formulating a political
response to it, and it seems ineffective at changing minds. While
conspiracies might be various shades of false, knowledge has a variety
of social functions and is not reducible to a purely rationalistic
logic. Perhaps it is more fruitful to examine the conspiracies that
drive actions such as 5G-tower burning and to speculate about what they
mean as a reflection of our present historical conjuncture. This doesn't
mean agreeing with all the claims of conspiracists, but it does suggest
a need to interpret them in their relation to the deeper structural
crises that afflict our world.

Conspiracists connect COVID-19 and 5G in a number of ways, each offering
a different glimpse of the societies in which these conspiracies have
found fertile ground. They can in part be understood as representative
of different factions, sometimes in competition with one another for
adherents, and sometimes able to be bundled together. 5G conspiracies
are also bound up with sprawling networks of other conspiracies that
cover an extraordinarily large range of preoccupations: the knights
templar, 9/11 truthers, chemtrails, anti-vax, Creationism, fluoride mind
control, 'white genocide', Elvis lives, Roko's Basilisk, and flat
earthers. From the benign to the vile, mixing elements of the occult,
the paranoid, the plausible and the actual, they are stitched together
often with heroic levels of cognitive dissonance, yet sometimes
containing important kernels of truth. Conspiratorial beliefs seem to
thrive in the fringes, yet they are decidedly not limited to such
outliers. The conspiratorial claim that climate change is a hoax has
been thoroughly accepted by many of the most powerful states and
corporations on the planet, with planet-burning consequences. Conspiracy
theories seem to require a degree of plausibility, and this may well
reflect the increasingly large void that separates everyday experience
and what might count as real or true from our techno-scientifically
reorganised world. People intuitively disturbed by these developments
may find the explanatory power of the 5G conspiracies a way to make
sense of our chaotic world.

The crudest version of the 5G conspiracy---that electromagnetic
frequencies emitted from 5G antennas directly cause the virus---is a
belief that departs from any possible basis in scientific knowledge of
the material universe, both the knowledge of the physicist and that of
the physician. Perhaps this understanding of the conspiracy rests, at
least in part, on the fact that 5G and SARS-CoV-2 are both new,
frightening and poorly understood outside of specialist knowledges.
Curiously, here and elsewhere, some conspiracy theorists seek to make
their anti-scientific argument using pseudo-scientific terms. An example
of this is the various maps circulating online that plot the density of
5G towers over the number of COVID-19 cases---a geospatial data
analysis---and assert that there is a causal relation between the two
(as opposed to seeing both as proxies for population density). Despite
the cherry picking and logical fallacy at the heart of this, the
conspiracy here adopts elements of a scientific discourse to make claims
that run counter to the mainstream scientific explanation, drawing on
empirical data and plotting it in abstract projections to create what
looks like truth. When conspiracists couch their claims in
pseudo-scientific terminology it suggests both the hegemonic social
power of science---where even its enemies must argue at least
superficially in its terms---as well as a profound weakness: how
scientific discourse is so abstracted from many people's experience of
the world and how fundamentally political today's scientific enterprise
is.

[Building on the claim that 5G causes coronavirus, the social effects of
the pandemic are seen as a giant cover-up---a 'plandemic'---with its
adherents preferring to believe that it is a manufactured product of
mass propaganda and systemic corruption rather than the health crisis
explained by epidemiology and virology]{.underline}. While claims that
the pandemic was 'planned' are impossible to substantiate in any
meaningful way, claims of mass propaganda and systemic corruption are
harder to dismiss. [It is certainly true that governments are using the
pandemic as an excuse to ram through all sorts of dubious policies. For
example, Australia has seen waves of deregulation to 'cut red and green
tape', tax cuts for the rich, wage freezes, increased defence spending,
university-fee restructuring and massive investments in coal-seam gas,
and all this as public-interest journalism continues to collapse and
endless corruption scandals corrode governments'
legitimacy.]{.underline}

And, [while 5G didn't cause COVID,]{.underline} **[cybernetic
technologies did drastically accelerate the virus's global
spread]{.underline}**. A mere three months separated the first recorded
case of coronavirus and its spread to 114 countries and the declaration
of a pandemic. **[Such extreme speed of transmission is unimaginable
without cybernetically enabled globalisation.]{.underline}**
[On]{.underline} far [lower]{.underline} frequencies than
[5G]{.underline}, older forms of radio-wave technologies such as [radar
have been essential to mass air travel**. Today radar is automated via
the fully cybernetic systems that surveil and control the world's vast
fleets of aircraft**; it has been essential to the 'everyday' air travel
of the last decades, along with the cheap oil that powered planes made
by aerospace military corporations such as Airbus and Boeing and
globalised production]{.underline}. These various factors have created a
hypermobility of bodies that reaches deep into what were hitherto
relatively closed societies---in short, perfect conditions for the rapid
distribution of pathogens, and anxieties about them.

### Link\-\--Smart Cities\-\--2NC

#### Smart cities enable government [surveillance]{.underline} and [control]{.underline}.

Robert **Muggah 21**, principal at the SecDev Group and co-founder of
the Igarape Institute; and Greg Walton, fellow at the SecDev Group and a
researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute, 4/17/2021, \"'Smart' Cities
Are Surveilled Cities,\" Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/17/smart-cities-surveillance-privacy-digital-threats-internet-of-things-5g/>,
RMax

That's because ["**smart**" is increasingly a **euphemism** for
**surveillance**. Cities]{.underline} in at least 56 countries worldwide
[have deployed surveillance technologies powered by automatic **data
mining**, **facial recognition**, and other forms of artificial
intelligence. Urban surveillance is a multibillion-dollar industry, with
**Chinese** and **U.S.-based companies**]{.underline} such as Axis,
Dahua, Hikvision, Huawei, and ZTE leading the charge.
[Whether]{.underline} they are [in China or **elsewhere**, smart cities
are]{.underline} usually [described in benign terms with the soothing
promise of greener energy solutions, lower-friction mobility, and safer
streets. **Yet**]{.underline} in a growing number of places from New
York to Hong Kong, [there are **growing concerns** about the ways in
which **supercharged surveillance** is **encroaching** on free speech,
privacy, and data protection]{.underline}. But the truth is that facial
recognition and related technologies are far from the most worrisome
feature of smart cities.

Part of what supposedly makes cities smarter is the deployment and
integration of surveillance technologies such as sensors and biometric
data collection systems. Electronic, infrared, thermal, and lidar
sensors form the basis of the smart grid, and they do everything from
operating streetlights to optimizing parking and traffic flow to
detecting crime. Some cities are adopting these platforms more quickly
than others. China, for example, is home to 18 of the top 20 most
surveilled cities in the world. Shanghai, which achieved full 5G
coverage in its downtown area and 99 percent fiber-optic coverage across
the city, is covered by a veritable thicket of video surveillance.
Identity collection devices are commonplace, having exploded across
public and private spaces. Shanghai recently installed Alibaba's City
Brain public surveillance system, which oversees over 1,100 biometric
facial recognition cameras. A combination of satellites, drones, and
fixed cameras grab over 20 million images a day. The bus, metro, and
credit cards of local residents are also traced in real time. And these
tools are spreading. Chinese firms are busily exporting surveillance
tech to Latin America, other parts of Asia, and Africa, helping enable
what some critics call digital authoritarianism.

[Surveillance technologies are **hardly confined** to China. They
are]{.underline} also **[widespread in U.S. cities]{.underline}**.
Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, law enforcement agencies and private
companies deployed surveillance tools, ostensibly to improve public and
private safety and security. The 9/11 attacks and subsequent U.S.
Patriot Act dramatically accelerated their spread. Yet support for
facial recognition systems appears to be ebbing. San Francisco was the
country's first major city to ban its agencies from using them in 2019.
San Francisco was among the top five most surveilled cities in the
United States when eight of the nine members of its Board of Supervisors
endorsed the Stop Secret Surveillance Ordinance. [Rolling back
surveillance has proved difficult]{.underline}---digital rights
advocates recently detected over 2,700 cameras still in use for police
surveillance, property security, and transportation monitoring. In 2000,
campaigners sued the city for tapping into private cameras to surveil
mass protests, in defiance of the new ordinance.

Across North America and Western Europe, [the tensions over smart cities
can be distilled to concerns over how surveillance technology
**enables** **pervasive collection**, retention, and **misuse** of
personal data by everything from **law enforcement** agencies to
**private companies**]{.underline}. Debates frequently center on the
extent to which these tools undermine transparency, accountability, and
trust. There are also [concerns]{.underline} (and mounting evidence)
[about how facial recognition technologies are racially biased and
inaccurate when it comes to people of color, discriminating particularly
against Asian and African Americans]{.underline}. This helps explain why
in the two years since San Francisco banned facial recognition
technologies, 13 other U.S. cities have followed suit, including Boston;
Berkeley and Oakland in California; and Portland, Oregon. By contrast,
in China, racial bias seems to be a feature, not a bug---patented,
marketed, and baked into national policing standards for facial
recognition databases. What's more, Chinese companies are bringing their
technologies to global markets.

#### 5G key to media imperialism which has a direct impact on US globalization, capitalism, and empire building

**Tang 20** \[Min Tang, writer at University of Washington Bothell,
International Journal of Communication, \"Huawei Versus the United
States? The Geopolitics of Exterritorial Internet Infrastructure \",
2020, accessed 7-17-2022,
https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/12624/3204\] Lex IT

After historicizing [the **Huawei case** in the entanglement of
information systems and geopolitics]{.underline}, this article [situates
the case in the **media imperialism discourse** and]{.underline}
examines [its contemporary relevance]{.underline}. This article connects
the case to the debate on multistakeholderism versus multilateralism in
global Internet governance and reconceptualizes the framework through
the role of nation-states. [This case is not solely a matter of
bilateral trade disputes, but rather about the intensifying geopolitics
surrounding global Internet infrastructure---**5G technology**, in this
specific case, where a self-interested logic of **neoliberal
imperialism** surfaces in the U.S. approach that contradicts what it
holds as a multistakeholder model in Internet governance.]{.underline}
Methodologically, the study takes a critical political economy approach,
drawing on document analysis of primary and secondary sources. It starts
with an overview of the United States' use of diplomatic devices---be
they political, economic, or military---to steer the global
communication system, practices of which some scholars term media
imperialism. The article then situates Internet governance in the
broader history of struggles in the global information order and
examines the key debate on conceptualizing states, followed by a section
on the rise of China's digital industries, resulting in increasing
intercapital tensions and state efforts in seeking influences on
exterritorial Internet. To understand the continuities, changes, and
trajectories of these intertwined processes, the Huawei indictment is
used as a case study. Global Communication, Geopolitics, and Media
Imperialism From Britain's dominance on submarine cables in the 19th
century and German leaders' ambition to shape world communication
through wireless telegraphy news, to the rise of the United States
rivaling the United Kingdom over exterritorial networks after World Wars
I and II and the early development of the global Internet system,
control of global information infrastructures has always been a priority
for imperial states (D. Schiller, 2011a; Tworek, 2019). [Global media
scholars have cast light on the relations between communication and
empire of various periods]{.underline}. Boyd-Barrett and Rantanen (1998)
[examine the role of news agencies in the developments of **capitalism
and globalization**]{.underline} as "an outstanding but neglected
feature of the past 150 years" (p. 2). Tworek (2019) takes Germany at
the turn of 20th century and especially during and after World War I to
explain how it had built a global news network to support "political,
economic and military power at home and abroad" (pp. 5--7). Winseck and
Pike (2007) further the links between communication and empire,
suggesting complicated power axes of nation-states, corporations, and
technologies in these processes in the early 20th century. [The U.S.
government has long used diplomatic leverage, including trade, to steer
communication policies to promote national interests]{.underline}.
Hills' (2002, 2007) historical work argues that the history of [**U.S.
imperial expansion is a history of** the struggle in **controlling the
global information network**]{.underline}. Guback (1969) [illustrated
how U.S. foreign policy in the decade post--World War II helped reduce
restrictions on American films in Europe and expand Hollywood's overseas
markets, thereby sustaining U.S. political interests]{.underline}. Into
the second half of the 20th century, U.S.-based transnational media
corporations rose to dominate global cultural industries (Herman &
McChesney, 1997; H. Schiller, 1992). Through these processes, a natural
alliance between the U.S. state media industries was forged. The
[overseas expansion of American broadcasting]{.underline}, advertising,
and media systems, together with the military, [were the pillars of the
U.S.'s global dominance]{.underline} (H. Schiller, 1992, p. 37). These
highly integrated American media conglomerations also exerted strong
influences on U.S. economic and foreign policies to allow their further
consolidation and greater media power over other countries
(Boyd-Barrett, 2006; Herman & McChesney, 1997, p. 4). [This laid the
foundation for the media/cultural **imperialism paradigm**]{.underline}.
[Many scholars pinpoint the onset of media imperialism]{.underline}
discourse [to]{.underline} Herbert Schiller's (1976) study on [the
**relationship between media and the U.S. empire**]{.underline}, where
he used cultural imperialism to describe the sum of the processes by
which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its
dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced and sometimes bribed
into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the
values and structures of the dominating center of the system. (p. 9) In
his initial work, Schiller was mostly concerned with [the **neoliberal
expansion of U.S. mass media** as a major vehicle to build, maintain,
and exercise **imperialistic national power**]{.underline}. Boyd-Barrett
(2015) refined the concept and articulates three key aspects of the
multilayered empire-making processes in and through media: Firstly,
[processes of **imperialism** are in various senses executed, promoted,
transformed or undermined and resisted by and through
media]{.underline}. Secondly, [the media themselves]{.underline}, the
meanings they [produce and distribute and the political-economic
processes that sustain]{.underline} them are sculpted by and through
ongoing processes of [**empire building** and maintenance]{.underline},
and they carry the residues of empires that once were. Thirdly, there
are [media behaviors]{.underline} that in and of themselves and without
reference to broader or more encompassing frameworks [may
be]{.underline} considered [imperialistic]{.underline}. (p. 1) With more
scholars taking on this concept, [media imperialism gradually became a
critical discourse encompassing various theories that embrace
multifaceted relations between communication systems and
imperialism]{.underline} (Boyd-Barrett, 2015; Tomlinson, 2002). Some
notable elements in this field of inquiry are the transnational
expansion of media corporations, the entanglement of state entities, the
rhetorical and narrative vehicle, and the dialectical interrelations
among these different parts. This discourse became a primary
intellectual source for the New World Information and Communication
Order (NWICO), a series of policy debates that addressed the media and
geopolitical struggles in the 1970s between the North and the South
(Nordenstreng, 2013). At first a political movement by developing
countries to resist cultural imperialism, NWICO evolved into critiques
on structural matters of information flow, media policies, and
infrastructure governance, which continued at the World Summit on
Information Society (WSIS; Chakravartty, 2006). Since the early 1980s,
**[information and communication technologies]{.underline}** (ICT) [have
developed into new sites of reproduction and control for **U.S.
imperialism**]{.underline} (H. Schiller, 1981, 1984). [The neoliberal
policies gave birth to an array of U.S.-based ICT
monopolies]{.underline}, such as IBM, Cisco, Apple, Microsoft, and
Google, [which spearheaded U.S. global expansion]{.underline} through
proprietary systems of technical standards, patents, and copyright law
and through networked cloud computing (McChesney, 2013; D. Schiller,
2014). Meanwhile, a "military-digital complex" (McChesney, 2013, pp.
158--171) has surfaced, assisting the U.S. government with data
collection for strategic exterritorial interests (D. Schiller, 2011a).
This was evident in the participation of U.S social networks in the Arab
uprisings and with Edward Snowden's revelation of the National Security
Agency's global surveillance programs (Aouragh & Chakravartty, 2016;
Greenwald, 2014). As Aouragh and Chakravartty (2016) observe, "it is
painfully apparent that telecommunications and social media companies
alike comply, co-operate and bend to state power---whether Egyptian
military regimes or U.S. imperial interests" (p. 565). [The growth of
U.S. digital giants as the new engine for geopolitical conquest bear
much resemblance to media imperialism]{.underline}. The conflicts over
the global communication order, especially the management of Internet
infrastructures, are as much alive as in the era of NWICO and WSIS
(Nordenstreng, 2013; Pickard, 2007). This study reconceptualizes
Internet governance within the longer history of struggles in the global
communication systems and benefits from the media imperialism discourse
that takes a holistic view of state power and the dialectical relation
between the state and private actors.

#### Huawei and other 5g telecom companies in China have become a pawn for the greater domestic and international macro-securitization of China by the US

[Securitization theory is about the social construction of a threat and
the response to it]{.underline}. The theory emerged in the 1990s as a
reaction to and rejection of rationalist notions in the then dominant
theories in International Relations of dangers and risks as objective
givens (Buzan et al., 1998). Instead, securitization theory emphasizes
the political processes that make something a security issue. The theory
has since evolved in many directions, but the key idea is that 'an issue
is given sufficient saliency to win the assent of the audience, which
enables those who are authorized to handle the issue to use whatever
means they deem most appropriate. In other words, [securitization
combines the politics of threat design with that of threat
management]{.underline}' (Balzacq et al., 2016: 495).

The theory comprises a securitizing actor (e.g. an individual or a
state), securitizing moves (e.g. speeches and practices), an audience
(e.g. a society or a parliament), and a referent object (that which is
being securitized, e.g. terrorism or migration). [In this article, we
use a simple model to enhance an empirical study of the row over 5G in
the West. We define the United States as the securitizing actor that
securitized 5G through speeches and diplomatic practices in an attempt
to convince Europe (the audience) to follow suit]{.underline}.

Applying the theory to processes taking place between states rather than
inside them has been labelled macrosecuritization by Buzan and Wæver
(2009). This aspect of securitization theory has not been explored as
broadly as many other facets of the theory. Buzan and Wæver\'s model is
complex and multidimensional, including level of analysis (local to
global), degree of comprehensiveness (from niche to inclusive), and
degree of success in convincing the audience.
[Macrosecuritizations,]{.underline} they write[, 'are necessarily
launched as candidates for top-rank threats', such as 'geo-economics,
terrorism, \[and\] nuclear proliferation']{.underline} (ibid.: 258--59).
Niche securitizations, on the other hand, 'get onto the agenda as
accepted threats, but do not rise to top priority'; examples include
'environmental threats, epidemic diseases, organised crime, \[and\]
drugs' (ibid.). Buzan and Wæver also point out that macrosecuritizations
are more vulnerable to breakdown than mid- or micro-level
securitizations, as the mid-level units (states) may pull out or reject
the securitizing move. A reason for this could be that there are usually
weaker relations between the securitizing actor and the audience on the
macro/global level than in mid- or micro-level cases.

Inspired by Buzan and Wæver\'s model, we borrow some of its concepts for
our empirical study, but do not apply it in its full complexity. In our
case, [the US government was not dependent upon European consent to
implement restrictions on Chinese 5G suppliers on American soil. This
was a domestic securitization process]{.underline}. The securitizing
move we study, [however]{.underline}, happened [after the initial US
securitization and was about convincing other states to undertake their
own national securitizations of the 5G rollout. This was **an American
attempt at comprehensive macrosecuritization of China**, with a niche
securitization of 5G]{.underline}.

Another dimension of the theory that we engage with here is the material
or technological dimension. As Buzan and Wæver (2009: 255) point out:
'In principle, securitizing actors can attempt to construct anything as
a referent object. In practice, however, the constraints of facilitating
conditions mean that they are much more likely to be successful with
some types of referent object than with others'. In our case we argue
that [the features of **5G technology** --- its weaknesses and
vulnerabilities as well as its expected role as a critical
infrastructure in our societies --- are **important to understanding
securitization processes**]{.underline}. In other words, [these
processes were constrained and impacted by the material 'realities' of
5G technology]{.underline}. Understanding, for instance, if the dangers
pointed to by the securitizing actor (such as espionage) can be
addressed or resolved through technological solutions, is crucial. Such
understanding can help us navigate the political terrain and enhance our
understanding of securitization processes. This does not mean that the
technological specificities of 5G telecoms in any way determine
political outcomes --- but they do affect them. In short, if a simple
technical solution could mitigate all the concerns raised by the
securitizing actor, securitization would fail.

AMERICAN SECURITIZATION OF CHINESE TELECOMS

[Voices calling for the **securitization of Chinese telecommunications
companies** in the US can be traced back to at least 2010]{.underline}.
At that time, [the FBI, politicians and US experts repeatedly pointed
out that Chinese companies could pose a security threat to the United
States]{.underline} (Barboza, 2010). In 2012 [Congress warned that the
'United States should view with suspicion the continued penetration of
the US telecommunications market by Chinese telecommunications
companies]{.underline}' (US House of Representatives, 2012: vi).

At the time, these warnings did not gain too much traction. [The overall
political mood when it came to China was one of inclusion. Since the
1990s]{.underline}, the US and the West had had a clear strategy to
bring China (and others, such as Russia) into the existing world order.
In practice, this meant that they were invited into existing regimes,
such as the World Trade Organization, and that trade and dialogue were
promoted with the hope that authoritarian regimes would open up and
gradually democratize. This policy had been questioned and criticized
for a while, [but]{.underline} as the Trump administration took office
in 2016, a distinct shift in both rhetoric and practices could be noted.
[Trump embarked upon a confrontational approach towards China in many
areas, not least in trade, tariffs and industrial production, but also
in security]{.underline}. [The argument was]{.underline} that the
strategy of inclusion and change had failed, and [that China had abused
American openness to subsidize its industry, manipulate currency, steal
technology and position itself in global markets. Increasingly
authoritarian political developments in China and growing pressure on
neighbouring countries were also referred to by US government officials.
The securitization of Chinese 5G must therefore be seen in this broader
context of American securitization of China in general.]{.underline}

[It was the **Chinese telecoms company Huawei** that **became a**
particular **target**]{.underline} (referent object) **[of
securitization in the US]{.underline}**. [As a world leader in 5G
technology, and a provider of the 4G networks in many Western countries,
Huawei was a strong candidate to secure many 5G contracts. However,
**the Trump administration** took a robust stance against the company,
citing the risks of espionage from China. They **claimed that Huawei and
other Chinese technology companies represented a serious threat to
national security**, as their **5G** systems could be misused for the
purpose of espionage or even sabotage by China]{.underline} (Cartwright,
2020).

[Questions were asked about its ownership structure and the influence
the Chinese Communist Party had over Huawei]{.underline} (Hawes and Li,
2017; Rühlig, 2020). In particular, critics of Huawei referred to the
2017 Chinese Intelligence Law, which requires Chinese companies to turn
over information to, and comply with, China\'s intelligence and security
services (Rühlig and Björk, 2020: 9). [As a result, in 2018 the US
decided to ban the use of Huawei and ZTE, another Chinese
telecommunications company, in the Armed Forces]{.underline} (US
Congress, 2018). Furthermore, [in May 2019 the US put Huawei on its
'Entities List', a list of companies not allowed to buy American
products]{.underline} (Federal Register, 2019). This meant that Huawei
could no longer use US-made chips and other components in its products.

[In]{.underline} April [2020]{.underline}, the then Secretary of State,
[Mike Pompeo, announced that the United States would introduce a '5G
Clean Path']{.underline} system that would ensure that no correspondence
from US embassies would go through Chinese networks or systems. This was
later extended to the 'Clean Network', whose purpose was to 'secure
national resources, including citizens' computer security and the
company\'s most sensitive information from aggressive intrusions by
malicious actors, such as the Chinese Communist Party' (US Department of
State, 2020a). The Clean Network included 'Clean Apps', 'Clean Carrier',
'Clean Store', 'Clean Cable', 'Clean Cloud' and 'Clean Path'. [The
**purpose was to exclude Chinese companies** from app stores, remove
American apps from Chinese app stores, and refrain from using Chinese
networks, cloud services and cables]{.underline}.

[**At the same time that Huawei was securitized domestically**, **the
Trump administration embarked upon a global campaign to make other
countries follow suit**]{.underline}. The language used by US officials
was forthright, with no diplomatic filters. For instance[, in 2020 the
then Secretary of Defense]{.underline}, Mark Esper, [stated]{.underline}
that: '[If countries choose to go the Huawei route, it could well
jeopardize all the information sharing and intelligence sharing we have
been talking about, and that could undermine the alliance, or at least
our relationship with that country]{.underline}' (quoted in Sanger and
McCabe, 2020). In short, [the securitization of Huawei consisted of
rhetoric focused on risks and dangers, restrictive legislation and a
global campaign, which we will return to below]{.underline}.

However, [the campaign against Huawei was not restricted to telecoms
security. The company was accused by US authorities of racketeering and
theft of trade secrets]{.underline}. The conflict peaked in 2019 when
[Huawei]{.underline} and its [chief financial officer]{.underline}, Meng
Wanzhou, were indicted for fraud and sanctions evasion. The
[arrest]{.underline} of Meng [Wanzhou in Canada and subsequent ---
seemingly retaliatory --- arrests of Canadian citizens in China
contributed to a strained political climate between China, the US and
Canada]{.underline} (Blanchfield, 2020). However, **[none of this had
anything to do with 5G security]{.underline}**. According to Sanger and
McCabe (2020), [**'The Huawei fight is just one part of a bigger
US--China battle**, as Washington tries to contain Beijing\'s influence
and power and **ensure that the world\'s second-largest economy does
not** come to **dominate advanced industries that could give it an
economic and military edge'**]{.underline}. Furthermore, they hold,
'[**The United States is also trying to limit China\'s access to
American technology** more broadly and is considering restricting sales
of microchips, **artificial intelligence**, robotics and some types of
advanced software, along with preventing tech companies from teaming up
--- or even sharing research --- with Chinese firms]{.underline}'
(ibid.). Hence, [the securitization of Huawei was about more than just
5G security; geopolitics and economic rivalry were also important
factors]{.underline} (Inkster, 2019; Mascitelli and Chung, 2019). [**The
securitization of 5G and Huawei was** therefore **part of a broader US
policy of confronting and securitizing China across a spectrum of
issues**. It was part of a comprehensive and global macrosecuritization
of China]{.underline}.

**[This broader American macrosecuritization of China raises
some]{.underline}** important **[questions]{.underline}**: is the niche
securitization of primarily Chinese 5G a subset of this? [Were the 5G
security concerns inflated or used as a fig leaf to cover for economic
interests and geopolitical rivalry?]{.underline} Was, for instance, Mark
Esper\'s concern that the 5G network may be exploited for espionage or
sabotage exaggerated to cover for a political agenda? [We cannot know
the exact motivations for the US\'s 5G securitization.]{.underline}
There were probably several overlapping agendas at play. [However, we
can get a better idea of the technical security risks associated with
5G, and thus at least be able to assess whether the securitization could
be substantiated on technological grounds or not]{.underline}. In
theoretical terms this means exploring the technical--material
foundation on which the securitizing act is based, without arguing that
securitization had to happen. It will, however, indicate the strength of
the arguments that the securitizing actors relied on in the process.

[Spectrum harmonization -- a challenge]{.underline}

[Harmonizing the use of spectrum bands across geographies is
**essential** to achieving **mass-market conditions** which in turn
enables **cost-efficient** and **competitive** industrial
devices]{.underline}. [Many countries have]{.underline} already [begun
to assign spectrum for 5G wide-area cellular networks, and quick
regulatory actions and decisions have proven to be **highly positive**
for all]{.underline} ecosystem [parties]{.underline}, [benefiting
service providers and device makers with the ability to **make
technology investments** as well as consumers with]{.underline} the
possibility for earlier enjoyment of [new]{.underline} generations of
[technology]{.underline}. Some countries have also begun to consider
licensed/leased spectrum as part of industrial digitalization and
industrial applications (see Figure 2). Germany, for example, allocated
local licensed spectrum in 3700-3800 MHz band range to industries for
their applications already in 2019, while Japan similarly announced the
allocation of the 28 GHz band. Some nations, like Czech Republic and
Denmark, have chosen an alternative way to dedicate spectrum to
industries. They are including obligations in selected 5G bands for CSPs
national licenses to offer local spectrum leasing to industries at a
pre-defined price.

The [approaches]{.underline} taken **[differ widely]{.underline}**
between regulators, and the allocated bands are in many cases shared
with incumbents.

Discussions on spectrum for industries are ongoing or dedicated local
spectrum is assigned. Includes spectrum made available by regulators
through leasing obligations.

**[Mid band]{.underline}** - [Brazil, Chile, China, Croatia, Czech
Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Japan, Netherlands,

**[High band, mmW]{.underline}** - [Australia, Denmark, Finland,

UK]{.underline}

Figure 2. [Discussions on spectrum for industries are

Regarding the [locally licensed/leased spectrum]{.underline} considered
by administrations, these diverse [allocations **pose
challenges**]{.underline} [to building a device ecosystem for industrial
applications]{.underline}. Device chipsets need to be supported not only
by an ecosystem of traditional mobile broadband (MBB) devices but also
by an ecosystem that includes industrial devices of varying complexity
on different spectrum bands. These ecosystems, however, are still under
formation.

Geosecurity Gravity of China's Unconventional Power

In a similar fashion to how former US Secretary of State Dean Rusk
alerted NATO to the potential geosecurity challenges of a nuclear China
in 1964, [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}---predominantly under
the Trump administration---[has been momentous in **cautioning** its
NATO allies of the **dangers** posed by Chinese **cyber**, **digital**,
and **economic** power. After these assertive **announcements**, NATO
exclaimed]{.underline} that "[China is coming closer to us.]{.underline}
We see them in Africa, in the Arctic, investing in infrastructure in
Europe and also in cyberspace."25

[Almost overnight, the Alliance was **fractured** over the **U**nited
**S**tates' insistence that Europeans "over-relied" on Chinese
**economic investments** and **5G technologies**]{.underline}.26
[However, this case has **legitimate grounds** for **geosecurity**
concern]{.underline}. In 2012 Central and Eastern European (CEE) states
were overwhelmingly enthralled over China's decision to establish a
format for mutual economic cooperation with the 17+1 initiative---now
the 16+1 initiative after Lithuania withdrew from the partnership in May
2021. For many of the CEE states participating in the 16+1 initiative,
the extraregional engagement of China did not raise any cause for
geosecurity anxiety, seeing as their proximity to Russia and the direct
threat it posed was more concerning.27 Moreover, many of the CEE states
regarded any geosecurity threat from China as more of a Western European
issue.28

[The **assertiveness** of the **U**nited **S**tates to broadcast China
as a geosecurity challenge became a **reality** when China began to use
its **economic investments** to attain its "core interests"---the
**Taiwan** quagmire, **Tibet**, **Xinjiang**, the **S**outh **C**hina
**S**ea disputes, and **s**tate-**o**wned **e**nterprises, such as
**Huawei**---being excluded from the CEE markets]{.underline}.29
[Showcasing its **unconventional power** to impact the **economic
stability** of NATO's European members, China has **initiated trade
sanctions**, **investment restrictions**, **tourism bans**, widespread
**boycotts**, and **restrictions** on official travel when it does not
get its way on **diplomatic matters**]{.underline}. China recently
recalled its ambassador from Lithuania, limited trade, and suspended
rail services between the two countries after Lithuania authorized
Taiwan to open a representative office in Vilnius and Taiwan
reciprocated with plans to open a similar office in Taipei.30 [China has
also exerted **unconventional hard power** through **state-issued
threats** and **arbitrary detention** of NATO allies' **state
officials**]{.underline}.31

[NATO's European members have **begun to acknowledge** China's growing
**geosecurity challenges** in cyberspace]{.underline}. According to
[the]{.underline} Atlantic Council's China Plan, the People's Liberation
Army (**[PLA]{.underline}**) [has ongoing missions to maximize its
ability to conduct **multiple cyber operations**, including but not
limited to **cybertheft**, **cyber-reconnaissance**, **cyberwarfare**,
and **cyberattacks** on **information** and **military systems** and
civilian **electric grids**]{.underline}.32 What is more, [NATO's
2020]{.underline} "reflection process" [report condemned China's ongoing
"**disinformation campaign**"]{.underline} against its members,
"[widespread **i**ntellectual **p**roperty **theft**]{.underline}" that
presents geosecurity threats on allies' prosperity, [and
"**cyberattacks**" on NATO governments and societies]{.underline}.33

Geosecurity Gravity of China's Conventional Power

[China is]{.underline} due [to have the second-largest
military]{.underline} globally [by 2050, a distinct **great-power
feature** that will enable China to **project its security** and
**defense interests** outside its regional jurisdiction]{.underline}.
China has also made it clear that it yearns for the People's Liberation
Army Navy (PLAN) to evolve its green-water maritime capabilities into an
efficient blue-water oceanic force. With a powerful blue-water navy, it
can be anticipated that the PLAN will seek out new military dimensions
in extraregional jurisdictions to promote, protect, and procure its
geoeconomic and---by default---geosecurity interests.

1\) **[Threatening allies doesn\'t work]{.underline}**. Devising a
credible alternative might.

Unsurprisingly, other [governments **don\'t like to be
threatened**]{.underline}, and [many see resisting Washington on **this
point** as a way of pushing back on an \"America First\"
agenda]{.underline}. But **[NATO allies]{.underline}**, and allies in
Asia, [seem more likely to respond to a **positive incentive**: A
Western supply chain with the **reach**, **effectiveness**, and
**affordability of Huawei**.]{.underline}

There are many ideas floating around about how to do this. One is to
combine Nokia and Ericsson, two European suppliers that do not enjoy
Huawei\'s market reach, to create a more competitive alternative. A
second is to combine them with an American partner\--or even acquire a
controlling American stake, as was recently floated by Attorney General
William Barr. Congress also seems to be moving this way, including with
the recent introduction of a bill by Senators Warner and Burr that calls
for a fund designed to develop \"5G alternatives to Huawei.\" But
whatever the corporate configuration, it is clear that the United States
and its partners need a Western champion of their own.

[The question is whether the U.S. is ready to go **further** than
**simply protecting** companies from takeover to assure that the
country\'s own technological base is not hollowed out?]{.underline} For
decades, such \"industrial policy\" was a political issue that divided
Democrats and Republicans.

Of course, the United States has never been as hands-off as it
advertises. DARPA has long financed promising defense technologies.
In-Q-Tel has long served as a small-scale venture capitalist for the
intelligence community. Defense Innovation Unit (formerly Defense
Innovation Unit-Experimental, or DIUx) has been particularly successful
at finding commercial firms and products that could be useful for
warfighters\--and it has invested in a few.

Yet all these have survived by flying under the radar. [Their work has
**not** been tied together as part of a **national

### Say No\-\--Poland\-\--2NC

#### Poland's president wants Huawei.

The lobbying struggle to find out who will be able to provide 5G network
equipment in Poland is entering a decisive phase. Investments counted in
billions cannot start until the government allocates frequencies for
next-generation networks in a delayed auction - and until it is clear
whether telecommunications companies operating in Poland will be able to
use the services of Chinese suppliers, especially Huawei , which is very
strong on this market. . Business is waiting for decisions. Chinese
equipment suppliers, which may be eliminated from the market by the
government amendment to the regulations, have found an ally in the
presidential palace - says Puls Biznesu .

[The fate of Chinese companies will be determined by the amendment
to]{.underline} the Act on the National Cybersecurity System
**[(KSC)]{.underline}**, the provisions of which are intended to prevent
signing contracts with \"high-risk suppliers\" , i.e. Chinese in
practice. [There has been a fierce lobbying fight around the draft
amendment for over a year, in which Huawei and representatives of
Chinese and American diplomacy are very active behind the scenes. The
**president** also became **active** on the **final
straight**]{.underline}.

According to Puls Biznesu, the [president\'s interest]{.underline} in
the bill, the amendment of which has been in the freezer for over six
months, [goes beyond the sphere of general declarations at public
events - and goes **against** the **position presented by the
government**]{.underline}. An anonymous interlocutor of the newspaper
from the President\'s Chancellery assures that [the president will **not
agree** to laws that will **discriminate against Chinese
companies**]{.underline}.

The representative of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, with whom
the newspaper talks, distances itself from this and emphasizes that the
shape of the regulations will be determined by security
considerations. And he adds that [work on KSC will be
accelerated]{.underline} (they are to start within a few weeks), for
[which]{.underline} President Andrzej [Duda recently **appealed** during
the Cybersec forum]{.underline}.

### China Lost\-\--1NC

#### China lost the 5G race.

Hal **Brands 21**, Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs at the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and a
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, 9-19-2021, \"Huawei's
Decline Shows Why China Will Struggle to Dominate,\" Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-19/huawei-s-decline-shows-why-china-will-struggle-to-dominate>
//billy

One of [the biggest geopolitical developments of the last two years has
been the quiet **decline of Huawei** Tech]{.underline}nologies Co. [In
2019, the Chinese telecommunications behemoth was racing toward
dominance of the world's 5G networks.]{.underline} It was a symbol of
Beijing's apparent rise to technological primacy. [Today,]{.underline}
however, [Huawei isn't thinking about supremacy]{.underline}: "**[Our
aim is to survive]{.underline}**," [its chairman has
announced.]{.underline}

Since 2020, [Huawei has been **caught in** the global blowback against
Chinese belligerence]{.underline}. [It has been pummeled by a **U.S.
diplomatic and sanctions campaign**]{.underline}. Barring an unexpected
rescue, i[ts prospects will worsen next year, when Huawei exhausts **its
limited supply of** state-of-the-art **semiconductors**]{.underline} ---
the vital components for modern electronics. For years, many experts
believe, [Huawei has been tightly linked to the Chinese Communist Party.
Now, it is becoming a casualty of America's intensifying technological
conflict with Beijing.]{.underline}

Huawei's decline is instructive for several reasons. It shows how
**[China is]{.underline}** often **[its own worst enemy]{.underline}**,
as its global assertiveness makes its rivals multiply. It represents
bipartisan effectiveness: President [Joe **Biden** has **prosecuted**
the **assault against Huawei** by refining policies that President
Donald Trump initiated with strong congressional support.]{.underline}
Not least, it shows that the U.S. has the tools, and can assemble the
strategy, to win a high-tech rivalry with China --- provided Washington
can avoid losing crucial near-term battles first.

[Huawei became]{.underline} a telecommunications [giant thanks
to]{.underline} a unique combination of advantages. It received generous
[government subsidies,]{.underline} totaling perhaps \$75 billion,
[which allowed it to]{.underline} develop quality products while
[undercutting its competitors' prices]{.underline}. Unlike its foreign
competitors, Huawei [had unfettered access to China's vast domestic
market, which allowed it to operate at a scale that further drove down
costs.]{.underline} And it benefitted from the political and diplomatic
support of the Communist Party, which viewed 5G telecommunications as a
critical arena in the struggle for global power --- at a time when
America was, one Trump-era official acknowledged, "asleep at the
switch."

By 2020, Huawei controlled 31% of the global telecommunications
infrastructure market and had more contracts to build 5G networks than
any other company. Its customers were not just cost-conscious developing
countries: Roughly half of Huawei's 91 contracts for 5G were in Europe,
and even close U.S. allies such as the U.K. had chosen to include
Huawei's gear in their networks. Meanwhile, the U.S. response was
fitful.

If Huawei built the world's 5G networks, U.S. officials feared, Beijing
could cite its National Intelligence Law to demand access to sensitive
information flowing through them. China would reap enormous geopolitical
leverage, much as the U.K. had by dominating the world's undersea
communications cables in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Beijing's vision of the future, in which advanced technologies
turbocharge autocratic capitalism, would move closer to reality. And
because 5G networks feature infrastructure that is costly and difficult
to replace, countries that chose Huawei now might have to rely on its
upgrades for years to come. "The race for 5G is on, and America must
win," Trump declared.

Through 2019, however, a divided [Trump]{.underline} administration
[struggled to respond]{.underline}. The potentially punishing sanctions
the president leveled against the company were, in practice, patchy and
inconsistent. Trump [launched an anti-Huawei diplomatic
campaign]{.underline}, enlisting Australia, Japan and countries that
relied heavily on American protection, such as Poland. Yet the president
undermined his own efforts by suggesting that Huawei was just a
bargaining chip in the broader U.S.-China dispute.

An "America First" administration also had trouble with the daunting
task of developing affordable, non-Huawei options. When Secretary of
Defense Mark Esper warned European elites not to rely on Chinese
technology in February 2020, a response from the crowd --- "are you
offering an alternative?" --- produced laughter and applause.

Huawei seemed to be running away with the race to wire the world for the
next generation. In fact, its fortunes were about to fade.

[**China's own behavior** is]{.underline} partly [to blame]{.underline}.
[Beijing]{.underline} had already shown a capacity to unintentionally
[undercut Huawei's prospects]{.underline}, as when [it alienated Canada
by effectively kidnapping two Canadian citizens in 2018]{.underline}.
[The outbreak of **Covid-19**]{.underline}, and the way [**China
attempted to exploit** the pandemic]{.underline}, forced countries
around the world to reconsider ties to the regime.

[A slew of **European countries walked away** from Huawei]{.underline};
China's overall global favorability ratings dropped sharply. Similarly,
after Chinese forces clashed with India high in the Himalayas in June
2020, the Indian government effectively barred Huawei from the country's
5G networks.

[The **U.S**. has been **well-positioned**]{.underline} to profit from
this blowback, [because a three-pronged strategy]{.underline} --- begun
by Trump and continued by Biden --- has begun to cohere.

First is a renewed diplomatic push. [Pressure from
**Trump**]{.underline}, including threats to curtail intelligence
sharing, ultimately [helped **sway** Britain and other close **allies to
distance** themselves **from Huawei.**]{.underline} The U.S.-sponsored
Clean Network, a coalition of countries that have pledged to exclude
high-risk vendors, gathered more adherents during 2020 as American
officials consistently drove home the dangers of working with Huawei.

In 2021, the fact that U.S. policy has become less gratuitously
antagonistic toward allies under Biden has also made it easier to rally
international support. Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of
International Relations at Tsinghua University, acknowledges that the
president's "multilateral club strategy" has taken a toll.

Second, [**Washington** has **used** powerful **sanctions to starve
Huawei** of vital inputs]{.underline}. By ending Trump's ambivalence
about China, Covid accelerated his anti-Huawei campaign. By the close of
the Trump years, Huawei was prohibited from doing business with Google,
Facebook and other U.S. firms that provided key software for its phones.
More important, Washington had cut off Huawei from the highly
sophisticated semiconductors on which its products rely.

Washington's success came from **[exploiting asymmetric
strengths]{.underline}** --- the reach of the U.S. financial system,
America's unmatched geopolitical influence, and the ubiquity of U.S. and
allied technology at the highest ends of the semiconductor value chain
--- to turn its policy toward a global prohibition on providing advanced
semiconductors or semiconductor technology to China. The U.S. does not,
for example, produce the world's most advanced chip-making equipment; a
Dutch firm, ASML, does. But [Washington has used its **leverage to
prevent** ASML from **exporting** specialized **chip-making equipment to
China**]{.underline}, and to stop foreign chipmakers, such as Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, from selling their top products to
Huawei. Even in highly globalized industries, the arm of American power
is long.

The U.S. thus struck at an asymmetric Chinese weakness: It remains
unable, despite massive investments, to design and produce cutting-edge
semiconductors itself. "The fact that core technology is controlled by
others," President Xi Jinping has admitted, "is our greatest hidden
danger." Here, too, Biden has picked up where Trump left off, limiting
Huawei's ability to raise capital in the U.S. and otherwise intensifying
the sanctions campaign.

The damage has been substantial. [**U.S. restrictions** have created new
uncertainty around **Huawei's supply chain**]{.underline}. They have
also raised the likelihood that [Huawei will soon have **to rely on
less-sophisticated semiconductors**]{.underline}, which consume more
power and ultimately make the networks that feature them more expensive
to operate over time. American sanctions are thus giving countries an
economic motive to shun Huawei, in addition to longstanding security
concerns.

### China Lost\-\--2NC 

#### Countries are successfully blocking China without bans\-\--plan not key.

Hal **Brands 21**, Distinguished Professor of Global Affairs at the
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and a

//billy

These measures are buying time for a third aspect of [**U.S. strategy**:
the multilateral development of]{.underline} **[alternatives to
Huawei]{.underline}**. The International Development Finance Corporation
is [**offering financing** to countries that choose **non-Chinese
options** for their 5G networks]{.underline}. [If Huawei can be stymied,
then firms in democratic countries will have a better shot at setting
the technological standards that will shape the telecommunications
industry in the future.]{.underline} The Biden administration is also
betting on something called Open Radio Access Networks, or
**[O-RAN]{.underline}**, an effort [to develop common standards that
promote greater compatibility between different types of
telecommunications equipment]{.underline}. In effect, O-[RAN allows
different companies to plug and play in a single network, **making it
harder for Huawei** or any other firm to dominate global
telecommunications infrastructure.]{.underline} O-RAN has yet to be
deployed commercially at any scale. Feasibility and affordability remain
significant concerns; it may work better for big countries than for
small ones. Yet the pace of deployments is predicted to accelerate
rapidly over the next three to five years, so Biden has put it high on
the agenda for U.S. diplomacy with key countries (South Korea, Japan,
India) as well as institutions such as the European Union and the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. America's strategy, then, is about
running faster as well as slowing its rival. [Washington aims to break
Huawei's momentum until the U.S. and its friends can develop
alternatives that will limit the Chinese firm's global
appeal.]{.underline} The effects of U.S. policy are starting to
accumulate. As of 2021[, **eight of the world's** 10 **largest
economies**, countries representing over 60% of the world's cellular
equipment market, and nearly all members of the European Union, had
either **banned or restricted Huawei** from their 5G networks. Many
**countries** that **have not imposed** formal **restrictions**, such as
Germany and Canada, have subtly **made it** very **difficult for
Huawei**]{.underline}. The company's sales of network gear fell 14.2%
between mid-2020 and mid-2021[. Its overall revenue fell roughly 29% and
earnings have slumped in regions from the Middle East to the
Americas.]{.underline} Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, has declared that
there is "no chaos within the company," but the numbers tell a different
story. [**Huawei**'s predicament could **get much worse**.]{.underline}
Probably next year, [the company will **run out** of the advanced
**semiconductors** it stockpiled as U.S. hostility grew]{.underline}.
That will force it to fulfill existing contracts with older, less
efficient components --- or not fulfill them at all. Huawei may be too
important for the Communist Party to let it fail. But its global
expansion will become increasingly problematic. Meanwhile, [there has
been **less collateral damage** **from** the **anti-Huawei campaign
than** some observers initially **feared.**]{.underline} U.S. and
foreign chipmakers worried that the sanctions would crush their sales,
given that Huawei was the world's third-largest chip purchaser.

Allied governments chafed at Washington's push to make its sanctions
extraterritorial. But the chipmakers have not been massacred, in part
because Huawei's now-thriving competitors are buying more, and in part
because the U.S. has allowed Huawei to purchase older chips not suitable
for its 5G business. And American policies have often benefited major
foreign firms, such as Samsung Electronics Co., Ericsson AB and Nokia
Oyj, by hobbling their principal rival.

O-RAN remains the least developed part of U.S. strategy. But even here,
there are encouraging signs. This year, several major European telecom
firms agreed to build O-RAN networks spanning the continent. Major
mobile carriers in India have also decided to invest in the technology
for their domestic networks and develop products for export.

As they do so, O-RAN will start to profit from scale effects of the sort
Huawei enjoyed. And because the Indian telecom market has a low average
revenue per user, an approach that is economically viable there could be
viable almost anywhere. If that happened, Huawei's price advantage in
developing markets --- so far, its trump card --- may become a thing of
the past.

[Two years ago, **Huawei** was a symbol of China's global tech
ambitions.]{.underline} Today, [it is **an example of** persistent
**Chinese vulnerability**]{.underline}, as well as a marker of how
America has begun to fuse the unilateral coercion and multilateral
construction necessary to wage a technological cold war. Yet Huawei's
story also underscores a final lesson, on the need for speed in U.S.
strategy.

The 5G network is a classic example of a technology with first-mover
advantages. Companies that build and install the hardware on which 5G
networks sit will enjoy lasting influence over the countries those
networks serve. The U.S. nearly waited too long to meet the threat ---
and even as Huawei struggles, the battle isn't through.

Washington is just beginning to promote alternatives to Huawei, and to
make the generational investments needed to keep America and its allies
far ahead in designing and producing top-shelf semiconductors. Beijing
isn't conceding defeat: It is quadrupling down on indigenous innovation
in hopes of becoming the world's leader in advanced semiconductors by
2030.

Other battles await. China is bidding for control of the world's data,
through investments in cloud computing, data centers and fiberoptic
cables. AI, biotech and quantum computing loom large. The U.S. has
begun, albeit belatedly, to address the challenge of Chinese-dominated
5G networks. The lesson for the broader tech competition is not to wait
until it is too late.

//mh

[In response to growing concerns about Huawei's reach, the Trump
administration **leveraged U.S. dominance** in advanced semiconductors
to bar sales of essential computer chips to the company without a
specific license.]{.underline} Access to U.S. chips, particularly
5G-related semiconductors that enable wireless communications, network
management, and data storage, is crucial to Huawei, which is reported to
be running out of supply. [The Trump administration also pressured
countries not to use Chinese components in their 5G
infrastructure.]{.underline}

As part of a CFR Independent Task Force on BRI, we analyzed every
country's official policy toward Huawei 5G and the extent to which this
pressure campaign has succeeded. We found that in addition to the United
States, eight countries have issued outright bans of the company. Almost
all of these are close U.S. allies such as Australia, Japan, and the
United Kingdom.

[More countries have taken a quieter approach, attempting to
simultaneously allay U.S. concerns and not provoke a Chinese
response.]{.underline} Some have taken measures that amount to a de
facto ban without actually barring Huawei. For example:

- India has not formally banned the company but has begun to phase out
  the use of Huawei equipment in future projects, and is reportedly
  weighing a formal ban.

- France announced telecommunications operators would not be able to
  renew licenses for Huawei equipment when they expired, effectively
  phasing out the company's presence in the country.

- Vietnam has not barred Huawei, but its service providers have avoided
  using its equipment in both their 4G and 5G networks.

- Italy's government vetoed a deal between Huawei and telecommunications
  provider Fastweb that would have used Huawei as the sole supplier of
  its 5G network.

- Canada has put off a decision on Huawei for so long that its companies
  have chosen to exclude Huawei from their 5G networks due to the risk
  that they will be forced to replace the equipment in the future.

- Still, others have chosen to use Huawei's competitors without taking a
  public stance against the company. The largest telecommunications
  firms in Belgium, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Norway, Portugal,
  Singapore, and Spain have all contracted with Ericsson or Nokia to
  build their 5G networks

[While the U.S. pressure campaign has had some success**, it is likely
meeting its limits**. The threat of the loss of intelligence sharing and
security partnerships is **unlikely to persuade countries** that are not
formal allies or close security partners with Washington.]{.underline}

[Moreover, the United States has been **unable to persuade all of its
allies** to avoid Huawei]{.underline}. [The company is involved in 5G
networks in NATO members Hungary, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Turkey.
Some of the United States' closest partners in the Middle East,
including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are also using
Huawei.]{.underline}

[A principal reason that the United States has not had more success in
persuading countries not to use Huawei equipment is **that it cannot
offer an alternative**. The United States **does not and will not have a
company that is competitive in the full stack of 5G
equipment**.]{.underline}

### China Won\-\--2NC

#### China won\-\--at best the US can work towards 6G. 

David **Sacks 21**, research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations,
where his work focuses on U.S.-China relations, U.S.-Taiwan relations,
Chinese foreign policy, cross-Strait relations, and the political
thought of Hans Morgenthau. He was previously the Special Assistant to
the President for Research at the Council on Foreign Relations, March
29th, 2021, https://www.cfr.org/blog/china-huawei-5g//tyei

A principal reason that [the United States]{.underline} has not had more
success in persuading countries not to use Huawei equipment is that it
[cannot offer an alternative. The United States does not and will not
have a company that is competitive in the full stack of 5G
equipment.]{.underline}

To make it easier for countries to avoid Huawei[, our Task Force
recommends that the U.S. Development Finance Corporation partner with
its counterparts in **Finland**, South Korea, and
**Sweden**]{.underline} to co-finance Nokia, Samsung, and Ericsson 5G
projects.

The United States should also work with its partners to develop the
nascent open radio access network, or Open RAN, architecture. While
Huawei offers a full 5G stack, Open RAN allows multiple companies to
supply different parts of a modular 5G network. The hope is that 5G
networks built on an Open RAN architecture can better compete with
Huawei on price. In addition, [while no U.S. company offers an
end-to-end 5G solution, they can better compete by specializing in
individual components of a modular network, like end-user
devices]{.underline}.

In the longer term, [the United States must be better prepared for the
arrival of 6G,]{.underline} which is likely to replace 5G within 15
years. U.S. policy-makers should fund R&D centers at universities that
focus on 6G technologies, and consider tax breaks and other incentives
to support private sector investment in 6G, so that there is at least
one competitive U.S. company in this space.

Finally, [recognizing that some U.S. allies and partners will adopt
Huawei 5G despite U.S. pressure, the United States will need to develop
mitigation plans for possible Chinese disruption of telecommunications
infrastructure]{.underline} in those countries. In the words of one
Pentagon-advisory group study, the [U.S. military will need to "assume
that all network infrastructure will ultimately become vulnerable to
cyber-attack" and adopt a "zero-trust" network model]{.underline}.

Washington cannot expect countries to sit on the sidelines and forego
upgrades to their networks while the United States gets its act
together. Instead[, the United States should **work with allies and
partners** to offer a **viable alternative** and prepare for a future in
which China controls a large part of the 5G infrastructure.]{.underline}

https://www.lawfareblog.com/what-congress-and-isnt-doing-5g) ☺

But it is [doubtful that]{.underline} the 116th [Congress will muster
any [broad-based
response](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/business/dealbook/huawei-5g-national-security-trade.html) that
will materially change the trajectory of the United States's deployment
of 5G technology or the security of the network. Because **5G will
remain a private-sector-led initiative** in the United States, the
government's role is limited largely to debating regulatory issues.
There is **no** broad **consensus on whether** or how **federal
regulation should preempt local regulations on** sensitive local issues
like **infrastructure installation, nor** any consensus **on how to make
available the resources** necessary **to bridge the financial gap so
that rural areas** in the United States **get 5G
coverage**.]{.underline} And while most observers agree that the
aggressive implementation of 5G by Chinese companies around the world
poses serious security concerns for the United States[, Congress is
still **holding out hope that** simple moves like **banning** the
Chinese company **Huawei will solve the security problem. It will
not**.]{.underline}

More broadly, the reality is that adequate political will does not exist
on Capitol Hill to tackle the complicated, multifaceted and
resource-intensive issue of 5G in a meaningful way. In the current
political environment, it may take a Sputnik moment---when the Soviet
Union launched the first satellite into space, spurring the United
States to redouble efforts to catch up in the space race---to capture
the interest and concern of everyday Americans and, by extension, their
elected representatives.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has employed impressive rhetoric on
5G but has no real plan and lacks both leadership and interagency
coordination on the issue. The executive branch is also making
moves---like trying to reduce regulations at the local level and using
the Chinese technology company Huawei as a tool in a trade war with
China---that have uncertain outcomes and could end up hurting the effort
to deploy 5G quickly and securely.

The 116th [Congress will accomplish the minimum incremental
steps]{.underline} needed to make the claim that Congress is doing
something on 5G. But [it likely will not unlock the resources needed to
securely deploy 5G in the United States in a timely way or to assure a
technological edge over international competitors on 5G]{.underline}.
Instead, Congress's principal achievements this year and next will be to
provide oversight of the Trump administration's actions related to 5G
and lay the groundwork for serious consideration of this issue in 2021.

the United States.

In addition, Lawfare has published multiple articles addressing the
security challenges associated with 5G. Jim
Baker [summarized](https://www.lawfareblog.com/5g-networks-must-be-secure-and-reliable) the
situation:

5G promises to revolutionize how people use technology. From
transportation to health care to entertainment, the way people interact
with wireless internet devices will change substantially. And as 5G
enables data to be transmitted much more quickly, the number of devices
connected to the internet will likely explode, producing massive
economic benefits for those who can quickly take full advantage of the
new technology.

But 5G poses huge risks for society as well. As people become more
dependent on wireless communications and generate even more data about
what they are doing, the adoption of 5G will bring with it substantial
national security, cybersecurity and privacy risks. These risks must be
mitigated appropriately in order to protect the interests of the United
States and its allies.

[Others](https://www.lawfareblog.com/huawei-and-managing-5g-risk) on Lawfare [debated](https://www.lawfareblog.com/risks-huawei-risk-mitigation) the [best
way](https://www.lawfareblog.com/risk-mitigation-and-huawei-response) to
manage the technical security risks presented by Huawei's dominant
position in 5G. My colleagues Tom Wheeler and Robert Williams [pointed
out](https://www.lawfareblog.com/keeping-huawei-hardware-out-us-not-enough-secure-5g) that
the Trump administration's imposition of export restrictions on Huawei
and other Chinese companies will not be sufficient to stem the security
threat from China, and that the Trump administration has in fact killed
or missed opportunities to increase the security of the network.

Congress began taking a serious look at 5G issues in 2018 and passed a
number of laws in the prior Congress aimed at facilitating aspects of
5G---including, for example, laws aimed at making [more
spectrum](https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1752) (the
range of radio waves used for communications
purposes) [available](https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1752) to
telecommunications companies to support 5G. How countries make spectrum
available to telecommunications providers plays an important role in
how, and on what timeline, new networks and services are rolled out. In
the United States, spectrum traditionally is auctioned to
telecommunications providers, and the money goes to the U.S. Treasury.

Spectrum issues will be a perennial issue and will [continue to
percolate](https://matsui.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1876).
But Congress is also considering a range of other issues related to 5G
and is weighing a range of approaches---some of which have more merit
than others.

Bipartisan Pushback on Nationalization of 5G

In theory, government control of the 5G network could increase security
and ensure that 5G reaches rural markets where there is currently little
profit incentive for private industry to build infrastructure and
provide services. Congressional responses to proposals to nationalize
parts of the 5G network offer a window into the political aspect of the
5G issue.

The nationalization idea has been advanced twice, each time for a
different reason. First, in early 2018, a [leaked National Security
Council
memo](https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html) proposed
that the U.S. government pay to build a single 5G network---an
unprecedented nationalization of private infrastructure---in order to
compete with China and protect the system from malicious cyber actors.
Second, in March 2019,
Politico [reported](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/trump-campaign-5g-1230276) that
Trump 2020 campaign officials supported a proposal---which reportedly
"spark\[ed\] wireless industry fears of nationalization"---under which
the government would take over spectrum designated for 5G and develop a
system to share the spectrum with wireless providers on a wholesale
basis. According
to [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/trump-campaign-5g-1230276),
this was a bid by Trump campaign officials to woo rural voters who have
lacked adequate internet service in the absence of financial incentives
for wireless companies to offer affordable broadband. The plan
was [reportedly](https://www.fiercewireless.com/5g/confusion-reigns-trump-2020-s-5g-wholesale-vision) backed
by Trump 2020 Campaign Manager Brad Parscale and Adviser [Newt
Gingrinch](https://www.facebook.com/newtgingrich/videos/newt-live-the-american-5g-failure/2262549377351710/).

Congressional pushback was clear and bipartisan. Sens. Ted Cruz,
R-Texas, and Catherine Cortez-Masto, D-Nev., twice introduced the
thoroughly named [Eliminate From Regulators Opportunities to Nationalize
The Internet in Every Respect (EFRONTIER)
Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/918/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22e+frontier%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=3).
It would prohibit the president and federal agencies from constructing,
operating, or offering wholesale or retail service on a broadband
network "unless a duly enacted Act of Congress signed into law by the
President provides the President or the agency ... with that authority."
An [identical bipartisan
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2063/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22e+frontier%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=3) was
introduced on the House side.
And [another](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/893/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=3&s=2) [pair](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2881/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=1) of
bipartisan, bicameral bills calling for the Trump administration to
produce a strategy report contains an explicit limitation that the
report "shall not include a recommendation or a proposal to Federalize
5th or future generations mobile telecommunications systems or
infrastructure." Yet another [bipartisan Senate
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1625/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1) is
broader in scope but includes a statement that it is the policy of the
United States that "the Federal Government should ... support but not
build or operate 5G networks."

The pushback worked. Some
commentators [speculated](http://fortune.com/2019/04/12/trump-ajit-pai-5g-wireless-auction-rural-internet/) that
the real reason the administration hastily put together a 5G event in
April 2019---purportedly to announce two Trump administration efforts to
promote 5G---was so the president could publicly calm fears about
nationalization. And Trump did, [stating at the
event](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-united-states-5g-deployment/),
"In the United States, our approach is private-sector driven and
private-sector led. Government doesn't have to spend lots of money....
We had another alternative of doing it that would be through government
investment and leading through the government. We don't want to do that
because it won't be nearly as good, nearly as fast." Bipartisan
congressional opposition, along with opposition by the major
telecommunications providers, seemed to have forced the president to
publicly rebut his presidential campaign and state his position clearly.

Bipartisan Agreement About the Threats Posed by China

The most common issue addressed in proposed legislation is the challenge
posed by China both as an economic competitor to the United States in
the "race" to deploy and dominate 5G and as a national security
espionage and cyberattack threat. China is the current leader in less
expensive technologies for 5G and is likely to deploy the world's first
5G wide-area network. According to the [Congressional Research
Service](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11251), Huawei
has signed contracts for the construction of 5G infrastructure in around
30 countries, including U.S. allies like Turkey and Iceland. American
companies, which lack the technology and the financial incentive to seek
these contracts, are not currently joining the competition.

The 5G national security issue for the United States
is [multifaceted](https://www.ft.com/content/8b48f460-50af-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49).
In April, four former high-level military officials issued
a [statement](https://www.lawfareblog.com/document-former-military-and-intelligence-officials-letter-5g-risks) expressing
"grave concerns about a future where a Chinese-developed 5G network is
widely adopted among our allies and partners." The concerns were
threefold: espionage, the security of future military operations, and
the vulnerability of democracy and human rights around the world.

A number of legislative proposals have sought to articulate the problem.
A bipartisan Senate [concurrent
resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-concurrent-resolution/10/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=11&s=2) states
that "Chinese telecommunications companies such as Huawei and ZTE pose
serious threats to the national security of the United States and allies
of the United States" and that "the United States should reiterate to
countries that are choosing to incorporate Huawei or ZTE products in
their new telecommunications infrastructure that the United States will
consider all necessary measures to limit the risks incurred by entities
of the United States Government or Armed Forces from use of such
compromised networks." Among other things, it finds that "the United
States should work with the private sector and allies and partners of
the United States, including the European Union, in a regularized
bilateral or multilateral format, to identify secure, cost-effective,
and reliable alternatives to Huawei or ZTE products."

Other bills seek to gather information about national security threats
to 5G. The Senate Intelligence Committee's authorization bill, [S.
1589](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1589/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=6&s=2),
and the similar House bill, [H.R.
3678](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3678/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22network%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=7),
require the director of national intelligence to submit a report to
Congress addressing "(1) the threat to United States national security
posed by the global and regional adoption of fifth-generation (5G)
wireless network technology built by foreign companies; and (2) the
effect of possible efforts to mitigate the
threat." [Another](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/987/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=4&s=2) [pair](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2565/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=5&s=2) of
bipartisan, bicameral bills, called the U.S.-China Economic and Security
Review Act of 2019, address select 5G issues as part of a broader bill
to address problems posed by the rise of China as identified by
the [U.S.-China Economic and Security Review
Commission](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/annual_reports/Executive%20Summary%202018%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf).
One section requires the administration to submit an annual report to
Congress on supply-chain vulnerabilities related to China, including an
"assessment of the existing procurement and security policies and
guidance of each Federal agency with respect to cybersecurity,
operations security, physical security, information security, and data
security that may affect information and communications technology,
fifth generation mobile networks (commonly known as '5G networks') and
the Internet of Things." Another section requires a one-time report from
the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Commerce Department
on steps required to ensure the rapid and secure deployment of 5G
networks in the United States, with a particular focus on the threat
posed by equipment and services designed or manufactured in China, as
well as information on any new statutory authorities that may be
required to ensure the security of domestic 5G networks.

A pair
of [bipartisan](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/893/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=3&s=2), [bicameral](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2881/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=2&s=1) bills
sponsored by John Cornyn, R-Texas, in the Senate and Abigail Spanberger,
D-Va., in the House, called the Secure 5G and Beyond Act of 2019, goes a
small step further, requiring the administration to produce a strategy
in six months that would: (1) "ensure the security of 5th and future
generations mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure within
the United States"; (2) assist allies and strategic partners "in
maximizing the security of 5th and future generations mobile
telecommunications systems and infrastructure inside their countries";
and (3) "protect the competitiveness of United States companies, privacy
of United States consumers, and integrity of standards setting bodies
against political influence." The bill outlines 17 elements to be
included in the strategy, including a "description of such legislative
or administrative action as may be necessary to carry out the strategy."

A more comprehensive, bipartisan bill offers some concrete ideas.
The [United States 5G Leadership Act of
2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1625/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1),
introduced by Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Mark Warner, D-Va., Tom
Cotton, R-Ark., and Ed Markey, D-Mass., prohibits the purchase---from
any of the universal service funds outlined in section 254 of the
Communications Act of 1934 ([47 U.S.C. §
254](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-47-telecommunications/chapter-5-wire-or-radio-communication/subchapter-ii-common-carriers/part-ii-development-of-competitive-markets/section-254-universal-service))---of
communications equipment and services from Chinese companies, any other
entity that poses a national security risk, and "any company that is
subject to extrajudicial direction from a foreign government." It also
aims to subsidize smaller providers (6 million customers or fewer) with
a new \$700 million Supply Chain Trust Fund (funded from the sale of
spectrum) to ensure that such providers are purchasing uncompromised
equipment and services. It requires a one-time report from the
administration on steps to ensure the secure deployment and availability
of 5G networks and "any new statutory authority required to ensure the
security of 5G networks in the United States." Finally, it establishes a
"joint program to share information regarding security, risks, and
vulnerabilities with United States communication providers and trusted
suppliers" including small businesses and companies serving rural areas
and directs the prioritization of federal funds "to enhance
representation of the United States at international forums that set
standards for 5G networks and for future generations of wireless
communications networks."

Several other bills begin to address the particular security challenges
that the Department of Defense will face if 5G networks are not secure.
The Senate Armed Services Committee's National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), [S.1790](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1790/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=9&s=2),
includes two sections that address 5G directly. Section 212 requires the
secretary of defense to establish secure 5G wireless network components
and capabilities "at no fewer than two Department of Defense
installations." One, at the Nevada Test and Training Range, would allow
the Department of Defense "to explore and demonstrate the utility of
using fifth-generation wireless networking technology to enhance combat
operations." A second installation would "explore and demonstrate
infrastructure implementations of high bandwidth, scalable, and low
latency fifth-generation wireless networking technology" and
"\[a\]pplications for secure fifth-generation wireless network
capabilities for the Department." On the House side, the House Armed
Services Committee's NDAA, [H.R.
2500](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/2500/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=7&s=2),
requires the secretary of defense to develop a strategy for harnessing
5G technologies to enhance military capabilities, maintain a
technological advantage on the battlefield, and "accelerate the
deployment of new commercial products and services enabled by 5G
networks throughout the Department of Defense." It proposes a \$175
million increase in funds for such research.

One bipartisan bill in the Senate, introduced by Martin Heinrich,
D-N.M., and Rob Portman, R-Ohio, focuses on training personnel in the
Armed Forces in light of new technology challenges like
5G. [S.1471](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1471/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=8&s=2),
the Armed Forces Digital Advantage Act, seeks to "promote and maintain
digital engineering as a core competency of the Armed Forces" and
charges the under secretary of defense for personnel and readiness to
carry out "the recruitment, development, and incentivization of
retention in and to the Armed Forces of individuals with aptitude,
experience, proficient expertise, or a combination thereof in digital
engineering."

Finally, some bills address head-on the challenges posed by
international economic competition. A
Senate [resolution](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-resolution/259/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22AIRWAVES%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1) "deems
it a national priority for the United States to lead the world in the
development and deployment" of 5G techology and "strongly urges all
entities, including Federal agencies, to work cooperatively with the
Federal Communications Commission to advance the goal of United States
leadership in 5G technology, including at the upcoming World
Radiocommunication Conference 2019." Section 103 of the
bipartisan [H.R.3407](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3407/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225G%22%5D%7D&r=8&s=4) would
require the Export-Import Bank to establish a Program on China and
Transformational Exports specifically to support the extension of loans,
guarantees and insurance to American companies that are fully
competitive with how China and other countries that use subsidies to
increase exports treat their domestic companies. The explicit aims are
to "directly neutralize export subsidies for competing goods and
services financed by official export credit, tied aid, or blended
financing provided by the People's Republic of China or by a covered
country" and "advance the comparative leadership of the United States
with respect to the People's Republic of China, or support United States
innovation, employment, and technological standards, through direct
exports" in a number of areas, including "\[w\]ireless communications
equipment (including 5G or subsequent wireless technologies)." [H.R.
3679](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3679/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=2) directs
the director of national intelligence, through the director of the
Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Agency, to carry out a prize
competition worth up to \$5 million to competitively stimulate research
and development relevant to 5G technology.

At this point, it is difficult to say which of these many bills may
become law. The yearly NDAA is probably the most important single item
to follow: Unlike smaller stand-alone bills, the NDAA will almost
certainly become law.

Lack of Consensus on How to Address State and Local Impediments to Small
Cell Deployment

The timely rollout out 5G in the United States faces significant
hurdles. [**Rollout of 5G** across the United
States ]{.underline}[[could]{.underline} **[take a decade or
longer]{.underline}**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-downside-of-5g-overwhelmed-cities-torn-up-streets-a-decade-until-completion-11561780801?mod=mhp)[ due
to a **lack of investment** in low-density areas as well as a **lack of
cooperation** at the local level.]{.underline} The United States trails
other countries, most notably China, in site density of 5G
infrastructure. Many Asian countries already have far denser
infrastructure for their 4G network and, as a result, have a head start
on the density required for 5G. [One Chinese company called China Tower
has a total of approximately 1.9 million wireless sites in
China, [compared
to](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-tmt-5g-deployment-imperative.pdf) a
total of approximately 200,000 in the United States across all
companies.]{.underline} China has installed 350,000 cell sites since
2015, whereas the United States has installed fewer than 30,000 during
the same time period. That means China is deploying an average of 460
cell sites a day within the country---12 times the United States's pace.

The importance of speedy deployment of 5G in the United States is the
subject of some debate. Some observers [hold the
view](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-tmt-5g-deployment-imperative.pdf) that
network effects---in which the value of a product or service is
dependent on a high number of users---could grant a first-adopter
sustained advantage and the potential to capture a greater share of the
economic potential of 5G. Put another way, countries with the largest
and most reliable networks will have a head start in developing the
technologies enabled by faster speeds that can then be exported to other
5G markets. Others [make the
point](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/09/25/the-real-5g-race-is-to-serve-all-americans/) that
the United States was not the first to roll out 1G, 2G, 3G or 4G but
nonetheless is currently the world leader in the chips, operating
systems and software applications that run on 4G; and that the United
States should instead "race" to make 5G both secure and available to all
Americans.

The arduous and intense installation requirements for 5G mean that many
more workers---[including engineers, planners, trench diggers and
antenna
installers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-downside-of-5g-overwhelmed-cities-torn-up-streets-a-decade-until-completion-11561780801?mod=mhp)---will
need to be trained in related skills if 5G is to take place in a
competitive time frame. To address this problem, one bipartisan bill in
the House, titled the [Communications Jobs Training Act of
2019](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1848/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%225g%22%5D%7D&r=10&s=2),
focuses on educational training requirements to support 5G deployment
and implementation. The bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 ([47
U.S.C. §
301](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-47-telecommunications/chapter-5-wire-or-radio-communication/subchapter-iii-special-provisions-relating-to-radio/part-i-general-provisions/section-301-license-for-radio-communication-or-transmission-of-energy) et
seq.) to require the FCC, in consultation with the secretary of
education, to carry out a grant program to establish or expand job
training programs in community, vocational and technical schools for
communications tower service, construction, maintenance and structural
modification. Whether this bill gains any traction remains to be seen.

But a far more important and controversial issue looms. [There is a
major **question of how** the United States's **federalist system will
handle** the challenge posed by the sheer **volume and density of the
infrastructure needed** to fully deploy 5G. Under China's system of
government, there are no similar impediments based on local rules or
control. If the rollout of 5G is a proxy for a great power competition
between China and the United States, **China has a distinct advantage**
in this regard.]{.underline}

Earlier generation technologies like 3G and 4G required the installation
of large 200-foot cell towers spaced relatively far apart and were the
subject of much regulatory oversight at the local level. 5G requires
high-volume, pizza-box-sized small cells that are more compact but must
be much more densely installed for 5G to achieve its full potential.

In September 2018, the [**FCC** issued]{.underline}
an [[order]{.underline}](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-18-133A1.pdf) titled
"Accelerating Wireless Broadband Deployment by Removing Barriers to
Infrastructure Investment," [**requiring localities to consider**
applications for **siting of "small cell"** equipment---a key component
of 5G deployment]{.underline}---quickly and on a limited number of
criteria. [Twenty-five **states refused**]{.underline} to adopt the
FCC's rule. Generally speaking, these [states oppose the preemption of
state and local regulations, particularly state and local fees, time
frames for cell-siting decisions, and aesthetic requirements. A number
of **municipalities **]{.underline}[**[filed petitions]{.underline}**
[for review]{.underline}](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/LSB10265.pdf)[ in
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, alleging, among other
things, that the FCC's order exceeds the commission's statutory
authority. (Several **mobile service providers**, including AT&T,
Verizon and Sprint, also **filed petitions for review in federal
appellate courts** with various other complaints.)]{.underline}

While some [members of Congress support the administration's effort to
cut through state and local regulatory frameworks to facilitate quicker
5G deployment, others oppose taking regulatory decision-making away from
local officials.]{.underline} A January [House
bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/530/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Accelerating+Wireless+Broadband+Deployment+by+Removing+Barriers+to+Infrastructure+Investment%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=5) sponsored
by 50 Democrats (no Republicans were involved) [aims
to](https://eshoo.house.gov/news-stories/press-releases/eshoo-introduces-legislation-to-restore-local-control-in-deployment-of-5g/) restore
local regulatory control in the deployment of 5G by causing the
administration's order to have "no force or effect." Many localities are
encouraging their representatives in Congress to support local control.
Cities in Ventura County, [for
example](https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/local/communities/conejo-valley/2019/05/31/ventura-county-ca-5-g-fcc-kamala-harris-dianne-feinstein-julia-brownley/1224775001/?mod=article_inline),
are urging California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris to
introduce their own legislation or support the House bill.

document](https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en),
unveiled earlier this year, [the European Commission set out the target
of making sure "**all populated areas**" of the bloc are **covered by
5G** by 2030]{.underline}. It has [allocated "a **significant share**"
of its €150bn digital budget **to finance 5G** network
**infrastructure**.]{.underline}

[The European Investment Bank (**EIB**]{.underline}), investment arm of
the EU, has already funded numerous 5G infrastructure projects across
Europe. This week, for example,
it [[announced](https://www.eib.org/fr/press/all/2021-178-italy-eib-confirms-support-for-tim-s-plan-to-develop-5g-fibre-optic-network-and-data-centres?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=PressRelease&utm_content=na&mtm_campaign=PressRelease&mtm_keyword=na_Italy&mtm_source=twitter&mtm_medium=Social&mtm_content=na&mtm_cid=2021-05-31_02_en) a
further €120m **investment** in Italian telecoms company TIM **to
support its 5G infrastructure** roll-out, part of a €350m total
investment package.]{.underline}

Thanks in part to this investment, [Europe saw a **growing** number of
**commercial 5G launches**]{.underline} in 2020. Although it ranks a
distant second in 5G subscriptions behind Asia-Pacific, [it is expected
to **surpass** the 400,000 subscriptions **by 2025**, according to a
forecast by business intelligence provider GlobalData.]{.underline}

### EU Solves\-\--2NC

#### Current EU efforts solve 5G standard setting.

**[5G Action plan]{.underline}**

The 5G Action Plan is [a **strategic initiative** that will make 5G a
reality for all citizens and businesses **across the EU**.]{.underline}

Very high-capacity networks like 5G will be a key asset for Europe to
compete in the Global market, with worldwide 5G revenues for mobile
operators expected to reach €225 billion annually by 2025.

The Commission launched a plan to boost EU efforts for the deployment of
5G infrastructures and services across Europe in September 2016. The
action plan set out a clear roadmap for public and private investment on
5G infrastructure in the EU. 

To achieve that, [the Commission proposes the following
measures]{.underline}:

- align roadmaps and priorities for a **[coordinated 5G deployment
  across all EU Member states]{.underline}**, targeting early network
  introduction by 2018, and moving towards [commercial large scale
  introduction by the end of 2020 at the latest;]{.underline}

- make provisional spectrum bands available for 5G ahead of the 2019
  World Radio Communication Conference (WRC-19), to be complemented by
  additional bands as quickly as possible, and work towards a
  recommended approach for the authorisation of the specific 5G spectrum
  bands above 6GHz;

- **[promote early deployment]{.underline}** in major urban areas and
  along major transport paths;

- **[promote pan-European multi-stakeholder trials]{.underline}** as
  catalysts to turn technological innovation into [full business
  solutions;]{.underline}

- facilitate the implementation of an industry-led venture fund in
  support of **[5G-based innovation]{.underline}**;

- unite leading actors in working towards the **[promotion of global
  standards]{.underline}**.

#### Existing Franco-German funding and EU initiatives [solve]{.underline}

[Europe is seeking to play a role in **establishing connectivity
standards.** Making 5G available everywhere, and **setting the standards
for it, are among the "Digital Decade Principles"** announced in January
by the European Commission, in order to **guide digital transformation
in the EU.**]{.underline}

[Also in January, the **French and German governments announced €17.7mn
in funding** for four 5G projects. These included open 5G networks in
business parks and 5G solutions for operating theatres, to improve
telesupport.]{.underline}

[Bruno Le Maire, French minister for the economy, finance and recovery,
said the **Franco-German ecosystem "will play a key role to position
Europe at the forefront of innovation** in 5G and its
evolutions".]{.underline}

But 5G standards are not only a question of international geopolitics,
says DeNardis. She points to the question of airline flight disruption
in the US.

In January, the largest US airlines warned that the imminent
introduction of 5G threatened to ground flights across the country by
interfering with equipment needed for take-off and landing.

US lawmakers have expressed concern over the rollout of new 5G wireless
services and their effect on aviation © Bloomberg

["In no advanced society should the issue of 5G antenna placement be
making the news,"]{.underline} DeNardis says. "This should be behind the
scenes, not mediated by social media mobs. This is not how tech policy
should be done in any way."

The effect of the fracas, she warns, is to fuel public distrust in 5G,
which had previously been more pronounced in Europe.

"This is yet another area of anxiety and lack of trust in institutions,"
DeNardis says. "This serves to raise the importance of technical
standards in society and how they are rules and structures which bleed
into important social issues."

As debate about 5G standards continues, discussions are already under
way about its successor, 6G.

"It's not surprising that this is happening --- as standards evolve,
they're recognised as opportunities for nations to prioritise their
indigenous companies," DeNardis adds.

A [**resilient 5G system** is always available, reliable, performs as
expected, and recovers quickly when facing disturbances or attacks. The
technical capabilities of a resilient 5G system include a combination of
reliability, availability, robustness and security, whilst protecting
privacy. **These fundamental properties are inherent within telecom

//mh

In recent years, as part of its strategy to contain or delay the rise of
China[, the **U.S. government has taken a series of measures and
sanctions against Chinese technology** companies.]{.underline} According
to a study by the China Development Institute, from January 2017, when
the Trump administration took office, to June 2021, when the [Biden
administration passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act
of 2021 (USICA),]{.underline} the U.S. Congress, the government, and key
think tanks have released 209 bills, policies, and reports concerning
science and technology policies toward China. [Such policies include
**sanctions on China's high-tech companies**, regulations over key
cutting-edge technologies, and restrictions on the training of STEM
talents.]{.underline}

As one of China's most prominent communications equipment manufacturers,
[**Huawei** bears the brunt. It's **one of the biggest targets of U.S.
sanctions** to influence technology competition through trade
policy.]{.underline} Huawei's name is among the buzzwords in those
documents, alongside general terms like artificial intelligence,
innovation, technology, and Cold War.

U.S. Sanctions Against Huawei Keep Escalating

[**The United States has been cracking down on Huawei for over a
decade** since its proposed acquisition of 3Com Corporation failed to
pass review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States
(CFIUS) in 2008.]{.underline} Since then, Huawei's equipment sales
contracts or R&D partnerships with several U.S. companies, including
AT&T and Google, have been terminated. Starting in 2018, [the U.S.
government's crackdown on Huawei escalated abruptly. In addition to
introducing various restrictive policies itself, the U.S. government has
also called on Western countries, including Australia, Japan, and
European Union countries, to remove Huawei from 5G network construction
projects and stop buying its equipment.]{.underline}

In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce decided to place Huawei on
the Entity List for export controls. [**Huawei began to receive
comprehensive sanctions from the United States.** After that, the U.S.
Department of Commerce expanded the scope of export restrictions on
Huawei,]{.underline} requiring foreign semiconductor chip producers that
rely on U.S. equipment and software to obtain U.S. approval before
exporting chips to Huawei in May 2020. Three months later, [the U.S.
Department of Commerce revised its ban on Huawei, **further restricting
Huawei's products**]{.underline} made with U.S. technology and software
and adding 38 of Huawei's subsidiaries in 21 countries to the Entity
List. Ultimately, the ban had been escalated on September 15, 2020, with
a new regulation that prohibited any entity from supplying chips with
U.S. technology components to Huawei.

So far, the Biden administration has primarily followed the series of
punitive measures taken against China under the Trump administration.
[The United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 (USICA), which
has been passed by the Senate, includes a provision that prohibits the
Department of Commerce from removing Huawei from the Entity List without
demonstrating that it no longer poses a threat.]{.underline} Craig
Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies,
also said the U.S. Congress might reintroduce the Neutralizing Emerging
Threats from Wireless OEMs Receiving direction from Kleptocracies and
Surveillance states Act (NETWORKS Act) to impose additional sanctions or
export controls on Chinese entities.

//mh

[Wireless **carriers in Canada won\'t be allowed to install Huawei**
equipment]{.underline} in their high-speed 5G networks, the Canadian
government said Thursday, joining allies in banning the giant Chinese
technology company.

[Canada had been the only member of the Five Eyes intelligence-pooling
alliance not to bar or restrict use of equipment from Huawei
Technologies Co.]{.underline} Ltd. in its 5G networks. **[The U.S. and
the other members --- Britain, Australia and New Zealand --- previously
banned Huawei.]{.underline}**

[\"We are announcing our intention to **prohibit the inclusion of
Huawei** and ZTE products and services in Canada\'s telecommunications
systems,\" Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne
said.]{.underline}

Canada\'s ban also includes ZTE Corp., one of China\'s biggest tech
companies and one that is state-owned.

[Champagne added that \"**providers who already have this equipment
installed will be required to cease its use and remove it**.\" He said
Canada\'s wireless companies won\'t be offered
compensation.]{.underline}

Canada\'s major wireless companies already had started working with
other providers.

\"There are many hostile actors who are ready to exploit vulnerabilities
in our defenses,\" Public Safety Minister Marco Mendicino said.

Mendicino said the government did an extensive review and is redoubling
efforts to protect Canadians.

China condemned the move against one of its national champions as a form
of \"political manipulation\" carried out in coordination with the U.S.,
which was aimed at \"suppressing\" Chinese companies in violation of
free market principles.

\"China will comprehensively and seriously evaluate this incident and
take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and
interests of Chinese companies,\" the Chinese Embassy in Canada said in
a statement posted on its website.

China commonly employs such language in commercial disputes, which often
does not lead to a firm response from Beijing.

[The U.S. government **has been lobbying allies** like Canada for years
**to exclude Huawei from new ultra-fast 5G mobile networks** over
worries that China\'s communist rulers could compel the company to help
with cyberespionage. **The U.S. has warned it would reconsider
intelligence sharing with any countries that use Huawei
gear.**]{.underline}

HGVs = hypersonic gliding vehicles

Some of the [decision-makers felt]{.underline} that some of the
**[threats]{.underline}** commonly [associated with **emerging
tech**nologies in the scholarly discourse are
**overblown**]{.underline}. There was, for example, [**skepticism**
about whether nuclear launch decisions will]{.underline} ever [be
delegated to]{.underline} an [entity other than humans, or whether
**HGVs** are anything other than **fancy missiles**]{.underline}. Our
interviewees were concerned about cyber risks, but they also felt that
[the use of **cyber tech**nologies for **strategic purposes** is most
likely **not going to happen**]{.underline}. These findings underline
that [in spite of]{.underline} the [growing attention given to
**emerging tech**nologies]{.underline} among thinktankers and academics
alike, [decision-makers are **less concerned** about these
technologies]{.underline}. This means that either the experts are
alarmist, or that they need to build better epistemic communities to
convey to decisionmakers the risks that these technologies pose.
Furthermore, the centrality attached to nuclear weapons in strategic
thinking and planning appears to undermine any idea of weakening. Our
survey and interviews showed that while the respondents could imagine
that emerging technologies will have a more prominent role in deterrence
by denial; [**nuclear weapons** will remain **dominant** in deterrence
by punishment]{.underline}. This is rather curious since recent work in
thinking about long-range conventional strikes highlights that these
technologies might change the calculus and appear to affect deterrence
by punishment (Montgomery, 2020). However, [when it comes to
technologies like **HGVs** or **cyberwarfare**,]{.underline} the
[scholars are much more **skeptical**.]{.underline}

When referring to the positive applications of emerging technologies,
many of those surveyed reported that [**tech**nologies can be used to
enhance **nuclear safeguarding** and **verification**]{.underline}
**[measures]{.underline}**. In this respect, [decisionmakers felt that
if there is one contribution that emerging technologies can make to
**nuclear disarmament**, it would be here]{.underline}. Curiously, our
experts were quite skeptical about the prospects for global nuclear
disarmament. The majority of the experts did not think that nuclear
disarmament was going to happen in the next 50 years, and a large
portion of the experts did not think that nuclear disarmament would make
us safer. This seems to support the realist view that nuclear
proliferation is a result of the security dilemma, and the removal of
nuclear weapons would not resolve the underlying calculus but might make
conflict more likely (Waltz, 1981). This is doubly curious, since the
majority of our experts came from European countries, where civil
society pressure for nuclear disarmament is growing. Therefore, we
observe that both the general public and civil society are out of step
with the experts. The perception that nuclear disarmament is
unachievable (in a reasonable timeframe) and that it would not make the
world safer might explain why nuclear disarmament is not a policy
priority for numerous experts. As Pelopidas (2020) recently remarked, if
elites believe that nuclear weapons are eternal, then the motivation for
doing something about disarmament is not as much of a priority for them.

Rethinking China's "export strategy." 

On the other hand, [China's **export strategy** is **more
complicated**]{.underline} in practice. [Surveillance technology is
provided by liberal **democracies** and **authoritarian regimes
alike**.]{.underline}[36](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn36) Therefore,
[China is **not** simply propagating a **digital authoritarian
model**]{.underline} to export an alternative form of governance. As
[its actions depend on political context, [bilateral
relations](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/topics/social-sciences/bilateral-relations),
and **mutual economic interests**, China appears more **opportunistic**
than **strategic**]{.underline} with respect to [exporting advanced
surveillance technologies]{.underline}.

[Beijing may not be linking these technologies to a **specific political
use**. The adoption of Chinese surveillance technology in]{.underline}
strong liberal [democracies across Europe shows that regime type is
**not a good predictor** of countries that will adopt]{.underline}
artificial intelligence (AI) [surveillance
technology.]{.underline}[37](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn37) [The
**demands** for these technologies]{.underline} (e.g., controlling
migration, tracking terrorist activity) [are **diverse**
and]{.underline} often **[not]{.underline}** clearly [connected to
China's **geopolitical goals**---including the promotion of
**authoritarian practices**]{.underline}. For example, [in France,
domestic terrorist threats appear to drive the need for these
technologies]{.underline}.[38](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn38) [In
Greece]{.underline}, however, [the use of advanced surveillance
technologies in automated border control (ABC) systems are a priority to

the influx of migrants at Europe's
borders.[39](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn39)

[A **closer look**]{.underline} at the demand for China's technology
exports [reveals]{.underline} that [customers' agency and local dynamics
may **complicate** the logic that **Chinese surveillance tech**nologies
lead to **greater authoritarianism**]{.underline} in practice. [Huawei's
presence in Thailand]{.underline}---a country considered repressive
regarding internet freedoms---[does not appear to reveal a clear
**Chinese agenda**]{.underline} to push monitoring systems.
Additionally, one of the major selling points for this
technology---Huawei's Safe City---has garnered
skepticism.[40](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn40) As
new crime data from deployed Huawei Safe City and Smart City projects
suggests, "the perception of Chinese surveillance technology as
particularly effective and sophisticated is not matched by the actuality
of its chaotic
implementation."[41](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn41) The
success of Huawei's Safe City and Smart City projects in China, which
largely forms the marketing narrative to foreign customers, is based not
only on the technology itself, but on supporting policies and resources
(e.g., trained security personnel to transform data into actionable
information).[42](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn42) The
policies and resources must develop alongside these technologies. Of
course, such a supportive framework varies across countries---seventeen
in Africa alone---with Huawei Safe City and Smart City
projects.[43](https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/science/article/pii/S0030438722000138#fn43)

The United States' relationship with the People's Republic of China
(PRC) is largely defined by competition. The meeting of U.S. and Chinese
foreign officials in Anchorage just three months after the Biden
administration took office showed that both nations remain
"fundamentally at odds" in key areas (e.g., economic practices,
territorial disputes, and human rights).1 [Geopolitical competition
between these two global powers **risks direct and indirect armed
conflict** and injects volatility into financial markets that could
weaken the global economy.]{.underline}

Secretary of State Antony Blinken's December 2021 trip to Jakarta,
Indonesia, reflected the U.S.'s competitive spirit. By appealing to a
broad set of shared interests (e.g., democratic values and commerce
through open seas) with Indo-Pacific nations, the United States sought
to highlight itself as a more reliable and transparent strategic partner
than China.3 Blinken's mention of the United States and Republic of
Korea's (ROK) investments in research and development on secure 5G and
6G networks served as a reminder that the U.S. and its partners are
working to provide viable alternatives to Chinese investments in the
region.

[A myriad of official U.S. documents shows that **China is the U.S.'s
main geopolitical rival**.]{.underline} Militarily, China's rise
challenges America and its allies' interests in the Asia-Pacific region
and Europe. 5 Both the United States' and China's technological sectors
remain formidable tools for advancing and defending against each other's
military, political, economic, and social objectives.6 In particular,
the United States is concerned that China seeks to gain long-term allies
and influence across these domains by promoting its advanced
communications and information technologies through investing in several
nations' digital infrastructures.

[China's efforts to promote its 5G networks have sparked policy debates
in Washington and among its allies. Many in the West are concerned that
China's foothold in a nation's digital economy and communications could
affect a country's political future, as well as security cooperation
with the U.S. and its allies.]{.underline} In fact, a large part of
China's growing influence across much of the developing world---fueled
by its narrative as a non-colonial power and strategic goals encompassed
in "Made in China 2025"---is through its advancements in (and successful
marketing of) telecommunications technology. For example, China
dominates Africa's telecommunications infrastructure by supplying
approximately 70 percent of the continent's 4G networks. 7 Alongside
China's state-backed financing, its success in this sector across Africa
and much of the Global South is partly due to the United States'
increased pressure. This pressure includes banning Chinese-made
equipment, restricting access to U.S.- based technology, and persuading
allies to ban Chinese-made equipment to curb Chinese companies' global
reach. All of these measures are due to security concerns largely
emanating from within China (i.e., the Chinese Communist Party's
\[CCP's\] historical support of cyber espionage).8

On the other hand, some scholars argue that [**economic interests drive
China's motivation** for selling repressive technologies (let alone 5G
network infrastructure). "China's motivation . . . is based more on
economic interests than a grand strategy to impose authoritarian values
and alternate governance systems in host states."]{.underline} 9
[China's geopolitical interests and authoritarian "instincts" are not
the only viable explanations of its motivation to build 5G networks
abroad.]{.underline} The consumer in the local environment has a say and
may have different motivations.

[This article argues that the **bark of China's digital authoritarianism
may be worse than its byte**. China's promotion of its advanced
communication technologies is subject to local political, social, and
economic forces]{.underline}. More specifically, this article finds that
the combination of geopolitical dynamics and local economic
considerations challenge China's capacity to dominate digital
infrastructures. [We contend that Chinese 5G networks abroad do not
advance digital authoritarianism or negatively affect countries'
internet governance norms any more than non-Chinese network providers.
**Other local factors include leadership incentives, technological
capacity, and political norms** and practices that **largely determine**
how Chinese technologies are applied.]{.underline} While there are
legitimate concerns regarding espionage and network security, these
concerns should be analytically separate from issues of digital
authoritarianism due to distinct differences in the required level of
participation---or complicit behavior---from host governments. This
paper focuses on how Chinese 5G networks impact the relationship between
host governments and their citizens, not how China in pursuit of its
geostrategic objectives may be influencing foreign populations directly.

respond to strategic competition with China depends on having the right
diagnosis of the problem**.]{.underline} [Unfortunately, much of the
prevailing analysis and commentary on the subject has gotten the
diagnosis wrong by misunderstanding or misrepresenting the nature of the
challenge that China poses.]{.underline} Let us examine what it is, and
what it isn't.

The US contest with China is a full scale, full-spectrum strategic
great-power competition for wealth and power and influence, both within
East Asia and globally. It features competing models for political
governance and economic development, as well as competing views on the
structure and rules of the international order. This competition is
being driven primarily by historic changes and structural shifts in the
wake of the US-Soviet Cold War and---more recently and perhaps more
importantly---the Global Financial Crisis of 2008--9. These events and
their consequences have altered the global balance of power and
especially the relative strategic trajectories of the United States and
China. [This new **status quo has inevitably fueled tensions,
suspicions, and competition** between the world's two biggest powers.
Each side is determined to maximize its position and its freedom action
relative to the other.]{.underline}

[**This competition, however, is not automatically or necessarily an
adversarial relationship, or a zero-sum or winner-take-all contest**. It
is not, or at least **should not be, exclusive of bilateral
cooperation**]{.underline}---which in fact will be necessary and vital
to both countries and for the sake of the rest of the world. And
contrary to many prevailing views, it is [not a product of Chinese
leader Xi Jinping's personality or personal ambitions.]{.underline} The
historical and structural drivers of the competition largely predated
his rise to power in 2012.

Perhaps most importantly, [this is **not an existential ideological
struggle**]{.underline}, like that between the United States and the
Soviet Union. The ideologies and strategic objectives of the two sides
are not mutually exclusive, or at least need not be. [**China is not
seeking to destroy the US system** or to supplant the United States as
the global hegemon]{.underline}. [Indeed, Beijing has almost certainly
calculated that global hegemony is unachievable, unnecessary to secure
China's interests, and not something to be particularly wished for.
**Chinese leaders probably recognize that pursuing global hegemony would
be counterproductive**, and destabilizing in ways that would not be
conducive to China's interests or its security]{.underline}. They
probably also calculate---based in part on having observed the US
example---that possessing it would be both burdensome and unsustainable.
Given this cost-benefit analysis, Beijing is prepared to settle for
something less than global predominance, which is why Chinese leaders
talk a lot about global "multipolarity."

[It is within this framework of pursuing and promoting multipolarity
that China is seeking to legitimize its model of governance and
development, **not impose it upon other countries**. This is part of
what Beijing is referring to when it routinely invokes a "community of
common destiny for mankind." Rather than being the expansionist and
aggressive Sino-centric vision that some scholars have attributed to the
phrase, this is actually a relatively benign slogan that hearkens back
to the "five principles of peaceful coexistence."]{.underline} Its core
emphasis is on mutual respect for---or at least tolerance
of---alternative governing systems, and mutual pursuit of solutions to
shared global challenges and imperatives. Similarly, when Chinese
leaders talk about the "reform of global governance," they are clearly
talking about reform---not replacement of the international system with
one of China's making or wholly in China's image. Indeed, Beijing sees
the existing international system trending in its favor. But it wants to
adjust and update the system to make it even more reflective and
representative of the twenty-first-century balance of power in the
world. And obviously the Chinese would like to maximize the extent to
which the system serves China's agenda and endorses its preferred ways
of doing business.

[Much commentary has deemed the US-China strategic competition to be a
new Cold War. But is only a "cold war" to those commentators who choose
to define the term in a way that serves that purpose.]{.underline} [But
that comparison is inappropriate because, again, **the US-China contest
is not an existential ideological struggle**. The world today is not
characterized by two opposing ideological camps]{.underline} aligned
with Beijing and Washington; and the United States is integrated and
interdependent with China in ways that it never was with the Soviet
Union. Indeed, the competition with China is unprecedented because
Washington has never faced a strategic or ideological rival that had its
act together while being competitive in various realms.

#### Concerns about 5G are [overblown]{.underline}\-\--Huawei [doesn't have]{.underline} malicious intentions

Lyu **Jinghua 20** \[Jinghua is a scholar with Carnegie's Cyber Policy

//mh

All the declared [concerns supporting the ban of Huawei, including the
risks of surveillance and data collection and the potential
vulnerabilities to cyberattacks or installed kill switches, sound
**reasonable at first.**]{.underline} However, it is fair to say that
these are inherent risks embedded in all ICT products. Why is Huawei so
alarming, then? [The frequently heard answer is that Huawei has much
closer relations with the Chinse government than the usual ones, with
three main accusations. Are they convincing enough?]{.underline}

[The first and most primary accusation is that Huawei is forced to obey
the laws, such as the National Intelligence Law and Cybersecurity Law,
to transmit data to the government.]{.underline} There indeed are
regulations about the obligation of cooperation and assistance for
national security reasons, but according to a leading Chinese professor
in cybersecurity law, Shenkuo Wu, [the interpretation of how it affects
Huawei's overseas operations is **not accurate**.]{.underline} It is
stipulated that such obligations should only be fulfilled by the ICT
companies directly operating within Chinese territory rather than their
overseas subsidiaries. The latter, on the other hand, are clearly
required by The Code of Conduct for Overseas Investment and Operation of
Private Enterprises to comply with the laws and regulations of the host
countries (regions). Clifford Chance, a global law firm headquartered in
London, also concluded that [\"**nowhere does Chinese law give Beijing
the authority to compel telecommunication equipment firms** to install
backdoors or listening devices---or to engage in any behavior that might
compromise network security."]{.underline}

[The second argument is that the Chinese government has given Huawei as
much as \$75 billion in subsidies, which gives it incomparable
advantages in the 5G market.]{.underline} It is a common practice for
companies to receive government grants supporting high tech research and
development. [Moreover, **audited data shows** that in the 10 years from
2009 to 2018, the total amount of direct grants Huawei received from the
Chinese government -- mostly in R&D incentives -- **was just 0.3% of
Huawei\'s total sales** of \$514 billion over the same
period.]{.underline} The high volume of investment by Huawei in R&D,
which was \$15 billion in 2018 as shown by The 2018 EU Industrial R&D
Investment Scoreboard, apparently contributed more to its success.
Huawei is listed as the 5th among 50 companies in this report, while its
main competitors such as Cisco, Nokia, and Ericsson are respectively
listed as the 25th, 27th, and 43rd.

[The third one suggests Huawei's close connection with the government
because of the military background of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, and
some other employees]{.underline}. It is well known that China has the
largest amount of military personnel. The active force is currently 2
million, 2.3 million in late 2015, and even larger before. A report from
PLA Daily shows there were altogether 5.7 million retired military
personnel as of July 2018. Most of them retired at an early age and
sought a second career as civilians. [It is also **very common** for
companies around the world to hire retired military personnel, but there
is **little suspicion** of them working for the government behind the
scenes.]{.underline}

//mh

[Chinese entities have been alleged to steal IP from foreign companies
using methods such as trading with or forming joint ventures with the
companies and then gaining access to their sensitive or proprietary
information]{.underline}. Businesses have also willingly allowed Chinese
partners to access this information in exchange for accessing China's
immense market. [Some examples of alleged Chinese IP theft include a
conspiracy to hack into U.S. defense contractors' computer networks to
steal sensitive military data and the fact that the Chinese military has
infrastructure that can look suspiciously similar to that used by the
United States.]{.underline} In the context of urging NATO allies to ban
Chinese 5G equipment, Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned at the
Department of Homeland Security's National Cybersecurity Summit last
September that China is committing "the greatest intellectual property
theft in human history."

Due to the clear costs of these and other alleged thefts, [there has
been a **strong bipartisan push by the U.S. government to curb
it**.]{.underline} [Earlier this month, following the China Initiative
Conference \[1\], the Attorney General and federal prosecutors told the
public that they **plan to be more aggressive in combating theft of U.S.
IP** by or on behalf of the Chinese government.]{.underline} [They plan
to do this by **prosecuting companies and individuals for IP theft** and
also through education and awareness programs.]{.underline} One
important prong will be educating American academic institutions of the
risk. Prosecutors noted that academic institutions create a lot of IP,
but do not protect it as well as private institutions do, making it more
susceptible to theft.

[Aside from federal prosecutors ramping up their enforcement, the U.S.
Department of Justice **(DOJ) is also acting to protect U.S.
IP**.]{.underline} On February 13th, [the **DOJ brought additional
charges** against Chinese telecommunications company, Huawei, including
charges for conspiracy to steal trade secrets.]{.underline} The DOJ
alleged that the company and its subsidiaries had either stolen, or
directed others to steal on its behalf, trade secrets and copyrighted
information through various creative means over decades in an effort to
benefit itself and cut costs.

### AT: Warming

#### [No impact]{.underline} to warming

Jay **Lehr 19**, Ph.D. in Groundwater Hydrology from the University of
Arizona, and Tom Harris, Executive Director of the International Climate
Science Coalition, "Global Warming Myth Debunked: Humans Have Minimal
Impact on Atmosphere's Carbon Dioxide and Climate", Western Journal,
2-14,
<https://www.westernjournal.com/global-warming-myth-debunked-humans-minimal-impact-atmospheres-carbon-dioxide-climate/>
\[language modified\]

Global [warming activists argue carbon-dioxide emissions are destroying
the planet, but the climate impacts of carbon dioxide are **minimal, at
worst**]{.underline}. Activists would also have you believe fossil-fuel
emissions have driven carbon-dioxide concentrations to their highest
levels in history. The Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency went so
far as to classify carbon dioxide as a toxic pollutant, and it
established a radical goal of closing all of America's coal-fired power
plants. [Claims of unprecedented]{.underline} carbon-dioxide [levels
ignore most of Earth's 4.6-billion-year history. Relative to Earth's
entire record, carbon-dioxide levels are at **historically low** levels;
they only appear high when compared to the dangerously low levels of
carbon dioxide that occurred in Earth's very recent history. The
geologic record reveals carbon dioxide has **almost always** been in
Earths' atmosphere in much greater concentrations than it is today. For
example, 600 million years ago, when history's greatest birth of new
animal species occurred]{.underline}, atmospheric carbon-dioxide
[concentrations exceeded 6,500]{.underline} parts per million [(ppm) ---
an amount that's **17 times** greater than it is today]{.underline}.
Atmospheric carbon dioxide is currently only 410 parts per million. That
means only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere is carbon dioxide (compared to
0.03 percent one century ago). Only one molecule in 2,500 is carbon
dioxide. Such levels certainly do not pose a health risk, as
carbon-dioxide levels in our naval submarines, which stay submerged for
months at a time, contain an average carbon-dioxide concentration of
5,000 ppm. The geologic record is important because it reveals
relationships between carbon-dioxide levels, climate, and life on Earth.
[Over billions of years, the geologic record shows there is **no
long-term correlation** between atmospheric carbon-dioxide levels and
Earth's climate. There are periods in Earth's history when carbon
dioxide concentrations were **many times** higher than they are today,
yet temperatures were identical to, or **even colder** than, modern
times. The claim that fossil-fuel emissions control atmospheric
carbon-dioxide concentrations is also **invalid**, as atmospheric
concentrations have gone up and down in the geological record, **even
without** human influence]{.underline}. The absurdity of climate
alarmism claims gets even stranger when you consider there are 7.5
billion people on our planet who, together, exhale 2.7 billion tons of
carbon dioxide each year, which is almost 10 percent of total
fossil-fuel emissions every year. However, we are but a single species.
Combined, people and all domesticated animals contribute 10 billion
tons. Further, [9 percent of carbon-dioxide emissions from all living
things arise not from animals, but from anaerobic bacteria and
fungi]{.underline}. These organisms metabolize dead plant and animal
matter in soil via decay processes that recycle carbon dioxide back into
the atmosphere. The grand total produced by all living things is
estimated to be 440 billion tons per year, or 13 times the amount of
carbon dioxide currently being produced by fossil-fuel emissions.
[Fossil-fuel emissions are **less than 10 percent** of biological
emissions]{.underline}. Are you laughing yet? [Every apocalyptic
pronouncement you hear or read is **\[totally wrong\]**]{.underline}
~~nothing short of insanity~~. Their primary goal is not to save plants,
humans, or animals, but rather to use climate "dangers" as a
justification for centralizing power in the hands of a select few.

### AT: Warming Wars

#### Warming won't cause global conflict

Dr. Ian **Cook 20**, Senior Lecturer in Global Politics and Policy at
Murdoch University, PhD in Political Theory from the University of
Queensland, The Politics of the Final Hundred Years of Humanity
(2030-2130), Springer Singapore, Kindle Edition

Yet **[a]{.underline}**nother [problem with the assumption that
catastrophic human-caused environment change simply causes civil
war]{.underline}, as Salehyan and Hendrix noted, [is that violence at
the scale of a civil war requires significant resources. In their view,
civil wars are more likely to occur in times of **relative abundance**.
While "**riots** and **protests**, may emerge]{.underline} from
conditions of scarcity," they argue, "[**sustaining** a militant
organization requires considerable planning and resources"]{.underline}
(Salehyan and Hendrix 2014, p. 240). [Reasons to fight might exist. For
this to turn into civil war, however, people "also need the
**capability**]{.underline} to do so, [and environmental scarcity may
**limit such capability**, thus **undermining the resource base
necessary** for mobilizing armed violence"]{.underline} (Salehyan and
Hendrix 2014, p. 240).

A related debate concerns what Adams and colleagues have claimed to be
[a **sampling bias** in studies of the connection between environment
change and armed conflict]{.underline} (Adams et al. 2018). Levy accepts
the existence of some sampling bias but rejects the view that this bias
results in an overstatement of the connection between environment change
and conflict. "Knowing that case selection is biased is useful, but not
a reason to lower our estimate of the climate's impact on conflict"
(Levy 2018, p. 441).

In responding to Levy's criticism, authors claiming bias wrote that they
did not "deny a link between climate change and conflict in principal.
Indeed, some of our own recent work indicates that such [a link exists,
but it is **highly conditional**]{.underline}." Their problem with the
research being done in this field was that "[sampling biases... increase
the risk that such links are **overstate**d]{.underline}, that [crucial
world regions do not receive sufficient attention]{.underline} and that
little knowledge is produced on peaceful adaptation" (Ide et al. 2018,
p. 442-- 3).

After reviewing the literature on the relationship between climate
change and violent conflict, Sakaguchi, Varughese and Auld concluded
that the "[current **lit**erature offers **mixed
ev**idence]{.underline}. This makes it difficult to render a definitive
statement about the climate-conflict relationship" (2017, p. 640). While
they pointed out that just over 60% of the studies they reviewed found
"that climate change variables are positively correlated with higher
levels of violent conflict," Sakaguchi, Varughese and Auld also argued
that "[many **subtleties** and **countertrends** underlie this overall
pattern]{.underline}" (2017, p. 640). Thus, even though "a majority of
reviewed studies envision climate variables influencing conflict through
a causal pathway, ... these [pathways are]{.underline} often
[**theoretically underspecified** and have **only weak empirical
support**]{.underline}" (Sakaguchi et al. 2017, p. 641).

As Koubi put it, the research that has been done on this question
"provides some evidence that climatic changes could act as a 'threat
multiplier' in several of the world's regions. In particular, the extant
literature shows that climatic conditions can lead to conflict in
agricultural-dependent regions and in combination and interaction with
other socioeconomic and political factors" (Koubi 2018, p. 200). After
having claimed that, to their knowledge, "[**no one** in the field of
climate research has suggested that climate change could be the **'sole
cause' of war**, violence, unrest or migration]{.underline}", Butler and
Kefford recommended "viewing climate change instead as a risk
multiplier, influencer or co-factor ... In this way of thinking,
environmental and ecological factors interact with social determinants,
including those that are economic, demographic and political, to produce
phenomena such as migration, conflict and famine" (2018, p. 587).

There can be no doubt that conflict will increase during the final
hundred years of humanity. But it will result from a complex interaction
of socio-political factors and a catastrophically changed environment.
It may not go beyond conflict between different groups or between the
government and opposition groups and become civil war. This depends on
the capacity of those opposition groups. In many cases, they will lack
the resources to conduct a civil war. The Syrian war is itself a good
illustration of the problem, as the groups opposed to the Syrian
government have only been able to conduct the extended civil war in
which they have been engaged with the support of outside groups.
(Mazzetti and Apuzzo 2016).

The question of whether civil war will break out is something that can
only be answered "region by region" and the answer must be based on
"knowledge of pre-conflict geographies, such as drivers of resilience
and vulnerability" (Farbotko 2018). Sometimes governments may abandon
territory and opposition groups can seize control of that land. But it
is likely to be land that is suffering worst from the effects of
catastrophic human-caused environment change and will not be habitable.
To replace an existing government or take control of a region within a
country through [civil war]{.underline} is no simple thing. It may
happen. But it will not happen on the scale that some people have
predicted. And it [will **not happen** just because of the
weather]{.underline}.

#### No climate wars

An evolving consensus that the earth is becoming warmer has led to
increased interest [in the social consequences of climate
change]{.underline}. Along with rising sea levels, varying patterns of
precipitation, vegetation, and possible resource scarcity, perhaps [the
most incendiary claims have to do with conflict and political
violence]{.underline}. A second [consensus has begun to emerge
among]{.underline} policy makers and [opinion leaders that]{.underline}
global [warming may]{.underline} well [result in increased civil
and]{.underline} even [interstate warfare]{.underline}, as groups and
nations compete for water, soil, or oil. Authoritative bodies, leading
government officials, and even the Nobel Peace prize committee have
highlighted the prospect that climate change will give rise to more
heated confrontations as communities compete in a warmer world.[Where
the basic science of climate change preceded policy]{.underline}, [this
second consensus among politicians and pundits about climate and
conflict **formed in the absence of substantial scientific
evidence**]{.underline}. [While anecdote]{.underline} and some focused
statistical research [suggests]{.underline} that [civil conflict may
have worsened]{.underline} in response to recent climate change in
developing regions (c.f., Homer-Dixon 1991, 1994; Burke et al. 2009).
[these claims have been **severely criticized** by other
studies]{.underline} (Nordas&Gleditsch 2007; Buhaug et al. 2010: Buhaug
2010).1 In contrast, [**long-term macro statistical studies** find that
**conflict increases in periods of climatic chill**]{.underline} (Zhang
et al. 2006, 2007; Tol& Wagner 2010).2 [Research on the more recent past
reveals that interstate conflict has declined in the second half of the
twentieth century, the very period during which global warming has begun
to make itself felt]{.underline} (Goldstein 2002; Levy et al. 2001;
Luard 1986, 1988; Hensel 2002; Sarkees, et al. 2003; Mueller 2009).3
While talk of a \'\'climatic peace" is premature, broader [claims that
global warming causes conflict must be evaluated in light of
**countervailing evidence**]{.underline} and a contrasting set of causal
theoretical claims.4

### AT: Disease

#### No extinction.

**Ord '20** \[Dr. Toby; 2020; Senior Research Fellow in Philosophy at
Oxford University, DPhil in Philosophy from the University of Oxford;
Hachette Books, "The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of
Humanity," p. 124-126\]

Are we safe now from events like this? Or are we more vulnerable? [Could
a pandemic threaten **humanity**'s future?]{.underline}10

The Black Death was not the only biological disaster to scar human
history. It was not even the only great bubonic plague. In 541 CE the
Plague of Justinian struck the Byzantine Empire. Over three years it
took the lives of roughly 3 percent of the world's people.11

When Europeans reached the Americas in 1492, the two populations exposed
each other to completely novel diseases. Over thousands of years each
population had built up resistance to their own set of diseases, but
were extremely susceptible to the others. The American peoples got by
far the worse end of exchange, through diseases such as measles,
influenza and especially smallpox.

During the next hundred years a combination of invasion and disease took
an immense toll---one whose scale may never be known, due to great
uncertainty about the size of the pre-existing population. We can't rule
out the loss of more than 90 percent of the population of the Americas
during that century, though the number could also be much lower.12 And
it is very difficult to tease out how much of this should be attributed
to war and occupation, rather than disease. As a rough upper bound, the
Columbian exchange may have killed as many as 10 percent of the world's
people.13

Centuries later, [the world had become so interconnected that a truly
global pandemic was possible]{.underline}. Near the end of the First
World War, a devastating strain of influenza (known as the 1918 flu or
Spanish Flu) spread to six continents, and even remote Pacific islands.
At least a third of the world's population were infected and 3 to 6
percent were killed.14 This death toll outstripped that of the First
World War, and possibly both World Wars combined.

[Yet even events like these **fall short** of being a threat to
**humanity**'s longterm potential]{.underline}.15

\[FOONOTE\]

[In addition to]{.underline} this [**historical** evidence, there are
some **deep**er **biological** observations and theories **suggest**ing
that **pathogens are unlikely to lead to the extinction** of their
hosts. These include the **empirical anti-correlation** between
**infectiousness** and **lethality**, the **extreme rarity** of diseases
that kill more than 75% of those infected, the observed **tendency** of
pandemics to **become less virulent** as they progress and the theory of
**optimal virulence**]{.underline}. However, there is no watertight case
against pathogens leading to the extinction of their hosts.

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

[In the great bubonic plagues we saw civilization in the affected areas
falter, but **recover**. The regional]{.underline} 25 to [**50 percent**
death rate was **not enough** to **precipitate a continent-wide
collapse** of civilization]{.underline}. It changed the relative
fortunes of empires, and may have altered the course of history
substantially, but [if anything, it gives us reason to believe that
human civilization is **likely to make it through** future events with
similar death rates, **even if**]{.underline} they were
**[global]{.underline}** in scale.

The 1918 flu pandemic was remarkable in having very little apparent
effect on the world's development despite its global reach. It looks
like it was lost in the wake of the First World War, which despite a
smaller death toll, seems to have had a much larger effect on the course
of history.16

It is less clear what lesson to draw from the Columbian exchange due to
our lack of good records and its mix of causes. Pandemics were clearly a
part of what led to a regional collapse of civilization, but we don't
know whether this would have occurred had it not been for the
accompanying violence and imperial rule. [The strongest case against
existential risk from natural pandemics is the **fossil
record**]{.underline} argument from Chapter 3. [Extinction risk from
natural causes above **0.1 percent per century** is **incompatible**
with the **evidence** of **how long** humanity and similar species have
lasted]{.underline}. But this argument only works where the risk to
humanity now is similar or lower than the longterm levels. For most
risks this is clearly true, but not for pandemics. We have done many
things to exacerbate the risk: some that could make pandemics more
likely to occur, and some that could increase their damage. Thus even
"natural" pandemics should be seen as a partly anthropogenic risk.

### AT: Pollution

#### No [pollution]{.underline} impacts

**Kareiva and Carranza, 18**---Institute of the Environment and
Sustainability, University of California, Los Angeles (Peter and
Valerie, "Existential risk due to ecosystem collapse: Nature strikes
back," Futures, available online January 5, 2018, ScienceDirect, dml)

Another hypothesized planetary boundary entails the conversion of
natural habitats to agricultural land. The mechanism by which too much
agricultural land could cause a crisis is unclear---unless it is because
land conversion causes so much biodiversity loss that species
extinctions are the proximate cause of an ecocatastrophe. [**Excessive
chemical pollution** and]{.underline} excessive [**atmospheric aerosol
loading** have each been suggested as planetary boundaries]{.underline}
as well. In the case of these pollution boundaries, [there are
**well-documented mechanisms** by which surpassing some concentration of
a pollutant inflicts severe human health hazards. There is **abundant
evidence** linking chemical and aerosol pollution to higher mortality
and lower reproductive success in humans]{.underline}, which in turn
could cause a major die-off. It is perhaps appropriate then that when
Hollywood envisions an unlivable world, it often invokes a story of
humans poisoning themselves. [That said, it is **doubtful** that we will
**poison ourselves towards extinction**. **Data show** that as nations
**develop** and **increase their wealth**, they tend to **clean up their
air** and **water** and **reduce environmental pollution**]{.underline}
(Flörke et al., 2013; Hao & Wang, 2005). [In addition, as economies
become **more circular**]{.underline} (see Mathews & Tan, 2016),
[environmental damage due to waste products is **likely to
decline**]{.underline}. The key point is that [the pollutants associated
with the planetary boundaries are **so widely recognized**, and the
consequences of local toxic events are **so immediate**, that it is
**reasonable** to expect national governments to **act before we suffer
a planetary ecocatastrophe**]{.underline}.

### AT: Smart Cities\-\--1NC

#### Smart cities are [inevitable]{.underline} -- population growth makes it [impossible to avoid]{.underline}

**Butler '21** \[Georgia, 10-18-2021, \"[Why **smart cities**
are]{.underline} both incredible and **[inevitable]{.underline}**,\"
Data Center Dynamics,

St. Mark's, AM\]

[When we look]{.underline} in[to the future, we]{.underline} have a
terrible habit of **[underestimat]{.underline}**ing [it]{.underline}. We
look at the last 10 years, how far technology has come in that time, and
expect this development to be mirrored in the decade coming.

This couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, [progress follows
the **law of accelerating returns** and the last 10 years saw
**significantly more growth** than the decade before]{.underline}.

Explained as simply as possible, the 'law of accelerating returns' is
based on the principle that [as we develop more technology]{.underline},
[further growth becomes easier]{.underline} to conceive. [We learn from
experience, and faster due to the resources available]{.underline} to
us.

[When we think about this velocity]{.underline}, [smart cities seem
**just around the corner**]{.underline}, and as a concept are heavily
reliant upon data centers for their success.

"[The world population]{.underline} presently [stands at]{.underline}
approximately [7.7 billion]{.underline} people, [with]{.underline}
nearly four billion or [54 percent]{.underline} living [in
cities]{.underline} today. By 2050, it\'s projected that more than
two-thirds of the world population will live in urban areas, with seven
billion of the expected 9.7 billion people occupying cities globally."

Marc Cram, the director of new market development for Server Technology,
a brand from Legrand, sees these [population densities]{.underline} as
**[directly related]{.underline}** [to the development of smart
cities]{.underline}. This is, in part, **[due to
necessity]{.underline}**. [As the population expands, we need
to]{.underline} find a way to **[manage it effectively]{.underline}**
[in the highly dense areas. Resources will be **stretched** and become
**reliant** on efficiency.]{.underline}

### AT: Smart Cities\-\--AT: 5G\-\--2NC

#### 5G implementation [fails]{.underline} -- transmission range and delays

Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) and director of the Center

[For cities to reach this potential]{.underline} sooner rather than
later, however, [they will need to]{.underline} accelerate the
deployment and adoption of 5G. One way is for cities to **[streamline
their permitting processes]{.underline}**. [5G uses small cells that can
transmit data faster but **not as far**]{.underline} as the towers of
past wireless networks. [As a result, the number of small cell
installations]{.underline} needed [**to fully implement** 5G is expected
to be]{.underline} 10 to **[100 times]{.underline}** [the number of
existing cell towers]{.underline}. [This means that **delays**,
inefficiencies and high costs in the permitting process take a **heavy
toll** on 5G deployment.]{.underline}

[While the **F**ederal **C**ommunications **C**ommission]{.underline}
[generally requires cities to approve]{.underline} or deny [5G
installations in **60 or 90 days**]{.underline} depending on the type of
application, cities can make themselves more attractive to firms
installing 5G by setting shorter timelines. For example, Austin, Texas,
has self-imposed a 40-day limit to approve or deny applications after a
slow application review process led to the city falling behind its
peers.

[In some U.S. cities, it's **slower than**]{.underline} the old
[4G]{.underline} system. Washington should make it a priority.

At this point, football fans have seen so many ads from AT&T and Verizon
claiming to have the fastest and most reliable 5G service on the planet
that those without a 5G smartphone might think they are really missing
something. Don't be misled. Unless you are traveling internationally,
you won't enjoy faster speeds with a new 5G-enabled smartphone than
you'd get on a 4G phone streaming games from New York, Los Angeles or
many other U.S. cities. AT&T's and Verizon's new 5G networks are often
significantly slower than the 4G networks they replace. [America is far
behind in almost **every dimension** of 5G]{.underline}
[while]{.underline} other nations---including
[China]{.underline}---**[race ahead]{.underline}**.

[America's average 5G mobile internet speed]{.underline} is roughly 75
megabits per second, which [is **abysmal**]{.underline}. [In China's
urban centers 5G phones get average speeds of 300 megabits per
second]{.underline}. Though that's not quite the fastest 5G in the
world---[South Korea claims that title at over 400
Mbps]{.underline}---it's still [fast enough to download a
high-definition movie in two minutes]{.underline}. Mobile internet speed
is a central advancement of 5G, which enables a new domain of
breakthrough applications with potent economic and national-security
implications. [American 5G upload speeds are slower than]{.underline}
those of many [developed countries, including Israel, Singapore and
Canada]{.underline}. In Boston, Chicago and New York City, AT&T's 5G
speeds are at least 10% slower than its 4G; in Washington, Los Angeles
and Austin, Texas, Verizon's 5G speeds are at least 20% slower than the
company's 4G.

[The U.S]{.underline}. also [trails China in the global market for
5G]{.underline}-related [services]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline}
**[American sanctions]{.underline}** have [hurt Huawei]{.underline},
[China's national champion is still the **global leader**]{.underline}
[in supplying]{.underline} [5G infrastructure]{.underline} with [30% of
the market]{.underline}, while **[no U.S. firms sell 5G infrastructure
abroad]{.underline}**. [Strategically significant countries including
Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Turkey]{.underline} have
**[installed Huawei infrastructure]{.underline}** and [are already using
it to deliver 5G services.]{.underline}

[While Beijing has **prioritized** broadening its 5G
network]{.underline}, [Washington has a]{.underline} **[dysfunctional
relationship]{.underline}** [with the U.S. mobile
industry]{.underline}---as [typified by the]{.underline} Federal
[Aviation Administration's hysterics over the proximity of American
airports to 5G services]{.underline}, which operate near scores of
airports around the world with no problem. For its part, [China has been
rapidly allocating the most efficient part of the wireless
spectrum]{.underline}, called midband, [to 5G service
providers]{.underline}. [China has deployed at least three times as much
midband to 5G providers as the U.S. has. AT&T and Verizon]{.underline}
are using the same spectrum bands for both their 4G and 5G networks. As
a result, as one industry analyst aptly put it, their [5G networks are
"just **4G with sprinkles** on it."]{.underline}

[Washington's dithering]{.underline} has [left America well behind
China]{.underline} [in the race to build 5G infrastructure]{.underline}.
Because 5G signals have short wavelengths, reliable service requires
proximity to many wireless base stations. [China has installed more than
one million 5G base stations]{.underline}, while [the U.S. has built
only 100,000]{.underline}. [The American fiber-optic network
is]{.underline} also **[less dense]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}
that of [many developed countries]{.underline} like Japan, [making it
more difficult for mobile operators to deploy these small cell
sites]{.underline}.

[China's investment in 5G also]{.underline} ~~dwarfs~~ \[[is much better
than]{.underline}\] **[America's]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
Innovation and [Competition Act]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} Senate
Majority Leader Chuck [Schumer]{.underline} [hailed]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} "[the key to preserving America's position on the world
stage]{.underline} as a current and future technological leader in the
21st century," [would authorize \$1.5 billion in spending on 5G
mobile]{.underline} [networks]{.underline} through 2026. **[China has
already spent \$50 billion]{.underline}** [to build out its 5G network
and is on track to spend an additional \$100 billion on 5G over the next
five years]{.underline}.

[The pathetic U.S. performance]{.underline} **[in the 5G
race]{.underline}** [is a sign of America's larger failure to keep up
with China on]{.underline} strategically [important
technologies]{.underline}. [China is also ahead of America in high-tech
**manufacturing, green energy**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} many
[applications of **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}. On
current trajectories, [by 2030 it will likely lead the U.S. in the
number of semiconductor chips it produces and in applications
of]{.underline} **[biotechnology]{.underline}** [to defeat]{.underline}
**[diseases]{.underline}** like **[cancer]{.underline}**.

In 2019 [the Pentagon's]{.underline} Defense [Innovation
Board]{.underline} [tried to **sound the alarm**]{.underline},
[stating]{.underline} bluntly: "[China is on a track to repeat in 5G
what happened with the U.S. in 4G]{.underline}." The transition from 3G
to 4G made possible a previously unimaginable world of mobile computing,
smartphones and applications from Google Maps and Uber to Facebook and
Instagram. [The step up to real 5G speeds will lead to analogous
breakthroughs in autonomous vehicles, virtual-reality
applications]{.underline} like the metaverse, [and other areas that have
yet to be invented]{.underline}. [Applications]{.underline} abound [that
could advantage a country's intelligence agencies and enhance its
military capabilities]{.underline}.

It [will take far more than an additional \$1.5 billion investment from
Congress to change this]{.underline}. The [Biden]{.underline}
administration [should make 5G a national priority and take the lead in
building digital highways across the country]{.underline} as the
government did in creating our national highway system. [Otherwise,
**China will own the 5G future**]{.underline}. -- Via The Wall Street

[Xi]{.underline} Jinping [is]{.underline} a man **[on a
mission]{.underline}**.

Next on [Xi's agenda]{.underline} was the need [to assert]{.underline}
**[China's interests]{.underline}** [on the global stage]{.underline}.
[Xi]{.underline} quickly [began]{.underline} **[land reclamation
efforts]{.underline}** [in the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea, established
an]{.underline} [air defense identification zone over]{.underline}
**[disputed territory]{.underline}** in the East China Sea, helped
launch the New Development Bank (sometimes called the BRICS Bank),
unveiled the massive international infrastructure project that came to
be known as the Belt and Road Initiative, and proposed the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank.

[Xi continued to slash]{.underline} his way through [the status
quo]{.underline} for the remainder of his first term [and shows no signs
of abating as he approaches the end of his second.]{.underline} **[His
consolidation]{.underline}** [of power]{.underline} continues
**[uninterrupted]{.underline}**: [he faces]{.underline}
**[no]{.underline}** genuine **[political rivals]{.underline}**, has
[removed term limits]{.underline} on his tenure in office,
[and]{.underline} has **[installed allies]{.underline}** and loyalists
[in key positions]{.underline}. New [research centers]{.underline} are
dedicated to [studying]{.underline} his [writings]{.underline} and
speeches, [party officials]{.underline} publicly **[extol]{.underline}**
[his wisdom and virtue]{.underline}, and [party regulations]{.underline}
and government planning documents increasingly [claim to be based
on]{.underline} "**[Xi Jinping Thought]{.underline}**." [He
has]{.underline} asserted the [CCP's dominance over]{.underline} vast
[swaths of Chinese]{.underline} society and economic [life]{.underline},
even [forcing]{.underline} influential business and **[technology
titans]{.underline}** [to beg]{.underline} **[forgiveness]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} their **[insufficient]{.underline}** [loyalty to the
party]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [he continues to expand]{.underline}
[China's international]{.underline} **[sphere of
influence]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} the exercise of [hard
power]{.underline}, [economic coercion]{.underline}, [and deep
integration into]{.underline} international and [multilateral
bodies]{.underline}.

Many outside observers, myself included, initially believed that [the
party's inability to contain]{.underline} the outbreak [of COVID-19
highlighted]{.underline} the [weaknesses of China's system]{.underline}.
By the summer of 2020, however, [Xi was able to exto]{.underline}l the
[virtues of **centralized control**]{.underline} in checking the
pandemic's domestic spread. Far from undermining his political
authority, [Beijing's iron-fisted approach to combating the virus
has]{.underline} now [become]{.underline} a point of **[national
pride.]{.underline}**

**[A UNIQUE MOMENT]{.underline}**

[Xi's fast pace was provoked by]{.underline} a convergence of
[geopolitical]{.underline}, [demographic]{.underline},
[economic]{.underline}, [environmental]{.underline}, and
**[technological]{.underline}** **[changes]{.underline}**. [The
risks]{.underline} they pose [are daunting, but]{.underline}
[not]{.underline} yet [existential]{.underline}; [Beijing has
a]{.underline} window of [opportunity]{.underline} [to address
them]{.underline} before they become fatal. And the potential rewards
they offer are considerable.

The first major change is Beijing's assessment that the power and
influence of the West have entered a phase of accelerated decline, and
as a result, [a new era of multipolarity has begun]{.underline}, one
that **[China could shape]{.underline}** more [to its
liking]{.underline}. [This view took hold as the U.S. wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq became quagmires]{.underline}, and it solidified in
the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which the Chinese leadership saw
as the death knell for U.S. global prestige. In 2016, the British vote
to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as
president in the United States fortified the consensus view that the
United States, and the West more generally, was in decline. This might
suggest that [China could opt for strategic patience and]{.underline}
simply **[allow American power to wane]{.underline}**. But [the
possibility of a renewal of U.S. leadership brought]{.underline} about
by [the advent of]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline}
administration---[and concerns about Xi's mortality]{.underline} (he
will be 82 in 2035)---[means]{.underline} that [Beijing is **unwilling**
to]{.underline} wait and [see how long]{.underline} this phase of
**[Western decline will last]{.underline}**.

[The second important force confronting Xi is]{.underline} China's
deteriorating **[demographic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** [outlook]{.underline}. By the time he assumed
office, [China's population]{.underline} was simultaneously [aging and
shrinking]{.underline}, and [the country]{.underline} was
[facing]{.underline} an imminent surge of [retirees]{.underline} that
would [stress the]{.underline} country's relatively weak [health-care
and pension systems]{.underline}. The [Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences]{.underline} now expects [China's population to peak in
2029]{.underline}, and a recent study in The Lancet forecast that it
will shrink by nearly 50 percent by the end of the century. Although
Beijing ended its draconian one-child policy in 2016, [the
country]{.underline} has still [recorded a 15 percent decline in
births]{.underline} during the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the government
estimates that by 2033, nearly one-third of the population will be over
the age of 60.

[Contributing to these woes is China's shrinking workforce]{.underline}
[and rising wages]{.underline}, which have increased by [ten
percent]{.underline}, on average, since 2005. Larger paychecks are good
for workers, but [global manufacturers are]{.underline} increasingly
[moving]{.underline} their [operations]{.underline} **[out of
China]{.underline}** and [to lower-cost countries]{.underline},
[leaving]{.underline} a rising number of [low-skilled workers in
China]{.underline} unemployed or underemployed. And
[because]{.underline} [only 12.5 percent of China's labor
force]{.underline} has [graduated]{.underline} from college (compared
with 24 percent in the United States), [positioning the bulk of the
country's workforce to compete for the high-skilled jobs]{.underline} of
the future **[will be an uphill battle]{.underline}**.

[Directly related]{.underline} to this worrying demographic picture [is
the **slowdown** of China's]{.underline} [economy]{.underline}. With
[annual GDP growth]{.underline} having [dropped]{.underline} from a high
of 14 percent in 2007 [to the mid-single digits]{.underline} today,
[many]{.underline} of the [long-standing problems]{.underline} Beijing
[had been able to sweep under the rug now require attention and a
willingness to accept economic]{.underline} and political
[pain]{.underline}, from **[unwinding]{.underline}** [the vast sea of
indebted companies to demanding]{.underline} that [firms]{.underline}
and individuals [pay more into]{.underline} the country's [tax
coffers]{.underline}. [At the heart]{.underline} of China's growth woes
[is flagging productivity]{.underline}. [Throughout]{.underline} the
first several [decades]{.underline} of the post-Mao reform period,
realizing productivity gains was relatively straightforward, as
[the]{.underline} planned [economy was dissolved in favor
of]{.underline} **[market forces]{.underline}** and droves of
[citizens]{.underline} voluntarily [fled the countryside for urban and
coastal areas]{.underline} and the [promise of higher-wage]{.underline}
[jobs.]{.underline} [Later]{.underline}, as [foreign companies brought
investment, **technology**, and **know-how** to the
country]{.underline}, [i**ndustrial efficiency** continued to
improve]{.underline}. Finally, [the massive amounts spent on
infrastructure]{.underline}, especially roads and rail, **[boosted
connectivity]{.underline}** and thus **[productivity]{.underline}**.
[All]{.underline} of this [helped a poor]{.underline} and primarily
[agricultural economy]{.underline} rapidly [catch up with]{.underline}
more **[advanced]{.underline}** [economies]{.underline}.

Yet [by the time Xi assumed power]{.underline},
**[policymakers]{.underline}** were [finding it]{.underline}
increasingly [difficult to maintain momentum without
creating]{.underline} **[unsustainable levels of debt]{.underline}**,
just as they had done in response to the 2008 global financial crisis.
What is more, [the country was already saturated with transportation
infrastructure]{.underline}, so an additional mile of [road]{.underline}
[or high-speed rail]{.underline} [wasn't going to add much to
growth]{.underline}. And [because almost all able-bodied
workers]{.underline} had already [moved from the
countryside]{.underline} to urban areas, **[relocating
labor]{.underline}** [wouldn't arrest]{.underline} the
[decline]{.underline} [in productivity]{.underline}, either. Finally,
[the social and environmental costs of China's]{.underline}
**[previous]{.underline}** [growth paradigm had become]{.underline} both
**[unsustainable]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[destabilizing]{.underline}**, as staggering [air pollution and
environmental devastation]{.underline} **[provoked]{.underline}** acute
[anger among Chinese citizens]{.underline}.

[Perhaps]{.underline} the most [consequential shifts]{.underline} [to
have occurred on Xi's watch are]{.underline} advances in **[new
technologies]{.underline}** such as [**a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline}, [robotics]{.underline}, and biomedical
[engineering]{.underline}, among others. Xi believes that [dominating
the]{.underline} "**[commanding heights]{.underline}**" [of
these]{.underline} new [tools]{.underline} [will play a]{.underline}
**[critical role in]{.underline}** China's [economic]{.underline},
[military]{.underline}, [and geopolitical fate]{.underline}, and [he has
mobilized the party to]{.underline} **[transform]{.underline}** [the
country into a high-tech powerhouse.]{.underline} This includes
[expending vast sums to develop the country's]{.underline} **[R &
D]{.underline}** and production capabilities [in technologies deemed
critical to national security]{.underline}, from
**[semiconductors]{.underline}** to batteries. As Xi stated in 2014,
[first-mover advantage will go to]{.underline} "[whoever holds the nose
of]{.underline} the ox of science and **[technology
innovation]{.underline}**."

[Xi]{.underline} also [hopes]{.underline} that new [technologies can
help the CCP overcome]{.underline}, or at least circumvent, nearly [all
of China's domestic challenges]{.underline}. [The negative impacts of a
shrinking workforce]{.underline}, he believes, [can be blunted
by]{.underline} an aggressive push toward **[automation]{.underline}**,
and [job losses]{.underline} in traditional industries [can be offset
by]{.underline} opportunities in newer, **[high-tech
sectors]{.underline}**. "[Whether we can stiffen our back in the
international arena]{.underline} and cross the 'middle-income trap'
[depends]{.underline} to a large extent [on]{.underline} the improvement
of science and [technology innovation capability]{.underline}," [Xi
said]{.underline} in 2014.

[New technologies]{.underline} [serve other purposes]{.underline}, as
well. [Facial recognition]{.underline} tools [and]{.underline}
[**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline} [give China's internal
security organs new ways to]{.underline} surveil citizens and [suppress
dissent]{.underline}. [The party's]{.underline} "[military-civil
fusion]{.underline}" strategy [strives to harness]{.underline} these
[new technologies to significantly bolster]{.underline} the **[Chinese
military's warfighting capabilities]{.underline}**. And [advances in
green technology offer the prospect of]{.underline} simultaneously
[pursuing economic **growth** and]{.underline}
**[pollution]{.underline}** abatement, two goals Beijing has generally
seen as being in tension.

**[THE PARANOID STYLE IN CHINESE POLITICS]{.underline}**

This convergence of changes and developments would have occurred
regardless of who assumed power in China in 2012. Perhaps another leader
would have undertaken a similarly bold agenda. Yet among contemporary
Chinese political figures, [Xi]{.underline} has [demonstrated an
unrivaled skill for bureaucratic infighting]{.underline}. And [he
clearly believes]{.underline} that [he is a figure of]{.underline}
**[historical significance]{.underline}**, on [whom the CCP's fate
rests]{.underline}.

In order to push forward significant change, [Xi]{.underline} [has
overseen the construction of a **new political order**]{.underline}, one
[underpinned by a massive increase in the]{.underline} power and
**[authority]{.underline}** [of the CCP]{.underline}. Yet beyond this
elevation of party power, perhaps [Xi's most critical legacy will be his
expansive redefinition of]{.underline} **[national
security]{.underline}**. His advocacy of [a]{.underline} "[comprehensive
national security concept]{.underline}" emerged in early 2014, and in a
speech that April, he announced that China faced "[the most complicated
internal and external factors in its history]{.underline}." Although
this was clearly hyperbole---[**war** with the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} in Korea and the nationwide famine of the late
1950s [were more complicated]{.underline}---[Xi's message]{.underline}
to the political system [was clear]{.underline}: **[a new era of risk
and uncertainty confronts the party]{.underline}**.

The [CCP's]{.underline} long experience of [defections]{.underline},
attempted [coups]{.underline}, [and subversion]{.underline} by outside
actors [predisposes it to]{.underline} acute **[paranoia]{.underline}**,
something that reached a fever pitch in the Mao era. [Xi risks
**institutionalizing**]{.underline} [this]{.underline}
**[paranoid]{.underline}** **[style]{.underline}**. [One
result]{.underline} of blurring the line between internal and external
security [has been]{.underline} **[threat inflation]{.underline}**:
[party cadres in low-crime]{.underline}, [low-risk areas]{.underline}
now [issue warnings of terrorism]{.underline}, "[color
revolutions]{.underline}," and "[Christian infiltration]{.underline}."
In Xinjiang, [fears of separatism]{.underline} have been used to
[justify turning the entire region into a]{.underline}
**[dystopian]{.underline}** high-tech **[prison]{.underline}**. And in
Hong Kong, [Xi]{.underline} has [established]{.underline} a "[national
security]{.underline}" [bureaucracy]{.underline} [that can
**ignore**]{.underline} local [laws]{.underline} [and operate
in]{.underline} total **[secrecy]{.underline}** [as it weeds out
**perceived threats**]{.underline} [to Beijing's iron-fisted
rule]{.underline}. In both places, [Xi has demonstrated]{.underline}
that [he is willing to accept international opprobrium when he feels
that the party's core interests are at stake.]{.underline}

At home, [Xi stokes]{.underline} **[nationalist sentiment]{.underline}**
by [framing China as]{.underline} **[surrounded]{.underline}** and
besieged [by enemies]{.underline}, exploiting a deeply emotional (and
highly distorted) view of the past, and romanticizing China's battles
against the Japanese in World War II and its "victory" over the United
States in the Korean War. By [warning that China]{.underline} has
[entered a period of heightened risk from]{.underline} "**[hostile
foreign forces]{.underline}**," [Xi is attempting to accommodate Chinese
citizens to the idea of]{.underline} more [difficult times]{.underline}
ahead [and ensure that the party and he himself are viewed
as]{.underline} **[stabilizing forces.]{.underline}**

[Xi]{.underline} has [placed China on a **risky
trajectory**]{.underline}, one that threatens the achievements his
predecessors secured.

Meanwhile, [to exploit a perceived window of opportunity during an
American retreat from global affairs]{.underline}, [Beijing]{.underline}
has **[advanced aggressively]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} multiple
[**fo**reign **po**licy fronts]{.underline}. [These include]{.underline}
the use of "[gray zone]{.underline}" [tactics]{.underline}, such as
employing commercial fishing boats to assert territorial interests in
the South China Sea and [establishing China's]{.underline} first
**[overseas military base]{.underline}**, in Djibouti. [China's vast
domestic market]{.underline} has [allowed Xi to threaten countries that
don't demonstrate political]{.underline} and diplomatic
**[obedience]{.underline}**, as evidenced by Beijing's recent campaign
of economic coercion against Australia in response to Canberra's call
for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus that
causes COVID-19. Similarly, Xi has encouraged Chinese "Wolf Warrior"
diplomats to intimidate and harass host countries that criticize or
otherwise antagonize China. Earlier this year, Beijing levied sanctions
against Jo Smith Finley, a British anthropologist and political
scientist who studies Xinjiang, and the Mercator Institute for China
Studies, a German think tank, whose work the CCP claimed had "severely
harm\[ed\] China's sovereignty and interests."

Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping demonstrated strategic patience in
asserting China's interests on the global stage. Indeed, Mao told U.S.
President Richard Nixon that China could wait 100 years to reclaim
Taiwan, and Deng negotiated the return of Hong Kong under the promise
(since broken by Xi) of a 50-year period of local autonomy. Both leaders
had a profound sense of China's relative fragility and the importance of
careful, nuanced statesmanship. Xi does not share their equanimity, or
their confidence in long-term solutions.

That has sparked concerns that [Xi will attempt an extraordinarily risky
gambit to take Taiwan]{.underline} by force **[by 2027]{.underline}**,
the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army.
It seems doubtful, however, that he would invite a possible military
conflict with the United States just 110 miles from China's shoreline.
Assuming the PLA were successful in overcoming Taiwan's defenses, to say
nothing of surmounting possible U.S. involvement, [Xi would then have to
carry out a military occupation against sustained resistance for an
indeterminate length of time]{.underline}. An attempted [takeover of
Taiwan would undermine]{.underline} nearly all of [Xi's other
global]{.underline} and domestic [ambitions]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
[although the more extreme scenarios might remain unlikely]{.underline}
for the time being**[, Xi will continue]{.underline}** [to have China
flaunt its strength]{.underline} in its neighborhood and push outward in
pursuit of its interests. On many issues, he appears to want final
resolution on his watch.

**[THE MAN OF THE SYSTEM]{.underline}**

[Xi's tendency to]{.underline} believe he can [shape the]{.underline}
precise [course o]{.underline}f **[China's trajectory]{.underline}**
calls to mind the economist Adam Smith's description of "the man of
system": [a leader]{.underline} "so [enamored with the]{.underline}
supposed [beauty of his]{.underline} own ideal plan of
[government]{.underline}, that **[he cannot suffer]{.underline}** [the
smallest deviation from any part of it]{.underline}." In order to
realize his near-term goals, Xi has abandoned the invisible hand of the
market and forged an economic system that relies on state actors to
reach predetermined objectives.

Critical to this shift has been Xi's reliance on industrial policy, a
tool of economic statecraft that had fallen out of favor until near the
end of the tenure of Xi's predecessor, Hu, when it began to shape
Beijing's approach to technological innovation. The year 2015 marked an
important inflection point, with the introduction of supersized
industrial policy programs that sought not just to advance a given
technology or industry but also to remake the entire structure of the
economy. These included the Made in China 2025 plan, which aims to
upgrade China's manufacturing capabilities in a number of important
sectors; the Internet Plus strategy, a scheme to integrate information
technology into more traditional industries; and the 14th Five-Year
Plan, which outlines an ambitious agenda to decrease China's reliance on
foreign technology inputs. Through such policies, Beijing channels tens
of trillions of yuan into companies, technologies, and sectors it
considers strategically significant. It does this by means of direct
subsidies, tax rebates, and quasi-market "government guidance funds,"
which resemble state-controlled venture capital firms.

Thus far, Beijing's track record in this area is decidedly mixed: in
many cases, vast sums of investment have produced meager returns. But as
the economist Barry Naughton has cautioned, "Chinese industrial policies
are so large, and so new, that we are not yet in a position to evaluate
them. They may turn out to be successful, but it is also possible that
they will turn out to be disastrous."

Xi believes he can mold China's future as did the emperors of the
country's storied past.

Related to this industrial policy is Xi's approach to China's
private-sector companies, including many of the technological and
financial giants that just a few years ago observers viewed as possible
agents of political and social change. Technological innovation put
firms such as Ant Group and Tencent in control of critical new data
flows and financial technology. Xi clearly perceived this as an
unacceptable threat, as demonstrated by the CCP's recent spiking of Ant
Group's initial public offering in the wake of comments made by its
founder, Jack Ma, that many perceived as critical of the party.

[Xi is willing to forgo a boost in China's international financial
prestige to protect the party's interests and send a signal to business
elites: the party comes first]{.underline}. This is no David and Goliath
story, however. It's more akin to a family feud, given the close and
enduring connections between China's nominally private firms and its
political system. Indeed, nearly all of China's most successful
entrepreneurs are members of the CCP, and for many companies, success
depends on favors granted by the party, including protection from
foreign competition. But whereas previous Chinese leaders granted wide
latitude to the private sector, Xi has forcefully drawn a line. Doing so
has further restricted the country's ability to innovate. No matter how
sophisticated Beijing's regulators and state investors may be, sustained
innovation and gains in productivity cannot occur without a vibrant
private sector.

GRAND STRATEGY OR GRAND TRAGEDY?

[In order to seize]{.underline} temporary [advantages and
**forestall**]{.underline} [domestic challenges]{.underline},
[Xi]{.underline} has [positioned himself for a]{.underline} 15-year
**[race]{.underline}**, one for which [he has mobilized]{.underline} the
awesome [capabilities of a system]{.underline} that he now commands
**[unchallenged]{.underline}**. [Xi's]{.underline} truncated [time frame
compels a sense of urgency that will define Beijing's]{.underline}
policy [agenda]{.underline}, risk tolerance, and willingness to
compromise as it sprints ahead. [This will narrow the options available
to countries hoping to shape China's behavior]{.underline} or hoping
that the "Wolf Warrior" attitude will naturally recede.

[The **U**nited States can disprove Beijing's contention that its
democracy has atrophied]{.underline} and that Washington's star is
dimming [by strengthening the resilience of American
society]{.underline} and improving the competence of the U.S.
government. [If the United States and its allies invest in
innovation]{.underline} and human capital, **[they can
forestall]{.underline}** [Xi's efforts to gain first-mover advantage in
**emerging**]{.underline} and critical **[technologies]{.underline}**.
Likewise, [a more active]{.underline} and forward-looking [U.S. role in
shaping the global order would limit Beijing's ability to spread
illiberal ideas]{.underline} beyond China's borders.

Unwittingly, [Xi has put China into **competition with
itself**]{.underline}, in a race [to determine if its]{.underline} many
[strengths]{.underline} **[can outstrip]{.underline}** [the pathologies
that Xi]{.underline} himself has [introduced to the system]{.underline}.
By the time he assumed power, [the CCP]{.underline} had [established
a]{.underline} fairly [predictable process for the]{.underline} regular
and peaceful **[transition of power]{.underline}**. Next fall, the 20th
Party Congress will be held, and normally, a leader who has been in
charge as long as Xi has would step aside. To date, however, there is no
expectation that Xi will do so. This is an extraordinarily risky move,
not just for the CCP itself but also for the future of China. With no
successor in sight, if Xi dies unexpectedly in the next decade, the
country could be thrown into chaos.

Even assuming that Xi remains healthy while in power, [the longer his
tenure **persists**]{.underline}, [the more the CCP will resemble a
**cult of personality**]{.underline}, as it did under Mao. Elements of
this are already evident, with visible sycophancy among China's
political class now the norm. [Paeans to the greatness of
"Xi]{.underline} Jinping Thought" [may strike outsiders as]{.underline}
merely [curious]{.underline} or even comical, [but they have a
genuinely]{.underline} **[deleterious]{.underline}** [effect on the
quality of **decision-making**]{.underline} [and information flows
within the party]{.underline}.

### China Good\-\--2NC

#### China's 5G [revolutionizes]{.underline} AI, biotechnology, and green tech\-\--[winning]{.underline} the [tech race]{.underline} is key

**Kharpal 22** (Arjun Kharpal, CNBC's senior technology correspondent,
based in London, 2-17-2022, "'Pathetic' performance has left U.S. 'well
behind' China in 5G race, ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt says," CNBC,
https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/17/us-well-behind-china-in-5g-race-ex-google-ceo-eric-schmidt-says.html,
DOA: 7-5-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

[The U.S. government's]{.underline} "**[dithering]{.underline}**" has
[left the country]{.underline} "**[well behind]{.underline}**" [China in
the race to build]{.underline} out [5G technology]{.underline}, former
Google CEO Eric Schmidt said, as he urged Washington to step up
investment in the next-generation internet technology.

Writing in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Schmidt and Graham
Allison, a professor of government at Harvard, said that [America is
"far behind in]{.underline} almost **[every dimension]{.underline}** [of
5G]{.underline} while other
[nations]{.underline}---[including]{.underline} [China]{.underline} ---
race ahead."

The authors urged the Biden administration to make 5G a "national
priority." Otherwise, they said, "**[China will own the 5G
future]{.underline}**."

[5G refers to next-generation]{.underline} wireless
[internet]{.underline} [that promises super-fast download
speeds]{.underline}. But [it could also form the basis for **industrial
and military applications**]{.underline} [and form a way for devices
to]{.underline} **[communicate]{.underline}** with each other. That's
why [it's seen as a critical technology and one of the reasons **China
is moving quickly with its own 5G rollout**]{.underline} and future
applications.

"[The step up to real 5G speeds will lead to]{.underline} analogous
**[breakthroughs]{.underline}** in autonomous vehicles, virtual-reality
applications like the metaverse, and other areas that have yet to be
invented," Schmidt and Allison wrote. "[Applications abound that could
advantage a country's intelligence agencies and enhance its military
capabilities]{.underline}."

[The pair also accused the U.S. of falling behind]{.underline} in a
number of areas. They said that [China's average 5G download speed is
significantly faster than the U.S.'s.]{.underline}

[China's median download speed was]{.underline} just over [299 megabits
per second]{.underline} in the third quarter of 2021 [versus 93.73
megabits per second in the U.S.]{.underline}, according to Speedtest, a
company which measures internet speeds.

"[Mobile internet speed is a]{.underline} **[central
advancement]{.underline}** [of 5G]{.underline}, [which enables
a]{.underline} **[new domain of breakthrough]{.underline}**
[applications with potent]{.underline} **[economic]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} national-**[security]{.underline}**
[implications]{.underline}," Allison and Schmidt said.

The authors also said that **[Huawei]{.underline}**, China's biggest
telecommunications equipment maker, still **[dominates the
market]{.underline}** "[although American sanctions have hurt
Huawei."]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [China has been]{.underline} "rapidly [allocating the most
efficient part]{.underline}" of the wireless spectrum, called
[midband]{.underline}, [to telecommunications]{.underline}
[companies]{.underline}. The authors claimed that AT&T and Verizon are
using the same spectrum band for both their 4G and 5G networks in the
U.S.

Allison and Schmidt also said that **[China is outspending the
U.S]{.underline}**. [when it comes to 5G]{.underline}.

"[The pathetic U.S. performance]{.underline} in the 5G race is [a sign
of America's larger failure to keep up with China on]{.underline}
strategically important [technologies]{.underline}. [China is also ahead
of America in]{.underline} high-tech manufacturing, [green
energy]{.underline} and many **[applications of artificial
intelligence]{.underline}**," they said.

"On current trajectories, [by 2030 it will likely lead the U.S. in the
number of semiconductor chips it produces and in applications of
biotechnology to defeat diseases like cancer]{.underline}."

Schmidt has been critical of the U.S. government's approach to
technologies he views as key to the future and has warned on several
occasions about the threat of China overtaking.

Last year, a report by the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence, which Schmidt chairs, said [China could soon replace the
U.S. as the world's]{.underline} "**[AI superpower]{.underline}**" and
[that could have serious military implications to consider]{.underline}.

### China Good\-\--Innovation\-\--2NC

#### Chinese [5G]{.underline} is safe, spills out [globally]{.underline}, and drives technological [innovation]{.underline}

**Xiang 20** (Nina Xiang, the founder of China Money Network, a media
platform tracking China\'s venture and tech sectors, 9-8-2020, \"How
China winning the race to install 5G will be good for the world,\"
Nikkei Asia,
https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/How-China-winning-the-race-to-install-5G-will-be-good-for-the-world,
DOA: 7-5-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

It seems **[nothing]{.underline}** [can stop China from]{.underline}
[winning the **global race**]{.underline} [to install 5G]{.underline}
telecommunications [technology]{.underline}. **[Not government
bans]{.underline}**, [nor the debilitating COVID-19
pandemic]{.underline}.

Despite these grave challenges, when it comes to 5G [China
is]{.underline} actually **[extending]{.underline}** [its lead
while]{.underline} other countries are plagued by delays.

By the end of July, [China\'s 5G users]{.underline} had already
**[surpassed]{.underline}** [88 million]{.underline}, accounting for
over [80% of]{.underline} users [worldwide]{.underline} \-- far ahead of
the previously projected 70% share for the whole of 2020. By the end of
this year, [the number of]{.underline} **[5G base
stations]{.underline}** [in China is expected to reach nearly one
million]{.underline}, **[by far]{.underline}** [the biggest tally
**globally**]{.underline}.

And **[despite]{.underline}** [the U.S. cutting off the]{.underline}
[supply of crucial mobile chips]{.underline}, **[China\'s
Huawei]{.underline}** Technologies [remains the top filer of
standard-essential 5G patents]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} the
[telecommunications giant set to remain a top **global supplier** of 5G
equipment]{.underline}.

Compare this to some regions in the U.K., where delays of up to three
years are expected for the rollout of 5G technology after the government
decided to strip Huawei from its networks. Or elsewhere in Europe, where
COVID-19 is expected to slow the 5G rollout by up to 18 months. Even
[the U.S. looks]{.underline} **[certain]{.underline}** [to
lag]{.underline} far [behind China in the 5G race]{.underline}, despite
the Trump Administration trying to speed things up last month by making
a crucial new chunk of spectrum available to telecom carriers.

Yes, the 5G rivalry is threatening to further divide the world\'s
digital universe by accelerating the U.S.-China decoupling in multiple
dimensions and further disrupting global supply chains. But if we look
beyond these geopolitical complications, and focus instead on the
certainty that China\'s 5G leadership provides, then the current period
can also be seen in a more constructive and beneficial light.

[The world does not have to suffer]{.underline} or break apart [just
because]{.underline} **[China leads]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
next-generation wireless [technology]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} the
area of consumer internet [innovation]{.underline}, [all]{.underline}
[China\'s 5G lead will do is strengthen its]{.underline} emerging [role
as an innovator]{.underline}, just as it did during the 4G mobile
internet age when China began to introduce new ideas in particular areas
ahead of others.

[Bike-sharing and super apps are]{.underline} two
[examples]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} unique
[innovations]{.underline} soon [spread to **other corners of the
world**]{.underline}, enabling California surfers to rent electric
scooters with their phones, and allowing young professionals in
Indonesia to hail a motorcycle taxi, and order and pay for a meal all on
the same app.

What [China\'s]{.underline} advanced [schedule in 5G]{.underline}
deployment [means]{.underline} is that [China\'s entrepreneurs will be
able to experiment with user applications]{.underline} on scale first.
It\'s not inconceivable that successful applications tested in China \--
be it augmented reality or new gaming experiences \-- will later be
introduced to other countries.

It\'s often argued that [5G\'s industrial applications will
bring]{.underline} **[revolutionary change]{.underline}**, such as
**[smart factories]{.underline}** [where 5G\'s]{.underline} super fast
[speed]{.underline} [and]{.underline} low [latency]{.underline} [will
enable more]{.underline} **[flexible]{.underline}**,
**[efficient]{.underline}**, and **[intelligent]{.underline}**
[manufacturing]{.underline}. But [China,]{.underline} currently the
world\'s factory with 28.4% of global manufacturing output \-- far
greater than the second-place U.S. on 16.6% \-- [was]{.underline}
**[already]{.underline}** w[ell-positioned to benefit the most from such
changes.]{.underline} And [as the biggest exporter]{.underline}
accounting for 13.45% of global trade, [China can keep improving the
quality of the products it exports to the benefit of the world\'s
consumers.]{.underline}

Elsewhere, in areas including [smart cities]{.underline}, [health
care]{.underline}, and [autonomous driving car]{.underline}s, [China can
serve as the]{.underline} **[testing ground]{.underline}** for trial and
error. [What works]{.underline}, [what doesn\'t]{.underline}, and [how
5G can]{.underline} best **[facilitate]{.underline}** these [long-term
revolutions]{.underline} will only be answered through real-life
experiments.

Imagine an accident involving an autonomous driving bus on a public road
in China that warns the rest of the world that such mixed traffic
situations are not the best approach for self-driving tech. [The more
lead time China has to test and answer these questions in scale, the
more valuable the lessons will be to other countries.]{.underline}

Of course, China\'s leadership in 5G will not be only positive. How to
ensure security, protect data privacy, and control risks will be
pressing concerns that many international companies and legislators will
need to urgently address.

Still, while the surveillance tech that forms a key part of any smart
city project is clearly a thorny subject, [the fear that Beijing can
export authoritarianism around the world through the sale of
surveillance tech is]{.underline} about **[as credible]{.underline}**
[as the idea that the U.S. can export democracy by selling more Big Macs
and getting more people to watch Hollywood films.]{.underline}

To be sure, there are troubling ethical questions around the use of
surveillance tech. But the best solution is to have a global regulatory
framework to address them, such as the EU\'s General Data Protection
Regulation. But [when it comes to seeing]{.underline} more
[technological innovations]{.underline} coming out of China, [the rest
of the world should **relax**]{.underline}. As the mobile internet era
showed, [China can **innovate** on its own **without** inflicting much
harm.]{.underline}

[The 5G age may see China becoming an even bigger]{.underline} driving
**[force for innovation]{.underline}**. Some of these inventions will
raise difficult questions, but some will be as good for the public as
those brought about by many of the things that came out of Silicon
Valley. Having dual \-- or even multiple \-- engines of innovation is
not a bad thing.

### China Good\-\--Governance\-\--2NC

#### Chinese leadership is key to solving all global problems -- that solves the case

Shen **Yamei 18**, Deputy Director and Associate Research Fellow of
Department for American Studies, China Institute of International
Studies, 1-9-2018, \"Probing into the "Chinese Solution" for the
Transformation of Global Governance,\" CAIFC,
http://www.caifc.org.cn/en/content.aspx?id=4491

[As the world is in a period of great development, transformation and
adjustment, the international power comparison is undergoing profound
changes, global governance is reshuffling and traditional governance
concepts and models are confronted with challenges. The international
community is expecting China to play a bigger role in global governance,
which has given birth to the Chinese solution.]{.underline} A. To Lead
the Transformation of the Global Governance System. [**The
"shortcomings" of the existing global governance system are prominent,
which can hardly ensure global development. First, the traditional
dominant forces are seriously imbalanced**. The US and
Europe]{.underline} that used to dominate the global governance system
[have been beset with structural problems]{.underline}, with their
economic development stalling, social contradictions intensifying,
populism and secessionism rising, and states trapped in internal strife
and differentiation. [These countries have not fully reformed and
adjusted themselves well, but rather pointed their fingers at
globalization and resorted to retreat for self-insurance or were busy
with their own affairs without any wish or ability to participate in
global governance, which has encouraged the growth of
"anti-globalization" trend into an interference factor to global
governance]{.underline}. [Second, the global governance mechanism is
relatively lagging behind.]{.underline} [Over the years of development,
the strength of emerging economies has increased dramatically, which has
substantially upset the international power structure, as the developing
countries as a whole have made 80 percent of the contributions to global
economic growth]{.underline}. [These countries have expressed their
appeal for new governance and begun policy coordination among
themselves]{.underline}, which has initiated the transition of global
governance form "Western governance" to "East-West joint governance",
but [**the traditional governance mechanisms such as the World Bank, IMF
and G7 failed to reflect the demand of the new pattern, in addition to
their lack of representation and inclusiveness.** Third, the global
governance rules are developing in a fragmented way, with governance
deficits existing in some key areas.]{.underline} With the
diversification and in-depth integration of international interests, the
domain of global governance has continued to expand, with actors
multiplying by folds and action intentions becoming complicated. [As
relevant efforts are usually temporary and limited to specific partners
or issues, global governance driven by requests of "diversified
governance" lacks systematic and comprehensive solutions]{.underline}.
[Since the beginning of this year, there have been risks of running into
an acephalous state **in such key areas as global economic governance
and climate change**]{.underline}. **[Such emerging issues as nuclear
security and international terrorism have suffered injustice because of
power politics]{.underline}**. **[The governance areas in deficit, such
as cyber security, polar region and oceans, have "reversely forced"
certain countries and organizations to respond hastily]{.underline}**.
[All of these have made the global governance system trapped in a
dilemma and call urgently for a clear direction of
advancement.]{.underline} B. To Innovate and Perfect the International
Order. Currently, whether the developing countries or the Western
countries of Europe and the US are greatly discontent with the existing
international order as well as their appeals and motivation for changing
the order are unprecedentedly strong. The US is the major creator and
beneficiary of the existing hegemonic order, but it is now doubtful that
it has gained much less than lost from the existing order, faced with
the difficulties of global economic transformation and obsessed with
economic despair and political dejection. [Although the developing
countries as represented by China acknowledge the positive role played
by the post-war international order in safeguarding peace, boosting
prosperity and promoting globalization, they criticize the existing
order for lack of inclusiveness in politics and equality in economy, as
well as double standard in security, believing it has failed to reflect
the multi-polarization trend of the world and is an exclusive "circle
club]{.underline}". Therefore, there is much room for improvement. For
[China, to lead the transformation of the global governance system and
international order not only supports the efforts of the developing
countries to uphold multilateralism rather than unilateralism, advocate
the rule of law rather than the law of the jungle and practice democracy
rather than power politics in international relations]{.underline}, [but
also is an important subject concerning whether China could gain the
discourse power and development space corresponding to its own strength
and interests in the process of innovating and perfecting the framework
of international order.]{.underline} C. To Promote Integration of the
Eastern and Western Civilizations. Dialog among civilizations, which is
the popular foundation for any country's diplomatic proposals, runs like
a trickle moistening things silently. Nevertheless, [in the existing
international system guided by the "Western-Centrism", the Western
civilization has always had the self-righteous superiority, conflicting
with the interests and mentality of other countries and having failed to
find the path to co-existing peacefully and harmoniously with other
civilizations]{.underline}. **[So to speak, many problems of today,
including the growing gap in economic development between the developed
and developing countries against the background of globalization, the
Middle East trapped in chaos and disorder, the failure of Russia and
Turkey to "integrate into the West", etc., can be directly attributed to
lack of exchanges, communication and integration among
civilizations.]{.underline}** Since the 18th National Congress of CPC,
Xi Jinping has raised the concept of "Chinese Dream" that reflects both
Chinese values and China's pursuit, re-introducing to the world the idea
of "all living creatures grow together without harming one another and
ways run parallel without interfering with one another", which is the
highest ideal in Chinese traditional culture, and striving to shape
China into a force that counter-balance the Western civilization. He has
also made solemn commitment that "we respect the diversity of
civilizations ...... cannot be puffed up with pride and depreciate other
civilizations and nations"; "facing the people deeply trapped in misery
and wars, we should have not only compassion and sympathy, but also
responsibility and action ...... do whatever we can to extend assistance
to those people caught in predicament", etc. [China will rebalance the
international pattern from a more inclusive civilization perspective and
with more far-sighted strategic mindset, or at least correct the
bisected or predominated world order so as to promote the parallel
development of the Eastern and Western civilizations through mutual
learning, integration and encouragement.]{.underline} D. To Pass on
China's Confidence. Only a short while ago, some Western countries had
called for "China's responsibility" and made it an inhibition to
"regulate" China's development orientation. [Today, China has become a
source of stability in an international situation full of uncertainties.
Over the past 5 years, China has made outstanding contributions to the
recovery of world economy under relatively great pressure of its own
economic downturn.]{.underline} [Encouraged by the "four confidences",
the whole of the Chinese society has burst out innovation vitality and
produced innovation achievements]{.underline}, making people have more
sense of gain and more optimistic about the national development
prospect. It is the heroism of the ordinary Chinese to overcome
difficulties and realize the ideal destiny that best explains China's
confidence. When this confidence is passed on in the field of diplomacy,
it is expressed as: first, China's posture is seen as more forging ahead
and courageous to undertake responsibilities \-\-\-- proactively shaping
the international agendas rather than passively accepting them; having
clear-cut attitudes on international disputes rather than being
equivocal; and extending international cooperation to comprehensive and
dimensional development rather than based on the theory of "economy
only". In sum, China will actively seek understanding and support from
other countries rather than imposing its will on others with clear-cut
Chinese characteristics, Chinese style and Chinese manner. Second,
China's discourse is featured as a combination of inflexibility and
yielding as well as magnanimous \-\-\-- combining the internationally
recognized diplomatic principles with the excellent Chinese cultural
traditions through digesting the Chinese and foreign humanistic classics
assisted with philosophical speculations to make "China Brand, Chinese
Voice and China's Image get more and more recognized". Third, [the
Chinese solution is more practical and intimate to people as well as
emphasizes inclusive cooperation, as China is full of confidence to
break the monopoly of the Western model on global development, "offering
mankind a Chinese solution to explore a better social system", and
"providing a brand new option for the nations and peoples who are hoping
both to speed up development and maintain independence".]{.underline}
II.Path Searching of the "Chinese Solution" for Global Governance [Over
the past years' efforts, China has the ability to transform itself from
"grasping the opportunity" for development to "creating opportunity" and
"sharing opportunity" for common development, hoping to pass on the
longing of the Chinese people for a better life to the people of other
countries and promoting the development of the global governance system
toward a more just and rational end. It has become the major power's
conscious commitment of China to lead the transformation of the global
governance system in a profound way.]{.underline} A. To Construct the
Theoretical System for Global Governance. The theoretical system of
global governance has been the focus of the party central committee's
diplomatic theory innovation since the 18th National Congress of CPC as
well as an important component of the theory of socialism with Chinese
characteristics for a new era, which is not only the sublimation of
China's interaction with the world from "absorbing and learning" to
"cooperation and mutual learning", but also the cause why so many
developing countries have turned from "learning from the West" to
"exploring for treasures in the East". In the past 5 years, the party
central committee, based on precise interpretation of the world pattern
today and serious reflection on the future development of mankind, has
made a sincere call to the world for promoting the development of global
governance system toward a more just and rational end, and proposed a
series of new concepts and new strategies including engaging in major
power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, creating the human
community with common destiny, promoting the construction of new
international relationship rooted in the principle of cooperation and
win-win, enriching the strategic thinking of peaceful development,
sticking to the correct benefit view, formulating the partnership
network the world over, advancing the global economic governance in a
way of mutual consultation, joint construction and co-sharing,
advocating the joint, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable
security concept, and launching the grand "Belt and Road" initiative.
[The Chinese solution composed of these contents, not only fundamentally
different from the old roads of industrial revolution and colonial
expansion in history, but also different from the market-driven
neo-liberalism model currently advocated by Western countries and
international organizations, stands at the height of the world and even
mankind, seeking for global common development and having widened the
road for the developing countries to modernization, which is widely
welcomed by the international community.]{.underline} B. To Supplement
and Perfect the Global Governance System[. Currently, the international
political practice in global governance is mostly problem-driven without
creating a set of relatively independent, centralized and integral power
structures, resulting in the existing global governance
systemcharacterized as both extensive and unbalanced]{.underline}.
[China has been engaged in reform and innovation, while maintaining and
constructing the existing systems, producing some thinking and method
with Chinese characteristics. First, China sees the UN as a mirror that
reflects the status quo of global governance, which should act as the
leader of global governance, and actively safeguards the global
governance system with the UN at the core. Second, China is actively
promoting the transforming process of such recently emerged
international mechanisms as G20, BRICS and SCO]{.underline}, perfecting
them through practice, and boosting Asia-Pacific regional cooperation
and the development of economic globalization. China is also promoting
the construction of regional security mechanism through the Six-Party
Talks on Korean Peninsula nuclear issue, Boao Forum for Asia, CICA and
multilateral security dialog mechanisms led by ASEAN so as to lay the
foundation for the future regional security framework. Third, China has
initiated the establishment of AIIB and the New Development Bank of
BRICS, creating a precedent for developing countries to set up
multilateral financial institutions. The core of the new relationship
between China and them lies in "boosting rather than controlling" and
"public rather than private", which is much different from the
management and operation model of the World Bank, manifesting the
increasing global governance ability of China and the developing
countries as well as exerting pressure on the international economic and
financial institution to speed up reforms. **[Thus, in leading the
transformation of the global governance system, China has not overthrown
the existing systems and started all over again, but been engaged in
innovating and perfecting; China has proactively undertaken
international responsibilities, but has to do everything in its power
and act according to its ability.]{.underline}** C. To Reform the Global
Governance Rules. [Many of the problems facing global governance today
are deeply rooted in such a cause that the dominant power of the
existing governance system has taken it as the tool to realize its own
national interests first and a platform to pursue its political
goals.]{.underline} Since the beginning of this year, the US has for
several times requested the World Bank, IMF and G20 to make efforts to
mitigate the so-called global imbalance, abandoned its commitment to
support trade openness, cut down investment projects to the
middle-income countries, and deleted commitment to support the efforts
to deal with climate change financially, which has made the
international systems accessories of the US domestic economic agendas,
dealing a heavy blow to the global governance system. [On the contrary,
the interests and agendas of China, as a major power of the world, are
open to the whole world, and China in the future "will provide the world
with broader market, more sufficient capital, more abundant goods and
more precious opportunities for cooperation", while having the ability
to make the world listen to its voice more attentively.]{.underline}
[With regard to the subject of global governance, China has advocated
that what global governance system is better cannot be decided upon by
any single country, as the destiny of the world should be in the hands
of the people of all countries. In principle, all the parties should
stick to the principle of mutual consultation, joint construction and
co-sharing, resolve disputes through dialog and differences through
consultation]{.underline}. Regarding the critical areas, opening to the
outer world does not mean building one's own backyard, but building the
spring garden for co-sharing; the "Belt and Road" initiative is not
China's solo, but a chorus participated in by all countries concerned.
**[China has also proposed international public security views on
nuclear security, maritime cooperation and cyber space order, calling
for efforts to make the global village into a "grand stage for seeking
common development" rather than a "wrestling arena"; we cannot "set up a
stage here, while pulling away a prop there", but "complement each other
to put on a grand show"]{.underline}**. From the orientation of reforms,
efforts should be made to better safeguard and expand the legitimate
interests of the developing countries and increase the influence of the
emerging economies on global governance. Over the past 5 years, China
has attached importance to full court diplomacy, gradually coming to the
center stage of international politics and proactively establishing
principles for global governance. By hosting such important events as
IAELM, CICA Summit, G20 Summit, the Belt and Road International
Cooperation Forum and BRICS Summit, China has used theseplatforms to
elaborate the Asia-Pacific Dream for the first time to the world,
expressing China's views on Asian security and global economic
governance, discussing with the countries concerned with the Belt and
Road about the synergy of their future development strategies and
setting off the "BRICS plus" capacity expansion mechanism, in which
China not only contributes its solution and shows its style, but also
participates in the shaping of international principles through
practice. On promoting the resolution of hot international issues, China
abides by the norms governing international relations based on the
purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and insists on justice,
playing a constructive role as a responsible major power in actively
promoting the political accommodation in Afghanistan, mediating the
Djibouti-Eritrea dispute, promoting peace talks in the Middle East,
devoting itself to the peaceful resolution of the South China Sea
dispute through negotiations. In addition, China's responsibility and
quick response to international crises have gained widespread praises,
as seen in such cases as assisting Africa in its fight against the Ebola
epidemic, sending emergency fresh water to the capital of Maldives and
buying rice from Cambodia to help relieve its financial squeeze, which
has shown the simple feelings of the Chinese people to share the same
breath and fate with the people of other countries. D. To Support the
Increase of the Developing Countries' Voice. The developing countries,
especially the emerging powers, are not only the important participants
of the globalization process, but also the important direction to which
the international power system is transferring. With the accelerating
shift of global economic center to emerging markets and developing
economies, the will and ability of the developing countries to
participate in global governance have been correspondingly strengthened.
[As the biggest developing country and fast growing major power, China
has the same appeal and proposal for governance as other developing
countries and already began policy coordination with them, as China
should comply with historical tide and continue to support the increase
of the developing countries' voice in the global governance system. To
this end, China has pursued the policy of "dialog but not confrontation,
partnership but not alliance", attaching importance to the construction
of new type of major power relationship and global partnership network,
while making a series proposals in the practice of global governance
that could represent the legitimate interests of the developing
countries and be conducive to safeguarding global justice, including
supporting an open, inclusive, universal, balanced and win-win economic
globalization; promoting the reforms on share and voting mechanism of
IMF to increase the voting rights and representation of the emerging
market economies; financing the infrastructure construction and
industrial upgrading of other developing countries through various
bilateral or regional funds; and helping other developing countries to
respond to such challenges as famine, refugees, climate change and
public hygiene by debt forgiveness and assistance.]{.underline}

#### Effective global governance prevents unregulated emergent tech -- prevents extinction

Robert **Bailey 18,** Vision of Earth contributor and computer science
masters, 9-5-2018, \"Why do we need global governance?,\" Vision of
Earth, https://www.visionofearth.org/social-change/global-governance/

[Global governance is necessary because humanity increasingly faces both
problems and opportunities that are global in scale]{.underline}. Today,
[transnational problems such as violence and pandemics routinely reach
across borders,]{.underline} affecting us all. At the same time, [the
increasingly integrated global system has also laid the necessary
foundations for peace and spectacular prosperity]{.underline}.
[Effective global governance will allow us to end armed conflict, deal
with new and emerging problems such as technological risks and
automation, and to achieve levels of prosperity and progress never
before seen]{.underline}.1 **[The most important challenge for humanity
to overcome is that of existential risks]{.underline}**. [One way to
look at the danger of an existential risk is to quantify the level of
global coordination needed to deal with it.]{.underline} While best-shot
risks, at one end of the spectrum only require that a single nation,
organization or even individual (i.e., superhero) has the means and the
will to save everyone, weakest-link risks, at the other end of the
spectrum, are dangers that might require literally every country to take
appropriate action to prevent catastrophe, with no room for failure.2 3
We've always been at risk of natural disaster, but with advances in our
level of technology the risk we pose to ourselves as a species becomes
ever greater. Nuclear weapons are a well-known risk that we still live
with to this day. **[The progress of technological research exposes us
to new dangers such as bioengineered superbugs, nanotechnological
menaces, and the risk of an out-of-control artificial intelligence with
ill-intent]{.underline}**. [Increased levels of global coordination are
needed to combat many of these risks]{.underline}, as described in our
article on the cooperation possibilities frontier. [There are other
problems that don't necessarily threaten the species or even
civilization as we know it, but which are holding back the development
of prosperity and progress. Armed conflict]{.underline}, around since
the dawn of history, [still haunts us today]{.underline}. Even though
wars between great powers appear to be a thing of the past, [regional
conflicts still account for tremendous human suffering and loss of life
in parts of the world without stable governance.4]{.underline} Other
problems have emerged precisely because of our successes in the past.
[The unprecedented advancement of human wellbeing and prosperity over
the past century has been based in large part on the use of fossil
fuels, thus exposing us to climate change. Widespread automation,
already a stressor on society, will put increased pressure on the social
and economic fabric of our societies over the next few
decad]{.underline}es. Global governance can help alleviate these issues
in various ways -- we refer the interested reader to the very detailed
work in Ruling Ourselves. Finally, global governance will increasingly
be judged not only by the extent to which it prevents harm, but also by
its demonstrated ability to improve human wellbeing.5 Progress has let
us set our sights higher as a species, both for what we consider to be
the right trajectory for humanity and for our own conduct.6 Major
advances in human wellbeing can be accomplished with existing technology
and modest improvements in global coordination. [Effective global
governance is global governance that tackles these issues better than
the regional governments of the world can independently. Global
governance is key to solving global problems. **Without it, we may not
be able to avoid weakest-link existential risks or regulate new and
dangerous technologies.** With it, we may be able to prosper as we never
have before. The next step is to determine how effective global
governance can be achieved.]{.underline}

### China Good\-\--Relations\-\--2NC

#### U.S. 5G norms cause [backlash]{.underline} and [heightened competition]{.underline} that [increase]{.underline} likelihood of US-China war, prevent [effective climate cooperation]{.underline}, and spoil [arms control]{.underline} talks.

Ben **Scott 21**, Director of Australia's Security and the Rules-Based
Order Project at the Lowry Institute, 9/25/2021, \"International rules
make U.S.-China conflict more likely,\" No Publication,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/publications/international-rules-make-us-china-conflict-more-likely,
RMax

Unlike previous great power contests, [**competition** between the U.S.
and China is being waged through]{.underline}, and over the content of,
**[international rules]{.underline}**.

The winners of the First World War sought to reorder the world in the
form of the League of Nations. They did so again after the Second World
War, although more inclusively, by establishing the United Nations.
Something similar happened after the Cold War, as the \"Washington
Consensus\" expanded across the globe.

Neither China nor the U.S. is looking to reorder the world by winning a
decisive war. Because **[both]{.underline}** recognize that such a
conflict could be catastrophic, they [are trying to win **without
fighting** and are using **international rules** and **rule-writing** as
tools to constrain their adversaries and **shape the world** in **their
favor**]{.underline}.

Long before the U.S. was willing to acknowledge its strategic
competition with China, then U.S. President Barack Obama urged the
adoption of the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement because it
would allow \"America \-- and not countries like China \-- to write the
rules of the road in the 21st century.\" President Joe Biden\'s interim
national security guidance published in March ended with a similar
declaration that the U.S., not China, would shape \"new global norms and
agreements.\"

[Under Xi Jinping, China has become more open about its intention to
**make**, rather than]{.underline} merely [**take**, rules]{.underline}.
Unlike some foreign policy realists, the [Chinese Communist Party
understands]{.underline} that **[hard military]{.underline}** or even
economic [power is not the **only source** of **international
influence**]{.underline}.

[The competition over **new tech**nology is **central** to this **new
domain** of **competitive rule writing**. The battle to set **global
standards** and dominate the market for **5G**]{.underline} broadband
cellular [**networks** is playing out over **other emerging
tech**nologies such as the rules about the development of facial
recognition technology that involve fundamental questions of
value]{.underline}.

But [**competition** over **rules** could]{.underline}, paradoxically,
[make a **military conflict more likely**]{.underline}. [The
**fundamental rules** of international relations]{.underline} \-- many
of which are embodied in international law \-- [exist to **manage
competition** and **enable cooperation**]{.underline}. These rules only
exist insofar as they are accepted by states. Trying to determine them
competitively is pointless. Great powers can simply decide to opt out.

Washington now more clearly recognizes the need for rules that will
forestall conflict, with President Biden recently emphasizing the need
for \"responsible competition\" bounded by \"guardrails\" in order to
\"ensure competition does not veer into conflict.\"

[The]{.underline} recent [surge in Chinese jets entering Taiwan\'s Air
Defence Identification Zone has underscored the need for a **working
hotline**]{.underline}. When U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Mark Milley recently revealed that in Donald Trump\'s final months he
found it necessary to reassure his Chinese counterpart that they are
were not about to be attacked, he added that such phone calls could take
days or weeks to set up.

[Washington\'s need for **more cooperation**]{.underline} with Beijing
[goes **beyond crisis management**]{.underline}. More broadly, [it is
necessary to address **climate change**]{.underline} \-- still at the
top of Biden\'s agenda \-- [and start talks on **arms control**, a need
driven home by China\'s reportedly successful test of a Fractional
Orbital Bombardment System.]{.underline}

[China appears]{.underline} far [**less enthusiastic** about
\"**guardrails**,\"]{.underline} with [Beijing]{.underline} probably
[suspecting]{.underline} that [such a concept is]{.underline}, in fact,
[another form of competitive rule-setting and a thinly-veiled attempt to
**lock in** the **status quo**]{.underline}. China itself is no stranger
to using conflict management for geopolitical ends. It is pushing an
ostensibly neutral \"Code of Conduct\" for the South China Sea that
would cement its dominance of that body of water.

Competition without guardrails is a game of chicken that Beijing seems
readier to play. It may view Washington\'s recent pivot to \"responsible
competition\" as a sign of weakness. Experience has shown that, Trump
aside, most U.S. presidents come into office talking tough on China but,
over time, come to realize the importance of engaging and accommodating
it.

[The **challenge** for **Washington** is to sell the concept of
**responsible competition**]{.underline} as mutually beneficial [without
feeding the perception that this offer is a sign of weakness to be
**exploited**]{.underline}. The sequencing of recent exchanges suggests
that [this is a **delicate balance**]{.underline}.

### China Good\-\--Status Denial\-\--2NC

#### Technological competition is the primary way China intends to gain status

**Khong, 19 -** Yuen Foong Khong is the Li Ka Shing Professor of
Political Science at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National
University of Singapore ("Power as prestige in world politics,"
International Affairs, Volume 95, Issue 1, January 2019, Pages 119--142,
<https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiy245>,
<https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/95/1/119/5273583>

The analysis of US--China interactions presented here reveals that the
phase of heightened geopolitical competition between the two superpowers
is upon us. A key bone of contention now and in the coming decade will
be about the hierarchy of prestige. [By most accounts, China is likely
to overtake the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to become the
world\'s largest economy within a decade]{.underline}; meanwhile [it is
investing heavily in multiple arenas---military, economic,
technological, cultural---to create facts on the ground that will force
the US to recognize it as a co-equal]{.underline}. Indeed, [if the
tech]{.underline}nological [advances]{.underline} sought by 'Made in
China 2025' and the economic and political--diplomatic goals of the BRI
[are realized]{.underline}---big ifs, to be sure---[China will be well
positioned to 'win friends and influence people' in ways America did
with its economic and technological prowess]{.underline}. [It will be in
a position to match, and]{.underline} perhaps [overtake, the US
**reputation for power**.]{.underline} A Pew poll of 2015 found that, in
27 out of the 40 countries polled, a plurality or majority of
individuals believed that China 'will or already has overtaken the US as
a superpower'.78 Such polls need to be interpreted with caution; but if
that day does come to pass, it will put the US in a position of great
strategic angst. Kishore Mahbubani cites an exchange he had at the 2012
Davos meeting in which he raised the possibility of China replacing the
United States as the world\'s top power---a suggestion to which Senator
Bob Corker, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
responded: 'The American people absolutely would not be prepared
psychologically for an event where the world began to believe that it
was not the greatest power on earth.'79

#### Status denial goes nuclear

**Onea, 14** - Tudor Onea is a Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council of Canada Post-doctoral Fellow with the Department of Government
at Dartmouth College ("Between dominance and decline: status anxiety and
great power rivalry" Review of International Studies, Volume 40 / Issue
01 / January 2014, pp 125-152

Rivalries between great powers over dominance have captured scholarly
attention since the days of Thucydides. However, the bulk of studies
have concentrated on shifts in capabilities, while neglecting the
motives that produce such positional rivalries. The status anxiety
hypothesis is an effort to address this omission, by tracing their
occurrence and continuation, sometimes for decades, to the clashing
status requirements of the dominant power and those of the next-in-line
state. In a nutshell, [status anxiety argues that the **refusal of the
dominant power** to allow the succession of the challenger will be a
fundamental cause of rivalry, worsening as the rising power threatens to
overtake the current leader]{.underline} in additional dimensions. The
purpose of this article was to formulate this hypothesis as well as
subject it to preliminary testing. The findings suggest [that status
anxiety represented a significant influence]{.underline}, though not
necessarily excluding additional balance of power considerations, [in
the foreign policy decision-making of declining dominant
powers:]{.underline} France in the mid-eighteenth century and Britain at
the turn of the twentieth century. Status anxiety thus helps account for
the hostility France manifested towards Britain, and Britain towards
German demands for superior status, a reaction which is more problematic
to account for by theories stressing solely physical security and
material gains.

A further contribution of this endeavour is that it suggests the
existence of a dominant power club, distinct from the club of major or
great powers, and, as such, following a different set of rules.138 The
existing status literature has concentrated exclusively on the latter
club, arguing persuasively that there is no impediment for granting
either admission to new members or opportunities for further advancement
to current ones.139 Hence, status competition in the great power club is
seen as non-zero sum. But the dominant power club has a membership of
one, which makes it unfeasible for the dominant power to satisfy the
demands of dominant power aspirants without voluntarily surrendering its
supremacy. Accordingly, [status competition over the]{.underline}
dominant [position is more likely to be **zero-sum** and lead to
rivalry.]{.underline}

The findings of this article are at this point only plausible, yet they
highlight the need for further research covering the entire universe of
dominant powers in order to determine both if intense status anxiety
always prompts conflict and if reduced status anxiety or its absence
lead to stability. Consequently, additional studies of the role of
status for dominant powers foreign policy should be conducted, extending
beyond the current en vogue concentration on the foreign policy of
rising powers alone.

Indeed, [dominant powers\' status anxiety may be increasingly
policy-relevant, if unipolarity were to erode due to a steady shrinking
of distance between the US and China]{.underline}. [This is not to
suggest that Sino-American confrontation under the ominous **shadow of
nuclear weapons** is inevitable, but to draw attention to the possible
**heightened risks posed by status anxiety**]{.underline} in future
decades. In the words of President Obama: 'if other nations do not play
for second place, I do not accept second-place for the United States of
America'.140

7-11-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

What Are **[China's Smart Cities]{.underline}**?

In 2011, [China]{.underline}'s 12th Five-Year Plan
[announced]{.underline} its [intentions to develop]{.underline}
"**[digital cities]{.underline}**." Within this plan, [Beijing sought
to]{.underline} **[accelerate]{.underline}** [the construction of
**new-gen**eration]{.underline} [IT infrastructure]{.underline}, [mobile
communication networks]{.underline}, [internet
infrastructures]{.underline}, digital and television [broadcasting
networks]{.underline}, [satellite communication]{.underline} facilities,
[and]{.underline} an ultra high speed, [large capacity]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} highly intelligent [national trunk **transmission
network**]{.underline}. [The government]{.underline} also [wanted to
construct]{.underline} **[broadband connection]{.underline}** throughout
urban and rural areas [to strengthen]{.underline}
**[interconnectivity]{.underline}**.

[This infrastructure]{.underline} now [serves as the basis
of]{.underline} **[China's smart cities]{.underline}**. Smart cities are
[urban areas that collect]{.underline} large amounts of
[data]{.underline} [and use it to improve]{.underline} **[city
operations]{.underline}**. [Developers]{.underline} can [create
technological applications]{.underline} based [upon a city's critical
communications infrastructure]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} then
[convert data into insights]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} insights
into [tools]{.underline}. [These applications]{.underline} in turn
[serve as a form of]{.underline} **[public-private
partnerships]{.underline}**, [creating opportunities for
government]{.underline}, [companies]{.underline}, [and the
public]{.underline}. For example, [in]{.underline} the case of [public
transit]{.underline}, [bus riders could use a real-time traffic
monitoring app]{.underline}lication [to find the]{.underline}
**[optimal]{.underline}** [time to travel]{.underline} with less traffic
while [reducing the]{.underline} overall **[strain]{.underline}** [on
the]{.underline} public [transportation system.]{.underline}

In subsequent five-year plans, [Beijing's gaze]{.underline} has
[narrowed in on]{.underline} **[smart city]{.underline}**
[development]{.underline}. [Policymakers]{.underline} have
[diverted]{.underline} significant [resources]{.underline} [towards
furthering]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [technological innovation and
public-private partnerships behind]{.underline} **[smart
cities]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline} the development of
**[5G]{.underline}**, [**a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}, new
[energy vehicles]{.underline}, [cloud]{.underline} computing,
[blockchain]{.underline} technology, [and]{.underline} internet of
things ([IoT]{.underline}), all of [which serve a critical function in
the infrastructure of]{.underline} many of [China's urban
areas]{.underline}. In early 2020 alone, [China's governing]{.underline}
National People's [Congress]{.underline} [signed off on a]{.underline}
US\$1.4 trillion [fiscal plan to support]{.underline} **[technological
innovation]{.underline}** in these fields.

How Are [China's Tech Giants Developing Smart Cities]{.underline}?

[As]{.underline} new [technologies emerge after]{.underline} decades of
[**r**esearch a**n**d **d**evelopment]{.underline}, a handful of
[companies have taken the lead in the]{.underline}
**[transformation]{.underline}** [of cities]{.underline}. These include
[Alibaba, Baidu, Didi Chuxing]{.underline}, **[Huawei]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} [Tencent]{.underline}, all of [which have incorporated
their individual technologies]{.underline} across Hangzhou, Suzhou,
Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Beijing, among others. [These
technologies]{.underline} then [form the building blocks
for]{.underline} "**[digital brains]{.underline}**," [which
utilize]{.underline} [cloud]{.underline} computing, [AI]{.underline},
[and IoT]{.underline} [to create the foundations for]{.underline}
**[smart city]{.underline}** [infrastructure]{.underline}.

[Alibaba: City Brain]{.underline}

[Alibaba's City Brain]{.underline} [uses **a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline} and network infrastructure [to
**automate** traffic]{.underline} systems, **[optimize]{.underline}**
public [transportation routes]{.underline}, [identify **environmental
issues**]{.underline}, [and allow for]{.underline} more efficient
[public resource management]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} largely
[associated with Hangzhou]{.underline}, the city in which it was piloted
and home to Alibaba's headquarters. [Since]{.underline} the
implementation of [Alibaba's City Brain]{.underline}, [transit
times]{.underline} in its pilot areas [have been reduced by
15%,]{.underline} [arrival times of ambulances were cut in
half,]{.underline} and [an AI surveillance]{.underline} system [to
monitor traffic]{.underline} violations [has lowered]{.underline}
**[overhead]{.underline}** [for law enforcement]{.underline}.

**[City Brain]{.underline}** [has been]{.underline} [deployed
in]{.underline} many of Hangzhou's [parking lots]{.underline}, enabling
a "[park-first, pay later]{.underline} system" that aims [to cut down
congestion near major traffic centers]{.underline}. This same system is
[also applied to]{.underline} its [hospitals]{.underline} [where
patients can receive treatment]{.underline} first [and pay
later]{.underline}. [This is in]{.underline} [conjunction
with]{.underline} [Alibaba's Medical Brain]{.underline} [that
utilizes]{.underline} **[AI]{.underline}** and big data [to treat
patients]{.underline}. It has already begun piloting in a few hospitals
across Hangzhou.

[The success of Alibaba's City Brain]{.underline} project in Hangzhou
[has attracted the attention of major cities]{.underline} across China.
Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Macao, and Lhasa have [all begun pilot
programs]{.underline}, and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, a hub for Alibaba's
Southeast Asian operations, has imported the technology. [Despite
regulatory changes and]{.underline} recent [crackdowns]{.underline} on
the company's anti-competitive e-commerce practices, [Alibaba's other
technologies are]{.underline} still **[deeply integrated]{.underline}**
[into]{.underline} many Chinese cities' [infrastructures]{.underline}.

**[Huawei]{.underline}**: [5G and the]{.underline} [**I**nternet **o**f
**T**hings]{.underline}

[Huawei]{.underline} has [faced]{.underline} intense
[scrutiny]{.underline} in recent years [over]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [5G]{.underline} technologies that [it
exports]{.underline} around the globe. Considered one of China's top
national champions, [Huawei]{.underline} [has been]{.underline}
**[pivotal]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline} overall
**[expansion]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [IoT technologies
and]{.underline} China's 5G telecommunications network, both of [which
are key to the]{.underline} overall **[development]{.underline}** [of
smart city infrastructures]{.underline}. [The company is responsible for
the interconnectivity of]{.underline} **[200 million]{.underline}**
[IoT-enabled devices around the world]{.underline}, [with 90 million
connected to China Telecom's network alone**. Huawei's 5G**]{.underline}
technology [is key to]{.underline} many [smart city
projects]{.underline} [throughout China]{.underline}, [and it seeks
a]{.underline} much more [comprehensive approach to]{.underline} smart
city [infrastructure]{.underline}, **[encompassing]{.underline}**
everything from [airport management and traffic optimization
to]{.underline} streamlined [city governance and]{.underline} [medical
personnel assistance]{.underline}.

[Although Huawei's]{.underline} network [spans throughout
China]{.underline}, [Shenzhen and Shanghai have been the]{.underline}
primary focus as [pilot cities for the company's smart city
technologies.]{.underline} For example, [Shenzhen's]{.underline} Bao'an
International [Airport]{.underline} [signed an agreement with Huawei to
upgrade airport infrastructure]{.underline}. Since, Shenzhen Bao'an
International Airport [has seen a 15% reduction in waiting queues and a
20% reduction in onboarding times]{.underline} **[due to Huawei's
infrastructure]{.underline}**.

[Other parts of Shenzhen]{.underline} have [employed]{.underline}
**[Huawei's Smart Traffic]{.underline}** Lights and Traffic Control
[systems that]{.underline} help **[optimize]{.underline}** traffic
patterns. As cars become increasingly integrated with cellular
vehicle-to-everything ("C-V2X") technologies that enable connectivity
between cars and surrounding networks, [Huawei's systems]{.underline}
will [improve]{.underline} both [the flow of traffic as well as allow
for quickened response times]{.underline} for first responder emergency
vehicles. [These technologies]{.underline} [function]{.underline}
[similar to Alibaba's City Brain in employing AI with big
data]{.underline} **[to manage]{.underline}** [traffic]{.underline} [and
assist police a]{.underline}nd other critical services [to]{.underline}
**[optimize the efficiency]{.underline}** [of their]{.underline}
**[real-time decision making.]{.underline}** [The result]{.underline} of
Huawei's traffic brain has been [a 15% increase in traffic
speed.]{.underline}

[Tencent]{.underline}: **[WeChat and Net City]{.underline}**

[Tencent has been a key player in China's tech industry]{.underline} for
nearly two decades. [The company is behind]{.underline} popular
platforms like [QQ, Weibo, and WeChat]{.underline}, [and is
a]{.underline} major [driver behind **social media** and
**e-commerce**]{.underline}. [WeChat's]{.underline} extremely [high user
penetration rates]{.underline}, **[coupled with]{.underline}** its
[payment services and]{.underline} **[interoperability]{.underline}**
with other applications, have [allowed it to become a
**versatile**]{.underline} [platform among both China's digital
infrastructure and population]{.underline}. **[Tencent]{.underline}**
[is likely to continue dominating the]{.underline} [social media
landscape]{.underline}, [providing it sufficient resources and reach to
expand into other innovative projects]{.underline} such as its Net City
project.

[WeChat Pay]{.underline}, the digital payment system native to WeChat,
[has]{.underline} long [been integrated within]{.underline} most [city
**utilities**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[infrastructure]{.underline}** [across China]{.underline}. [It
provides services for]{.underline} **[vendors]{.underline}**,
**[consumers]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[government
bureaus]{.underline}**, alike, and [it would be difficult to find a
shop, restaurant, or vendor]{.underline} anywhere in China [that does
not accept the service]{.underline}. [Government services and hospitals
will]{.underline} even [allow you to use WeChat Pay]{.underline} if you
need to pay a fee or a fine.

[In addition to its payments]{.underline} services, [WeChat's ability
to]{.underline} **[disseminate]{.underline}** i[nformation]{.underline}
has also [proved invaluable]{.underline} over the years. This was
demonstrated at the onset of the [COVID-19]{.underline} epidemic, in
which [WeChat allowed for]{.underline} continuous [updates regarding
quarantine]{.underline} [measures and provided]{.underline} important
**[statistics]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} local [governmental
officials]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} later [helped
provide]{.underline} [contact tracing capabilities that were critical to
isolating COVID-19 clusters]{.underline} in certain areas. Among its
[most recent developments]{.underline} now [include a digital
vaccination certificate]{.underline} [and a digital
hospital]{.underline} picker [which uses AI to help connect you with
doctors]{.underline} that best suit your needs. [WeChat's **services and
innovations**]{.underline} have [allowed Tencent to not only grow
**exponentially** but]{.underline} also [become a key tool for **social
infrastructure** over the past decade]{.underline}.

[Despite scrutiny]{.underline} over its anti-competitive practices,
[Tencent is]{.underline} still [exploring]{.underline} different areas
of **[innovation]{.underline}**. Announced last year, [Tencent and
prominent architectural firm NBBJ]{.underline} jointly [announced the
creation of]{.underline} **[Net City]{.underline}**, [an area that will
prioritize]{.underline} **[green sustainable living]{.underline}**,
pedestrian-focused [infrastructure]{.underline}, [and an
underground]{.underline} [self-driving]{.underline} vehicle
[network]{.underline}. [Utilizing]{.underline} reclaimed [land near
Shenzhen]{.underline}, Net City [plans to accommodate 80,000
people]{.underline}. [It will]{.underline} primarily [serve Tencent's
offices]{.underline}, [providing a]{.underline} **[sustainable
ecosystem]{.underline}** [that benefits]{.underline} the company's
[employees and city residents]{.underline}. [It aims to
utilize]{.underline} **[renewable energies]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[reusable]{.underline}** waste
**[water]{.underline}** in order [to promote a more environmentally
friendly living environment.]{.underline} [Construction]{.underline} of
this area started in 2020 and [is estimated to be completed in
2027.]{.underline}

[Baidu and Didi]{.underline}: **[Intelligent Driving]{.underline}** and
Autonomous Driving

[Baidu and Didi Chuxing]{.underline}, [two of China's largest tech
giants]{.underline}, [are competing]{.underline} with each other [to
develop]{.underline} **[autonomous driving vehicles]{.underline}**.
[With the]{.underline} **[development of 5G]{.underline}**, C-V2X, [and
rapid transit technologies]{.underline}, [Baidu and Didi]{.underline}
both have [launched partnerships]{.underline} **[with city
officials]{.underline}** in order [to develop intelligent
transportation]{.underline} at the city level.

[Baidu's Apollo]{.underline} [aims to develop]{.underline} **[smart
city]{.underline}** [digital transportation infrastructure that
utilizes]{.underline} C-V2X [technologies to integrate smart vehicles
into a city's]{.underline} wider [traffic grid]{.underline}. According
to Baidu, [this includes smart]{.underline} [signaling]{.underline},
smart [parking]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} smart
[buses]{.underline}. [This technology has]{.underline} already [been
deployed in major cities]{.underline} like Changsha and Guangzhou [and
has]{.underline} already **[totaled]{.underline}** hundreds of [millions
of dollars in contracts for the company]{.underline}.

[Didi Chuxing]{.underline}, [widely known for]{.underline} its [ride
sharing]{.underline} app, has [developed both]{.underline} **[Didi
Transportation Brain]{.underline}** [and an autonomous vehicle fleet
that are]{.underline} highly **[synergistic]{.underline}** with each
other[. The transportation brain]{.underline} [has]{.underline} already
[been deployed across multiple cities]{.underline} across China,
[leveraging **big data** and **AI** to improve travel times for
commuters]{.underline}. Its growing [robo-taxi fleet works in
tandem]{.underline} with its transportation brain, [and self-driving
autonomous vehicle pilot programs have been launched]{.underline} in
Shanghai, Yangquan, and Hefei.

[Baidu and Didi Chuxing have been successful in utilizing]{.underline}
the [networks and technologies of other companies to]{.underline}
rapidly [develop and deploy]{.underline} their
[technologies]{.underline}. For example, [both Baidu and Didi
Chuxing]{.underline} **[leverage Huawei's]{.underline}** expanding [5G
infrastructure]{.underline}, C-V2X protocols, [and pre-existing
transportation brains to compete in a]{.underline} young [competitive
market]{.underline}. Additionally, [these offerings offer the potential
for **overseas expansion**,]{.underline} [with both companies aiming to
develop self-driving vehicles]{.underline} as a mobility-as-a-service.

### China Good\-\--Warming\-\--2NC

#### Chinese 5G solves warming through [digital innovation]{.underline} and [deep decarbonization]{.underline}

**Mun 22** (Ng Wai Mun, a correspondent at Eco-Business, has nearly a
decade of experience in media, 6-6-2022, \"China's tech giant Huawei
touts digital growth to cut carbon emissions,\"
https://www.eco-business.com/news/chinas-tech-giant-huawei-touts-digital-growth-to-cut-carbon-emissions/,
DOA: 7-5-2022//Smarx Ahsan\-\--edited for spelling)

[By the end of this decade]{.underline}, **[renewables]{.underline}**,
particularly solar, [should make up]{.underline} at least [half of the
world's]{.underline} total [electricity]{.underline} generation.
[Enabled by]{.underline} **[digital]{.underline}**
[solutions]{.underline}, **[deep decarbonization]{.underline}** [must
occur across all sectors]{.underline}, and [digital infrastructure
itself should be]{.underline} 100 times [more energy
efficient.]{.underline}

In a latest report that highlights the role of information and
communications technology (ICT) in a cleaner and sustainable future,
[China's]{.underline} largest tech giant [Huawei]{.underline} [called
for more innovation to create]{.underline} **[synergies]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} **[digitalization]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[decarbonization]{.underline}**. It believes that [technology
will]{.underline} help [enable other sectors to reduce their **carbon
footprint**]{.underline}.

The report, titled Green Development 2030 and launched this month, maps
out Huawei's vision of the future, where [data centers running
on]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [will be
powered by]{.underline} **[solar photovoltaic]{.underline}** (PV)
[plants]{.underline}, and [where virtual factories staffed by robots
will enable efficient manufacturing cycles]{.underline}. By the end of
this decade, [all new buildings around the world will operate
at]{.underline} **[net-zero carbon]{.underline}** and [there will be
large-scale electrification in transportation]{.underline}, from [cars
to aviation and shipping]{.underline}, predicted Huawei.

In recent years, [not only has the digital economy become a major engine
of]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}** [growth]{.underline}, various
[sectors are looking to]{.underline} bold use of [technological
solutions to cope with climate-related challenges]{.underline}. For
example, most Asia-Pacific countries have released clear policies for
digitalization and decarbonization. In Asean, the region's internet
economy market is booming and key entities like the Asian Development
Bank are working on promoting digitalization for green and inclusive
growth in Asia.

[Huawei]{.underline}'s report further [highlights]{.underline} the
various [untapped green opportunities]{.underline} that different
[industries can tap on]{.underline}. It also calls for the ICT sector to
work on cutting its carbon footprint.

In the study, Huawei estimated that [only 20 per cent of businesses are
currently using digital technology]{.underline}, and [**green
development** will require increased **penetration** of digital
technology across **all sectors**.]{.underline}

\[Chart Omitted\]

"While the ICT industry itself accounts for less than 2 per cent of
global carbon emissions, it is a leverage point that can be exploited to
achieve disproportionate and higher emissions reductions," said Huawei,
which is predicting for carbon emissions reductions enabled by digital
solutions to hit at least 20 per cent of global emissions by 2030.

Huawei highlighted how **[digital technology]{.underline}** [can play a
role in increasing the efficiency of **carbon storage** and **carbon
removal**]{.underline}, processes that have featured more prominently in
the latest United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) report. The IPCC has said that [the removal of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere will be]{.underline} [**unavoidable** as climate
dangers grow]{.underline}.

\[Chart Omitted\]

Currently, [renewable energy makes up]{.underline} [28.6 per cent of the
global electricity generation]{.underline}, and [Huawei's
vision]{.underline} [is for the ratio to increase to 50 per cent by
2030]{.underline}, [making renewables]{.underline}
**[mainstream]{.underline}**. Key to this is a strong solar push, as it
predicts that solar power is set to become a major source of
electricity.

It imagines [offshore floating PVs]{.underline} [and wind
turbines]{.underline} to be a common sight by the end of the next
decade. [Power plants will]{.underline} also [become]{.underline} highly
**[digitized]{.underline}**.

"With [a converged, open]{.underline}, and [intelligent energy
cloud]{.underline}, **[virtual]{.underline}** [power plants will
break]{.underline} [down boundaries between traditional power plants and
users,]{.underline} and **[coordinate]{.underline}** distributed [wind
energy]{.underline}, solar PV, energy storage systems, and other
flexible loads."

[**Breakthroughs** in digital technology needed]{.underline}

[Huawei]{.underline} also [called for the energy efficiency of digital
infrastructure]{.underline} itself [to be]{.underline} vastly
[improved]{.underline}. [Growth]{.underline} [of the]{.underline}
**[digital economy]{.underline}** [creates additional energy
demands]{.underline} as new ICT infrastructure needs to be powered, but
yet [this should not deter investment]{.underline} into such
infrastructure. Instead, [the ICT sector should lead the way and search
for]{.underline} **[innovative]{.underline}** and effective
[solutions]{.underline} in order to meet these demands.

This is especially [as more countries]{.underline} and regions [start
embracing]{.underline} **[green development]{.underline}**.
[Huawei]{.underline} [urged]{.underline} further [breakthroughs in
digital technology and]{.underline} greater [coordination]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} different [industries]{.underline}.
[Regulations]{.underline}, systems and standards across various sectors
need to be clear and **[standardized]{.underline}**. "[This will require
**joint innovation**]{.underline} [in both digital technology and low
carbon growth]{.underline}, as [well as greater collaboration
across]{.underline} all communities, industries, value chains and
[ecosystems]{.underline}."

"**[Digital innovation]{.underline}** [is key to achieving]{.underline}
**[low-carbon growth]{.underline}**. [The two are]{.underline}
**[mutually reinforcing]{.underline}**, so [we need to keep
strengthening investment in research and development to deliver the
right enabling technologies]{.underline}."

The report's authors told Eco-Business that while
[digitalization]{.underline} may cause a rebound effect, its [downsides
are less significant than their potential to improve the
planet]{.underline}. Nonetheless, they acknowledge that these side
effects need to be addressed and controlled on a more systemic level.

The report points out that the ICT industry currently lacks a unified
standard to measure the carbon emissions of digital infrastructure, and
suggests the creation of an index to establish unified standards for
better management of the industry's energy consumption and carbon
footprint.

"On one hand, carriers from different countries and regions adopt
different approaches to network rollout. On the other hand, digital
infrastructure covers numerous domains, and its carbon emissions vary
greatly across domains, making it almost impossible to fully achieve
green and efficient operations."

In 2021, Huawei launched a white paper that proposed a Network Carbon
Intensity (NCI) index, which defines carbon emissions per bit of data
traffic as a new metric for green digital infrastructure.

[Huawei]{.underline} also [envisions]{.underline} for [networks to be
reconstructed based on the nature of the services they
carry]{.underline}, [allowing for energy-efficient routing. **Data
centers**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} currently [account
for]{.underline} about [1 per cent of global electricity
consumption]{.underline}, [need to adopt evaporative **cooling**
technology and **AI**.]{.underline}

[Digital infrastructure]{.underline} **[construction]{.underline}** also
[needs to become more flexible]{.underline} and efficient. "[Most of
today's data centers are built indoors]{.underline}. In the future, what
once filled an equipment room will be squeezed into a single cabinet,
and what once filled a cabinet will be mounted on a single pole.
[Traditional concrete data center buildings will be replaced by
prefabricated modular data centers]{.underline}," said Huawei, which
believes that [new data centers can be built in just a few months in the
future, meeting the requirements for rapid service rollout]{.underline}.

In its report, Huawei highlighted the Gui'an Data Centre it built in
China that has green and intelligent technologies incorporated into its
design, and which adopts indirect evaporative cooling technology and AI
to increase energy efficiency.

The center, which will be able to accommodate one million servers after
full completion, has a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of 1.12, and
generates 810,000 tons fewer carbon emissions every year compared with a
conventional one.

Although more countries and regions are embracing green development, the
world still lacks unified standards for low-carbon growth, the report
stated. "We still have many challenges ahead. [We need to make further
breakthroughs in digital technology, flesh out regulations, systems and
standards, and promote greater coordination between different
industries]{.underline}."

**[THE 5G FUTURE]{.underline}** [promises more]{.underline}. More
**[speed]{.underline}**. More **[security]{.underline}**. More
**[support]{.underline}** [for cutting-edge applications such
as]{.underline} robotic [telemedicine]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[driverless cars.]{.underline}

Yet [to achieve its full potential **while protecting the
environment**]{.underline}, [the next generation of wireless networking
will need to deliver less in]{.underline} one key area.

**[Energy consumption.]{.underline}**

From sleek mobile phones to ubiquitous cellular antennas to sprawling
data centers, [our increasingly connected digital lives require
increasing]{.underline} [amounts of electricity]{.underline}. The
result? [Increasing contributions to the carbon emissions]{.underline}
that scientists believe [are the]{.underline} **[driving
force]{.underline}** [behind climate change and]{.underline} planetary
[warming]{.underline}.

The numbers tell the story. Canadian [researchers estimate]{.underline}
that by next year, information and communications technology
([ICT]{.underline}) [will account for 3.5 percent of a]{.underline}nnual
**[global carbon emissions]{.underline}**, [a larger share
than]{.underline} the [aviation]{.underline} [and shipping
industries]{.underline} will account for.

By next year [3.5%]{.underline} [of]{.underline} annual [global carbon
emissions will come from]{.underline} information and communications
technology ([ICT]{.underline}).

[By 2040]{.underline} [14% of worldwide emissions will be from
ICT]{.underline}. Roughly [equivalent to the percentage now attributable
to the **entire population** of the United States.]{.underline}

That figure could jump to 14 percent of worldwide emissions by 2040,
roughly equivalent to the percentage now attributable to the entire
population of the United States.

Inside and outside the telecommunications industry, [there's concern
that the]{.underline} pending [5G shift could play a]{.underline}
**[significant role]{.underline}** [in any rise]{.underline}. By 2022,
[networks are expected to support]{.underline} **[26 billion
devices]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[connections
worldwide]{.underline}**, an increase of about 10 billion from 2015.

[A 5G world]{.underline} [includes]{.underline} many more [wireless
devices]{.underline}, including [security cameras]{.underline}, [smart
appli]{.underline}ances, and connected [factory robots]{.underline}.
More devices transmitting much more data figures to
[require]{.underline} far more [power]{.underline}. Telecom
sustainability expert Anders Andrae calls this situation [a
potential]{.underline} "**[perfect storm]{.underline}**" [of increased
energy consumption]{.underline}.

"[This is a real concern for 5G]{.underline}," says Zach Chang, a
carrier network product manager at the communications technology company
Huawei. "[It will be much more powerful than 4G]{.underline} in terms of
processing power and bandwidth [and has the potential to cover **the
whole Earth's** population.]{.underline}

"[All of that will increase **energy consumption**]{.underline}. [If the
efficiency of the entire infrastructure doesn't go up]{.underline}, it
won't make financial or environmental sense. **[It won't be
sustainable]{.underline}**."

ONLY **[THAT DOESN'T have to be the case.]{.underline}** International
standards for 5G call for reduced energy use compared to today's 4G
networks, and [companies such as Huawei are designing]{.underline} and
building [components with]{.underline} **[dramatically increased
efficiency]{.underline}** [in mind.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} ultimate [goal?]{.underline} [Use less power to
transmit more data]{.underline}, [decreasing the wattage
required]{.underline} for each bit of internet traffic.

One single kilowatt hour

4G

300 high-definition movies

5G

5,000 ultra-high-definition movies

So far, [results have been **promising**]{.underline}. While recently
discussing sustainability, Huawei Chairman Liang Hua said that with 4G,
a single kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity is sufficient to download
about 300 high-definition movies. With 5G, that same kilowatt hour can
power about 5,000 ultra-high definition movie downloads.

Or [consider base stations]{.underline}, which [transmit and
receive]{.underline} the **[radio signals]{.underline}** [at the heart
of wireless networks]{.underline}. [These **power-hungry**
sites]{.underline} [can account for]{.underline} as much as [80 percent
of total network energy use]{.underline}. Nearly **[half of the
electricity consumed]{.underline}** by each station [goes to the
air-conditioning]{.underline} [used to cool transmission
equipment]{.underline}.

In the city of Hangzhou, **[Huawei]{.underline}** and a major Chinese
telecom provider [have deployed new 5G base stations that require fewer
heat-generating electronic components]{.underline}. [They]{.underline}
also [use sophisticated power management software and trade
air-conditioning for open-air cooling]{.underline}.

Compared to 4G stations, the [new stations use almost 20 percent less
electricity]{.underline}. That [saves an estimated 4,130 kWh of power
per site per year]{.underline}, [which translates t]{.underline}o about
**[1,125 kilograms]{.underline}** (kg) [of carbon
emissions]{.underline}.

If the efficiency of the entire infrastructure doesn't go up, it won't
make financial or environmental sense. It won't be sustainable.

Similarly, other companies in Europe and Japan have developed base
stations that use liquid cooling and solar power. Respectively, those
solutions reduce energy operating expenses by nearly a third and CO2
emissions by up to 80 percent.

What could these reductions mean at scale? Between now and 2022, [Huawei
estimates]{.underline}, [more than 2 million base stations in China
alone will be built or reconstructed for 5G.]{.underline}

[Apply that number to the energy-use reductions]{.underline} achieved in
Hangzhou, and [that's 8.3 billion]{.underline} [kWh of electricity and
2.3 billion kg of **carbon emissions** saved per year]{.underline}. [The
first number is almost the same as total annual household power
consumption in Iceland. The second is equivalent to the **yearly** CO2
absorption of **130 million trees.**]{.underline}

"[When you're talking about]{.underline} hundreds of [thousands of base
stations]{.underline}, [even a 1 percent savings in power use is
**huge**]{.underline}," says Scott Jamar, Huawei's vice president of
Industry Relations.

Better base station efficiency isn't the only way to reduce 5G power
use. [Huawei]{.underline} and others [are developing additional
solutions]{.underline}, including:

**[Sleep Modes]{.underline}**

CURRENT [4G NETWORKS]{.underline} [use]{.underline} almost [the same
amount of energy regardless of how much data they are
handling]{.underline}. By contrast, **[5G will allow telecoms
to]{.underline}** **[reduce power consumption]{.underline}** [during
periods of lower network traffic]{.underline}---like [late at
night]{.underline}, [when most customers are sleeping instead of
using]{.underline} their mobile [devices]{.underline}.

"I work in an industrial park," Chang says. "[During the day, lots of
people go there to work]{.underline}. They're checking emails and making
lots of phone calls. [The nearby base station has to work at peak
capacity to process all of that data]{.underline}.

"But [at night, those same people leave]{.underline}. So [you don't need
that peak capacity]{.underline}. [With 5G, you can **lower your power
use** significantly]{.underline}, [without sacrificing performance for
the individual user]{.underline} who happens to still be there and
online."

**[Analytics & Artificial Intelligence]{.underline}**

[THE DATA CENTERS]{.underline} that store our photos, host our websites,
and handle our cloud computing [consume an enormous amount of
energy]{.underline}. [In the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} alone,
[data centers are expected to use about 73 billion kWh]{.underline} by
next year.

As is the case with base stations, [much of that power goes to keeping
equipment cool]{.underline} enough to function properly. And [that's
where]{.underline} [data analysis]{.underline} and artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) can help.

[Deploying an algorithm that learns how]{.underline} best [to
adjust]{.underline} fans, vents, and other [cooling equipment to cut
power consumption]{.underline}, a major American tech company
[reduced]{.underline} its data center [cooling costs]{.underline} by
about 40 percent. Meanwhile, [a leading Chinese telecom claims it was
able to reduce power consumption]{.underline} at its data centers
[by]{.underline} roughly **[30 percent]{.underline}** [during recent AI
trials]{.underline}.

Similarly, [Huawei]{.underline} has [helped telecoms in
**China**]{.underline}, **[Morocco]{.underline}**, [and **South
Africa**]{.underline} [lower **power consumption**]{.underline} on
[their existing networks by **12 percent**]{.underline}. How? [Through a
software-based analytic system that allows operators to visualize
and]{.underline} better [manage their overall energy use]{.underline}.

"[The main thing AI does is look at]{.underline} different [data sets
and make sense]{.underline} out [of them]{.underline}," Jamar says.
"[With energy efficiency]{.underline}, [it gives us the ability to fine
tune our energy use]{.underline} [in different areas based on **network
traffic**]{.underline}, like [the difference between an urban area and a
rural one]{.underline}. And [those]{.underline}
**[optimizations]{.underline}** [reduce]{.underline} **[power
consumption]{.underline}**."

ULTIMATELY, [5G's most important contribution]{.underline} to energy
efficiency [may come through **enabling** users]{.underline}.
**[Environmentalists]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[policy]{.underline}** [think tanks alike believe]{.underline} that
[smart]{.underline}, [wirelessly-connected appliances]{.underline},
[factories]{.underline}, [cities]{.underline}, [and
transportation]{.underline} grids [will be able to]{.underline}
**[optimize]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[reduce]{.underline}**
their [power consumption]{.underline}, just like networks and data
centers. The end result? [Lower costs and a meaningful contribution to
global efforts to **mitigate climate change**.]{.underline}

"[The thing about 5G is]{.underline} that [we will have]{.underline}
much more [capacity to incorporate sensors into daily life]{.underline},
[from industry to]{.underline} our own [homes]{.underline}," Chang says.
"And [that will allow us to modulate]{.underline} our [energy
use]{.underline} in so many places we've overlooked, just because we
didn't have the communications tools to make equipment truly smart.
[With 5G,]{.underline} [our society as a whole can become much more
energy efficient]{.underline}."

#### Huawei 5G is critical to [broader shifts]{.underline} in green technology \-\-- they've already reduced [230 million tons]{.underline} of CO2 emissions

[The]{.underline} **[digital economy]{.underline}** [has become
a]{.underline} **[major engine]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** [economic growth]{.underline}.
[Green]{.underline} and low[-carbon technologies]{.underline} [have
becom]{.underline}e new d[rivers for sustainable
development.]{.underline} [This]{.underline}
**[combination]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [digital transformation
and green development presents the]{.underline} information and
communications technology ([ICT]{.underline}) [industry
with]{.underline} incredible [new opportunities]{.underline}.

[As]{.underline} global [climate change]{.underline} [is one of the
greatest challenges human]{.underline} beings [face]{.underline} today,
and [carbon neutrality]{.underline}, as the best way to cope with this
change, [has become the]{.underline} **[global consensus]{.underline}**
and mission[. Carbon neutrality is]{.underline} also
[meaningful]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[national]{.underline}**
[energy security]{.underline}. Since the end of last year,
[international energy markets]{.underline} have
**[fluctuated]{.underline}** sharply, and [the crisis has resulted in
a]{.underline} **[dramatic increase]{.underline}** [in the cost of
economics]{.underline}; a reminder that [more attention to energy
security is required]{.underline}.

Seeing this trend, [Huawei announced]{.underline} during APAC Digital
Innovation Congress that [it will continuously innovate]{.underline},
[use green ICT to empower green development]{.underline}, [and
contribute to a]{.underline} better, **[green]{.underline}** and
intelligent [world]{.underline}.

"Huawei always considers Asia Pacific as our strategic market. By the
end of 2021, almost all of the ASEAN countries have set carbon neutral
targets. [Huawei]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[committed]{.underline}** [to invest in Asia Pacific]{.underline}
continually [following the governments' pace]{.underline}," said by
Boham Sun, President of Huawei Digital Power of Asia Pacific on session
of Technology Innovation-Accelerating Power Digitalisation for a
Low-Carbon Smart Society.

According to Boham Sun, [Huawei]{.underline} Digital Power [has more
than 6,000 employees]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [12 R&D
centers]{.underline} **[globally]{.underline}** [with more
than]{.underline} [1,300 technology patents]{.underline},
[showing]{.underline} **[Huawei's leadership]{.underline}** [in Digital
Power Industry]{.underline}.

[Leveraging]{.underline} its [advantages]{.underline} [in power
electronics and **digital technologies**]{.underline},
[Huawei]{.underline} Digital Power [has created all-scenario low-carbon
energy **solutions**]{.underline}, [covering the]{.underline}
[whole]{.underline} **[energy flow]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}
[green power generation to]{.underline} **[efficient power
consumption]{.underline}**, including [Smart PV for green power
generation]{.underline}, [Data Center]{.underline} Facility and Site
Power facility [for green ICT infrastructure]{.underline}, [mPower for
green transportation]{.underline}.

On the road towards the low carbon vision, it is impossible to clap with
one hand. [Huawei is]{.underline} **[committed]{.underline}** [to
building]{.underline} **[a low-carbon]{.underline}** and green
Asia-Pacific [region ecosystem]{.underline}. [Huawei is focused
on]{.underline} **[core technologies]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
solutions and openly [cooperates with customers]{.underline},
[industry]{.underline} partners [and regulators]{.underline}, [to
build]{.underline} future "**[zero carbon to everything]{.underline}**"
solutions [to realize the carbon neutrality goal]{.underline}.

As a member of Asia Pacific, **[digitization]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[low-carbonization]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
two mostly [embraced consensuses in the world]{.underline}. [Thailand is
taking a forward-looking vision]{.underline} in this journey and is one
step ahead of most countries in both digitalization and
low-carbonization. In the journey towards a low-carbon future, Thailand
is [the first ASEAN country to commit to carbon neutrality]{.underline}.
At the recent 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26),
Thailand proposed the Carbon Neutrality 2050 roadmap to address climate
change, which is the same as the EU milestone.

[Towards this]{.underline} visionary [goal of **Carbon Neutrality
2050**]{.underline}, **[digitalization]{.underline}** [will play a
crucial role]{.underline} in the great journey.

[In Thailand]{.underline}, [Huawei established digital power
business]{.underline} last year [to]{.underline} fully
**[support]{.underline}** its [carbon neutrality]{.underline} goals. So
far, [Huawei has delivered more than 2.4GW of Smart Inverter to serve
more than 1000 customers and partners]{.underline} with best LCOE, in
total **[producing 6.18 billion kWh]{.underline}** [of clean energy
and]{.underline} **[reducing carbon emissions by 6.16 million
tons]{.underline}**. For example, [TSE Prachinburi 10MW floating power
station]{.underline}; 7[-Eleven\'s 1500 convenience store rooftop
photovoltaics]{.underline}; [Central Plaza Maha Chai 1.4MW PV roof;
Krabi 5MW PV power station]{.underline}. Also in 2021, it was estimated
that about [50,000 households had installed solar inverters, of which
14,000 were provided by Huawei]{.underline}.

Ken Hu, rotating chairman of Huawei also cited during APAC Digital
Innovation Congress that, "APAC is going green. [Countries
are]{.underline} really **[committed]{.underline}** [to sustainable
development]{.underline}. For example, [Japan and Thailand]{.underline}
have [committed to carbon neutrality]{.underline} by 2050. [Singapore is
committed to reaching peak carbon emissions by 2030]{.underline}. [China
will reach peak carbon emissions by 2030]{.underline}, and carbon
neutrality by 2060. Of course, **[digital technology]{.underline}**
[will be a key enabler]{.underline} throughout this process."

Simon Lin, President of Huawei\'s Asia Pacific Region, gave a on the
abundance of digital opportunities in APAC. He spoke about the
company\'s mission, \"In Asia-Pacific, for Asia-Pacific\", under speech
which [**Huawei is** committed to becoming a key contributor to the
digital economy in Asia-Pacific and working with customers and partners
to build a]{.underline} better **[green digital life]{.underline}**.

Lin said, \"[Huawei hopes to help]{.underline} Asia-Pacific [build a
leading]{.underline} **[green infrastructure]{.underline}**, [create a
thriving **industry ecosystem**]{.underline}, [and empower an inclusive
and **sustainable** Asia-Pacific]{.underline}.\"

According to Lin, [Huawei]{.underline} has [provided]{.underline}
**[connectivity]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} more than [90 million
households]{.underline} [and one billion mobile users]{.underline} in
Asia-Pacific. [Huawei\'s IaaS market share ranks No 4]{.underline} in
the emerging Asia-Pacific market, and [Huawei is
integrating]{.underline} **[digital and power electronics]{.underline}**
[technologies to enable energy digitalization for a greener
future.]{.underline}

[Huawei continues to **invest extensively**]{.underline} in research and
development [to reduce carbon footprint]{.underline} [of E2E products
and services by more than 80% compared to other products of the same
capacity.]{.underline}

"As of December 31, 2021, [Huawei]{.underline} Digital Power had
[already helped customers generate]{.underline} **[482.9 billion kWh of
green power]{.underline}**, [save 14.2 billion kWh of
electricity]{.underline}, and **[reduce CO2 emissions by 230 million
tonnes]{.underline}**, which is [equivalent to planting 320 million
trees]{.underline}," said by Boham Sun. "[Huawei]{.underline} also [aims
to develop its products to achieve]{.underline} 2[.7 times more energy
efficiency]{.underline}. [With combined digital and electronic
technologies]{.underline}, [Huawei develops innovative digital power
solutions that allow]{.underline} the most [efficient use of energy and
reduce CO2 emissions]{.underline} from ICT infrastructure. In 2021,
[Huawei has helped customers **around the world**]{.underline}
[reduce]{.underline} [CO2 emissions by]{.underline} **[230 million
metric tons]{.underline}**."

### China Good\-\--AT: China Fails\-\--2NC

#### China's tech sector is [resilient]{.underline}\-\--Xi's reforms [benefit]{.underline} the US

**Ignatius 21** (David Ignatius, writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs
column for The Washington Post, education from Harvard College, Kings
College, Cambridge, 11-9-2021, \"Xi's heavy-handed reforms of China's
tech sector could have an upside for the U.S.\" Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/09/xis-heavy-handed-reforms-chinas-tech-sector-could-have-an-upside-us/,
DOA: 7-10-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

[Napoleon]{.underline} is [said]{.underline} to have advised his
commanders: [**Never** interrupt your adversary]{.underline} [when he is
making a mistake]{.underline}. Some [American experts]{.underline} on
China [would offer a similar admonition]{.underline} [as they
watch]{.underline} President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping['s]{.underline}
heavy-handed **[regulation]{.underline}** [of China's tech
sector]{.underline}.

Over the past year, [Xi]{.underline} has [conducted]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} **[mini-purge]{.underline}** [against]{.underline}
[Internet entrepreneurs whose companies had been the]{.underline}
**[darlings]{.underline}** [of the tech world]{.underline}. [The
question]{.underline} puzzling U.S. analysts [is whether
Xi's]{.underline} leftward [turn is doing any]{.underline} permanent
**[damage]{.underline}** [to China's tech sector,]{.underline} [or
whether the Chinese economy is so]{.underline} **[strong and
dynamic]{.underline}** that [it can **absorb**]{.underline} [Xi's
mistakes]{.underline} and keep rolling.

[China's economic **strength**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[weakness]{.underline}** [will loom in the background]{.underline}
next week [as]{.underline} President [Biden talks with Xi]{.underline}
during a virtual summit. Clearly, [China's growth is
**slowing**]{.underline}, and Foreign Affairs posted an article last
month with the provocative title, "The End of China's Rise." But [past
experience suggests]{.underline} [it would be a]{.underline}
**[mistake]{.underline}** [to bet on China's **inability** to solve
**problems**]{.underline}.

Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister who is also a China
expert, says of Xi's recent crackdown on Chinese tycoons: "I don't think
it will kill the goose. But it's going to slow the goose." A senior U.S.
official offers a similar view: "[Xi is taking]{.underline} incredible
**[risks]{.underline}**" in his recent economic purge. "But [he has
**enormous**]{.underline} [margin for error]{.underline}. Like the U.S.
in its heyday, **[China can absorb failure]{.underline}**."

[China's]{.underline} **[Internet bubble]{.underline}** certainly [has
deflated]{.underline}. Jack [Ma]{.underline}, [founder of]{.underline}
[Alibaba]{.underline}, was **[silenced]{.underline}** a year ago after
he dared to criticize Chinese authorities; [regulators halted
the]{.underline} initial [public offering]{.underline} planned for his
Ant Group last November. [Advance orders for the]{.underline}
[stock]{.underline} had [reached \$3 trillion before]{.underline}
**[Beijing pulled the plug]{.underline}**. [China's
antitrust]{.underline} regulator subsequently [levied a \$2.8 billion
fine against Alibaba.]{.underline}

[Investors]{.underline} have [**suffered** from Xi's tech
putsch]{.underline}. [Shares in Alibaba]{.underline} Holding Co., the
flagship of Ma's empire, have [declined]{.underline} nearly [41
percent]{.underline} over the past year. [Didi Global]{.underline}, a
Chinese ride-hailing company, [has fallen 47 percent]{.underline} since
July. [Tencent Holdings]{.underline}, another Internet powerhouse, [has
dropped about 40 percent]{.underline} from its peak in February.

[**Caution** is]{.underline} now [the watchword]{.underline} in a sector
that was once as freewheeling and risk-tolerant as Silicon Valley. [As
Alibaba was being fined]{.underline} in April, **[antitrust
regulators]{.underline}** [summoned 34 Internet companies and
demanded]{.underline} self-criticism and [compliance]{.underline}. [A
dozen companies]{.underline} duly [issued]{.underline}
[statements]{.underline} **[promising reform]{.underline}**. [These
encounters raised worries]{.underline} that [Xi was returning
to]{.underline} the **[struggle sessions]{.underline}** [of the Cultural
Revolution]{.underline}.

But dunce caps aside, the irony is that [Xi's critique of **Big Tech**
is similar to]{.underline} recent debates in [the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. He argues that [the Internet boom]{.underline},
[by creating]{.underline} new [billionaires]{.underline}, [is worsening
**inequality**]{.underline}. Instead, [he wants]{.underline} "**[common
prosperity]{.underline}**." And he complains that [social media
companies have fostered gaming]{.underline} and other trivial pursuits,
[rather than a]{.underline} genuine **[technological
revolution]{.underline}**. Hard to disagree with any of that.

What makes [Xi's reform campaign]{.underline} dangerous for the Chinese
economy [is]{.underline} that he's [imposing change with]{.underline}
**[the iron fist]{.underline}** [of a police state]{.underline}. In
place of independent tech giants such as Alibaba and Tencent, [he
prefers state-owned enterprises]{.underline}, or "**[little
giants]{.underline}**," [that accept Communist Party
authority]{.underline}. Docile, [compliant tech executives may satisfy
Xi's commissars]{.underline}, [but they may be less likely to produce
the]{.underline} **[breakthrough ideas]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
can [power]{.underline} [Xi's]{.underline} "**[China
Dream]{.underline}**."

"[People are watching]{.underline}," says Christopher M. Schroeder, a
global investor who talks frequently with young Chinese tech innovators.
"M[any entrepreneurs]{.underline} I've spoken to
**[understand]{.underline}** [government concerns]{.underline} that Ant,
as an example, may have had legitimate issues that needed to be
addressed before going public," he says, and he [doubts there will be
a]{.underline} "**[slowing of]{.underline}** the astounding [rise of
tech start-ups in China]{.underline}." But it's a wary moment.

Christopher Johnson, a former CIA analyst who now runs a consulting firm
called China Strategies Group, notes Xi's comments last month to a
Politburo "study session on the digital economy." [Xi
stressed]{.underline} that [to]{.underline} "**[seize the commanding
heights]{.underline}**" [of global technology]{.underline}, [he wants to
make China]{.underline} **[self-reliant]{.underline}** [in core
technologies]{.underline}, such as semiconductors, "[**a**s **s**oon
**a**s **p**ossible]{.underline}." [That means less emphasis on social
media]{.underline} platforms [and digital commerce]{.underline}, where
China's tech giants had been so successful.

Xi's message, says Johnson: "[Elites and tech moguls]{.underline} [need
to]{.underline} quit their complaining and **[get on
board]{.underline}**, [or they will be left to]{.underline} the dustbin
of [history]{.underline}."

[For the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, [here's the potential
benefit of Xi's diktats on tech]{.underline}: Imagine [a
brilliant]{.underline} young [Chinese computer scientist studying
at]{.underline} [Stanford]{.underline}, say, [or]{.underline} [working
for Google]{.underline}. [Returning]{.underline} home [to China may look
a bit less attractive]{.underline} --- and certainly [less
lucrative]{.underline} --- than it did a year ago. In Shanghai or
Silicon Valley, **[brainpower doesn't follow orders from
politicians]{.underline}**.

#### China is [already prepared]{.underline} to become the [tech-hegemon]{.underline}\-\--US attempts to [control]{.underline} the industry are [ineffective]{.underline}

on the intersection of technology and geopolitics in Asia and Steven Lee

[China is freeing]{.underline} up tens of [billions of dollars for its
**tech industry**]{.underline} to borrow. [It is cataloging]{.underline}
the [sectors]{.underline} where [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates or others [could cut
off access to]{.underline} **[crucial technologies]{.underline}**. And
when its leaders released their most important economic plans last week,
[they laid out]{.underline} their [ambitions to become]{.underline}
[an]{.underline} **[innovation superpower]{.underline}** beholden to
none.

[Anticipating efforts by]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline}
administration to [continue to **challenge**]{.underline}
[China's]{.underline} [tech]{.underline}nological [rise]{.underline},
[the country's leaders are **accelerating**]{.underline} [plans to go it
alone]{.underline}, [seeking to address]{.underline}
**[vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline} country's
[economy]{.underline} [that could thwart]{.underline} its [ambitions
in]{.underline} a wide range of [industries, from smartphones to jet
engines]{.underline}.

[China has made]{.underline} audacious and [ambitious plans
before]{.underline} --- in 2015 --- but is falling short of its goals.
[With]{.underline} more countries becoming wary of [China's behavior
and]{.underline} its growing [economic might]{.underline}, [Beijing's
drive for]{.underline} **[technological independence]{.underline}** [has
taken on a new urgency]{.underline}. The country's new five-year plan,
made public on Friday, [called tech development]{.underline} [a matter
of]{.underline} **[national security]{.underline}**, [not just economic
development]{.underline}, a break from the previous plan.

[The plan pledged to increase]{.underline} [spending on]{.underline}
[**r**esearch a**n**d **d**evelopment]{.underline} by 7 percent
annually, [including]{.underline} the [public and private
sectors]{.underline}. That [figure]{.underline} was **[higher
than]{.underline}** budget increases for [China's military]{.underline},
which is slated to grow 6.8 percent next year, raising the prospect of
an era of looming Cold War-like competition with the United States.

[The]{.underline} spending [pledges follow]{.underline} four tumultuous
years during which President Donald J. [Trump]{.underline} rattled ---
and angered --- the Communist Party leadership under Xi Jinping by
[restricting access to American technology for]{.underline} some of its
corporate giants, including **[Huawei]{.underline}**.

[The experience]{.underline} has [hardened a view that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, even under a new
administration, [is determined to undercut the country's advancement
and]{.underline} that [China can]{.underline} **[no
longer]{.underline}** [rely on the West for]{.underline} a stable supply
of the [technologies]{.underline} [that]{.underline} help
[drive]{.underline} its [economic growth]{.underline}.

"[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
which has already climbed to the summit, [wants to kick away the
ladder]{.underline}," Zhang Xiaojing, an economist with the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, wrote on the eve of the legislative meetings
now underway in Beijing.

[The road to]{.underline} the "**[global peaks]{.underline}** [of
technology]{.underline}," as Mr. Xi has described China's aspirations,
[is]{.underline} decidedly [uphill]{.underline}. The government had
previously set out to spend 2.5 percent of gross domestic product on
research and development in the last five years, but actual expenditures
failed to reach that target.

[One sector]{.underline} that [China]{.underline} has [struggled with is
microchips]{.underline}, which much of its electronics production relies
on. Bewilderingly [complex production]{.underline} has [stymied Chinese
businesses]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} instead
[import]{.underline} the majority of [the semiconductors they
require]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} tens of
**[billions]{.underline}** of dollars **[invested]{.underline}**,
[China's]{.underline} domestic [chip production met only 15.9 percent
of]{.underline} its chip [demand]{.underline} in 2020, barely higher
than the 15.1 percent share it accounted for in 2014, according to IC
Insights, an American semiconductor research firm.

[China's premier]{.underline}, Li Keqiang, last week [detailed proposals
to]{.underline} **[accelerate]{.underline}** the development of high-end
[semiconductors]{.underline}, operating systems, computer processors,
cloud computing [and]{.underline} [**a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline}.

"I think [they're]{.underline} really [worried]{.underline}," said
Rebecca Arcesati, a tech analyst with the Mercator Institute for China
Studies in Berlin. "[They know]{.underline} that [without access
to]{.underline} those technologies, [they won't]{.underline} be able to
[reach their targets]{.underline}."

[The new strategy]{.underline}, to a degree, **[rebrands]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} country's previous Made in China 2025
[campaign]{.underline}, which sought to propel it to the lead in a range
of cutting-edge technologies. It broadly set out to produce 70 percent
of the core components that Chinese manufacturers needed by 2025. The
plan scared trade partners and contributed to a punishing trade war with
the United States.

"[China wants to]{.underline} **[reduce its dependency]{.underline}**
[on the world]{.underline} --- [not to reduce]{.underline} its
[trade]{.underline} and interaction [but to ensure]{.underline} that [it
is not vulnerable to]{.underline} the kind of **[strategic
blackmail]{.underline}** against China that it has historically used
against others," said Daniel Russel, a former American diplomat who is
now a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

[A confrontation has been brewing]{.underline} for more than a decade.
Long-held [Chinese policies]{.underline} to [winnow reliance on foreign
tech]{.underline} got a boost in 2013, after disclosures by Edward
Snowden about National Security Agency hacks that relied on American
firms.

[American companies have]{.underline} long [complained about policies
mandating tech transfer. Chinese **government-backed**]{.underline}
[hacks aimed at American intellectual property]{.underline} have further
[raised]{.underline} **[tensions]{.underline}**. [China]{.underline} has
in the past [used]{.underline} corporate **[espionage]{.underline}** [to
support economic interests]{.underline}, including in the high-tech
fields that the government is now making a priority.

[The]{.underline} [latest intrusion against]{.underline} business and
government agencies used [Microsoft]{.underline} email systems and was
discovered last weekend. Tentatively [linked to Chinese
hackers]{.underline}, it [is likely to]{.underline} **[sharpen a
divide]{.underline}** [that could split the tech world]{.underline}.

In recent weeks, [Chinese officials]{.underline} have repeatedly
[emphasized the danger of]{.underline} "**[choke points]{.underline}**"
[where the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [controls
key]{.underline} foundational [technologies]{.underline}. At a news
conference in [Beijing]{.underline}, Xiao Yaqing, who leads the Ministry
of Industry and Information Technology, announced a review of [41
sectors for]{.underline} "**[empty spots]{.underline}**" [that could
cause the tech supply chain to break]{.underline} "during crucial
times."

[Beijing is backing this effort with money and rhetoric]{.underline}.

[China Development Bank]{.underline}, the country's policy lender,
[said]{.underline} last week that [it was preparing]{.underline} over
[\$60 billion in loans]{.underline} [for]{.underline} more than [1,000
firms]{.underline} [key to]{.underline} **[strategic
innovation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} had [raised]{.underline}
[\$30 billion for a]{.underline} new government-backed [microchip
investment fund]{.underline}.

A Chinese Academy of Engineering official, Ni Guangnan, wrote recently
that the country should create a "Chinese system" that could supplant
the combined systems of Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and others that have
historically dominated computing. China should also increase the world's
reliance on its telecom infrastructure technology to "form a powerful
deterrent" against future embargoes, he added.

[The tech supply chain remains]{.underline} hugely [**complex**
and]{.underline} resolutely **[global]{.underline}**, and [too much
meddling in the markets can have unforeseen consequences]{.underline},
experts have warned. Top-down [jockeying by the]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} [over microchips]{.underline} [has]{.underline} in
part [triggered a chip shortage]{.underline} that recently hit the auto
industry.

[Neither country can]{.underline} imminently [attain]{.underline} true
**[self-reliance]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the myriad
[cutting-edge technologies]{.underline} required to run a modern economy
and military. In place of overarching policies, [a]{.underline} **[proxy
fight]{.underline}** [is emerging]{.underline}, with [both sides working
to secure missing pieces]{.underline} that come from other countries.

Many [American allies]{.underline} have been [happy to see]{.underline}
their [companies take advantage of a Chinese market]{.underline}
increasingly **[emptied]{.underline}** [of American
companies.]{.underline}

Earlier this month, ASML, [a Dutch company]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [makes the tools]{.underline} required
[to]{.underline} mass [produce microchips]{.underline}, said it h[ad
extended a contract to]{.underline} provide equipment to
[China]{.underline}'s largest semiconductor maker, [even
though]{.underline} [Washington put the firm]{.underline}, known as
[SMIC]{.underline}, **[on a blacklist]{.underline}** last year. [The
extension did not]{.underline} break any [restrictions]{.underline},
[but showed]{.underline} how **[there are limits]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
[ability to cut off supplies]{.underline}.

Decisions like that could continue to frustrate President Biden, who has
cast China as the country's most significant foreign policy challenge.
[China hopes to]{.underline} **[undercut]{.underline}** [American
efforts to]{.underline} **[isolate]{.underline}** [it by]{.underline}
**[entwining]{.underline}** [itself with major economies]{.underline},
[including those]{.underline} **[politically allied]{.underline}** [with
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.

"[They're]{.underline} certainly speaking and [acting with a view
of]{.underline} **[discouraging]{.underline}** [third countries from
joining]{.underline} any posse [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}
might organize against China," Mr. Russel of the Asia Society Policy
Institute said. [The goal is to buy]{.underline} "[time needed by China
to seal up]{.underline} the remaining **[vulnerabilities]{.underline}**
in its armor."

Whatever hopes Chinese leaders had about a diplomatic reset after the
Trump years appear to have already waned.

Mr. [Biden's]{.underline} first [conversation with]{.underline} Mr.
[Xi]{.underline} lasted about two hours and, according to the White
House, [included discussions about]{.underline} "[Beijing's
**coercive**]{.underline} and **[unfair]{.underline}** [economic
practices]{.underline}."

At home, Mr. [Biden]{.underline} has [warned]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[needs to keep up with China on]{.underline} investments in
[infrastructure]{.underline}, some [in support of tech
industries]{.underline}, including electric vehicles. "[If we don't get
moving]{.underline}, **[they're going to eat our lunch]{.underline}**,"
he said while making the case for the \$1.9 trillion economic stimulus
plan.

The phrase echoed one he had made as a candidate only two years before
--- to dismiss the challenge posed by China. "[China's going to eat our
lunch]{.underline}?" he said while stumping in Iowa in 2019. "**[C'mon,

**[DANGER AHEAD]{.underline}**

Today, [the U.S.-Chinese relationship is]{.underline} **[in free
fall]{.underline}**. [Economic relations are]{.underline} **[on the
rocks]{.underline}** [due to]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration's [trade war]{.underline}, [and U.S. technology policy
aims to put]{.underline} **[Chinese firms such as Huawei]{.underline}**
[out of business]{.underline}. [It is easy to see how]{.underline} any
number of [flash points could trigger]{.underline} **[a
war]{.underline}** in the coming years. Events on the Korean Peninsula
could draw in the United States and China, and both [countries' military
maneuvers have raised tensions]{.underline} in the South China Sea and
the Taiwan Strait. [Washington is]{.underline} also
[challenging]{.underline} long-established understandings about
[Taiwan's status by edging closer to recognizing the island's
independence]{.underline} from China [and openly acknowledging the
United States' military commitment to defend Taiwan]{.underline}. The
United States has also reacted strongly to Beijing's repression of
China's Uighur Muslim minority and to its imposition of a harsh new
security law on Hong Kong. In both cases, [a bipartisan array of U.S.
officials have condemned China, and both Congress and the Trump
administration have imposed **retaliatory sanctions**.]{.underline}

[Despite]{.underline} such **[pushback]{.underline}**, however, [China
is unlikely to **abandon** its goal of becoming a]{.underline} regional
**[hegemon]{.underline}** in East Asia. [Beijing will]{.underline} also
[continue]{.underline} **[pressing]{.underline}** [the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [to accord it respect as a great-power
equal]{.underline}. **[Avoiding war]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
**[accommodating China's desires]{.underline}** [would require the
**U**nited **S**tates to **retract**]{.underline} [its security
guarantee to Taiwan and recognize Beijing's claims on the
island]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline} would also [need to accept
the reality]{.underline} that [its liberal values]{.underline} **[are
not universal]{.underline}** and thus [stop interfering in China's
internal affairs by condemning Beijing's policies]{.underline} in Hong
Kong and Xinjiang and [issuing thinly veiled calls for regime
change]{.underline}.

[There is little chance]{.underline} that [the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [will take]{.underline} those
[steps]{.underline}. [Doing so would mean]{.underline}
**[acknowledging]{.underline}** [the end of **U.S.
primacy.**]{.underline} [This makes the prospect of a]{.underline} hot
[war]{.underline} ever more **[likely]{.underline}**. Unlike during the
Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union generally accepted
each other's European spheres of influence, today, [Washington and
Beijing have]{.underline} **[starkly different]{.underline}** [views of
who should enjoy]{.underline} **[preeminence]{.underline}** [in the East
China and South China Seas and Taiwan.]{.underline}

[If Washington does not cede]{.underline} its
**[dominance]{.underline}** [in East Asia it is on the]{.underline}
**[fast track to war.]{.underline}**

[U.S. public opinion is]{.underline} also **[unlikely]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} act as a [check]{.underline} on [this]{.underline}
potential [march to war]{.underline}. Historically, the [country's
foreign policy establishment has not]{.underline} been particularly
**[responsive]{.underline}** to public opinion, and many [American
voters know little about]{.underline} U.S. [overseas military
commitments]{.underline} and their implications. In the event of a
Chinese attack, especially on Taiwan, the "rally around the flag" effect
and the U.S. government's ability to manipulate public opinion would
likely neuter public opposition to war. U.S. leaders would condemn
Beijing as a ruthless, aggressive, and expansionist communist
dictatorship aiming to suppress the freedom-loving people of a
democratic territory. The U.S. public would be told that war was
necessary to uphold the United States' universal values. Of course, as
was the case with World War I, the Vietnam War, and the Iraq war, public
disillusionment would set in if the war went badly. By then, however, it
would be too late.

### China Good\-\--AT: Huawei Bad\-\--2NC

DOA: 7-5-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

[The UK government is happy to allow Huawei]{.underline} equipment [to
form part of the UK's 5G network]{.underline} -- **[just
not]{.underline}** any of the **[crucial parts]{.underline}**, according
to leaked discussions from the National Security Council. [The United
States and Australia have taken a]{.underline} much more hardline
approach, with [complete bans on]{.underline} using [Huawei]{.underline}
equipment to form any part of their 5G network. **[What is all the worry
about]{.underline}**?

According to telecoms firm Qualcomm, [5G mobile internet gives a
**massive** speed boost]{.underline} -- at least [10 or 20 times
greater]{.underline} -- [over]{.underline} our current [4G]{.underline}
networks. [As devices start sharing more]{.underline} and more
[data]{.underline}, from phones streaming data-rich video to
self-driving cars, [it's **vital** to have a speedy
**connection**.]{.underline}

[Countries]{.underline} across the world [are]{.underline} currently
[planning]{.underline} [their 5G networks]{.underline} and as one of the
world's largest tech firms, **[Huawei]{.underline}** [is vying for the
business]{.underline} -- but [finding closed doors]{.underline}.

[The main fear is]{.underline} that [Huawei will install snooping
devices]{.underline} at the behest of the Chinese government -- [a worry
that **stems from a belief** that **it's not possible** to operate in
China **without engaging** with the state apparatus and acting as an arm
of its **spy network**]{.underline}.

[It's a concern stoked by Chinese plans to pass a cybersecurity
law]{.underline} [that requires Chinese companies transferring data to
store "important data" in the country]{.underline} -- [where outsiders
fear it could be accessed easily by state mandate]{.underline}.

[The UK]{.underline} regularly [monitors Huawei's equipment as part of
the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre Oversight Board]{.underline}
-- [a body set up to allay fears about the technology being tampered
with]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} apparent [decision]{.underline}
from the UK's National Security Council [is to give Huawei access only
to the edge of the 5G]{.underline} network, [which **does not involve**
the transmission of **sensitive information**]{.underline}, keeping the
core of the network safe.

**[Bans for Huawei]{.underline}**

However [other **countries** have gone **further**]{.underline}. Last
August, [Australia's communication minister]{.underline} and home
affairs minister [said]{.underline} in a joint statement [that there is
a risk that companies subject to foreign governments may be asked
give]{.underline} **[unauthorized access]{.underline}** [to their
networks]{.underline}. Though the statement didn't explicitly mention
[Huawei]{.underline}, the firm later said they [had been **banned** from
being involved with Australia's 5G **infrastructure**.]{.underline}

[Similar noises have been made in the]{.underline} US. A **[US State
Department]{.underline}** ambassador [warned]{.underline} in February
that [Huawei and other Chinese technology companies posed a
"threat"]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that [they shouldn't be allowed
to engage with key communications infrastructure]{.underline}, such as
antennas and mast-based equipment to access the network.

[The]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[has yet to take a stance]{.underline}, [asking member states to
submit]{.underline} its own [cybersecurity assessments of Huawei's
involvement in Europe's 5G network]{.underline} by the end of June. In
March a representative of [the German intelligence service said Huawei
shouldn't be involved in the country's 5G network.]{.underline}

**[The fears may be unfounded]{.underline}** however. [Sensitive data
should never be sent over a public network **without being encrypted**
anyway]{.underline}. [This means that even if the message is intercepted
it's]{.underline} nearly [**impossible** to read]{.underline}.

[Additionally]{.underline}, so far [no evidence has made it into
the]{.underline} public [domain]{.underline} showing [that Huawei has
mishandled data]{.underline} or is tied up with the Chinese state.

[No one company should be entrusted with]{.underline} something as
critical as the [5G]{.underline} network, as if something goes wrong,
intentionally or otherwise, it could have devastating effects. [But if
the infrastructure is distributed among many different groups, others
can pick up the slack if needed]{.underline}.

Relations, where his work focuses on U.S.-China relations, U.S.-Taiwan

Should Do To Respond,\" Council on Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/china-huawei-5g, DOA: 7-5-2022//Smarx Ahsan)

In 2015, [China added the]{.underline} [Digital Silk Road]{.underline}
(**[DSR]{.underline}**) [to its]{.underline} massive [Belt]{.underline}
and [Road Initiative]{.underline} (**[BRI]{.underline}**). [While
Beijing uses DSR to offer]{.underline} a suite of
[technologies]{.underline} to BRI [countries]{.underline},
**[Huawei's]{.underline}** [effort to provide]{.underline}
[**next-gen**eration]{.underline} [communication networks to countries
has drawn]{.underline} the most **[scrutiny]{.underline}** [in
the]{.underline} [**U**nited **S**tates.]{.underline}

[U.S.]{.underline} [officials]{.underline} have frequently
[claimed]{.underline} that **[Huawei]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
effectively [an extension of the]{.underline} [**C**hinese **C**ommunist
**P**arty]{.underline}. Under China's 2017 National Intelligence Law,
**[Huawei]{.underline}**, like all Chinese companies and entities,
[appears legally required to conduct intelligence work on behalf of the
Chinese government]{.underline}. According to this analysis, [the
Chinese government has the ability to use]{.underline} Huawei-built
fifth-generation ([5G]{.underline}) [networks to collect intelligence,
monitor critics, and steal intellectual property]{.underline}. [There
are]{.underline} also [worries that the company might bow to government
demands and disable networks]{.underline} to exert coercive pressure on
a country.

[The]{.underline} [**U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} also [has
commercial concerns]{.underline}. [Once Huawei builds a]{.underline}
country's [5G network]{.underline}, [that country is likely to choose
Huawei to upgrade those systems when newer technologies become
available]{.underline}, [thus]{.underline} **[excluding U.S.
companies]{.underline}** for potentially decades. [Huawei has already
finalized more 5G contracts than any other telecom company]{.underline},
**[half of which are for 5G networks in Europe]{.underline}**.

[In Africa]{.underline}, **[Huawei]{.underline}** has [built 70 percent
of the continent's 4G networks]{.underline} [and has signed the **only**
formal agreement on 5G]{.underline}, with South African wireless carrier
Rain. [The export of Huawei telecom equipment along the DSR has enabled
the company's share of global telecom equipment to increase by 40
percent in the years since BRI was rolled out.]{.underline}

[In response to growing concerns about Huawei's reach]{.underline}, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [leveraged U.S]{.underline}.
**[dominance]{.underline}** [in advanced semiconductors to]{.underline}
**[bar sales]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} essential computer
[chips]{.underline} [to the company without a specific
license]{.underline}. [Access to U.S. chips]{.underline}, particularly
[5G-related semiconductors]{.underline} that enable wireless
communications, network management, and data storage, **[is crucial to
Huawei]{.underline}**, [which is reported to be running out of
supply.]{.underline} The [Trump]{.underline} administration also
[pressured countries not to use Chinese components in their 5G
infrastructure]{.underline}.

As part of a CFR Independent Task Force on BRI, we analyzed every
country's official policy toward Huawei 5G and the extent to which this
pressure campaign has succeeded. We found that in addition to the United
States, [eight countries have issued outright bans of the company.
Almost all of these are close U.S. allies such as Australia, Japan, and
the United Kingdom.]{.underline}

[More countries have taken a quieter approach]{.underline}, [attempting
to simultaneously allay U.S. concerns and **not provoke a Chinese
response**]{.underline}. Some have taken [measures that amount to a de
facto ban without actually barring Huawei]{.underline}. For example:

- [**India** has]{.underline} not formally banned the company but has
  [begun to phase out the use of Huawei equipment in future projects,
  and is reportedly weighing a formal ban.]{.underline}

- **[France]{.underline}** [announced telecommunications operators would
  not be able to renew licenses for Huawei]{.underline} equipment when
  they expired, effectively [phasing out the company's presence in the
  country]{.underline}.

- [**Vietnam** has not barred Huawei, but its service providers have
  avoided using its equipment in both their 4G and 5G
  networks.]{.underline}

- **[Italy's]{.underline}** [government vetoed]{.underline} [a deal
  between Huawei and]{.underline} telecommunications provider
  [Fastweb]{.underline} [that would have used Huawei as the sole
  supplier of its 5G network.]{.underline}

- **[Canada]{.underline}** has [put off a decision on Huawei for so long
  that]{.underline} its [companies have chosen to **exclude
  Huawei**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} their [5G
  networks]{.underline} due to the risk that they will be forced to
  replace the equipment in the future.

Still, [others have chosen to use Huawei's competitors without taking a
public stance against the company]{.underline}. The [largest
telecommunications firms in Belgium, Croatia, Finland, Greece, Norway,
Portugal, Singapore, and Spain have]{.underline} all [contracted with
Ericsson or Nokia to build their 5G networks.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} [has]{.underline} had [the world's]{.underline}
**[fastest-growing economy]{.underline}** since the 1980s. [A key
driver]{.underline} of this extraordinary growth [has been]{.underline}
the country's pragmatic system of **[innovation]{.underline}**, [which
balances]{.underline} [government steering and]{.underline}
market-oriented [entrepreneurs]{.underline}.

Right now, [this system is undergoing changes that]{.underline} may
[have]{.underline} profound [implications for the]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** economic and political **[order]{.underline}**.

[The Chinese government is pushing for]{.underline} better [**r**esearch
a**n**d **d**evelopment]{.underline}, "**[smart
manufacturing]{.underline}**" [facilities]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} more sophisticated [digital economy]{.underline}. At the
same time, **[tensions]{.underline}** [between China and the West
are]{.underline} **[straining]{.underline}** [international
cooperation]{.underline} [in industries]{.underline} such as
[semiconductor]{.underline} [and biopharmaceutical
manufacturing.]{.underline}

[Taken together with]{.underline} the shocks of the [Covid]{.underline}
pandemic, [and]{.underline} particularly China's rapid and large-scale
[lockdowns]{.underline}, [these developments could lead to a
**decoupling**]{.underline} [of China's **innovation**]{.underline}
system [from the rest of the world]{.underline}.

**[Balancing]{.underline}** [government and market]{.underline}

[China's]{.underline} current "**[innovation machine]{.underline}**"
started developing during the late 1970s when economic reforms lessened
the role of state ownership and central planning. In their place, room
[was made for the market to try new ideas through trial and
error]{.underline}.

[The government sets regulations **aligned** to the state's
objectives]{.underline} [and]{.underline} may [send
**signals**]{.underline} [to investors and entrepreneurs]{.underline}
via its own investments or policy settings. Within this setting,
[private businesses pursue opportunities]{.underline} in their own
interests.

However, freedom for businesses may be declining. Last year, the
government cracked down on the fintech and private tutoring sectors,
which were seen to be misaligned with government goals.

[China performs well on]{.underline} many measures of
[innovation]{.underline} **[performance]{.underline}**, [such
as]{.underline}

- [**R&D** expenditure]{.underline},

- Number of [scientific]{.underline} and [technological]{.underline}
  [publications]{.underline},

- Numbers of [STEM graduates]{.underline} and patents and

- Top [university rankings]{.underline}.

[Most of these]{.underline} indices, however, [measure quantity rather
than quality]{.underline}. So, for example, [China has]{.underline}:

- produced a huge number of scientific and technological publications
  but it [lags]{.underline} far [behind the US]{.underline}
  [in]{.underline} highly **[cited publications]{.underline}**, a
  measure of the influence and originality of research;

- substantially increased R&D expenditure -- but [the proportion of its
  R&D]{.underline} expenditure on basic research, especially by
  enterprises, is still far [lower than]{.underline} in many
  [industrialized countries]{.underline};

- educated many more STEM graduates than any other country in recent
  decades, but [still lacks top-tier talent in]{.underline} many areas
  such as [artificial intelligence and semiconductors]{.underline}

- applied for the most international patents of any country, but [the
  quality of]{.underline} these [patents]{.underline} measured by
  scientific influence and potential commercial value still [lags behind
  those of international competitors]{.underline}.

[Adding]{.underline} "**[quality]{.underline}**" [alongside]{.underline}
"**[quantity]{.underline}**" [will be crucial to China's
innovation]{.underline} ambitions.

In the past, policies have aimed to catch up with known technologies
used elsewhere, but [China will need to shift focus in order to
develop]{.underline} unknown and **[emerging
technologies]{.underline}**. [This will require]{.underline} both
[greater investment]{.underline} in longer-term basic research [and
reforms of the research]{.underline} culture [to tolerate
failure.]{.underline}

Developing **[smart manufacturing]{.underline}**

[Chinese firms can]{.underline} already [translate complex designs
into]{.underline} **[mass production]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
high [precision]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[unmatched]{.underline}** [speed]{.underline} and cost. As a result,
[Chinese manufacturing appeals to]{.underline} [high-tech
companies]{.underline} such as [Apple]{.underline} and
[Tesla]{.underline}.

The [next]{.underline} step [is]{.underline} [upgrading
toward]{.underline} "**[industry 4.0]{.underline}**" [smart
manufacturing]{.underline}, [aligned with]{.underline} the **[core
industries]{.underline}** listed in the government's Made in China 2025
blueprint.

By 2020, [China]{.underline} had [built]{.underline} [11 "lighthouse
factories"]{.underline} -- benchmark "smart" manufacturers -- [the most
of any country]{.underline} in the World Economic Forum's "global
lighthouse network."

[China's giant tech companies]{.underline} such as
[Alibaba]{.underline}, [Tencent]{.underline} and
**[Huawei]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} also [using machine learning
and big data analytics to innovate]{.underline} in other fields,
including [pharmaceutical research and autonomous driving]{.underline}.

In China, [the regulations for]{.underline}
**[biotechnology]{.underline}**, bioengineering and biopharmaceuticals
[are relatively relaxed]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} has [attracted
researchers and investors to]{.underline} several leading
[biotechnology]{.underline} "**[clusters]{.underline}**."

[China's population]{.underline} of more than 1.4 billion people also
[means that]{.underline} even for rare [diseases]{.underline} it [has
large numbers of patients]{.underline}. [Using]{.underline} large
patient **[databases]{.underline}**, [companies are making advances in
**precision medicine**]{.underline} (treatments [tailored to an
individual's genes]{.underline}, [environment]{.underline}, and
[lifestyle]{.underline}).

The rising power of China's big tech firms has seen the government step
in to maintain fair market competition. Regulations force digital firms
to share user data and consolidate critical "platform goods," such as
mobile payments, across their ecosystems.

**[International collaboration]{.underline}** is [key]{.underline}

[As we have seen in]{.underline} the recent triumph of [Covid-19
vaccines]{.underline}, [**global collaboration** in R&D is]{.underline}
hugely [valuable]{.underline}. However, [there are signs]{.underline}
that such [collaboration between China and the West may be under
threat]{.underline}.

The [**semiconductor** manufacturing]{.underline} industry -- [making
the chips and circuits that drive]{.underline} modern
[electronics]{.underline} -- [is]{.underline} now [global]{.underline},
[but at risk of fragmentation.]{.underline}

[Making chips requires]{.underline} huge amounts of [knowledge and
capital investment]{.underline}, and while [China]{.underline} is the
world's largest consumer of semiconductors, it **[relies heavily on
imports]{.underline}**. However, [US sanctions mean]{.underline} many
global [semiconductor companies cannot sell in China]{.underline}.

[China is now investing]{.underline} vast [sums]{.underline} in an
attempt [to be able to make all the semiconductors it
needs]{.underline}.

[If China succeeds]{.underline} in this, [one consequence
is]{.underline} that [Chinese-made semiconductors will]{.underline}
likely **[use different technical standards]{.underline}** from the
current ones.

**[Different standards]{.underline}**

[Diverging technical standards may seem]{.underline} like a
[minor]{.underline} issue, [but it will make it]{.underline} [more
difficult for **Chinese and Western**]{.underline}
[technologies]{.underline} and products [to work together]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} in turn [may reduce global trade and
investment]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} **[bad
results]{.underline}** [for consumers]{.underline}.

**[Decoupling standards]{.underline}** [will deepen the fracture
between]{.underline} [Chinese and Western **digital
innovation**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} in turn [will]{.underline}
likely [lead to further]{.underline} [decoupling in]{.underline}
[finance, trade and data]{.underline}.

At a time of heightened international tensions, [both China and the West
need to be clear on the value of]{.underline} **[international
collaboration]{.underline}** [in innovation.]{.underline}

[The **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} [put up another]{.underline}
major [roadblock]{.underline} this month [against
**Huawei**]{.underline}, [as China\'s big
telecommunications]{.underline} [company moves to set up the latest 5G
mobile networks worldwide]{.underline}.

On May 19, [the Commerce Department issued]{.underline} new [export
rules to **choke off Huawei\'s access** to semiconductor
chips]{.underline} [it needs to build]{.underline} cellphones and
**[5G]{.underline}** infrastructure.

[The new controls ban chipmakers]{.underline} --- mostly based in South
Korea and Taiwan --- [from using U.S. machines and software to
manufacture semiconductors **for Huawei**]{.underline}. [That closes a
loophole that]{.underline} had [allowed semiconductor makers to continue
to sell components and designs to Huawei as long as they
were]{.underline} made [outside the U.S]{.underline}.

Analysts say [this latest move]{.underline} likely [spells a death knell
for **Huawei\'s global ambitions**]{.underline} [by freezing out the
Chinese company from fundamental semiconductor technology
and]{.underline} by [raising the costs for hundreds of
countries]{.underline} [that were **relying on Huawei**]{.underline}
components [for their 5G expansion plans]{.underline}, including many in
Europe. [The new restrictions]{.underline} **[dramatically raise the
stakes]{.underline}** [in the ongoing battle for technological
superiority between the U.S. and China]{.underline}.

How the controls are enforced will be a sweeping test of how far
America\'s historical dominance in high-tech sectors like semiconductors
can extend in dictating the behavior of non-U.S. firms.

\"It\'s an absolute watershed moment because [it\'s the beginning of an
emerging techno-nationalist reality]{.underline},\" says Alex Capri, a
fellow at the National University of Singapore who researches supply
chains.

**[Huawei]{.underline}**\'s rotating chairman, Guo Ping, [acknowledges
the obstacles]{.underline} in the past year of components out of reach.
\"**[Survival]{.underline}** [is the keyword for us now]{.underline},\"
he said at the company\'s annual analyst conference last week.

[According to the]{.underline} **[U.S]{.underline}**. government, [the
company]{.underline} and its affiliates [pose a **national security
threat**]{.underline} [because they could access sensitive information
and hand it over to China\'s government]{.underline}.

\"[We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei]{.underline} and
HiSilicon [and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities
contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy
interests]{.underline},\" Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a
statement.

[Huawei\'s executives say the company follows the law and deny it would
give data to the Chinese government]{.underline}.

**[Huawei\'s way]{.underline}**

A year ago, [Huawei defiantly vowed to overcome a U.S. ban that stopped
it from buying U.S.-made components]{.underline}, though the Trump
administration since gave the company several temporary exemptions.
\"**[Huawei is going to climb this mountain]{.underline}** \... one
thing for sure is [we\'ll make it out alive]{.underline},\" Ren
Zhengfei, the company\'s founder, told Business Insider then.

But [the newest rules will]{.underline} likely **[end Huawei\'s
ambitions]{.underline}** [to become the dominant provider of
next-generation mobile technology]{.underline}, analysts say.

[Huawei]{.underline} has [invested heavily in its own research and
development as]{.underline} **[part of a broader Chinese
effort]{.underline}** [to move away from reliance on foreign
technology]{.underline}. [HiSilicon]{.underline}, a Huawei subsidiary in
Shenzhen, [is now one of the most advanced Chinese chip
designers]{.underline}.

But [even HiSilicon]{.underline} still [uses electronic design
automation software sold by **U.S. firms**]{.underline} Cadence and
Synopsys [to **design** its chips]{.underline}. [HiSilicon]{.underline}
also [relies completely on]{.underline} the [Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing]{.underline} Co. [and Korean chipmakers]{.underline} like
SK Hynix and Samsung [to **manufacture** the actual chips]{.underline}.
[Those chipmakers]{.underline} in turn [rely on American
machines]{.underline} from companies like Lam Research and Applied
Materials.

[China\'s Semiconductor Manufacturing]{.underline} International
[Corp]{.underline}., widely seen as the country\'s most promising
competitor to the Taiwanese company, [uses U.S. machines as
well]{.underline}. [But SMIC\'s manufacturing]{.underline}
[technology]{.underline} [is]{.underline} at least several [years
behind]{.underline} its [Taiwanese competitors]{.underline}, analysts
say, meaning [it could not immediately substitute]{.underline} even
[mid-range]{.underline} chips --- 14- and 16-nanometer chips --- in
Huawei\'s current smartphones.

\"[Even if you buy the talent and the professors]{.underline}, **[you
can\'t buy the equipment]{.underline}**,\" says Brett Simpson, a senior
analyst at Arete Research. \"[You design a chip using U.S. software and
you build a]{.underline} \'fab\' \[or [manufacturing
plant]{.underline}\], **[using U.S. capital]{.underline}**
[equipment]{.underline}. That\'s the bottom line.\"

[Some Chinese tech companies]{.underline} briefly [considered using
**open-source design standards** for]{.underline} future
[processors]{.underline} [and avoid the export controls]{.underline}.
[Chinese tech giant Alibaba]{.underline} even [unveiled a new
**processor**]{.underline} last year using these standards, called
RISC-V, but [industry experts say such efforts cannot easily be
**scaled**.]{.underline}

\"[The U.S. government]{.underline} has [decided to]{.underline} sort of
**[weaponize]{.underline}** this [U.S. technology dominance]{.underline}
in [semiconductor manufacturing]{.underline} and semiconductor design
and across the board,\" says Paul Triolo, a technology policy analyst at
Eurasia Group. He says [that will have **reverberations** around the
world.]{.underline}

Up to [40% of]{.underline} current [European 4G]{.underline} mobile
network infrastructure [is from Huawei]{.underline}, and [much of the 5G
upgrading will go on top of that]{.underline}. That [includes
the]{.underline} [**U**nited **K**ingdom]{.underline}, [where the
government is under pressure to **bar Huawei** from the U.K.\'s
networks]{.underline}. [The new U.S. export controls could cut off
procurement of new parts to service existing]{.underline} 4G [base
stations and]{.underline} thus **[jeopardize]{.underline}** [the
building of future 5G networks in partnership with Huawei.]{.underline}

\"[This new rule will impact the **expansion**, **maintenance**, and
**continuous** operations of networks worth]{.underline} hundreds of
**[billions]{.underline}** of dollars [that we have rolled out
in]{.underline} more than [170 countries]{.underline},\" **[Huawei
said]{.underline}** in a statement after the U.S. controls were
announced.

### China Good\-\--AT: No Internal\-\--2NC

#### Winning the [5G tech race]{.underline} determines [military]{.underline} superiority and [IoT]{.underline} control

**Zhen 19** (Liu Zhen, reporter for the South China Morning Post,

[Apart from its]{.underline} tremendous [commercial
benefits]{.underline}, **[5G]{.underline}** -- the fifth generation of
mobile communication -- [is]{.underline}
**[revolutionizing]{.underline}** [military]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [security]{.underline} [technology]{.underline},
[which is]{.underline} partly [why it has become a]{.underline} **[focal
point]{.underline}** [in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[efforts to]{.underline} **[contain]{.underline}** [China's rise as
a]{.underline} **[tech power]{.underline}** and its allegations against
Chinese companies.

[The]{.underline} future [landscape of]{.underline} warfare and
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** [could be]{.underline} fundamentally
[changed by **5G**]{.underline}. But [experts say 5G is]{.underline}
**[more]{.underline}** [susceptible]{.underline} [to
hacking]{.underline} than previous networks, [at a time of **rising**
security concerns and]{.underline} [US-China]{.underline}
**[tensions]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} various
**[interconnected]{.underline}** [fronts that include]{.underline}
[trade]{.underline}, [influence in the Asia-Pacific]{.underline} region
[and]{.underline} **[technological rivalry]{.underline}**.

[These tensions provide]{.underline} the [backdrop to **controversy**
surrounding **Huawei**]{.underline}, the world's largest telecoms
equipment supplier.

Long before the Chinese company was indicted in the US this week on
multiple charges including stealing trade secrets and violating US
sanctions -- charges it denies -- [US intelligence voiced
concerns]{.underline} that **[Huawei's]{.underline}** telecommunications
**[equipment]{.underline}** [could contain "back doors" for]{.underline}
Chinese **[espionage]{.underline}**.

[Huawei]{.underline} has repeatedly [denied]{.underline} these
[allegations]{.underline}, but the [controversies]{.underline} have
[underlined]{.underline} [**5G's** growing **importance**]{.underline}
[and stepped up the]{.underline} **[technological arms
race]{.underline}** [between China and the US]{.underline}.

To most people, [the **next-gen**eration networks]{.underline}, which
will be at least 20 times faster than the most advanced networks today,
may just mean faster downloads of movies or smoother streaming. But they
[have]{.underline} much bigger [potential]{.underline} than that.

Whereas existing networks connect people to people, [the next generation
will connect]{.underline} a vast network of [sensors]{.underline},
[robots]{.underline} and autonomous [vehicles]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} sophisticated [**a**rtificial
**i**ntelligence]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} so-called [**i**nternet **o**f **t**hings]{.underline}
[will allow objects to]{.underline} "**[communicate]{.underline}**" with
each other [by exchanging]{.underline} vast volumes of
[data]{.underline} in real time, and [without]{.underline} **[human
intervention]{.underline}**.

[Autonomous factories]{.underline}, [long-distance]{.underline}
**[surgery]{.underline}** or robots preparing your breakfast -- things
that previously existed only in science fiction -- [will be made
possible.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, though, [it is being identified]{.underline} by many military
experts [as the]{.underline} **[cornerstone]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} future [military technology]{.underline}.

[Imagine]{.underline} a group of [skirmishers in a jungle]{.underline}.
They are [moving forward]{.underline} speedily [with a **distance** from
one another]{.underline} [of a few hundred meters]{.underline}.
[Each]{.underline} of them [wears a wristwatch that
displays]{.underline} fellow members' [positions]{.underline}. [This is
not satellite positioning]{.underline}, [because]{.underline}
**[reception]{.underline}** in the tropical forest [is]{.underline}
**[unstable]{.underline}**; [it's]{.underline}
**[machine-to-machine]{.underline}** [communication]{.underline}.

Suddenly [one soldier]{.underline}, ambushed by an enemy combatant, is
[shot]{.underline} and loses consciousness. [His]{.underline} smart
wearable [device]{.underline} [**detects his condition** via
sensors]{.underline}, immediately [tightens a belt around his
wound]{.underline}ed thigh, [injects]{.underline} an
[adrenaline]{.underline} shot and [sends an emergency alert to
the]{.underline} field [hospital]{.underline} [as well as
the]{.underline} entire [team]{.underline}.

[Having received the signal]{.underline} on their wristwatches, [the
team switch to a **coordinated** combat formation]{.underline} and
encircle the enemy. [An ambulance]{.underline} helicopter [arrives to
evacuate the]{.underline} [injured]{.underline} [soldier]{.underline}
[while]{.underline} **[auto-driven]{.underline}** [armoured
vehicles]{.underline} come to [reinforce]{.underline} -- [guided by
devices]{.underline} on each soldier [and antenna arrays]{.underline}
nearby.

Or, [imagine a street battle with]{.underline} a group of
**[terrorists]{.underline}** in a city. [There is a]{.underline} power
[blackout]{.underline} [and terrorists hide in an empty]{.underline}
office [building]{.underline}. [A **counterterrorism**]{.underline}
[technician]{.underline} [hacks into the building's audio]{.underline}
control [system]{.underline} [and collects]{.underline} high-sensitivity
[soundwaves]{.underline} [using the microphones on surveillance
cameras]{.underline} -- [the system is]{.underline} still
[running]{.underline} [thanks to]{.underline} the devices' [low power
**consumption** and]{.underline} long **[endurance]{.underline}**.

[After the acoustic data is sent]{.underline} back, artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.underline}**) [analysis determines the
locations]{.underline} [of the **terrorists**]{.underline}. [A drone is
called]{.underline} from nearby, [enters through a window]{.underline}
[and fires a mini-gun]{.underline} at them.

[These are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [movie plots]{.underline},
[but technologies]{.underline} already or about [to be
developed]{.underline}, [as the **i**nternet **o**f
**t**hings]{.underline} [-- built on 5G and AI]{.underline} technologies
-- **[reshapes warfare]{.underline}**.

"The [5G]{.underline} network [and]{.underline} the [**i**nternet **o**f
**t**hings]{.underline} enlarge and [deepen the]{.underline}
**[cognition]{.underline}** [of situations]{.underline} in the
battlefield by several orders of magnitude [and produce]{.underline}
gigantic amounts of [data]{.underline}, **[requiring AI]{.underline}**
[to analyze]{.underline} and even issue [commands]{.underline}," said Dr
Clark Shu, an AI and telecommunication researcher at the University of
Electronic Science and Technology of China.

With [the ability to carry]{.underline} much **[more
data]{.underline}**, much **[lower]{.underline}** [network
latency]{.underline} (network response time) [and energy
consumption]{.underline} and much **[better]{.underline}**
[stability]{.underline} than the previous generation of technologies,
[5G]{.underline} is expected [to **transform** digital
communication]{.underline}.

Using [5G]{.underline}, data can be transmitted at up to 10 gigabytes
per second, much faster than using a 4G network, and the latency is
reduced to under a millisecond, or 1 per cent that of 4G.

Such features [enhance]{.underline} **[connectivity]{.underline}** in
remote locations, [connect]{.underline} sensors and
**[robots]{.underline}**, and will [enable]{.underline}
[vehicles]{.underline}, [traffic]{.underline} control,
[factories]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [construction]{.underline} [to
become]{.underline} more **[autonomous]{.underline}**. In particular,
**[5G]{.underline}** [will enhance]{.underline} [the connectivity of
the]{.underline} internet of things (**[IoT]{.underline}**).

"[**I**nternet **o**f **t**hings]{.underline} [involves]{.underline}
close-range [telecommunications]{.underline} [technology]{.underline}
[to connect]{.underline} and exchange [information]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} two [devices]{.underline}, and [5G]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[fastest]{.underline}** data
transmission [method to realize it]{.underline}," said Zhou Zhaoxiong, a
senior engineer at China Mobile IoT Company, a subsidiary of China
Mobile.

[Military equipment]{.underline} **[embedded]{.underline}** [with
communication devices]{.underline} can also [form the]{.underline}
[**i**nternet **o**f **t**hings]{.underline}, he added. [The
communication can take place from]{.underline} **[device to
device]{.underline}**, without satellites or early-warning planes,
[saving]{.underline} those limited [resources for other
uses]{.underline} and significantly [**lowering the cost** of a military
operation]{.underline}, according to a 2017 report in China Defence
News, a mouthpiece of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).

[China]{.underline} [has been one of the **powerhouses** in]{.underline}
research and development of [5G]{.underline} technologies. [Its telecoms
operators]{.underline} have [said they will begin]{.underline} to
introduce [commercial 5G]{.underline} networks [from 2020]{.underline},
although Zhou said this would involve only regional pilot schemes
because 5G devices are still quite expensive for mass commercial use.

Last week, **[Huawei]{.underline}** [launched a chip]{.underline} that
it claimed to be [the world's most powerful 5G modem]{.underline}.

Then came the US Justice Department's 13-count indictment on Monday
against the Chinese company, its affiliates and its chief financial
officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou, following the arrest of Meng in Canada on
December 1 at the US' request.

But [questions over]{.underline} the [5G]{.underline} technology [made
by Huawei]{.underline} and other Chinese firms [date back]{.underline}
further. In [2012]{.underline}, [the US]{.underline} House Intelligence
Committee released a report [alleging Chinese telecoms]{.underline}
equipment makers [posed a threat to national security]{.underline}
[because of their]{.underline} **[relationship]{.underline}** [with the
Chinese government]{.underline}. China's 2017 National Intelligence Law
asks Chinese companies to cooperate for national intelligence purposes
when necessary.

[The US]{.underline} has **[lobbied]{.underline}** its [allies to
**ban**]{.underline} [Huawei]{.underline} [from]{.underline} building
[their next generation]{.underline} of mobile [phone
networks]{.underline}, [and countries]{.underline} such as
[Britain]{.underline}, [Germany]{.underline}, [Australia]{.underline},
[New Zealand]{.underline} and [Canada]{.underline} have either **[banned
Huawei]{.underline}** or are reviewing whether to do so.

Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei -- Meng's father -- is a former PLA
engineer, which has further fueled questions in the West about Huawei's
ties to the Chinese army and government.

But **[Huawei]{.underline}** executives [have asked]{.underline}
repeatedly, in vain, [for evidence of]{.underline} "**[back
doors]{.underline}**" [in its equipment]{.underline}. [BIS]{.underline},
the German internet security watchdog, [inspected Huawei
labs]{.underline} in Germany **[and found no evidence]{.underline}**,
and [The New York Times]{.underline} last week [quoted American
officials as saying]{.underline} that [the case]{.underline} against the
company [had]{.underline} "**[no smoking gun]{.underline}** -- [just
a]{.underline} heightened [concern about the firm's]{.underline}
**[rising technological dominance]{.underline}**".

[Moves by the US]{.underline} and its allies **[to block
Huawei]{.underline}** [from 5G]{.underline} networks on national
security grounds [were]{.underline} last month [described as
a]{.underline} "[concerted strategy]{.underline}" by Kevin Allison, of
US-headquartered political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, talking to US
broadcaster CNBC.

A report last year to the White House by [the US' National Security
Council]{.underline} [called]{.underline} for action and strategy
[to]{.underline} "**[protect US technology leadership]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} **[prevent]{.underline}** [China
challenging]{.underline} [US dominance in tech]{.underline}.

Song Zhongping, a Hong Kong-based military commentator, said [China has
commissioned research institutions]{.underline} and state-owned
companies, not Huawei, [for]{.underline} its **[military 5G
development]{.underline}**.

"For example, [branches of the **C**hina]{.underline}
[**E**lectronics]{.underline} [**T**echnology **G**roup
**C**orporation]{.underline}, [which makes military radars]{.underline}
and other electronic systems, [are]{.underline}
**[focused]{.underline}** [in this area]{.underline}," said Song.

[The US]{.underline}, too, [has been investing in **military use** of
5G]{.underline}, while [prototype 5G]{.underline} networks [for civilian
use]{.underline} [have been launched]{.underline} in some cities.

In a recent interview with military technologies publication C4ISRNET,
Brent Upson, a director at American aerospace and security company
[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}, [predicted]{.underline}
[machine-to-machine communication]{.underline}, using information from
several sources to form a unified picture of battlespaces, [and
AI-assisted decision-making]{.underline} would be among the trends in
2019.

Todd Wieser, chief technology officer of the US Air Force's Special
Operations Command, has said [5G tech will enhance]{.underline} his
forces' [mobile]{.underline} [communications]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[geospatial]{.underline}**
**[functionality]{.underline}**.

But [commercial 5G]{.underline} networks are [regarded by
the]{.underline} [US]{.underline} government [as]{.underline} [**easy
prey** for foreign intelligence]{.underline} agents and
[hackers]{.underline}, and such [concerns]{.underline} [are heightened
where a]{.underline} **[military network]{.underline}** [is subject
to]{.underline} **[hacking]{.underline}** and intrusion attempts [by
adversaries]{.underline}.

"[The biggest]{.underline} **[disadvantage]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} a [5G]{.underline} network [in the
battlefield]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the vulnerability to
[electromagnetic interference]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline}
**[hacking]{.underline}** and intrusion," said Shu.

"[The]{.underline} significant [increase in]{.underline} sensors and
[data]{.underline} nodes [means an increase of exposure]{.underline},
[and an **increased risk** of being]{.underline}
**[attacked]{.underline}**."

## Turn\-\--5G Bad

### Turn\-\--1NC

Cybersecurity Fellow. "What Will 5G Mean for the Environment?" 01/30/20

☺

Beginning 2020, the fifth generation of wireless technology is expected
to be widely implemented throughout the world. The new network, called
5G, promises to give faster speeds and a higher capacity for the use of
more devices. However, while companies from countries such as [the
United States and China are competing to be the first to deliver 5G to
the consumer, the environmental impacts of the new network are being
overlooked. In a time when the environment is at its most delicate,
overlooking these impacts is **extremely risky for future
generations**.]{.underline}

The main environmental issues associated with the implementation of the
5G network come with the [manufacturing of the many component parts of
the 5G infrastructure.]{.underline} In addition, the proliferation of
new devices that will use the 5G network that is tied to the
[acceleration of demand from consumers for new 5G-dependent devices will
have serious environmental consequences.]{.underline}

[The 5G network will inevitably cause a large **increase in energy
usage** among consumers, which is already one of the **main contributors
to climate change**]{.underline}. Additionally, the [manufacturing and
maintenance of]{.underline} the new technologies associated [with 5G
creates waste and uses important resources that have detrimental
consequences for the environment]{.underline}. 5G networks use
technology that has [harmful effects on birds, which in turn has
cascading effects through entire ecosystems.]{.underline} And, while 5G
developers are seeking to create a network that has fewer environmental
impacts than past networks, there is still room for improvement and the
consequences of 5G should be considered before it is widely rolled out.

What is 5G?

5G stands for the fifth generation of wireless technology. It is the
wave of wireless technology surpassing the 4G network that is used now.
Previous generations brought the first cell phones (1G), text messaging
(2G), online capabilities (3G), and faster speed
(4G).[\[1\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn1) The
fifth generation aims to increase the speed of data movement, be more
responsive, and allow for greater connectivity of devices
simultaneously.[\[2\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn2) This
means that 5G will allow for nearly instantaneous downloading of data
that, with the current network, would take hours. For example,
downloading a movie using 5G would take mere seconds. These new
improvements will allow for self-driving cars, massive expansion of
Internet of Things (IoT) device use, and acceleration of new
technological advancements used in everyday activities by a much wider
range of people.

While 5G is not fully developed, it is expected to consist of at least
five new technologies that allow it to perform much more complicated
tasks at faster speeds. The new technologies 5G will use are hardware
that works with much higher frequencies (millimeter wavelengths), small
cells, massive MIMO (multiple input multiple output), beamforming, and
full
duplex.[\[3\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn3) Working
together, these new technologies will expand the potential of many of
the devices used today and devices being developed for the future.

Millimeter waves are a higher frequency wavelength than the radio
wavelength generally used in wireless transmission
today.[\[4\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn4) The
use of this portion of the spectrum corresponds to higher frequency and
shorter wavelengths, in this case in the millimeter range (vs the
lower radio frequencies where the wavelengths can be in the meters to
hundreds of kilometers). Higher frequency waves allow for more devices
to be connected to the same network at the same time, because there is
more space available compared to the radio waves that are used today.
The use of this portion of the spectrum has much longer wavelengths than
of that anticipated for a portion of the 5G implementation. The waves in
use now can measure up to tens of centimeters, while the new 5G waves
would be no greater than ten
millimeters.[\[5\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn5) The
millimeter waves will create more transmission space for the
ever-expanding number of people and devices crowding the current
networks. The millimeter waves will create more space for devices to be
used by consumers, which will increase energy usage, subsequently
leading to increased global warming.

Millimeter waves are very weak in their ability to connect two devices,
which is why 5G needs something called "small cells" to give full,
uninterrupted coverage. Small cells are essentially miniature cell
towers that would be placed 250 meters apart throughout cities and other
areas needing
coverage.[\[6\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn6) The
small cells are necessary as emissions \[or signals\] at this higher
frequency/shorter wavelength have more difficulty passing through solid
objects and are even easily intercepted by
rain.[\[7\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn7) The
small cells could be placed on anything from trees to street lights to
the sides of businesses and homes to maximize connection and limit "dead
zones" (areas where connections are
lost).[\[8\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn8)

The next new piece of technology necessary for 5G is massive MIMO, which
stands for multiple input multiple output. The MIMO describes the
capacity of 5G's base stations, because those base stations would be
able to handle a much higher amount of data at any one moment of time.
Currently, 4G base stations have around eight transmitters and four
receivers which direct the flow of data between
devices.[\[9\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn9) 5G
will exceed this capacity with the use of massive MIMO that can handle
22 times more
ports.[\[10\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn10) Figure
1 shows how a massive MIMO tower would be able to direct a higher number
of connections at once. However, massive MIMO causes signals to be
crossed more easily.  Crossed signals cause an interruption in the
transmission of data from one device to the next due to a clashing of
the wavelengths as they travel to their respective destinations. To
overcome the cross signals problem, beamforming is needed.

To maximize the efficiency of sending data another new technology called
beamforming will be used in 5G. For data to be sent to the correct user,
a way of directing the wavelengths without interference is necessary.
This is done through a technique called beamforming. Beamforming directs
where exactly data are being sent by using a variety of antennas to
organize signals based on certain characteristics, such as the magnitude
of the
signal.[\[12\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn12) By
directly sending signals to where they need to go, beamforming decreases
the chances that a signal is dropped due to the interference of a
physical object.

One way that 5G will follow through on its promise of faster data
transmission is through sending and receiving data
simultaneously.[\[13\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn13) The
method that allows for simultaneous input and output of data is called
full duplexing. While full duplex capabilities allow for faster
transmission of data, there is an issue of signal interference, because
of
echoes.[\[14\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn14) Full
duplexing will cut transmission times in half, because it allows for a
response to occur as soon as an input is delivered, eliminating the
turnaround time that is seen in transmission today.

Because these technologies are new and untested, it is hard to say how
they will impact our environment. This raises another issue: there are
impacts that can be anticipated and predicted, but there are also
unanticipated impacts because much of the new technologies are untested.
Nevertheless, it is possible to anticipate some of detrimental
environmental consequences of the new technologies and the 5G network,
because we know these technologies will increase exposure to harmful
radiation, increase mining of rare minerals, increase waste, and
increase energy usage. The main 5G environmental concerns have to do
with two of the five new components: the millimeter waves and the small
cells.

Increased Energy Usage of the 5G Network

The whole aim of the new 5G network is to allow for more devices to be
used by the consumer at faster rates than ever before, because of this
goal there will certainly be an increase in energy usage globally[.
Energy usage is one of the main contributors to climate change today and
an increase in energy usage would cause climate change to increase
drastically as well.]{.underline} 5G will operate on a higher frequency
portion of the spectrum to open new space for more devices. The smaller
size of the millimeter waves compared to radio frequency waves allows
for more data to be shared more quickly and creates a wide bandwidth
that can support much larger
tasks.[\[15\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn15) While
the idea of more space for devices to be used is great for consumers,
this will lead to a spike in energy usage for two reasons -- the
[technology itself is energy demanding and will increase demand for more
electronic devices]{.underline}. The [ability for more devices to be
used on the same network creates more incentive for consumers to buy
electronics and use them more often]{.underline}. This will have a
harmful impact on the environment through increased energy use.

Climate change has several underlying contributors; however, energy
usage is gaining attention in its severity with regards to perpetuating
climate change. Before 5G has even been released, about [2% of the
world's greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to the ICT
industry]{.underline}.[\[16\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn16) While
2% may not seem like a very large portion, it translates to around
**[860 million tons of greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}**.[\[17\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn17) Greenhouse
gas emissions are the main contributors to [natural disasters, such as
flooding and drought,]{.underline} which are increasing severity and
occurrence every year. Currently, roughly 85% of the energy used in the
United States can be attributed to fossil fuel
consumption.[\[18\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn18) The
dwindling availability of fossil fuels and the environmental burden of
releasing these fossil fuels into our atmosphere signal an immediate
need to shift to other energy sources. [Without a shift to other forms
of energy production and the addition of technology allowed by the
implementation of 5G, the strain on our environment will rise and the
**damage may never be repaired**]{.underline}. With an increase in
energy usage through technology and the implementation of 5G, it can be
expected that the climate change issues faced today will only increase.

The overall contribution of carbon dioxide emissions from the ICT
industry has a huge impact on climate change and will continue to have
even larger impacts without proper actions. In a European Union report,
researchers estimated that in order to keep the increase in global
temperature below 2° Celsius a decrease in carbon emissions of around
15-30% is necessary by
2020.[\[19\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn19)

[Engineers claim that the small cells used to provide the 5G connection
will be energy efficient and powered in a sustainable way; however the
maintenance and production of these cells is more of an
issue]{.underline}. Supporters of the 5G network advocate that the small
cells will use solar or wind energy to stay sustainable and
green.[\[20\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn20) These
devices, labeled "fuel-cell energy servers" will work as clean
energy-based generators for the small
cells.[\[21\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn21) [While
implementing base stations that use sustainable energy to function would
be a step in the right direction in environmental conservation, it is
not the solution to the main issue caused by 5G, which is the impact
that the massive amount of new devices in the hands of consumers will
have on the amount of energy required to power these
devices.]{.underline}

Consumption Increases and 5G Technologies

The wasteful nature of manufacturing and maintenance of both individual
devices and the devices used to deliver 5G connection could become a
major contributor of climate change. The promise of 5G technology is to
expand the number of devices functioning might be the most troubling
aspect of the new technology. Cell phones, computers, and other everyday
devices are manufactured in a way that puts stress on the environment. A
report by the EPA estimated that in 2010, 25% of the world's greenhouse
gas emissions comes from electricity and heat production making it the
largest single source of
emissions.[\[22\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn22) The
main gas emitted by this sector is carbon dioxide, due to the burning of
natural gas, such as coal, to fuel electricity
sources.[\[23\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn23) Carbon
dioxide is one of the most common greenhouse gases seen in our
atmosphere, it traps heat in earth's atmosphere trying to escape into
space, which causes the atmosphere to warm generating climate
change.[\[24\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn24)

Increased consumption of devices is taking a toll on the
environment.[\[25\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn25) As
consumers gain access to more technologies the cycle of consumption only
expands. As new devices are developed, the older devices are thrown out
even if they are still functional. Often, big companies will
purposefully change their products in ways that make certain partner
devices (such as chargers or earphones) unusable--creating demand for
new products. Economic incentives mean that companies will continue
these practices in spite of the environmental impacts.

One of the [main issues with the 5G network and the resulting increase
in consumption of technological devices is that **the production
required for these devices is not sustainable**.]{.underline} In the
case of making new devices, whether they be new smart-phones or the
small cells needed for 5G, the [use of nonrenewable metals is
required]{.underline}. It is extremely difficult to use metals for
manufacturing sustainably, because metals are not a renewable
resource.[\[26\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn26) Metals
used in the manufacturing of the smart devices frequently used today
often cannot be recycled in the same way many household items can be
recycled. Because these technologies cannot be recycled, they [create
tons of waste]{.underline} when they are created and tons of waste when
they are thrown away.

There are around six billion mobile devices in use today, with this
number expected to increase drastically as the global population
increases and new devices enter the
market.[\[27\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn27) One
estimate of the life-time carbon emissions of a single device--not
including related accessories and network connection--is that a device
produces a total of 45kg of carbon dioxide at a medium level of usage
over three years. This amount of emission is comparable to that of
driving the average European car for
300km.[\[28\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn28)

But, the most environmentally taxing stage of a mobile device life cycle
is [during the production stage,]{.underline} where around [68% of total
carbon emissions is produced, equating to 30kg of carbon
dioxide]{.underline}.[\[29\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn29) To
put this into perspective, an iPhone X weighs approximately 0.174kg, so
in order to produce the actual device, 172 iPhone X's worth of carbon
dioxide is also created. These emissions vary from person to person and
between different devices, but it's possible to estimate the impact one
device has on the environment. 5G grants the capacity for more devices
to be used, significantly increase the existing carbon footprint of
smart devices today.

Energy usage for the ever-growing number of devices on the market and in
homes is another environmental threat that would be greatly increased by
the new capabilities brought by the 5G network. Often, energy forecasts
overlook the amount of energy that will be consumed by new technologies,
which leads to a skewed understanding of the actual amount of energy
expected to be
used.[\[30\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn30) One
example of this is with IoT
devices.[\[31\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn31) IoT
is one of the main aspects of 5G people in the technology field are most
excited about. [5G will allow for a larger expansion of IoT into the
everyday
household.]{.underline}[[\[32\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn32) While
some IoT devices promise lower energy usage abilities, the 50 billion
new IoT devices expected to be produced and used by consumers will
surpass the energy used by today's electronics]{.underline}.

The small cells required for the 5G network to properly function causes
another issue of waste with the new network. Because of the weak nature
of the millimeter waves used in the 5G technology, [small cells will
need to be placed around 250 meters apart to insure continuous
connection]{.underline}.[\[33\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn33) The
main issue with these small cells is that the manufacturing and
maintenance of these cells [will create a lot of wast]{.underline}e. The
manufacturing of technology [takes a large toll on the
environment,]{.underline} due to the consumption of non-renewable
resources to produce devices, and technology ending up in landfills.
Implementing these small cells into large cities where they must be
placed at such a high density will have a drastic impact on technology
waste.

Technology is constantly changing and improving, which is one of the
huge reasons it has such high economic value.  But, when a technological
advancement in small cells happens, the current small cells would have
to be replaced. The short lifespan of devices created today makes waste
predictable and inevitable[. In New York City, where there would have to
be at least 3,135,200 small cells, the **waste created in just one
city** when a new advancement in small cells is implemented **would have
overwhelming consequences on the environment**.]{.underline} 5G is just
one of many examples of how important it is to look at the consequences
of new advancements before their implementation. While it is exciting to
see new technology that promises to improve everyday life, the
consequences of additional waste and energy usage must be considered to
preserve a sustainable environment in the future.

The Impact of 5G on Ecosystems

There is some evidence that the new devices and technologies associated
with [5G will be harmful to delicate ecosystems]{.underline}. The main
component of the 5G network that will affect the earth's ecosystems is
the millimeter waves. The millimeter waves that are being used in
developing the 5G network have never been used at such scale before.
This makes it especially difficult to know how they will impact the
environment and certain ecosystems. However, studies have found that
there are some harms caused by these new technologies.

The millimeter waves, specifically, have been linked to many
[disturbances in the ecosystems of birds]{.underline}. In a study by the
Centre for Environment and Vocational Studies of Punjab University,
researchers observed that after exposure to radiation from a cell tower
for just 5-30 minutes, [the eggs of sparrows were
disfigured]{.underline}.[\[34\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn34) The
disfiguration of birds exposed for such a short amount of time to these
frequencies is significant considering that the new 5G network will have
a much higher density of base stations (small cells) throughout areas
needing connection. The potential dangers of having so many small cells
all over areas where birds live could cause whole populations of birds
to have mutations that threaten their population's survival.
Additionally, a study done in Spain [showed breeding, nesting, and
roosting was negatively affected]{.underline} by microwave radiation
emitted by a cell
tower.[\[35\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn35) Again,
the issue of the increase in the amount of connection conductors in the
form of small cells to provide connection with the 5G network is seen to
be harmful to species that live around humans.

Additionally, Warnke found that cellular devices had a [detrimental
impact on
bees]{.underline}.[\[36\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn36) In
this study, [beehives exposed for just ten minutes to 900MHz waves fell
victim to colony collapse
disorder]{.underline}.[\[37\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn37) Colony
collapse disorder is when many of the bees living in the hive abandon
the hive leaving the queen, the eggs, and a few worker bees. The worker
bees exposed to this radiation also had worsened navigational skills,
causing them to stop returning to their original hive after about ten
days.[\[38\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn38) [Bees
are an incredibly important part of the earth's ecosystem]{.underline}.
Around one-third of the food produced today is dependent on bees for
pollination, making bees are a vital part of the agricultural
system.[\[39\]](https://jsis.washington.edu/news/what-will-5g-mean-for-the-environment/#_ftn39) Bees
not only provide pollination for the plant-based food we eat, but they
are also important to maintaining the food livestock eats. [**Without
bees, a vast majority of the food eaten today would be lost** or at the
very least highly limited]{.underline}. Climate change has already
caused a large decline in the world's bee population.

The impact that the cell towers have on birds and bees is important to
understand, [because all ecosystems of the earth are interconnected. If
one component of an ecosystem is disrupted the whole system will be
affected.]{.underline} The disturbances of birds with the cell towers of
today would only increase, because with 5G a larger number of small cell
radio-tower-like devices would be necessary to ensure high quality
connection for users. Having a larger number of high concentrations of
these millimeter waves in the form of small cells would cause a wider
exposure to bees and birds, and possibly other species that are equally
important to our environment.

### Turn\-\--Environment\-\--2NC

#### 5G TKOs nature\-\--energy consumption and radiation alone kill ecosystems.

**Nash '21** (Axel Nash, senior Mobiletrans website editor, previously
worked as a managing editor at Android headlines and as an executive
editor of UBM Americas, 2/24/21, "5G is Dangerous to Human Beings and
Environment: Why and How?"
<https://mobiletrans.wondershare.com/5g/5g-dangerous.html>) ☺

The development of the fifth-generation wireless network has promised
faster speed and vast capacity for various devices. However, the effects
of this wireless network on the environment are overlooked. [Since the
environment is more delicate, overlooking it might cause adverse effects
in the ecosystem for future generations.]{.underline} Many allegations
are coming the 5G way, [stating the technology is causing health and
environmental risks, slowly **contributing to the ecosystem\'s killing**
due to the high-frequency characteristic of the 5g network.]{.underline}

Biologists and environmental scientists are still studying the
environmental impact of the 5G network. However, even with the several
controversies, theories, and hoaxes, it is unclear what long-term impact
5G can cause to the environment. The environmental concerns revolve
around the effects that the 5G\'s higher frequencies can cause on
humans, animals, diverse plants, and how energy is consumed.

While the dangers of the 5G network on the environment are overlooked
even with the international organizations, there still could be adverse
effects that may take a while to realize. This means the future
generations are likely to suffer consequences linked to the new
technology.

If you wonder whether 5G is harmful to the environment, the short answer
is that [5G is not suitable for the ecosystem]{.underline}. We
understand that 5G emits high-frequency waves that range between 30GHz
and300GHz. It means that there must be [antennas with proximity, which
means **more radiation**.]{.underline} Therefore, the cellular network
[will require more energy]{.underline}. Since much of the [energy comes
from fossil fuels and natural gas, **high energy demand will lead to
more gas and oil demand**, leading to environmental issues]{.underline}.
There is a need to look at the bigger picture before ignoring the future
consequences of this fast-growing 5G wireless network.

[When looking into the effects of the 5G wireless network on plants\'
health, the millimeter waves are particularly suspected to be absorbed
by the rain and plants. The process could leave the food not safe to
consume. The irradiated water from rain could ruin the ecosystem. Even
the seedlings exposed to radio frequencies are likely to suffer
hazardous symptoms, which will cause unknown long-term impacts to the
environment and animals.]{.underline}

On the other hand, the 5G [technology could lead to weather satellite
interference. The frequency bands used in the weather forecast systems
to detect the atmospheric water levels are similar to the bands used by
5G wireless technology. Therefore, in**terfering with these weather
satellite frequencies** could lead to adverse effects and **degrade the
weather forecasting.** Interference on the weather satellite could
**lead to large-scale weather events that** could **lead to harmful
climate and environmental risks** in the future]{.underline}. If there
are chances of interfering with the weather satellite, questions will
arise concerning some parametric insurance policies\' accuracy.

It is clear the climate change has many underlying contributors, but a
few are gaining attention to its severity in causing adverse effects.
Before 5G was introduced, the statistics indicated that the ICT industry
contributed about 2% of the greenhouse gas emission. The 2% contributor
may not seem like a significant portion, but it translates to enormous
tons of greenhouse gas emitted. Now that many companies are looking to
integrate the 5G network to develop AI systems and communication
devices, the chances of contributing to climate change in a higher
percentage are increasing. We already understand that the greenhouse gas
emission could lead to adverse natural disasters such as droughts and
floods, which might increase the severity over the years.

As many people and companies take advantage of the fast-growing 5G
technology, new devices are manufactured, leading to high chances of
abandoning the old devices. This means a lot of e-waste is likely to
stick around, especially the non-renewables. Discarding the old 5G
non-compatible devices means that we invite a vast environmental problem
if proper plans are not implemented yet.

Further impacts are likely to be experienced regarding the advancement
of the 5G network across many countries[. The full deployment of 5G
means building towers almost everywhere, including on the mountains,
forests, and so on, to ensure a robust connection is established. The
process could lead to increased radiation to the delicate contributors
to the safety of the ecosystem.]{.underline}

#### Wider implementation kills insects and birds and guarantees global warming.

More energy consumption and emissions

Currently, [information and communications technology is responsible for
about 4 percent of global electricity consumption, and 1.4 percent of
global carbon emissions.]{.underline} But an Ericcson report projects
that [by the end of 2025]{.underline}, 5G will have 2.6 billion
subscribers; total global mobile subscriptions are expected to reach 5.8
billion by then. By 2030, IoT devices around the world could number 125
billion. At that point, [**information technology** is expected to be
responsible for one-fifth of all global electricity consumption and by
2040, it could **generate 14 percent of** worldwide greenhouse gas
**emissions**]{.underline}. If the entire system is not energy
efficient, 5G will ultimately not be sustainable.

[Data storage centers that handle cloud computing and websites, and
store our information use]{.underline} enormous amounts of energy---as
much as [80 percent of total network energy use]{.underline}. About half
of this goes towards keeping transmission equipment in base stations
cool. A Berkeley Lab report found that U.S. data centers consumed 70
billion kWh in 2014; this year they are projected to consume 73 billion
kWh. [**Small cell base stations** may **devour three times as much
power as 4G** base stations.]{.underline}

Life cycle impacts

In 2019, the president of The Shift Project, a French think tank
advocating the shift to a post-carbon economy, said[, "...behind each
byte we have mining and metal processing, oil extraction and
petrochemicals, manufacturing and intermediate transports, public works
(to bury the cables) and power generation with coal and gas. As a
result, the carbon footprint of the global digital system is already
four percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions, and its energy
consumption rises by nine percent per year."]{.underline}

The increase in greenhouse gas emissions will be due in part to the fact
that [consumers will need to buy new 5G mobile phones in order to take
full advantage of 5G]{.underline}. A Swedish study calculated that a
smart phone produced 45 kg of CO2 during its entire lifetime, with most
of it coming from the production phase---the manufacture of integrated
circuits, sourcing the raw material, production of the phone shell, then
assembly and distribution. If accessories and the mobile network are
included, the total life cycle impact is 68 kg CO2.

The **[manufacture of more IoT devices]{.underline}** and **[cell
phones, and small cells]{.underline}** also [**means more mining and**
use of many **nonrenewable metals** that are difficult to
recycle.]{.underline}

As consumers around the world move to 5G phones, [many older **phones
and IoT devices will be discarded** if there are no buy back or
recycling plans for them]{.underline}. This will result in [enormous
amounts of e-waste, which is already a huge global problem]{.underline}.

The full deployment of 5G could have a disruptive impact on ecosystems.
A [Punjab University study found that **sparrows exposed to cell tower
radiation** for five to 30 minutes **produced disfigured
eggs**]{.underline}. In Spain, the [**nesting, breeding and roosting of
birds were disturbed by** microwave radiation from a **cell
tower**.]{.underline} [Wireless frequencies have also been found to
interfere with the navigational systems and circadian rhythms of birds,
affecting migration.]{.underline}

Another study found that [**bees** exposed to low-band spectrum
radiation for 10 minutes **suffered colony collapse
disorder**]{.underline}. And some research has found that [insects,
including honeybees, absorb more radiation from the mid-band and 5G
spectrum]{.underline}. This could lead to changes in insect behavior and
functions over time.

### Turn\-\--AT: Hacks\-\--2NC

#### Peer reviewed, science-based facts show that 5G is a human carcinogen and also affects plants and animals -- prefer ev from authors who *[aren't]{.underline}* pawns of the Telecom industry.

Most politicians and other decision-makers using guidelines for exposure
to radiofrequency (RF) radiation seem to ignore the risks to human
health and the environment. [The fact that the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) at the World Health Organization (WHO) in May
2011 classified RF radiation in the frequency range of 30 kHz to 300 GHz
to be a 'possible' human carcinogen, Group 2B
([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b1-ol-0-0-11876),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b2-ol-0-0-11876)),
is being ignored.]{.underline} This has been recently exemplified in a
hearing at the Tallinn Parliament in Estonia
([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b3-ol-0-0-11876)).

An important factor may be the [**influence on politicians by
individuals and organizations with** inborn **conflicts of interests**
(COIs)]{.underline} and their own agenda in supporting the no-risk
paradigm
([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b4-ol-0-0-11876),[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b5-ol-0-0-11876)).
The [International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection
(**ICNIRP) has repeatedly ignored scientific evidence** on adverse
effects of RF radiation to humans and the environment.]{.underline}
Their guidelines for exposure are based solely on the thermal (heating)
paradigm and were first published in ICNIRP 1998
([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b6-ol-0-0-11876)),
updated in ICNIRP 2009
([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b7-ol-0-0-11876))
and have now been newly published in ICNIRP 2020
([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b8-ol-0-0-11876)),
with no change of concept, only relying on thermal effects from RF
radiation on humans. The large amount of peer-reviewed science on
non-thermal effects has been ignored in all ICNIRP evaluations
([9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b9-ol-0-0-11876),[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b10-ol-0-0-11876)).
Additionally, ICNIRP has successfully maintained their obsolete
guidelines worldwide.

COIs can be detrimental, and it is necessary to be as unbiased as
possible when assessing health risks. There are three points that should
be emphasized. Firstly, the evidence regarding health risks from
environmental factors may not be unambiguous, and therefore informed
judgements must be made. Furthermore, there are gaps in knowledge that
call for experienced evaluations, and no conclusion can be reached
without value judgements. Secondly, paradigms are defended against the
evidence and against external assessments by social networks in the
scientific community. Thirdly, the stronger the impact of decisions
about health risks on economic, military and political interests, the
stronger will stakeholders try to influence these decision processes.

Since the IARC evaluation in 2011
([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b1-ol-0-0-11876),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b2-ol-0-0-11876)),

[The deployment of]{.underline} the fifth generation,
**[5G]{.underline}**, of RF [**radiation is a major concern** in
numerous countries, with groups of citizens trying to implement a
moratorium until thorough research on adverse effects on human health
and the environment has been performed]{.underline}. An [**appeal for a

**scientists and** medical **doctors**, was sent to the]{.underline}
European Union ([EU]{.underline}) in September 2017
([18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b18-ol-0-0-11876)),
currently with no EU response
([19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b19-ol-0-0-11876)).
Several regions have implemented a moratorium on the deployment of 5G
motivated by the lack of studies on health effects, for instance Geneva
([20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b20-ol-0-0-11876)).

In the present article, the current situation in Switzerland is
discussed as an example
([21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b21-ol-0-0-11876)).
Additionally, the ICNIRP 2020 evaluation is discussed
([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b8-ol-0-0-11876)).

Evaluation of health risks in Switzerland

Several Swiss citizens have brought to our attention that Associate
Professor Martin Röösli is the chair of two important government expert
groups in Switzerland (directeur), despite possible COIs and a history
of misrepresentation of science
([22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b22-ol-0-0-11876),[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b23-ol-0-0-11876)).
These groups are Beratende Expertengruppe NIS (BERENIS; the Swiss
advisory expert group on electromagnetic fields and non-ionizing
radiation)
([24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b24-ol-0-0-11876)),
and the subgroup 3, the Mobile Communications and Radiation Working
Group of the Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and
Communications/Eidgenössisches Departement für Umwelt, Verkehr, Energie
und Kommunikation, evaluating RF-radiation health risks from 5G
technology
([25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b25-ol-0-0-11876),[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b26-ol-0-0-11876)).

The conclusions made in the recent Swiss government 5G report are biased
and can be found here
([27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b27-ol-0-0-11876),[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b28-ol-0-0-11876)).
This 5G report concluded that there is an absence of short-term health
impacts and an absence or insufficient evidence of long-term effects
\[see Table 17 (Tableau 17) on page 69 in the French version
([27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b27-ol-0-0-11876))
and Table 17 (Tabelle 17) on page 67 in the German version
([28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b28-ol-0-0-11876))\].

Furthermore, it was reported that there is limited evidence for glioma,
neurilemmoma (schwannoma) and co-carcinogenic effects, and insufficient
evidence for effects on children from prenatal exposure or from their
own mobile phone use. Regarding cognitive effects, fetal development and
fertility (sperm quality), the judgement was that the evidence on
harmful effects is insufficient. These evaluations were strikingly
similar to those of the ICNIRP (see Appendix B in ICNIRP 2020; 8). Other
important endpoints, such as effects on blood-brain barrier, cell
proliferation, apoptosis (programmed cell death), oxidative stress
(reactive oxygen species) and gene and protein expression, were not
evaluated.

According to Le Courrier November 19, 2019, Martin Röösli presented the
conclusion in an interview in the following way: 'Sur l\'aspect
sanitaire pur, «le groupe de travail constate que, jusqu\'à présent,
aucun effet sanitaire n\'a été prouvé de manière cohérente en dessous
des valeurs limites d\'immissions fixées», résume Martin Röösli,
professeur d\'épidémiologie environnementale à l\'Institut tropical et
de santé publique suisse'
([29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b29-ol-0-0-11876)).
\[Regarding the health issue, the working group concludes that, until
now, no health effect has been consistently proven below the given
exposure limits, summarizes Martin Röösli, professor in environmental
epidemiology at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute\].

This Swiss evaluation is scientifically inaccurate and is in opposition
to the opinion of numerous scientists in this field
([18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b18-ol-0-0-11876)).
In addition, 252 electromagnetic field (EMF) scientists from 43
countries, all with published peer-reviewed research on the biologic and
health effects of nonionizing electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) have
stated that:

'Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that
[RF-EMF]{.underline} affects living organisms at levels well below most
international and national guidelines. [Effects include increased cancer
risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic
damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system,
learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative
impacts on general well-being in humans.]{.underline} Damage goes well
beyond the human race, as [there is]{.underline} growing [evidence of
**harmful** effects **to** both **plant and animal life'**
([30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7405337/#b30-ol-0-0-11876)).]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Warming\-\--2NC

#### Curan says 5G causes warming from energy use and waste\-\--extinction.

**Krosofsky '21** (Andrew Krosofsky, journalist at GreenMatters. "How
Global Warming May Eventually Lead to Global Extinction" 03/11/21
<https://www.greenmatters.com/p/will-global-warming-cause-extinction>) ☺

Life on this planet has gone through many [extinction-level
events]{.underline} over time. Most of these phenomena [were caused by
natural, cataclysmic]{.underline} forces beyond the control of any of
the lifeforms existing at that time. The [current cataclysmic forces are
anything but natural]{.underline} and they are well within our control.
The [**question is not, \"[will global warming cause
extinction](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/endangered-vs-extinct-species)?\"---
it's, \"how can we prevent that inevitability** from
happening**?**]{.underline}

Will global warming cause extinction?

Eventually, yes. [Global warming will invariably result in the **mass
extinction** of millions of different species, **humankind
included.**]{.underline} In fact, [the Center for Biological
Diversity](https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/global_warming_and_life_on_earth/index.html) says
that global [warming is currently the greatest threat to life on this
planet.]{.underline} Global warming causes a number of detrimental
effects on the environment that many species won't be able to handle
long-term. 

[Extreme weather patterns are shifting climates]{.underline} across the
globe, eliminating habitats and altering the landscape. As a result,
[food and fresh water sources]{.underline} are being drastically
[reduced]{.underline}. Then, of course, there are [the rising global
temperatures]{.underline} themselves, which many [species are physically
unable to contend]{.underline} with. Formerly [frozen [arctic and
antarctic regions are
melting](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/arctic-ice-melting),
increasing [sea
levels](https://www.greenmatters.com/news/2019/01/15/bPhgWvMpZ/oceans-warming-climate-change) and
temperatures.]{.underline} Eventually, [these effects will create a
**perfect storm of extinction conditions. **]{.underline}

What species will go extinct if global warming continues?

The melting glaciers of the arctic and the searing, unmanageable heat
indexes being seen along the Equator are just the tip of the iceberg, so
to speak. The species that live in these [climate
zones](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-is-a-climate-zone) have
already been affected by the changes caused by global warming. Take
polar bears for example, whose habitats and food sources have been so
greatly diminished that they have been forced to range further and
further south. 

Increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and oceans have
already led to [ocean
acidification](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/what-causes-ocean-acidification#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Natural%20History,for%20some%20species%20to%20survive.).
This has caused many species of crustaceans to either adapt or perish
and has led to the mass bleaching of more than 50 percent of
Australia's [Great Barrier
Reef](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/coral-great-barrier-reef),
according to [National
Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/article/explore-atlas-great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching-map-climate-change).

According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the current trajectory
of global warming predicts that [more than 30 percent of Earth's plant
and animal species will face extinction by 2050. By the end of the
century, that number could be as high as 70 percent. ]{.underline}

Will global warming cause humanity's extinction?

We won't try and sugarcoat things, [humanity's own prospects aren't
looking that great either]{.underline}. According to [The
Conversation](https://theconversation.com/will-climate-change-cause-humans-to-go-extinct-117691),
[our species has just **under a decade** left **to get** our **CO₂
emissions under control**.]{.underline} [If we don't cut those emissions
by half before 2030, [temperatures will
rise](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/global-temperature-rise-predictions) to]{.underline}
potentially [catastrophic levels]{.underline}. It may only seem like a
degree or so, but the worldwide ramifications are immense. 

The human species is resilient. We will survive for a while longer, even
if these grim global warming predictions come to pass, but it will mean
less food, less water, and increased hardship across the world ---
especially in low-income areas and developing countries. This increase
will also mean
more [pandemics](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/climate-crisis-leads-to-pandemics),
devastating storms, and uncontrollable wildfires. 

It's difficult to calculate the numbers in these cases or to assess
precisely what risks we will all be facing, but this is because we have
never experienced anything like it before. 

How do we stave off extinction?

[We keep]{.underline} species [extinction at bay by continuing to
fix]{.underline} the environmental [mistakes we\'ve already
made.]{.underline} The [Paris
Agreement](https://www.greenmatters.com/p/paris-agreement) set the stage
for global unity in the face of environmental annihilation, but it has
not done enough. [More work and cooperation are required to meet the
2030 goal]{.underline}. [If more countries switch to renewable sources
of power]{.underline}, if more people choose to eat less meat, **[create
less waste, use less energy]{.underline}**, and expand conservation
efforts, [we may have a chance of deferring this grim fate.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Bees\-\--2NC

#### 5G kills the remaining bees\-\--extinction. 

**Pollard '20** (Elma Pollard, editor of the Green Times, a social
enterprise focused on climate change and other environmental news. "Does
**[5G mean]{.underline}** the **[final knockout for the
bees]{.underline}**?" 04/28/20
<https://thegreentimes.co.za/does-5g-mean-the-final-knockout-for-the-bees/>)
☺

1\. Vital essential bee-to-bee communication is massively disturbed by
mobile transmission.

Prof. Martin Lindauer, one of the most important German-speaking
[bee]{.underline} and behavioral researchers, discovered that bees
communicate with each other with the help of electromagnetic fields.
They [use the waggle dance to indicate to each other the direction and
distance to good food sources]{.underline}. In 1974, Russian researchers
Eskov and Sapozhnikov found that [bees produce frequencies between 180
Hz and 250 Hz]{.underline} with the help of small magnetite crystals in
their rump.

[The data transmission of mobile communication takes place with a pulse
frequency of 217 Hz and is exactly in the range of the waggle
dance.]{.underline} This impairs the natural communication of the bees.
The result: food collecting bees cannot tell each other correctly where
good food sources are. Thus, [the feeding of the bee colony is
existentially endangered.]{.underline}

2\. Mobile radiation leads to stress reactions and the doom of whole bee
colonies.

For example, several experiments with continuous radio irradiation of
hives in India, Russia and Germany have consistently shown that the
[**exposure of radiation leads to** increased stress reactions in the
bees, which ultimately can lead to the **death of the bee
colony.**]{.underline}

The biophysicist and Doctor of Natural Sciences, Dr. Ulrich Warnke,
clearly describes the great suffering of bees in low-frequency,
artificially constructed electric fields:

"[In 50 Hz alternating fields with field strengths of 110 V/cm
\[electric field strength\], the bee colonies in their habitation are
very restless. The temperature in the hive increases significantly. The
defense of social territory is increased so uncontrollably that members
of the hive kill each other. They do not recognize each other
anymore.]{.underline} After a few days of field influence, the [bees
remove their progeny out of the cells and new progeny is no longer
created. Likewise, honey and pollen are consumed and then no longer
collected.]{.underline}

[The bee colony finally cements all the cracks and the entry hole with
propolis \[a resinous mass made by bees\] to keep out the alleged
'enemy.']{.underline} After cementing the cracks and the entry hole an
acute lack of oxygen is created, and thus the bees try to create air
with intense fanning. In the process, the wing muscles cause such high
temperatures that the wax can melt. The bees try to cool down the
excessive temperature by even more intensive fanning. The end is a
'hyper activity' of the hive, which means that **[all individuals suffer
death by heat and suffocation."]{.underline}**

3\. Mobile radiation severely impairs the orientation of the bees.

Different scientists have found that organisms at all levels, ranging
from unicellular organisms, bacteria, insects, snails to vertebrates
(e.g. whales or birds) can orientate themselves by electromagnetic
fields, such as the Earth's magnetic field or weather fronts and air
mass-movements. All of these creatures have a compass system. For
example, in the cell body of so-called magnetic bacteria iron-containing
crystals act comparatively as a strong magnet.

These so-called magnetosomes act as a compass needle and align the cell
always to the Earth's magnetic field, so that they can move very
straightforwardly and unerringly through their habitat. The zoologist
and behavioral scientist Prof. Dr. Med. Wolfgang Wiltschko, and the
biologist Prof. Dr. Günther Fleissner proved the magnetic sense of
birds: Iron-containing magnetite crystals in the beaks indicate the
intensity of the magnetic field to the birds.

So they know at every moment of their flight where they are currently
located within their biologically stored earth magnetic field map. The
renowned bee and behavioral scientist Prof. Martin Lindauer proved by
experiments on [bees]{.underline} that these also [orientate themselves
with the help of biomagnetite particles]{.underline} (Fe3O4) on natural
magnetic fields. [But if the natural ones magnetic fields are overlaid
by artificial magnetic fields, then the calibration of the animals'
natural sense of compass is falsified, and this sets false directional
impulses so that they lose their way.]{.underline}

Technical communication transmissions (e.g., mobile, satellite)
massively disturb the energy and information lines of nature on which
the animals rely on. A team of Indian researchers proved that the
[orientation of bees is affected the most by mobile phone
radiation]{.underline}. In their experiment two mobile phones were
attached to the sides of each of two beehives. Twice a day they were
activated for fifteen minutes.

In a third hive, only mobile phone dummies were installed. Nothing was
installed on the fourth hive. After 90 days, the two [irradiated bee
colonies were significantly smaller and honey production had ceased
altogether]{.underline}. The queens averaged only 145 eggs per day,
compared to 376 in the other hives. The working bees strayed around the
hive disoriented. When they left, they returned less and less often. [At
the end of the experiment there was **no honey, no breeding and no bees
in the irradiated beehives.**]{.underline}

4\. Mobile radiation weakens the immune system.

Scientists at the American Beltsville Farming Research Institute found
that deceased bees have a severely weakened immune system.

"It is extremely alarming that dying is accompanied by symptoms that
have never been described before. The immune system of the animals seems
to have collapsed; some bees suffer from five to six infections
simultaneously."

But how can that be explained? The immune system works optimally only if
cell communication is working properly. The diverse biochemical
processes in the cells are controlled by means of electromagnetic
pulses.

It is precisely these electromagnetic impulses that are massively
disturbed by mobile communications, so that the biochemical processes
within the immune system are waning. Bees get sick and die. This would
also explain the strong parasite infestation of many bee colonies with
the Varroa mite, which beekeepers and researchers have been fighting for
decades. The disturbed bee immune system cannot defend itself anymore
against this highly dangerous bee enemy.

Conclusion:

[We already exist in the mobile generations up to 4G. To now introduce a
fifth generation with unevenly higher radiation exposure could mean the
complete extinction of the bees. This requires an immediate and
uncompromising rethinking by everyone, because **our survival is
dependent upon the bees.**]{.underline}

### \*\*\*\*Impact\-\--Health\-\--2NC

#### 5G wrecks human health\-\--radiation causes genetic, reproductive, and neurological damage. 

**Moskowitz '19** (Joel M. Moskowitz, PhD, director of the Center for
Family and Community Health in the School of Public Health at the
University of California, Berkeley. "We Have No Reason to Believe 5G Is
Safe" 10/17./19
<https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/we-have-no-reason-to-believe-5g-is-safe/>)
☺

The [telecommunications industry]{.underline} and their experts have
[accused many scientists who have researched]{.underline} the effects of
cell phone [radiation of \"fear mongering\" over the advent of wireless
technology\'s 5G.]{.underline} Since much of **[our research is
publicly-funded]{.underline}**, we believe it is our ethical
responsibility to [inform the public about what the **peer-reviewed
scientific literature tells us** about the health risks from wireless
radiation.]{.underline}

The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently
announced through a [press
release](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-358968A1.pdf) that
the commission will soon reaffirm the radio frequency radiation (RFR)
exposure limits that the FCC adopted in the late 1990s. These limits are
based upon a [behavioral change in
rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21999884) exposed to microwave
radiation and were designed to protect us from [short-term heating risks
due to RFR
exposure](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZcI0mHUoPlu3tBsWufCg28lXd7V2prKY/view).
 

Yet, since the FCC adopted these limits based largely on research from
the 1980s, the preponderance of peer-reviewed research, [more than 500
studies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CbWmdGTnnW1iZ9pxlxq1ssAdYl3Eur3/view),
have found harmful biologic or health effects from exposure to RFR at
intensities too low to cause significant heating.

Citing this large body of research, more than 240 scientists who have
published peer-reviewed research on the biologic and health effects of
nonionizing electromagnetic fields (EMF) signed [the International EMF
Scientist Appeal](https://emfscientist.org/), which calls for stronger
exposure limits. The appeal makes the following assertions:

"Numerous recent scientific publications have shown that [EMF
affects]{.underline} living organisms at levels well below most
international and national guidelines. Effects include [**increased
cancer risk, cellular stress**, increase in harmful **free radicals,
genetic damages**, structural and functional **changes of the
reproductive system**, **learning and memory deficits, neurological
disorders**, and negative impacts on general well-being in
humans.]{.underline} Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is
growing evidence of [harmful effects to both plant and animal
life."]{.underline}

The scientists who signed this appeal arguably constitute the majority
of experts on the effects of nonionizing radiation. They have published
more than 2,000 papers and letters on EMF in professional journals.

The FCC's RFR exposure limits regulate the intensity of exposure, taking
into account the frequency of the carrier waves, but ignore the
signaling properties of the RFR. Along with the patterning and duration
of exposures, certain characteristics of the signal (e.g., pulsing,
polarization)[ increase the biologic and health
impacts](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574218300991) of
the exposure. New exposure limits are needed which account for these
differential effects. Moreover, these limits should be [based on a
biological effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22676645), not a
change in a laboratory rat's behavior.

The [World Health Organization]{.underline}\'s International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) [[classified RFR as \"possibly carcinogenic to
humans\"]{.underline} ](https://www.iarc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pr208_E.pdf)in
2011. Last year, a \$30 million study conducted by the [U.S. National
Toxicology Program (NTP) found **"clear evidence" that** two years of
**exposure** to cell phone RFR [**increased cancer** in male rats and
damaged DNA in
rats ](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/ntp-temp/tr595_508.pdf)and [mice ](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/ntp-temp/tr596_508.pdf)of
both sexes.]{.underline} The Ramazzini Institute in Italy replicated the
key finding of the NTP using a different carrier frequency and much
weaker exposure to cell phone radiation over the life of the rats.

Based upon the research published since 2011, including human and animal
studies and mechanistic data, the [IARC has recently prioritized RFR to
be reviewed again in the next five years]{.underline}. Since many EMF
scientists believe we now have [sufficient
evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376454/) to
consider RFR as either a probable or known human carcinogen, the IARC
will likely upgrade the carcinogenic potential of RFR in the near
future.

Nonetheless, without conducting a formal risk assessment or a systematic
review of the research on RFR health effects, the FDA recently
reaffirmed the FCC's 1996 exposure limits [in a letter to the
FCC](https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10815418118189/13-84.pdf), stating
that the agency had "concluded that no changes to the current standards
are warranted at this time," and that "NTP's experimental findings
should not be applied to human cell phone usage." The letter stated that
"the available scientific evidence to date does not support adverse
health effects in humans due to exposures at or under the current
limits."

The latest cellular technology, [5G, will employ millimeter
waves]{.underline} for the first time in addition to microwaves that
have been in use for older cellular technologies, 2G through 4G. Given
limited reach, 5G will [require cell antennas every 100 to 200
meters,]{.underline} exposing many people to millimeter wave radiation.
5G also employs new technologies (e.g[., active antennas capable of
beam-forming; phased arrays; massive multiple inputs and outputs, known
as massive MIMO)]{.underline} which [pose unique challenges for
measuring exposures]{.underline}.

Millimeter waves are mostly absorbed within a few millimeters of human
skin and in the surface layers of the cornea. Short-term exposure can
have adverse physiological effects in the peripheral nervous system, the
immune system and the cardiovascular system. The research suggests that
[long-term exposure may pose health risks to the skin (e.g., melanoma),
the eyes (e.g., ocular melanoma) and the testes (e.g.,
sterility).]{.underline}

Since 5G is a new technology, there is no research on health effects, so
we are "flying blind" to quote a U.S. senator. However, we have
considerable evidence about the harmful effects of 2G and 3G. Little is
known the effects of exposure to 4G, a 10-year-old technology, because
governments have been remiss in funding this research. Meanwhile, we are
seeing increases in certain types of head and neck tumors in tumor
registries, which may be at least partially attributable to the
proliferation of cell phone radiation. These increases are consistent
with results from case-control studies of tumor risk in heavy cell phone
users.

5G will not replace 4G; it will accompany 4G for the near future and
possibly over the long term. If there are synergistic effects from
simultaneous exposures to multiple types of RFR, our overall risk of
harm from RFR may increase substantially. Cancer is not the only risk as
there is [**considerable evidence that RFR causes neurological disorders
and reproductive harm,** likely due to oxidative stress.]{.underline}

As a society, should we invest hundreds of billions of dollars deploying
5G, a cellular technology that requires the installation of 800,000 or
more new cell antenna sites in the U.S. close to where we live, work and
play?

Instead, we should support the recommendations of the [**250 scientists
and** medical **doctors**]{.underline} who signed the [[5G
Appeal](http://www.5gappeal.eu/) that **calls for an immediate
moratorium on** the deployment of **5G**]{.underline} and demand that
our government fund the research needed to adopt biologically based
exposure limits that protect our health and safety.

[Stop global roll out of 5G networks until safety is confirmed, urges

Transmitter density means greater population exposure to high levels of
radio frequency electromagnetic fields

We should err on the side of caution and stop the global roll out of 5G
(fifth generation) telecoms networks until we are certain this
technology is completely safe, urges an expert in an[ opinion
piece](https://jech.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jech-2019-213595) published
online in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.

There are no health concerns about 5G and COVID-19, despite what
conspiracy theorists have suggested. 

But the [transmitter density required for 5G means]{.underline} that
[more people will be exposed to radio frequency electromagnetic
fields]{.underline} (RF-EMFs), and at levels that emerging [evidence
suggests, are]{.underline} potentially [harmful to health, argues
Professor John William Frank, Usher Institute, University of
Edinburgh.]{.underline}

The advent of 5G technology has been hailed by governments and certain
vested interests as transformative, promising clear economic and
lifestyle benefits, through massively boosting wireless and mobile
connectivity at home, work, school and in the community, he says.

But [it has become the subject of fierce controversy]{.underline},
fuelled by four key areas of [scientific uncertainty and
concern.]{.underline}

The lack of clarity about precisely what technology is included in 5G;
and a growing but far from comprehensive body of laboratory research
indicating the biologically disruptive potential of RF-EMFs  

An almost total lack (as yet) of high quality epidemiological studies of
the impact on human health from 5G EMF exposure

Mounting epidemiological evidence of such effects from previous
generations of RF-EMF exposure at lower levels

Persistent allegations that some national telecomms regulatory
authorities haven't based their RF-EMF safety policies on the latest
science, amid potential conflicts of interest

5G uses much higher frequency (3 to 300GHz) radio waves than in the past
and it makes use of very new---and [relatively unevaluated, in terms of
safety]{.underline}---supportive technology [to enable this higher data
transmission capacity]{.underline}, points out Professor Frank.

Its inherent [fragility means that transmission boosting 'cell'
antennae]{.underline} are generally [required every 100--300
m]{.underline}---which is [far more spatially dense than]{.underline}
the transmission masts required for [older]{.underline} 2G, 3G and 4G
[technology]{.underline}, using lower frequency waves, he says.

A dense transmission network is also required to achieve the
'everywhere/anytime' connectivity promised by 5G developers.

Existing 4G systems can service up to 4000 radio frequency-using devices
per square kilometre; 5G systems will connect up to one million devices
per square kilometre---greatly increasing the speed of data transfer (by
a factor of 10) and the volume of data transmitted (by a factor of
1000), he explains.

While several major reviews of the existing evidence on the potential
health harms of 5G have been published over the past decade, these have
been of "varying scientific quality," suggests Professor Frank.

And they have not stopped the clamour from "[a growing number of
engineers, scientists, and doctors internationally\...calling on
governments to raise their safety standards for RF-EMFs,]{.underline}
commission more and better research, and hold off on further increases
in public exposure, pending clearer evidence of safety," he writes.

Permitted maximum safety limits for RF-EMF exposure vary considerably
around the world, he points out.

What's more, '5G systems' is not a consistently defined term, comprising
quite different specific technologies and components.

"It is highly likely that each of these many forms of transmission
causes somewhat different biological effects---making sound,
comprehensive and up-to-date research on those effects virtually
impossible," he explains.

Recent reviews of lab data on RF-EMFs indicate that [exposures can
produce wide-ranging effects, including reproductive, fetal,
oncological, neuropsychiatric, skin, eye and
immunological]{.underline}.  But there is absolutely no evidence
whatsoever to suggest that it is implicated in the spread of COVID-19,
as some conspiracy theorists have suggested, he emphasises.

NO SILVER BULLET

In the early 2010s the U.S. flight-tested a long-range glider, the
Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2). It was designed to glide up to
7,600 kilometers after being boosted to an initial speed of Mach 20 by a
rocket. [We combined data from]{.underline} these
**[tests]{.underline}** with other information about the vehicle [to
construct **detailed** computer **simulations of hypersonic flight**.
We]{.underline} also [compared the performance of boost-glide weapons
with long-established technologies, such as ballistic or cruise
missiles,]{.underline} on the three abilities in which hypersonic
weapons are said to be exceptional---delivery time, maneuverability and
stealth.

[Hypersonic weapons are]{.underline} often [said to **reduce** the
**time** needed to deliver a warhead, but this claim is]{.underline}
largely [based on a **misleading comparison** with subsonic cruise
missiles or with ballistic missiles on **longer
trajectories**]{.underline}. The most energy-efficient path for a
ballistic missile, called a minimum-energy trajectory, sends a warhead
arcing high above Earth before it falls to its target. The warhead
avoids atmospheric drag over most of its flight but follows a much
longer path than a hypersonic glider would, so it can take somewhat
longer to reach the same target.

Yet [a ballistic missile can]{.underline} instead [fly at **lower
altitude**]{.underline}, called [a depressed
trajectory]{.underline}---long seen as a way of delivering
quicker [nuclear
attacks](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/1992/06/depressed_trajectory_slbms_a_t.html) from
submarines. [Such a path would be **much shorter** than a minimum-energy
one]{.underline}, and a warhead following it would also avoid drag over
most of its trajectory. [**In contrast**, a hypersonic glider spends
**significantly more time** within the atmosphere, where drag **reduces
its speed**]{.underline}. Our calculations show that [a ballistic
missile]{.underline} on a depressed trajectory [can deliver a warhead
with a]{.underline}n equal or [**shorter flight time** than a hypersonic
weapon over the **same range**.]{.underline}

[**Maneuvering** is another advertised advantage of hypersonic
weapons]{.underline}. Again, [the reality is **more
complicated**]{.underline}. The U.S. has developed and tested
maneuvering reentry vehicles (MaRVs)---warheads that use aerodynamic
forces to change direction as they near the target, helping to increase
accuracy and evade missile defenses---for ballistic missiles for
decades: maneuverability is not unique to hypersonic weapons. To be
sure, MaRVs typically twist and turn only late in flight. They cannot
snake around during their entire course as hypersonic gliders are
supposed to do. But [the **maneuverability** of hypersonic gliders is
constrained by the **great forces** needed to **turn** a vehicle flying
at such tremendous speeds.]{.underline}

[To change direction, a hypersonic glider must use lift forces to impart
a horizontal velocity]{.underline}---[which might **itself** have to be
**hypersonic**]{.underline}. For example, to turn by 30 degrees, a
glider flying at Mach 15, or 4.5 kilometers per second, must generate a
horizontal velocity of Mach 7.5, or 2.3 kilometers per second. (Because
the speed of sound changes with density and altitude, flight engineers
often take Mach 1 to be about 300 meters per second, and so do we.) At
the same time, the glider must retain enough vertical lift to stay
aloft. Such [maneuvers can **cost significant speed and
range**]{.underline}.

To generate the extra lift needed to change direction, the vehicle could
dive to a lower altitude to use the greater push from denser air. It
would make its turn before returning to a higher altitude, with less
drag, to resume its flight. Going to lower altitudes would reduce the
time needed to turn but also increase the drag that the vehicle
experiences. For example, at Mach 15 a glider such as the HTV-2 would
fly at an altitude of about 40 kilometers. If it drops by about 2.5
kilometers, then turning by 30 degrees would take about seven minutes,
during which it would travel along a vast arc, with a radius of some
4,000 kilometers. The extra drag that comes from traveling in denser
air, even for such a short time, would reduce the glider's speed by
about Mach 1.3, causing it to lose about 450 kilometers of range out of
the 3,000 kilometers it might otherwise have traveled.

Some amount of midcourse maneuvering, such as for selecting a new
target, can be useful, and gliders could likely make larger maneuvers
than ballistic missile warheads can. Still, MaRVs can already maneuver
by hundreds of kilometers during reentry, so it is hard to see how this
ability is revolutionary.

[Another common claim is that]{.underline} because [gliders]{.underline}
travel at lower altitudes than a ballistic warhead, they [would be
"**nearly invisible**" to **early-warning systems**]{.underline}. A
ground-based radar system can spot a warhead at an altitude of 1,000
kilometers from about 3,500 kilometers away, but because of the earth's
curvature it would not see a glider approaching at a height of 40
kilometers until it was only about 500 kilometers away. But [**both**
the U.S. and Russia have **early-warning satellites** with **sensitive
infrared sensors** that could spot the **intense light** that gliders
emit because of their extreme temperatures]{.underline}. Our analysis
indicates that [currently deployed U.S. satellites would be **capable**
of **detecting** and **tracking gliders** traveling through the
atmosphere at speeds covering]{.underline} most of [the **hypersonic
regime**]{.underline}.

Gliders deployable in the foreseeable future might avoid being seen by
U.S. satellites if they fly at the low end of the hypersonic range---
below about Mach 6. This concern appears to be motivating U.S. research
into new constellations of satellite sensors. But a boost-glide vehicle
similar to the HTV-2 with an initial speed of Mach 5.5 would travel less
than 500 kilometers, so flying at these speeds would significantly limit
its range. Hypersonic cruise missiles could conceivably maintain these
low speeds over longer distances. Such slow speeds may, however, negate
another key argument for hypersonic weapons---their ability to avoid
terminal missile defenses.

Russia and China seem to be developing hypersonic weapons largely
because of their ability to evade U.S. missile defense systems. The U.S.
Ground-based Midcourse Defense and ship-based Aegis SM-3 systems, which
are intended to defend the U.S., Japan, and other countries, intercept
above the atmosphere and are unable to engage hypersonic weapons flying
in at lower altitudes. Hypersonic gliders with sufficient speed and
maneuverability could also evade defenses of shorter range that work
within the atmosphere, such as the U.S. Patriot, SM-2 and THAAD systems.
These interceptors protect small regions, tens of kilometers across,
around military sites and ships, using lift forces for turning to
intercept incoming weapons. Their efficacy depends on their being more
maneuverable than the missile they are trying to hit, which in turn
depends strongly on flight speed. Patriot interceptors, for example, use
rocket boosters to reach speeds of up to Mach 6. A hypersonic weapon
could likely outmaneuver these interceptors if it maintained high
speeds---but could become vulnerable to them when flying below about
Mach 6. Thus, [almost as soon as a hypersonic glider becomes
**invisible** to **satellites**]{.underline} (but possibly visible to
ground radar), [it can become **susceptible** to
**interception**]{.underline}.

Moreover, [the ability to penetrate **defensive shields** is **not
unique** to hypersonic gliders. Interceptors that operate outside the
atmosphere are particularly vulnerable to]{.underline} being fooled by
[decoys and other countermeasures, which Russia and China have developed
and]{.underline} likely [deployed]{.underline}. Ballistic missiles of
short and medium range, launched from an aircraft, could fly at
altitudes low enough to avoid such "exo-atmospheric" defenses.
Similarly, equipping ballistic missiles, including missiles of short and
medium range, with MaRVs could allow them to outmaneuver and penetrate
defenses that operate within the atmosphere.

Today the U.S. has shifted its focus from developing long-range gliders
such as the HTV-2 toward hypersonic systems of shorter range, of up to a
few thousand kilometers. This change is motivated not only by the
shortcomings of the prototype HTV-2 glider, which the tests had
revealed, but also by a new mission: to use weapons in a local, or
"theater," conflict to penetrate and destroy defensive systems. In terms
of capabilities, however, these shorter-range hypersonic gliders are
virtually indistinguishable from MaRV-tipped ballistic missiles flying
on depressed trajectories. The similarity became obvious in 2018, when
the U.S. Department of Defense announced its choice of design for a
hypersonic vehicle intended for joint use by the army, navy and air
force. Rather than opting for a wedge shape like that of the HTV-2,
which would increase the value of L/D, the Pentagon chose an older
conical design based on an experimental MaRV originally developed in the
1970s. This weapon would have a lower range and less maneuverability,
the Pentagon acknowledged, but the technology was less risky.

A design from the 1970s is hardly revolutionary. It looks to us like the
Pentagon is using the hype about hypersonic weapons to secure funding
from Congress while reverting to a technology developed half a century
ago for its main system. While the Pentagon is putting some funds into
other designs, its focus is not the revolutionary systems that were
advertised.

DRAG AND LIFT

[Hypersonic systems deployed]{.underline} in the near term [will be
**"boost-glide" weapons**]{.underline}, which would be launched by a
rocket booster and then glide long distances without propulsion. (The
U.S. and other countries are also working to build hypersonic cruise
missiles, but their engines are still under development.) Yet our
[studies indicate that hypersonic gliders encounter **severe
challenges**. **Physics** gets in the way.]{.underline}

[Designers of hypersonic vehicles face a **daunting adversary**:
**drag**, the resistance a fluid offers to anything moving through
it]{.underline}. The drag on a flying object increases in proportion to
the square of its velocity, making it particularly debilitating at
hypersonic speeds. [A glider at **Mach 5** is subjected to **25 times
the drag**]{.underline} force than when it flies at Mach 1, for example,
and one at Mach 20 faces 400 times the drag of when it is at Mach 1.

[Even more severe is the **energy drain**]{.underline} from an aircraft
[as it pushes the molecules of air **forward** and
**aside**]{.underline}: it increases as the cube of the velocity. So a
[glider]{.underline} flying [at Mach 5 will lose energy **125 times
faster**]{.underline} than at Mach 1; one flying at Mach 20 will lose
energy 8,000 times faster. Just as problematic, the kinetic energy
flowing from the glider to the surrounding air transforms to thermal
energy and shock waves. Some of that energy transfers back to the
vehicle as heat: leading edges of boost-glide weapons flying at Mach 10
or above can reach temperatures above 2,000 kelvins for sustained
periods. Protecting a vehicle from this intense heat is one of the
biggest problems facing engineers.

At the same time, like any other glider, [a hypersonic one must generate
**lift**]{.underline}---a force perpendicular to its direction of
motion---to stay aloft and to turn. (A glider turns by banking or
otherwise inducing a horizontal component of the lift force.) As it
happens, [lift is also proportional to the square of the
velocity]{.underline}. Moreover, the aerodynamic processes that produce
lift also unavoidably generate drag. [The ratio of the lift
force]{.underline}, L, to the drag force, D, is called the lift-to-drag
ratio, [L/D, a **key marker** of a glider's performance]{.underline}.

Achievable [values of **L/D** for hypersonic vehicles are **much lower**
than for **conventional aircraft**. For subsonic]{.underline} aircraft,
[the ratio can be 15 or larger]{.underline}. Yet after decades of
research and development, U.S. [hypersonic weapons tested]{.underline}
in the past decade [appear to have L/D values less than
**three**]{.underline}. Such [low L/D ratios mean low lift and high
drag]{.underline}---which [limits the **speed** and
**range**]{.underline} of a hypersonic glider, reduces its
[**maneuverability** and increases surface heating]{.underline}.

As if that were not enough, [the physics and chemistry of
air]{.underline} flowing past an object [become **radically different**
at **hypersonic speeds**]{.underline}. Heated to thousands of degrees,
the surrounding air dissociates, converting molecular oxygen into free
atoms that can ionize and scour away the surface of the vehicle. [**Even
if** the missile survives the **roasting**, the heating produces a
**bright infrared signal** that **satellites** can see]{.underline}.

In an assessment after Putin's speech, [U.S. military officials stated
that **hypersonic weapons**]{.underline}, which China was also
developing, [would "**revolutionize warfare**."]{.underline} The
Pentagon, which had been working on similar systems for a decade and a
half, ramped up its own efforts; last year Congress dedicated \$3.2
billion to the research and development of hypersonic weapons and
defenses. Russia and China now claim to each have deployed at least one
such system. The U.S. has six known hypersonic programs, divided among
the air force, army and navy. Proponents say that these weapons are
incredibly fast and agile and virtually invisible.

**[We disagree]{.underline}**. We belong to a small but vibrant
[community of physicists and engineers]{.underline} scattered around the
globe [who study new weapons systems]{.underline} to [understand their
potential impacts on global security]{.underline}. This tradition is

scientists such as Andrei Sakharov, who sought to mitigate the danger to
the world from the nuclear weapons they had helped create. As
investigative physicists, we glean what information we can about new and
usually secretive technologies, analyze it and share our evaluations
with the public.

The tests surprised members of the U.S. Military and intelligence
community and caused [some]{.underline} U.S. officials and
[analysts]{.underline} to [suspect China is developing offensive missile
technology]{.underline} --- a "fractional orbital bombardment system"
--- [capable of threatening the U.S.]{.underline}

"The People's Liberation Army now has an increasingly credible
capability to undermine our missile defenses and threaten the American
homeland with both conventional and nuclear strikes," Republican
Congressman Michael Gallagher, of Wisconsin told the Financial Times.

[Should we be worried?]{.underline} Should we even care about this
in-development technology?

The answer, as it often is, is shrouded in gray. Yes, hypersonic
technology is the next big thing in aerospace and will likely have huge
implications for both civilian aviation and military operations over the
next century. [**No**, the Chinese tests over the summer **don't** mean
we're]{.underline} necessarily [any closer to **nuclear Armageddon** ---
not unless we're determined to make it so]{.underline}.

"I know the latest Chinese test has made a lot of people sit up and take
notice," U.S. [Naval War College Professor of National Security Affairs
and former nuclear Missile Squadron Commander]{.underline} Dana
[Struckman]{.underline} tells Inverse. "But in my opinion,
[it]{.underline} still [**doesn\'t change** the **nuclear deterrence
calculus** that much]{.underline}, if at all."

WHAT ARE HYPERSONIC WEAPONS?

Hypersonic flight generally means flying at Mach 5 --- five times the
speed of sound --- or faster. It's a speed at which the aerodynamics of
flight change significantly.

For example, the U.S. Cold War-era SR-71 spy plane flew at a merely high
supersonic Mach 3.2 and the plane's windshield would heat to 600 degrees
Fahrenheit due to friction. Airflows become even more forgiving at
hypersonic speeds. Some of the most cutting-edge aerospace engineering
in the U.S., Russia, and China involves figuring out how to make flight
at hypersonic speeds sustainable.

At the same time, [hypersonic flight **isn't entirely
new.**]{.underline}

There were [French and Russian scientists researching hypersonic
propulsion]{.underline} technologies [in the 1930s and 40s]{.underline}.
The U.S. [Air Force]{.underline} and NASA [were already flying at
hypersonic speeds in the 1950s]{.underline} with the X-15 rocket plane,
Michael Heil, former commander of the U.S. Air Force Space and Directed
Energy Laboratory tells Inverse.

[Spacecraft must hit **Mach 25**]{.underline} to reach orbit and later
re-enter the atmosphere at a blistering Mach 20, [as do the warheads
of]{.underline} Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, or [**ICBMs**, the
more traditional]{.underline} strategic **[nuclear
missile]{.underline}**.

If the U.S. and USSR had ever pushed the button, ICBMs would have
launched from silos and submarines, delivering nuclear warheads on
arching, ballistic trajectories through space and over the north pole to
incinerate people and infrastructure on the other side of the world.

Contemporary hypersonic research is different than ICBMs or spacecraft
in that it focuses on sustained, controlled flight at hypersonic speeds
in the atmosphere.

This requires either using rockets to boost a vehicle or missile that
then glides at hypersonic speeds to its target--- a "boost-glide" system
--- or an "air-breathing" vehicle with specialized jet engines called
supersonic combustion ramjet, or scramjet, engines (both approaches are
difficult, but scramjets are a bit like trying to light a blue dart in a
tornado).

The U.S. has developed both types of hypersonic technologies,
successfully flying air-breathing hypersonic test vehicles --- like the
X-43 in 2004 and the X-51 from 2010 to 2013 --- and boost-glide weapons
such as the Intermediate-Range Conventional Prompt Strike /Dark Eagle
missile, though the latter failed its most recent test flight in late
October.

WHAT KIND OF HYPERSONIC VEHICLE DID CHINA TEST?

[It's **not**]{.underline} exactly [**clear** what China flew over the
summer]{.underline}. Officially, the Chinese Foreign Ministry says the
launches were tests of reusable spacecraft.

Heil tells Inverse [it was likely some sort of **boost-glide
vehicle**]{.underline} ---[a maneuverable, hypersonic
glider]{.underline} lofted to high altitude and then gliding down at
hypersonic speeds to strike its target.

China has tested one such weapon system, the DF-ZF, nine times since
2014, according to a Congressional Research Service report.

But most [boost-glide systems **don't** place a **glide vehicle** in
orbit. That's much more like a fractional orbital bombardment system, or
FOB]{.underline}, a system that was actually deployed by the USSR in the
1970s and 80s, according to a Twitter thread by Jeffery Lewis, director
of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project at Middlebury Institute of
International Studies.

The idea is to place nuclear weapons in a partial orbit for a short
time, from where they can be called down upon your enemies
unpredictably.

"The Soviets had an operational FOBS capability for twelve years," Lewis
tweeted. "It was designed to defeat US missile defenses."

CHINA'S HYPERSONIC VEHICLE AND ITS CAPABILITIES

It's the possibility of a Chinese FOB system evading missile defense
systems that worries people like Congressman Gallagher. It's not the
speed of a hypersonic missile --- a traditional ICBM flies faster ---
but its maneuverability and unpredictability.

"Ballistic systems are, by definition, predictable. Once you know a
ballistic trajectory, you can predict about where it\'s gonna land,"
Heil says. "With a hypersonic system, even if you can detect it coming
in, it can maneuver. It can go off on a different azimuth and hit a
different target than you think it was aiming for."

That makes it hard to intercept a hypersonic missile with an
anti-missile missile.

But [China's hypersonic launch]{.underline} probably [**doesn't** mean
we're heading toward **nuclear war**]{.underline}.

[There's a **very important** thing to consider when discussing missile
defense systems and nuclear attacks: There is **no missile defense
system**]{.underline}. Not [against a large-scale nuclear
attack]{.underline} anyway.

A national missile defense against a few missiles is "doable," Heil
says. But is there a missile defense system in place that could fend off
a large-scale attack from China? No.

Ultimately, [it **doesn't** matter **how** you nuke an American city, it
**only** matters **that** you nuked an American city. Whether a missile
from space, a bomb dropped]{.underline} from a plane, [or]{.underline}
smuggled [inside of a suitcase, if China nukes the U.S., the U.S. will
nuke back.]{.underline}

[**M**utually **a**ssured **d**estruction was the basis of]{.underline}
the strategic [stalemate]{.underline} between the Soviet Union and the
U.S. [during the Cold War]{.underline} --- and **[we haven't progressed
past that policy]{.underline}**.

It may be the case that China is developing a missile system that can
evade missile defense systems, Struckman says, but assuming it wanted to
start a full-scale nuclear war --- a big if --- [a hypersonic missile,
"does **not** alleviate the targeting conundrum any adversary would
face]{.underline} in [trying to strike **400** dispersed **ICBMs**,
along with deployed **submarines** and **bombers**]{.underline}."

One of the reasons the U.S. and USSR stockpiled thousands of nuclear
weapons across multiple weapons platforms was to make it difficult for
the other side to wipe out their ability to retaliate should they be
victims of a surprise attack. **[Hypersonics]{.underline}** are in many
ways just better missiles --- but they [still **can't compete**
with]{.underline} the number of [American nukes]{.underline}.

What also gets lost in this conversation is the cost of hypersonic
missiles, Struckman says.

"It seems to me that [the **price tag alone** per]{.underline} unit cost
on a [hypersonic weapon would **preclude mass production**]{.underline}
and thus strengthen the argument for using them against high-value
targets," he explains.

Despite technological breakthroughs, [the US and China will **avoid**

capabilities as nuclear technology evolves.

Discussion, Limitations, and Conclusions

[**Scholars** continue to **dispute** the coercive role of **air power**
in single cases and across space and time]{.underline}. [This article
examines coercive air power from a new angle, assessing the role of air
power as a costly signal during **international crisis bargaining**. It
argues that **air demonstrations** communicate a **lack of resolve**
during coercive bargaining]{.underline}. [Using **new
data**]{.underline} on air, naval, and land demonstrations [during
interstate crises, this article finds that **air signals** do **not
increase** the **success** of **compellent threats**. Air demonstrations
are **far less effective** at inducing target compliance when compared
with other military demonstrations.]{.underline}

Of course, this is not to say that air power is ineffective in all
problem areas. This article does not assess the usefulness of air power
in a host of other situations, including surveillance, reconnaissance,
force application, and force enhancement processes, to name a few.
[However, the findings here jive with the **growing consensus** that air
power has **limited utility for coercion**]{.underline}. While Pape's
conclusions concerning air power prompted a litany of criticisms and
responses from multiple angles (Watts 1997; Warden 1997; Pape 1997a,
1997b; Mueller 1998), coercive air power (particularly when used in
punishment campaigns) has been found to have limited utility within war
(e.g., Horowitz and Reiter 2001).23 This article finds comparable
patterns in the period leading up to war as well.

One limitation of the study and data is its focus on the challenger
state over the target state. The theory here does not delve into the
goals/interests of the state being coerced, and the MCT data set does
not include much information on the target state. However, this
limitation is unlikely to undermine the findings of this article
regarding the success of compellent threats. If a state is the recipient
of a compellent threat, it is likely that the state has already begun to
undertake an action that is undesirable and is relatively highly
resolved to achieve its goals. [Given the target's **high resolve**, the
coercing state(s) will need to employ especially **costly signals** to
bring about a **desired behavior**.]{.underline} [Air power is **not a
particularly costly signal**, so we should expect air mobilizations and
demonstrations to be **less effective** in these cases. However, air
signals may be more effective for deterrent purposes, in which the
target state's resolve is weaker and the stakes are lower]{.underline}.
That is, if the target state has relatively low stakes in a crisis, air
mobilizations might actually serve as a credible and effective signal of
resolve. A study of deterrence may be better able to address variation
in target interests and resolve and find different effects for various
military signals.

This article suggests a significant revision to our understanding of
military mobilization and costly signals. To further evaluate this
article's central claim---that audiences interpret air demonstrations as
less costly signaling attempts and respond accordingly---we should move
to models and data sets that better assess the scope of the signal
employed. We also need to focus on the intent behind the signal. Of
course, intent is much more difficult to assess in practice than in
theory. State leaders often "intend" a policy to communicate multiple
meanings to different audiences and may revise their own understanding
based on its effects. Future research might look at how leaders
(especially presidents) choose among the signaling options in the
coercive bargaining context. This may require extensive archival
research to understand why leaders rely on certain types of military
power. For example, those with military experience may prefer certain
types of signals compared with civilian presidents, just as military
background can influence the willingness to use force more generally
(Horowitz and Stam 2014; Horowitz, Stam, and Ellis 2015; Sechser 2004).

[At a minimum, these findings suggest that air power communicates a
**lack of resolve** across a data set of compellent
threats]{.underline}. According to the theoretical framework provided
here, air signals reveal important limitations to a [state's cost
tolerance. In so doing, such acts signal a degree of restraint (perhaps
unintentionally) and come across as half-hearted signals. Instead of
being costly enough to demonstrate resolve, air signals are costless
enough to demonstrate a lack of resolve.]{.underline} [Recent
scholarship on air power notes that " \... . even when military
professionals doubt the effectiveness of air power in certain
situations, the siren song of airpower continues to appeal to civilians
committed to doing something"]{.underline} (Farley 2014, 189). [These
results lead to the frustrating conclusion that **succumbing** to the
demand to just "do something, anything" may be an efficient way to
accomplish **little** during cases of international
bargaining.]{.underline}

### AT: Naval Power\-\--1NC

#### Naval power fails.

None of these [arguments]{.underline} are completely incorrect, but in
questioning the primacy of land power, they [ignore]{.underline} both
[**history** and **geography**]{.underline}, as well as the
psychological aspect of warfare. [There is **no example in military
history** where **a major conflict** between **strong powers** has been
**decisively won** only on the basis of a naval]{.underline} or air
[campaign]{.underline}.

The Allied strategic bombing campaign against Germany in World War 2 was
unprecedented in scale. According to The United States Strategic Bombing
Survey, published after the war, almost 2,700,000 tons of bombs were
dropped, with more than 1,440,000 bomber sorties and 2,680,000 fighter
sorties being flown. An estimated 300,000 civilians were killed and
780,000 wounded while almost 7,500,000 were rendered homeless. However,
as the survey pointed out, "The mental reaction of the German people to
air attack is significant...Their morale, their belief in ultimate
victory or satisfactory compromise, and their confidence in their
leaders declined, but they continued to work efficiently as long as the
physical means of production remained." Ultimately it required a ground
offensive for Germany to capitulate.

There is a similar trend in the employment of naval power. For Alfred
Mahan, [the imposition of **a blockade** to choke a country's economy
was **the ultimate manifestation of sea power**]{.underline}. However,
[as]{.underline} John J. [Mearsheimer points out]{.underline} in his
book The Tragedy of Great Power Politics, "First,
**[blockades]{.underline}** alone [cannot]{.underline} [coerce **an
enemy into surrendering**. The futility]{.underline} of such a strategy
[is shown by the fact]{.underline} that [**no belligerent** has **ever
tried it**]{.underline}...Second, [blockades **rarely do much** to
weaken armies]{.underline}, hence they rarely contribute in important
ways to the success of a ground campaign."

Julian Corbett, a famous British naval strategist, reinforces this view
when he writes, "Since men live upon the land and not upon the sea,
great issues between nations at war have always been decided...either by
what your army can do against your enemy's territory and national life,
or else by the fear of what the fleet makes it possible for your army to
do."

There are two more domains of modern warfare, space and cyber. While
important, these are by themselves are not sufficient to force victory.
Non-contact warfare is a good term to use, and while countries would
like to win victories without much cost, it would be poor strategy to
plan our force structure on this assumption.

War is essentially a human endeavour and a clash of wills between two
adversaries. Past campaigns have shown that air or [**sea power** has
**rarely impacted**]{.underline} **[morale of the
population]{.underline}** to an extent that they force the government to
submit. It is only when territories are conquered, and population
subjugated that governments surrender. Mearsheimer makes a critical
observation, "Armies are of paramount importance in warfare because they
are the main military instrument for conquering and controlling land,
which is the supreme political objective in a world of territorial
states. **[Naval]{.underline}** and air [**forces** are **simply
not**]{.underline} [suited for **conquering territory**."]{.underline}

Strategic Stability, and New Challenges for Nuclear Security and Arms
Control," European Security 25(2), p. 171-172\]

[It is]{.underline} of course [**highly unlikely** that either the
**US**A or Russia has plans -- or perhaps more importantly, the desire
-- to]{.underline} fully [undermine the other's nuclear
**c**]{.underline}ommand [and **c**]{.underline}ontrol
[systems]{.underline} as a precursor to some type of disarming first
strike, but the perception that nuclear forces and associated systems
could be vulnerable or compromised is persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015)
puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement entering into our nuclear
forces are real". While [the growing possibility of "cyber disablement"
should **not** be **overstated** (notions of a "cyber-**Pearl
Harbor**"]{.underline} (Panetta 2012) [or "cyber 9--11"]{.underline}
(Charles 2013) [have **done little** to help understand the nature of
the challenge]{.underline}), cyberthreats are nevertheless an
increasingly important component of the contemporary US--Russia
strategic context. This is particularly the case when they are combined
with other emerging military-technical developments and programmes. The
net result, especially given the current downturn in US--Russian
strategic relations, and the way cyber is exacerbating the impact of
other problematic strategic dynamics, is that is seems highly unlikely
that either the USA or Russia will make the requisite moves to de-alert
nuclear forces that the new cyber challenges appear to necessitate, or
for that matter to (re)embrace the "deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time
soon.

Assessing the options for arms control and enhancing mutual security

Given the new challenges presented by cyber to both US and Russian
nuclear forces and to US--Russia strategic stability, it is important to
consider what might be done to help mitigate and guard against these
threats, and thereby help minimise the risks of unintentional launches,
miscalculation, and accidents, and perhaps create the conditions for
greater stability, de-alerting, and further nuclear cuts. While there is
unlikely to be a panacea or "magic bullet" that will reduce the risk of
cyberattacks on US and Russian nuclear forces to zero -- be they
designed to launch nuclear weapons or compromise the systems that
support them -- there are a number of options that might be considered
and pursued in order to address these different types of threats and
vulnerabilities. None, of these however, will be easy.

The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA and Russia is
working (potentially together) to harden and better protect nuclear
systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or cyber-induced
accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that Russian
nuclear command and control networks would be protected against cyber
incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile Forces
(Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network defences
and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded and
better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
[**nuclear** weapons and **c**ommand and **c**ontrol infrastructure are
likely to be the **best protected** of **all** computer systems, and
**"air gapped"**]{.underline}14 [from the wider Internet]{.underline} --
this does not mean they are invulnerable or will continue to be secure
in the future, particularly as systems are modernised or become more
complex (Fritz 2009). Or as Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at
Boeing, put it, "while its old it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

Threat to Nuclear Deterrence," War on the Rocks,
<http://warontherocks.com/2016/02/the-cyber-threat-to-nuclear-deterrence/>\]

[The perception that cyber threats will]{.underline} ultimately
[undermine the]{.underline} relevance or [effectiveness of nuclear
deterrence is **flawed**]{.underline} in at least three keys areas.
[First]{.underline} among these [is the perception that nuclear
weapons]{.underline} or their command and control systems [are similar
to a heavily defended corporate network. The **critical
error**]{.underline} in this analogy [is that there is an expectation of
IP-based availability that simply **does not exist** in the case of
American nuclear weapons --- **they are not online**. Even with
**physical access**, the proprietary nature of]{.underline} their
control system design and redundancy of the National [Command and
Control]{.underline} System (NCCS) [makes the possibility of
successfully implementing an exploit against either a weapon or
communications system **incredibly remote**]{.underline}. Also, [whereas
the cyber domain is characterized by significant levels of risk due to a
combination of]{.underline} bias toward [**automated safeguards** and
the liability of single human failures, nuclear weapon safety and surety
are predicated on **balanced elements** of **stringent human
interaction** and **control**. From **two-person integrity** in physical
inspections and loading, to the **rigorous mechanisms** and
**authority** required for weapons release, human beings serve as a
**multi-factor safeguard** while retaining the ultimate role to protect
the integrity of nuclear deterrence against cyber threats]{.underline}.

To a large degree, the potential vulnerabilities caused by wireless
communications and physical intrusions into areas holding nuclear
material are already mitigated via secure communications that are not
linked to the outside and multiple layers of physical security systems.
While there has been a great deal of publicity surrounding the Y-12
break-in of 2012, the truth is that the three people involved never got
near any nuclear material or technology.

Without state-level resourcing in the billions of dollars, [the
technical sophistication required to pursue a Stuxnet-like attack
against nuclear weapons is]{.underline} most likely [beyond the
capability of **even the most gifted group of hackers**]{.underline}.
For all intents, [this **excludes terrorist organizations** and **cyber
criminals** from the field of threats]{.underline} and restricts it to
those nations that already possess nuclear weapons. [Nuclear-weapon
states]{.underline}, however, [have the full-spectrum cyber threat
capability]{.underline} referenced in the Defense Science Board report
[and would most likely be influenced by an understanding of the elements
of classic nuclear deterrence strategy]{.underline}. In the case of
first strike, [no cyber weapon could be expected to perform at a rate
higher than any conventional anti-nuclear capability]{.underline} (i.e.,
not 100 percent effective). [Therefore, an adversary's nuclear threat
would be **perceived to endure**, thereby **negating** and
**dissuading** the effort to use and employ a cyber weapon against an
adversary's nuclear force]{.underline}. Additionally, just as missile
defense systems have been historically controversial due to perceived
destabilizing effects, it is reasonable to conclude that these
nuclear-weapon states would view the attempt to deploy a cyber
capability against their nuclear stockpiles from a similar perspective.

Finally, [the very existence of nuclear weapons is often enough to
**alter the risk analysis** of an adversary]{.underline}. With virtually
no chance of remote or unauthorized detonation (which would be the
desired results of a sabotage event), [the most probable cyber threat to
any nuclear stockpile is that of espionage. Attempted cyber
intrusions]{.underline} at the U.S. National Nuclear Security Agency
(NNSA) and its efforts to bolster cybersecurity initiatives [provide
clear evidence that this is already underway. However, theft of design
information or even more robust intelligence on the location of stored
nuclear weapons **cannot eliminate the potential destruction** that even
a handful of nuclear weapons can bring]{.underline} to an adversary.
[Knowledge alone, particularly the imperfect knowledge that cyber
espionage is likely to offer, is **incapable of drastically altering an
adversary's risk calculus**.]{.underline} In fact, [**quite the opposite
is true.** An adversary with greater understanding of the nuclear
capabilities of a rival is forced to consider courses of action to
**prevent escalation**]{.underline}, potentially [**increasing the
credibility** of a state's nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

Despite the growing sophistication in cyber capabilities and the
willingness to use them for espionage or in concert with kinetic attack,
the strategic value of nuclear weapons has not been diminished. [The
**insulated architecture** combined with a **robust and redundant
command-and-control system** makes the existence of any viable cyber
threat of exploitation **extremely low**. With the list of capable
adversaries limited by both funding and motivation, it is **highly
unlikely** that any nation will **possess**, or even **attempt to
develop**, a cyber weapon **sufficient to undermine the credibility of
nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. In both psychological and physical
terms, [the threat of the megabyte will never possess the ability to
overshadow the destructive force of the megaton]{.underline}. Although
the employment of cyberspace for military effect has brought new
challenges to the international community, the role of nuclear weapons
and their associated deterrence against open and unconstrained global
aggression are as relevant now as they were in the Cold War.
