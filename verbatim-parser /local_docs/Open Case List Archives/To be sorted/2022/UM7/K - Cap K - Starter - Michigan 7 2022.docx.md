#### NATO is the militarized front for racial capitalism on both a material and ideological level -- psy-ops, imperialism, and weaponization of everything overcodes every move to peace the aff will claim and means their ASSURANCES shore up western imperialism.

The celebration of [NATO's 70 years of existence provides]{.underline}
another [opportunity to unearth the real history of the ideas, practices
and destruction wrought by this military alliance. Even
with]{.underline} the clear [exposure of the cooperation between NATO,
the CIA and the British MI6 to spread terror and psychological
warfare]{.underline} in Europe immediately after the formation of this
military alliance, the [mainstream media, academics and policy makers
remain silent on]{.underline} activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
['false flag' operations that distorted the real causes of
insecurity]{.underline} in the world after 1945. The evidence of the
manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure the continued
survival of NATO has been well documented in the fraudulent
interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the present multiple
wars against the peoples of Iran. Vijay Prashad had [identified NATO as
the prime defender of]{.underline} the Atlantic project. This Atlantic
project, he noted was, "a fairly straightforward campaign by the
[propertied classes]{.underline} to maintain or restore their [position
of dominance]{.underline}." This Atlantic Project was anchored in the
military alliance called NATO with its principal work, that of reversing
the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and justice by the
poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had emerged on the
world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.
[The ostensive reason for **the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital** and]{.underline} after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the
core prop for [Wall Street]{.underline}. In this year, there will be
many commentaries on the fact that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold
War relic, that NATO is obsolete and lost its mandate, but very few will
link the expansion of NATO to the military management of the
international system. Prior to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify
the existence of NATO on ideological and political grounds, but with the
threat of a multi polar world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO
expanded to the point where this author joined with others in labelling
this organization Global NATO to reflect its current imperial mandate.
[The Global thrust of NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and
North America along with 41 'partners' that had started off under the
banner of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council]{.underline} (NACC) in
1991. [Since that time, NATO has launched a lengthy war without end in
Afghanistan, colluded in the destruction of Iraq and conspired with
militarists to forge 'Partnership for Peace']{.underline}
([with]{.underline} most **[members of the former Warsaw Pact
states]{.underline}**). The core 29 members are now enmeshed with
treaties and undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean
Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and
United Arab Emirates. There are also [the 'partners' from across the
globe: Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan]{.underline}. This enlargement
[served the military purposes of encircling China and
Russia]{.underline} who military planners in the West targeted. There is
no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but very [few have
documented the real crimes of this **global network of anticommunist
operatives who precipitated real terror and psychological
warfare**]{.underline} against the citizens of Europe and North America
[while supporting]{.underline} mass [atrocities from Algeria to
Indonesia]{.underline}, and South Africa. Books such as that of NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by
Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and
Their Secret World War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous research
techniques to uncover the dark history of NATO. These two books can be
distinguished from the bland international relations texts that
discusses NATO inside the old calculations of 'strategy,' 'concert of
democracies', 'security cooperation' and the balance of power,' and
spheres of influence. Most recently, this IR rendering of the history of
NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at Seventy: An
Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one of the
coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document spelt out
ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress, Nicolas
Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that the
current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On the
day before the actual 70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to a joint session of the US
Congress advocating an expansion of the alliance while promoting a
military buildup against Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have
to reflect deeply on whether the current sanctions regime and the
special propose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade
Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of inter imperialist
rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the
[shifting alliances yielded confusion among **working peoples who
ultimately went to fight against each other** in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima.]{.underline} The continued struggles for bread, peace and
justice ensure that it is only the authoritarian leaders from the Global
South who are compromised on the real meaning of the existence of NATO.
In the present era, [there is a new capitalist competition
while]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as **an integral part of the Pentagon's
world command structure**.]{.underline} Recent experiences have
demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that [the moguls of Wall
Street are willing to **wage as many wars, to destroy as many countries
and to kill as many people as necessary to achieve the dominance of US
capitalism**. The destruction of Libya was a classic example of the
**convergence of finance as warfare, the weaponization of information
and incessant bombing to destroy a society**.]{.underline} Where at the
start of NATO the war scare was the propaganda method, [In
the]{.underline} current [digital age, **brain hacking and the
engineering of smart phones** have placed]{.underline} the [giant
technology firms]{.underline} of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Facebook [at the forefront of the new weapons platform of NATO and Wall
Street.]{.underline} This analysis is in three parts spelling out the
rationale for the call for all progressive forces to join together to
concentrate their energies in the dismantling of NATO. NATO at Birth:
Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and psychological
warfare against Europeans. In the period after the fall of the Berlin
Wall there were major press reports on the role of NATO's stay behind
armies that had been operating inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten
years earlier, when [the kidnapping and killing of the former Italian
Prime Minister, Aldo Moro]{.underline} rocked western Europe, it emerged
that his demise [had been authored by]{.underline} clandestine
paramilitary network code-named ["Operation Gladio"]{.underline} that
was a false flag operation of NATO. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had
meticulously documented how [NATO funded and often even **directed
terrorist organizations throughout Europe in what was termed a "strategy
of tension" with the aim of preventing a rise of the left** in Western
European politics]{.underline}. NATO's "secret armies" engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. In the specific
case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable crime of
contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged to the
Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, [the **CIA
and MI6 had worked closely with former fascists** to oppose]{.underline}
citizens and [organizations]{.underline} in Western Europe [that were
anti-capitalists]{.underline}. Under the leadership of US planners such
as Allen Dulles, William Colby, Frank Wisner and later James Angleton,
these operatives weaned and nursed a network of agents and secret arms
dumps across Europe, a network that would remain secret but active
throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser elaborated on the extensive
operations of Operation Gladio all across Europe with the explicit aim
of subverting the democratic wishes of European citizens who were
opposed to oppression. It is worth quoting at length the role of the
secret armies. ["NATO's "secret armies"]{.underline} engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. [In
Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind army, working with the
army, [staged a coup d'état and killed Prime Minister]{.underline} Adnan
[Menderes; in Algeria]{.underline} in 1961, the French stay-behind army
[staged a coup]{.underline} with the CIA against the French government
of Algiers, [which ultimately failed;]{.underline} in 1967, [the Greek
stay-behind army staged a coup and imposed a military
dictatorship]{.underline}; in 1971 in [Turkey]{.underline}, [after a
military coup]{.underline}, the stay-behind army [engaged in "domestic
terror" and killed hundreds]{.underline}; in 1977 [in Spain, the stay
behind army carried out a massacre in Madrid]{.underline}; in 1980 in
Turkey, the head of the stay behind army staged a coup [and]{.underline}
took power; in 1985 [in Belgium, the stay behind attacked and shot
shoppers randomly in supermarkets]{.underline}, killing 28; in
Switzerland in 1990, the former head of the Swiss stay behind wrote the
US Defense Department he would reveal "the whole truth," and was found
the next day stabbed to death with his own bayonet; and in 1995, England
revealed that the MI6 and SAS helped set up stay behind armies across
Western Europe."\[5\] The mainstream media and University commentaries
have not been able to confront this history in so far as the
manipulation and deception that gave rise to the birth of NATO is still
at work against the citizens of Europe and the United States. War Scare,
NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe and North
America. [At the end of World War II, the defense Industries in the USA
had been faced with the choice of conversion and retooling]{.underline}
the [factories that made weapons or continue]{.underline} the [massive
subsidies for]{.underline} the [industries vested in
military]{.underline} and armaments [production. The choice
was]{.underline} eventually made to [embark on]{.underline} [**a
propaganda war scare to justify the need for an expanded army** and it
was in this context when NATO was conceived. To sustain the WW II
armaments enterprise, there needed to be **a cycle of war scare and the
fabrication and inflation of threats and enemies**.]{.underline} It was
in this context that Lawrence D. Bell, President of Bell Aircraft
Corporation, in a statement to [the U.S. Air Policy
Commission]{.underline} Finletter Commission) on September 29, 1947,
[stated that "**as soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money
available**."]{.underline} \[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn, "The
aircraft corporations that had garnered enormous profits during the war
on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that peace
was ruinous. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was
proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of
wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by
the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never
lived up to expectations, while efforts to diversify into other
products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved
disappointing and costly." \[7\] [In]{.underline} the spring of [1948,
the U.S. Secretary of Defense]{.underline} James Forrestal and top
officials of the Harry Truman administration [began to sound alarm about
a looming Soviet attack against Western Europe. It is]{.underline} now
[known]{.underline}, [from declassified documents, that the **officials
were aware that there was no credible evidence**]{.underline} to back up
their war scare. Some analysts have argued that the war scare of 1948
was devised to save the aircraft manufacturing industry from plunging
into bankruptcy. And this goal was achieved. In the book Harry S. Truman
and the War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states thatwithin 2 months of
the emergence of the scare, the Trumanadministration revamped the
aircraft industry by embarking on a 57% increase in purchase of military
aircraft, and the total budget of the Pentagon was increased by 30%.
[NATO was born]{.underline} on April 4, 1949 [out of this propaganda war
to deceive the US citizens about a pending attack of the Soviet
Union]{.underline} on Western Europe. [The task of organizing the
deception]{.underline} of the citizens of the West [was assigned to the
C]{.underline}entral [I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency.
There are now so many books and articles on the role of the CIA in
deception, propaganda and psychological warfare that we will not spend a
great deal of time on the role of the Covert agencies in giving
legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David
Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively how the Dulles
brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in this deception.
\[8\] It was especially chilling how **[Universities were suborned to be
surrogates for this psychological warfare]{.underline}**. Noam Chomsky
has dealt with this aspect of the period of the birth of NATO in the
work on the Universities and the Cold War.\[9\] Racists and
anticommunists in the propaganda war It was not by accident that [the
thinkers and **planners of these secret operations were known racists
and Nazi sympathizers**.]{.underline} Frank Wisner who hailed from
Mississippi in the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who
was an architect of the false flag operations and the deception
associated with NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War,
in 1948 Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special
Projects. Soon afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this
Office of Special Projects was renamed [the]{.underline} Office of
Policy Coordination (OPC). This became the [espionage and
counter-intelligence branch of the C]{.underline}entral
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency. Later James Jesus
Angleton was to take this brand of counter intelligence work to the
highest levels of state assassinations. Wisner [had been
mandated]{.underline} told [to create]{.underline} an organization that
concentrated on ["propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct
action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation
measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to
underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist
elements in threatened countries of the free world."]{.underline} It was
from this opaque sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination where
the brainwashing and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era was
refined. Evan Thomas reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early
Days of the CIA, the OPC's charter gave it responsibility for
"propaganda, economic warfare; preventative direct action, including
sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion
against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance
groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened
countries of the free world." NATO as the principal prop for
international capitalism today. In the celebratory events to memorialize
the founding of NATO in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when the
North American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the founding
members were colonial overlords. [**Colonialism and imperialism took a
new form** under the leadership of US capitalists defending the dollar
and Wall Street.]{.underline} At that historical moment in 1949, [the
justification]{.underline} for starting this organization
[was]{.underline} that it constituted [a system of **collective
defense**]{.underline} whereby its member states agreed to mutual
defense in response to an attack by any external party. The external
party in question at that time was the USSR; insofar as NATO had been
formed as an alliance ostensibly to defend Western Europe against
'communist expansion'. In the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new
Allies agreed "an armed attack against one or more of them... shall be
considered an attack against them all." **[The US military and
industrial leaders studied the terror and propaganda tactics of the
Nazis]{.underline}** in order [to learn the lessons of how to develop an
efficient military machine.]{.underline} James Whitman in the book,
Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race
Law, outlined what the fascists had learnt from the eugenics movement in
the United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist scientists from
Germany had found a place in the US academy, [the top planners of the
Cold War **linked the US primacy to the global history of racism to the
efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of conservative
Germany**.]{.underline} One of the unspoken aspects of the first years
of NATO was the question of containing the possible revolutionary
impulses of the German working peoples. To forestall such a possibility,
[the thinkers and planners of NATO collaborated with the former fascists
to learn their skills.]{.underline} The details of this alliance have
been spelt out in the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The
Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's
Secret Government. [The **merging of fascist ideas with the ideas of Jim
Crow** in the United States were refined in]{.underline} the secret
operation called, [Operation Paperclip]{.underline}. Anne Jacobsen,
Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring Nazi
Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the secret
program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely
carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC),
in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians,
such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from
Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily between
1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders,
of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a military
program that has brought us the weaponization of space. [The **creators
of NATO simultaneously mobilized the colonial and fascist elements** in
Belgium, Spain, Italy and France]{.underline}. Of the twelve [founding
members]{.underline}, six [were]{.underline} [outright colonial powers
and]{.underline} at [that]{.underline} moment, countries such as France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Portugal **[looked to the USA to
support their plunder of colonial societies]{.underline}**. In the
specific case of France, [in order **to assist French colonialism,
Algeria was named as a territory of NATO**.]{.underline} Sixty years
later when the President of France, Macron, apologized for the crimes of
killing more than one million Algerians, there is no reflection inside
western academic institutions on this role of NATO in Africa. Currently,
the French have been the most aggressive in promoting the fiction that
the defense radius of Europe stretches 4000 kilometers out from
Brussels, up to the arctic, well across the Russian frontier and down
into central Africa. It is not widely known that, initially, the
[Portuguese fascists were some of the principal beneficiaries of the
membership of NATO, with major **deployment of nuclear weapons in the
Azores as reward for the NATO support for colonialism** in Angola,
Mozambique, Guinea and other Portuguese outposts of colonial
domination.]{.underline} Prior to the formation of NATO in 1949, the
1947 document of [the State Department]{.underline} on Cooperative
Development of Africa had [stipulated that **colonialism would assist
the recovery of European capitalism**.]{.underline} \[12\]The State
Department had been explicit in outlining how cheap foodstuffs and raw
materials from Africa would assist Europe's recovery and create the
basis for unity and economic regeneration. [The USA set about creating a
number of international institutions to guarantee the survival of Europe
and of capitalism, the IMF]{.underline}, IBRD ([World
Bank]{.underline}), the [NATO]{.underline}, GATT, to [guarantee the
strength of the USA in international trade and finance]{.underline}. By
the time NATO was formed in 1949, the US planners had already made their
plans with Britain and France to extend their military control over
Africa. France was bequeathed the task of maintaining order in western
Africa while the British sought to maintain naval power incorporating
the British facilities from the Suez Canal down through Aden (Yemen), to
Mombasa (Kenya), Simons town [South Africa]{.underline} across to
Malaysia. \[13\] The racist [apartheid regime]{.underline} had
[persuaded NATO that it was necessary to integrate the South African
military into the western defense planning in order to protect the 'Cape
route.']{.underline} After the Suez crises of 1956 and the 1967 war this
alliance with the racist regime deepened. [Throughout its existence
**NATO assisted in the refinement of the racial status hierarchy in
which whites are dominant and people of color are
subordinate**.]{.underline} \[14\] [This **incorporation of racist ideas
into western defense** continued a **long tradition that shaped the
outlook of NATO** and reinforced the outlook of Frantz
Fanon]{.underline}: "Colonialism is violence in its natural state."
France and Britain excelled in this violence with the Belgians cementing
their communications and logistics coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba
and later support the killing of the Secretary General of the United
Nation, Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\] Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal
deepened their links to NATO but in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the
planned offensive of the British and the French in the Suez war. After
this war, both the currencies of Britain and France suffered sharp
declines with France seeking cover inside the European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC), while the British pound accepted its place as a prop
to the US dollar in the global economy. Within a year after the Suez
debacle, France had pushed for the Treaty of Rome that paved the way for
the European Economic Community to be a competitive force with US
capitalists. Within the context of the competition between European
capitalists and US capitalists, Charles De Gaulle exhibited pique at the
organization of NATO that supported the armaments culture of US capital.
Charles De Gaulle partially pulled France out of this alliance in 1966
after it became clear that this military organization was dominated by
the United States and Britain (supporting their military industries). De
Gaulle argued for an independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a
signatory to North Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North
Atlantic Council. Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned
to the fold of the NATO military structures in 2009. The duplicitous
actions on the part of the French leadership were always based on
calculations meant to preserve the dominance of French capital in
Africa. When the US devalued the dollar in 1971 and broke the agreements
of the Bretton Woods Treaty, it was the French who complained about the
Exorbitant Privilege of the Dollar. For a short period, both the
President of France and the Chancellor of West Germany had chafed under
the privilege and had worked hard to bring into being the Maastricht
Treaty and the Europe Union to end the dominance of the dollar in the
international capitalist system. It was known than the one necessary
aspect of this emerging common currency in Europe would be the
dismantling of the military occupation of Europe by US military
personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and Helmut Schmidt had linked
the common currency, the European Central Bank and common foreign and
security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that ultimately Europe will
break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the face of this threat and
the fall of the centrally planned economy that the forward planners
expanded NATO. Emergence of Global NATO and the myth of 'humanitarian
intervention' [Usually, when an alliance is formed for a specific
purpose such as halting the spread of communism, that alliance is folded
when the mission is complete.]{.underline} Hence, after the fall of the
Soviet Union in 1991, it was expected by those seeking the 'peace
dividend' that the mission of NATO would be scaled down. [Instead, NATO
expanded, seeking to encircle Russia by extending its membership to
include former members of the Warsaw Pact countries.]{.underline}
Progressive scholars have documented the cynicism of the **[US military
planners who orchestrated the 'humanitarian intervention' in the Balkans
in order to advance the hegemony of US capitalism]{.underline}** [after
the fall of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} The scholarship on this
manipulation of the European working peoples to entrench NATO is rich
and needs to be revisited at this moment of the celebration of the
70thanniversary of the founding of NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book,
The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence'
brought out evidence to expose how the massacres in the Balkans, helped
give a new impetus to US hegemony.' \[16\] David Gibbs had argued, "How
the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy." It is worth
quoting at length how the Balkans war was used to manipulate public
opinion in Europe, "Perhaps most importantly, the massacre helped give a
new impetus to US hegemony, contributing to its post-Cold War
legitimacy. In bolstering America's hegemonic position, the significance
of [the Srebrenica massacre]{.underline} cannot be overstated: The
massacre [helped trigger a NATO bombing campaign that is]{.underline}
widely [credited with ending the Bosnian war]{.underline}, along with
the associated atrocities, and this campaign gave NATO a new purpose for
the post-Soviet era. Since that time, the Srebrenica precedent has been
continuously invoked as a justification for military force. [The
**perceived need to prevent massacres and oppression helped justify
later interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya**, as well
as the ongoing fight against ISIS.]{.underline} The recent UN doctrine
of Responsibility to Protect, which contains a strongly interventionist
tone, was inspired in part by the memory of Srebrenica." \[17\] The more
nefarious aspect of this manipulation of humanitarianism was the ways in
which elements such as Bernard Kouchner used their credentials as former
members of the left and progressive forces to give cover to US
imperialism. Since the war in the Balkans it is now accepted by the
military planners that humanitarian intervention acts as a force
multiplier. \[18\] This position was explicitly stated by General Colin
Powell who noted, "Just as surely as our diplomats and military,
American NGOs are out there serving and sacrificing on the front lines
of freedom NGOs are such a force multiplier for us, such an important
part of our combat team." These observations can shed light on the
relationship between NGOs such as Doctors without Borders and the
International Rescue Committee in global militarism. The fiction of
collective western security was effectively broken while [after the
Asian economic crisis, US capital mobilized NATO to defend Wall
Street.]{.underline} In this defense of Wall Street, [**NATO incessantly
bombed Kosovo for 79 days** in 1999 as it gave itself a new mission to
enlarge US military power right up to the doorstep of
Moscow.]{.underline} Gingerly, NATO expanded under US President Bill
Clinton from 12 members to 16, then to 19, then to 26 by 2004 and by
2009 to 28 members. Despite vocal opposition from Russia, [the
discussion of expanding NATO now proceeded to develop the idea of Global
NATO]{.underline}. In 2019 there were 29 members of NATO. In his
presentation before the US Congress Stoltenberg advocated for a further
expansion of NATO and boasted of the high state of readiness of the NATO
Response Force (NRF) which had been created in 2002. NATO and the
Weaponization of finance **[Global NATO was the preeminent force to
orchestrate the weaponization of everything.]{.underline}** Michael
Hudson has [outlined]{.underline} finance as warfare and [the
weaponization of finance in the current phase of
imperialism.]{.underline} It will be important to grasp the present
sanctions regime of the USA as a form of warfare. In the current
literature on imperialism, the term weaponization of finance refers to
the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital
markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive
diplomacy. The [multiple wars agains Iran represent a model example of
the **weaponization of finance, the weaponization of information and the
weaponization of trade**.]{.underline} Under the Presidency of Barack
Obama,Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, noted that the weaponization of
finance offers to the US "a new battlefield...one that enables \[the
US\] to go after those who wish \[the US\] harm without putting \[US\]
troops in harm's way or using lethal force." Instead of fighting
countries militarily, the US can now "cripple them financially. The
Obama administration had retreated from a full scale weaponization of
finance with Iran by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA ) with Iran in 2015. Under the terms of this agreement in Vienna
on 14 July 2015 between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council---China, France, Russia, United
Kingdom, United States---plus Germany),\[a\] and the European Union, it
was agreed that Iran would accept the P5+1 would ensure that Iran did
not develop nuclear weapons. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel had opposed
this agreement. When Donald Tromp became President of the United States,
his administration renounced the JCPOA in 2018 and then signed an
executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that
continues to do business with Iran. The order gave companies 90-day or
180-day grace periods to extract themselves from existing Iranian
contacts or face punitive US measures. Those NATO partners of the USA
who signed the JCPOA refused to accept the sanctions imposed on Iran and
in 2019 agreed to create a special purpose vehicle to manage their trade
with Iran. Britain, Germany and France rolled out INSTEX in February
2019 as one way to break the weaponization of Finance by the USA but in
the cat and mouse game of economic warfare, the Foreign Ministers of
Europe have not yet been transparent on the full mandate of the special
purpose vehicle. These developments mirror the weaponization of trade
\[19\] and finance within NATO and the problems of inter imperialist
rivalry in West Asia. The threats against the countries that created a
special purpose vehicle (SPV) to help facilitate trade with Iran must be
taken very seriously, especially in the context of the political
insecurity generated by BREXIT. This period reminds the world that of
the depression when trade wars and currency wars eventually fueled open
fighting in World War II. Finance as warfare [Since the global financial
crisis of 2008-2009, there have been efforts by countries holding US
debt to limit their exposure to the dollar. In 2009, the Russians and
the Chinese worked to establish]{.underline} an alternative
international institution involving Brazil, Russia, India and China,
later including South Africa and called [BRICS]{.underline}. Within the
context of BRICS, the Chinese set about a slow process to
internationalize its currency, the RMB and undertook currency swaps to
avoid the US dollar. After failing to negotiate successfully within the
Bretton Woods institution for an increase of its drawing rights
commensurate with its volume of international trade, the Chinese
embarked on major economic and financial ventures under the banner of
One Belt One Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. When the
AIIB was launched in 2015 with 57 countries, the former Treasury
Secretary of the US, Lawrence Summers noted that the launch of the AIIB
was a turning point and 'the creation of the AIIB will undermine the
leadership role the U.S. has long enjoyed in global finance.' Both
Russia and China intensified their swap trading efforts and Russia
settled its crude sales to China. "In March 2018 news broke that Beijing
is planning a pilot project for the second half of the year to pay for
imported crude oil with renminbi instead of dollars. The two countries
allegedly selected for the pilot are Russia and Angola, with rumors that
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may become involved. If this
venture is successful, it will act as a spur to similar schemes for
other imports and primary products." China was joining the leaders of
Europe and the countries in Asia and West Asia who were calling for a
multi-currency financial system. Many progressive economists noted that
it was not a matter if more countries would flee the dollar, but when.
One economist writing from Singapore wrote, "the emergence of a
multicurrency or multi-asset international payments system will take
time. It doesn't portend a collapse of the global payments system, but
does point to a redistribution of global wealth. The seigniorage
harvested by the US as the world's banker will gradually fall, narrowing
the room for maneuver in US economic policy, which for the last 70 years
has had the greatest influence on markets globally. As the power of the
dollar wanes, the US will be pressured to adjust to a world economy
vastly changed since 1945." \[20\] The German financial leaders along
with France were maneuvering to speed this change with the establishment
of the special purpose vehicle to continue trading with Iran. At this
time of writing the specific details of the specific purpose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) is still
being worked out, but the statements of former Ambassador Nicholas Burns
before Congress on March 26 made it clear that the Foreign Policy
establishment in the USA will not retreat from the weaponization of
Finance, especially since INSTEX allows members of NATO to continue
trading and financial arrangements with Iran, China and Russia. In so
far as Global NATO is serving the task of defending the dollar, the
extent to which China has created an alternative clearing system in the
Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) will be seen as another
blow to US financial hegemony. Although in its first rollout of the CIPS
system, the Chinese went to great length that it would cooperate with
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
system, the current US intelligence war against the Chinese telecom firm
Huawei point to the integration between Finance, information warfare and
cyberwarfare. \[21\] In the book, The Perfect Weapon, David Sanger
discussed the debates within this highest levels of US intelligence and
the Federal Reserve of whether the USA should use its Federal Reserve
and cyber warfare to backdoor into the Russian Central Bank to make
money disappear. It is in this context where one can note in the
planning of NATO strengthening the cyber capabilities is at the top of
the Agenda. The Harvard study emphasized the importance of winning the
Technology Battle in the Digital Age. [The convergence of cyberwarfare,
economic warfare and information warfare is being taken to new levels
under the current administration with its wide ranging sanctions against
countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.]{.underline}
Traditional books on NATO had surveyed the integration of diplomacy,
sanctions and weapons procurement, but [the new push of the USA in
formulating its position of unrivalled dominance is turning out to be
another front for defending the dollar. In a world where the USA had
imposed sanctions on Cuba, Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Turkey, North
Korea, Syria, Sudan along with individual sanctions against individuals
in Somalia, South Sudan, Libya, Ukraine and Zimbabwe, the logic of these
sanctions]{.underline} enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) of the US Treasury has [now clarified to]{.underline} the allies
of the USA in [NATO the importance finance was warfare.]{.underline} It
was the former Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, who had warned that the
over use of sanctions could dull their effectiveness. His logic was
simple: Sanctions work because they cut targets off from dealing with
U.S. citizens and American financial institutions---a complete severance
from the world's largest economy and its most important financial
center. If Washington used this power idly, Lew suggested, it could
encourage countries to find partners outside of the United States, and
undermine sanctions' deterrent effect. [What Lew did not acknowledge was
**the relationship between the Treasury, Global NATO and the financial
wars**.]{.underline} Much of the scholarship on the printing of dollars
miss the way in which the infusion of capital in emerging economies
further enmesh these societies into the instability of the system.
Ultimately, the export of the oscillation of the US economy deepens
social and political challenges on the world and reinforces the
militarization of the international political economy. Michael Hudson
outlined three ways in which flooding of dollars through debt leverage
and QE supported the military: (1) the surplus dollars pouring into the
rest of the world for yet further financial speculation and corporate
takeovers; (2) the fact that central banks are obliged to recycle these
dollar inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the federal U.S.
budget deficit; and most important (but most suppressed in the U.S.
media, (3) the military character of the U.S. payments deficit and the
domestic federal budget deficit. He continued, "Strange as it may seem
and irrational as it would be in a more logical system of world
diplomacy the "dollar glut" is what finances America's global military
build-up. It forces foreign central banks to bear the costs of America's
expanding military empire effective "taxation without representation."
Keeping international reserves in "dollars" means recycling their dollar
inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills U.S. government debt issued largely
to finance the military." After the financial crisis in Europe,
Quantitative Easing was extended to the Eurozone and Japan, but in the
continuing re alignment, of global capitalism, US capital is working
hard to decapitate Russia and China as opponents of Global NATO. [The
currency wars and weaponization of finance is now accompanied by the
weaponization of trade and the weaponization of
information.]{.underline} Sanger's The Perfect Weapon War, Sabotage, and
Fear in the Cyber Agehas opened one window into how [**full spectrum
dominance** and the militarization of space is now linked to the
**weaponization of information and cognitive hacking**. We now have new
terms of warfare, terms such as "fake news", "disinformation,"
"weaponized information," "post-truth" and "alternative
facts."]{.underline} Weaponized information (WI) [defines a new method
messaging and dissemination of content that contains falsehoods, facts
taken out of context and pieces of truth strategically released, in an
attempt **to manipulate knowledge and beliefs**.]{.underline} The NATO
destruction of Libya was one clear example of how falsehoods were
refined to lull workers in Europe to support the destruction of Libya
The weaponization of Finance and the Destruction of Libya [Not enough is
being done to expose the real role of Global NATO and the role of so
called humanitarian operatives in ensuring that humanitarian
interventions become a force multiplier.]{.underline} Currently, many
countries of the EU collaborate with France in the North African region
in the fabrication of terror to ensure the deployment of the US Africa
Command and French forces in Africa. [In Western Europe, NATO has been
very successful in ensuring confusion, demoralization,]{.underline}
paralysis, [and apathy in relation to western imperialism in
Africa.]{.underline} African scholars and progressives are very clear
that while calling for the dismantling of NATO there must be a call for
the EURO to break from the CFA franc zone. Nicolas Sarkozy was very
clear that the intervention in Libya was to save the Euro. Africans
cannot have a Newtonian view of the struggle against imperialism to
assure those from the European left who want solidarity with Africans
while supporting French imperialism in Africa. Global NATO and French
machinations are involved in a delicate dance and there is silence from
the left in the EU when it comes to Europe's 4000 km strategic radius
that covers the entire area of West Africa, North Africa and down
through East Africa to Somalia. It is beyond this commentary to
delineate the ways in which German scholars, religious organizations,
German foundations and non-governmental organizations are now implicated
in the criminal acts of France in Africa, especially the war on terror.
It is the task of the progressive movement to penetrate the areas of
cooperation and conflict between European capitalists and Wall Street so
that European workers do not continue to complicity support
'humanitarian interventions.' [When 200 African scholars wrote the open
letter on the impending crime against the peoples of Libya, there has
been and continue to be **silence on the part of the left in Europe and
the United States**.]{.underline} Barack Obama had described the
intervention in Libya as a mistake and the British Parliamentary
Committee outlined how the Libyan intervention had been based on lies.
Obama may have considered the intervention a mistake, but his
understanding of the process did not reveal how Goldman Sachs was
thoroughly implicated the destruction of Libya. The case in the London
High Court of the Libyan Investment Authority vs Goldman Sachs brought
out revealing evidence of how [firms such as Goldman Sachs and others
involved in the financialization of the energy markets sought to
mobilize the resources of oil rich states]{.underline} with Sovereign
Wealth Funds [to keep alive the]{.underline} private equity, hedge funds
and structured derivatives [markets of the global capitalist
economy.]{.underline} Most societies and peoples in the world want these
banks to be brought under control. But Goldman Sachs benefitted in the
ruling because in 2014, two and a half years after the case was brought
before the High Court, there was a war in Libya and there was no
government therefore one could not represent the Libyan Investment
Authority in this arena. We see therefore that the financial
institutions are direct beneficiaries of the warfare that is going on in
Libya. When the United Nations passed Resolution 1970 and resolution
1973 in 2011, those who had signed these resolutions did not understand
then that the resolution was for regime in Libya.\[22\] The current
fighting in Libya remains one of the most inglorious aspects of the 70
year history of NATO but there is silence among those celebrating 70
years of NATO. \[23\] [Since the writings on Finance capital over a
century ago by]{.underline} Rudolph Hilferding, Vladimir
[Lenin,]{.underline} Rosa [Luxemburg, and]{.underline} Nikolai [Bukharin
the role of finance in the international system has grown beyond the
parameters outlined by those who linked finance capital to modern
imperialism]{.underline}.\[24\] After the collapse of the dollar/gold
system of 1944 **[the financial industry of the West has become the axis
on which international capitalism spins]{.underline}**.

[Capitalism is best understood as a]{.underline} [**competitive

**[exploitation]{.underline}** [of workers' labor power and the private
appropriation of **surplus value**]{.underline} (value generated beyond

[designates as a value-generating good or service **anything** that

market**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[excluded]{.underline}** [in
this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative "externalities,"
unrelated to the capitalist economy]{.underline} itself---whether in
terms of the shortening and degradation of human life or the destruction
of the natural environment. As environmental economist K. William Kapp
stated, "capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs."42

[We have now reached a point]{.underline} in the twenty-first century
[in which the]{.underline} **[externalities]{.underline}** [of
this]{.underline} [**irrational system**, such as the costs

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing, and that party organizing can allow this
emerging movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that [the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. A century of anticommunist propaganda has been
extremely effective in convincing even the most oppressed and
marginalized that communism has nothing to offer them. [The base
building emphasis on dual power responds directly to this insight. By
building institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to
concretely demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief
from the horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building
strategy recognizes that actually doing the work to serve the people
does infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular support than
electing democratic socialist candidates or holding endless political
education classes can ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that
we have something to offer the oppressed. The question, of course,
remains: once we have built a base of popular support, what do we do
next? [If it turns out that establishing socialist institutions to meet
people's needs does in fact create sympathy towards the cause of
communism, how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply: **[in
order to mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we need
to have already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.underline}** [It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs.
Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in the name of
communism.]{.underline} [We must refuse covert front organizing and
instead have a public face as a communist party.]{.underline} When we
build tenants unions, serve the people programs, and other dual power
projects, we must make it clear that we are organizing as communists,
unified around a party, and are not content simply with establishing
endless dual power organizations. [We must be clear that our strategy is
revolutionary and in order to make this clear we must adopt party
organizing. By "party organizing" I mean an organizational strategy
which adopts the party model. Such organizing focuses on building a
party whose membership is formally unified around a party line
determined by democratic centralist decision making.]{.underline} [The
party model creates internal methods for **holding party members
accountable**, unifying party member action around democratically
determined goals, and for educating party members in communist theory
and praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization utilizing the party
model works to build dual power institutions while simultaneously
educating the communities they hope to serve. [Organizations which adopt
the party model focus on propagandizing around the need for
revolutionary socialism. They function as the forefront of political
organizing, empowering local communities to theorize their liberation
through communist theory while organizing communities to literally fight
for their liberation.]{.underline} A party is not simply a group of
individuals doing work together, but is a formal organization unified in
its fight against capitalism. Party organizing has much to offer the
base building movement. By working in a unified party, base builders can
ensure that local struggles are tied to and informed by a unified
national and international strategy. While the most horrific
manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique form at the
local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is against a
material base which functions not only at the national but at the
international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[party organizing allows for
local organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for
their actions.]{.underline}** [It allows criticism to function not as
one independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather
as comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to
sharpen each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [accountability is crucial.]{.underline} [As a
movement which operates within a settler colonial society, imperialist
and colonial ideal frequently infect leftist organizing. Creating formal
unity and party procedure for dealing with and correcting these ideas
allows us to address these consistent problems within American socialist
organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies the various
dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also allows for
base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into
the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The party model
creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in
a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with
newer organizers. It also allows community members who have been served
by dual power projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming
party members and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy. It ensures that there are formal processes for educating
communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act
and organize in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must
recognize that the current state of the base building movement precludes
the possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [individual
base building organizations ought to adopt party models for their local
organizing. Local organizations ought to be building dual power
alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of community
members in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment of armed
and **militant party cadres** capable of defending dual power
institutions from state terror.]{.underline} Dual power institutions
must be unified openly and transparently around these organizations in
order for them to operate as more than "red charities." Serving the
people means meeting their material needs while also educating and
propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The
party model remains the most useful method for achieving these
ends.]{.underline} The use of the party model by local organizations
allows base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to
mobilize their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not
simply towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an
end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we will see future unification
of the various local base building organizations into a national
party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we must push for party
organizing at the local level. If local organizations adopt party
organizing, [it ought to become clear that]{.underline} **[a unified
national party will have to be the long term goal of the base building
movement.]{.underline}** Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. [I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have demonstrated
the need for party organizing in order to ensure that the base building
tendency maintains a revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer
details of revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are
not a good subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party
organizing offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will
succeed. My goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward
but to open a conversation about how the base building movement will
organize as it transitions from a loose network of individual
organizations into a unified socialist tendency. These discussions and
debates will be crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement
can succeed.

#### NATO is the militarized front for racial capitalism on both a material and ideological level -- psy-ops, imperialism, and weaponization of everything overcodes every move to peace the aff will claim and means their ASSURANCES shore up western imperialism.

The celebration of [NATO's 70 years of existence provides]{.underline}
another [opportunity to unearth the real history of the ideas, practices
and destruction wrought by this military alliance. Even
with]{.underline} the clear [exposure of the cooperation between NATO,
the CIA and the British MI6 to spread terror and psychological
warfare]{.underline} in Europe immediately after the formation of this
military alliance, the [mainstream media, academics and policy makers
remain silent on]{.underline} activities of the 'stay behind armies' and
['false flag' operations that distorted the real causes of
insecurity]{.underline} in the world after 1945. The evidence of the
manipulations of the peoples of the world to ensure the continued
survival of NATO has been well documented in the fraudulent
interventions and bombings in the Balkans right up the present multiple
wars against the peoples of Iran. Vijay Prashad had [identified NATO as
the prime defender of]{.underline} the Atlantic project. This Atlantic
project, he noted was, "a fairly straightforward campaign by the
[propertied classes]{.underline} to maintain or restore their [position
of dominance]{.underline}." This Atlantic Project was anchored in the
military alliance called NATO with its principal work, that of reversing
the South Project; the struggles for peace bread and justice by the
poorer citizens of the planet, especially those who had emerged on the
world stage after the decolonization of Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.
[The ostensive reason for **the founding of NATO was to 'thwart' Soviet
aggression, but in practice the organization was a prop for western
capital** and]{.underline} after the fall of the Berlin Wall, became the
core prop for [Wall Street]{.underline}. In this year, there will be
many commentaries on the fact that the existence of NATO reflects a Cold
War relic, that NATO is obsolete and lost its mandate, but very few will
link the expansion of NATO to the military management of the
international system. Prior to 1991, the planners of NATO could justify
the existence of NATO on ideological and political grounds, but with the
threat of a multi polar world and the diminution of the dollar, NATO
expanded to the point where this author joined with others in labelling
this organization Global NATO to reflect its current imperial mandate.
[The Global thrust of NATO now comprises 29 members from Europe and
North America along with 41 'partners' that had started off under the
banner of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council]{.underline} (NACC) in
1991. [Since that time, NATO has launched a lengthy war without end in
Afghanistan, colluded in the destruction of Iraq and conspired with
militarists to forge 'Partnership for Peace']{.underline}
([with]{.underline} most **[members of the former Warsaw Pact
states]{.underline}**). The core 29 members are now enmeshed with
treaties and undertakings from states involved in the Mediterranean
Dialog and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative: Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and
United Arab Emirates. There are also [the 'partners' from across the
globe: Afghanistan, Australia, Colombia, Iraq, Japan, Republic of Korea,
Mongolia, New Zealand and Pakistan]{.underline}. This enlargement
[served the military purposes of encircling China and
Russia]{.underline} who military planners in the West targeted. There is
no shortage of literature on NATO and its milestones, but very [few have
documented the real crimes of this **global network of anticommunist
operatives who precipitated real terror and psychological
warfare**]{.underline} against the citizens of Europe and North America
[while supporting]{.underline} mass [atrocities from Algeria to
Indonesia]{.underline}, and South Africa. Books such as that of NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe by
Danielle Ganser and The Brothers: John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles, and
Their Secret World War, by Stephen Kinzer used rigorous research
techniques to uncover the dark history of NATO. These two books can be
distinguished from the bland international relations texts that
discusses NATO inside the old calculations of 'strategy,' 'concert of
democracies', 'security cooperation' and the balance of power,' and
spheres of influence. Most recently, this IR rendering of the history of
NATO has been served up in a document entitled, NATO at Seventy: An
Alliance in Crisis. Published by Harvard University with one of the
coauthors being a former US ambassador to NATO. This document spelt out
ten challenges.\[1\] However, in a testimony before Congress, Nicolas
Burns boiled down the challenge of NATO to one objective; that the
current role of NATO must be to contain Russia and China.\[2\] On the
day before the actual 70thanniversary, on April 3, the Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg delivered an address to a joint session of the US
Congress advocating an expansion of the alliance while promoting a
military buildup against Russia. \[3\] European progressives will have
to reflect deeply on whether the current sanctions regime and the
special propose vehicle called the Instrument in Support of Trade
Exchanges (INSTEX), is ushering in another round of inter imperialist
rivalry reminiscent of the currency wars of 1929-1939. Then, the
[shifting alliances yielded confusion among **working peoples who
ultimately went to fight against each other** in Europe, spreading
barbarism throughout the world, from Auschwitz to
Hiroshima.]{.underline} The continued struggles for bread, peace and
justice ensure that it is only the authoritarian leaders from the Global
South who are compromised on the real meaning of the existence of NATO.
In the present era, [there is a new capitalist competition
while]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) [serves as **an integral part of the Pentagon's
world command structure**.]{.underline} Recent experiences have
demonstrated in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya that [the moguls of Wall
Street are willing to **wage as many wars, to destroy as many countries
and to kill as many people as necessary to achieve the dominance of US
capitalism**. The destruction of Libya was a classic example of the
**convergence of finance as warfare, the weaponization of information
and incessant bombing to destroy a society**.]{.underline} Where at the
start of NATO the war scare was the propaganda method, [In
the]{.underline} current [digital age, **brain hacking and the
engineering of smart phones** have placed]{.underline} the [giant
technology firms]{.underline} of Apple , Google, Amazon, Microsoft,
Facebook [at the forefront of the new weapons platform of NATO and Wall
Street.]{.underline} This analysis is in three parts spelling out the
rationale for the call for all progressive forces to join together to
concentrate their energies in the dismantling of NATO. NATO at Birth:
Stay behind armies, directed terrorist organizations and psychological
warfare against Europeans. In the period after the fall of the Berlin
Wall there were major press reports on the role of NATO's stay behind
armies that had been operating inside Western Europe since 1949.Ten
years earlier, when [the kidnapping and killing of the former Italian
Prime Minister, Aldo Moro]{.underline} rocked western Europe, it emerged
that his demise [had been authored by]{.underline} clandestine
paramilitary network code-named ["Operation Gladio"]{.underline} that
was a false flag operation of NATO. Danielle Ganser's book, NATO's
Secret Armies: Operation GLADIO and Terrorism in Western Europe had
meticulously documented how [NATO funded and often even **directed
terrorist organizations throughout Europe in what was termed a "strategy
of tension" with the aim of preventing a rise of the left** in Western
European politics]{.underline}. NATO's "secret armies" engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. In the specific
case of Italy, Aldo Moro had committed the unforgivable crime of
contemplating a government that included Italians who belonged to the
Italian Communist Party Right from the start of the Cold war, [the **CIA
and MI6 had worked closely with former fascists** to oppose]{.underline}
citizens and [organizations]{.underline} in Western Europe [that were
anti-capitalists]{.underline}. Under the leadership of US planners such
as Allen Dulles, William Colby, Frank Wisner and later James Angleton,
these operatives weaned and nursed a network of agents and secret arms
dumps across Europe, a network that would remain secret but active
throughout the Cold War. \[4\] Ganser elaborated on the extensive
operations of Operation Gladio all across Europe with the explicit aim
of subverting the democratic wishes of European citizens who were
opposed to oppression. It is worth quoting at length the role of the
secret armies. ["NATO's "secret armies"]{.underline} engaged in
subversive and criminal activities in several countries. [In
Turkey]{.underline} in 1960, the stay behind army, working with the
army, [staged a coup d'état and killed Prime Minister]{.underline} Adnan
[Menderes; in Algeria]{.underline} in 1961, the French stay-behind army
[staged a coup]{.underline} with the CIA against the French government
of Algiers, [which ultimately failed;]{.underline} in 1967, [the Greek
stay-behind army staged a coup and imposed a military
dictatorship]{.underline}; in 1971 in [Turkey]{.underline}, [after a
military coup]{.underline}, the stay-behind army [engaged in "domestic
terror" and killed hundreds]{.underline}; in 1977 [in Spain, the stay
behind army carried out a massacre in Madrid]{.underline}; in 1980 in
Turkey, the head of the stay behind army staged a coup [and]{.underline}
took power; in 1985 [in Belgium, the stay behind attacked and shot
shoppers randomly in supermarkets]{.underline}, killing 28; in
Switzerland in 1990, the former head of the Swiss stay behind wrote the
US Defense Department he would reveal "the whole truth," and was found
the next day stabbed to death with his own bayonet; and in 1995, England
revealed that the MI6 and SAS helped set up stay behind armies across
Western Europe."\[5\] The mainstream media and University commentaries
have not been able to confront this history in so far as the
manipulation and deception that gave rise to the birth of NATO is still
at work against the citizens of Europe and the United States. War Scare,
NATO and psychological warfare against the citizens of Europe and North
America. [At the end of World War II, the defense Industries in the USA
had been faced with the choice of conversion and retooling]{.underline}
the [factories that made weapons or continue]{.underline} the [massive
subsidies for]{.underline} the [industries vested in
military]{.underline} and armaments [production. The choice
was]{.underline} eventually made to [embark on]{.underline} [**a
propaganda war scare to justify the need for an expanded army** and it
was in this context when NATO was conceived. To sustain the WW II
armaments enterprise, there needed to be **a cycle of war scare and the
fabrication and inflation of threats and enemies**.]{.underline} It was
in this context that Lawrence D. Bell, President of Bell Aircraft
Corporation, in a statement to [the U.S. Air Policy
Commission]{.underline} Finletter Commission) on September 29, 1947,
[stated that "**as soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money
available**."]{.underline} \[6\] According to Andrew Cockburn, "The
aircraft corporations that had garnered enormous profits during the war
on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that peace
was ruinous. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was
proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of
wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by
the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never
lived up to expectations, while efforts to diversify into other
products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved
disappointing and costly." \[7\] [In]{.underline} the spring of [1948,
the U.S. Secretary of Defense]{.underline} James Forrestal and top
officials of the Harry Truman administration [began to sound alarm about
a looming Soviet attack against Western Europe. It is]{.underline} now
[known]{.underline}, [from declassified documents, that the **officials
were aware that there was no credible evidence**]{.underline} to back up
their war scare. Some analysts have argued that the war scare of 1948
was devised to save the aircraft manufacturing industry from plunging
into bankruptcy. And this goal was achieved. In the book Harry S. Truman
and the War Scare of 1948, Frank Kofsky states thatwithin 2 months of
the emergence of the scare, the Trumanadministration revamped the
aircraft industry by embarking on a 57% increase in purchase of military
aircraft, and the total budget of the Pentagon was increased by 30%.
[NATO was born]{.underline} on April 4, 1949 [out of this propaganda war
to deceive the US citizens about a pending attack of the Soviet
Union]{.underline} on Western Europe. [The task of organizing the
deception]{.underline} of the citizens of the West [was assigned to the
C]{.underline}entral [I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency.
There are now so many books and articles on the role of the CIA in
deception, propaganda and psychological warfare that we will not spend a
great deal of time on the role of the Covert agencies in giving
legitimacy to the idea of a Soviet threat. Stephen Kinzer and David
Talbot are two writers who have documented extensively how the Dulles
brothers ensnared every major profession in the USA in this deception.
\[8\] It was especially chilling how **[Universities were suborned to be
surrogates for this psychological warfare]{.underline}**. Noam Chomsky
has dealt with this aspect of the period of the birth of NATO in the
work on the Universities and the Cold War.\[9\] Racists and
anticommunists in the propaganda war It was not by accident that [the
thinkers and **planners of these secret operations were known racists
and Nazi sympathizers**.]{.underline} Frank Wisner who hailed from
Mississippi in the USA was a good example of the upright US citizen who
was an architect of the false flag operations and the deception
associated with NATO and western intelligence agencies. After the War,
in 1948 Frank Wisner was appointed director of the Office of Special
Projects. Soon afterwards under the direction of Allen Dulles, this
Office of Special Projects was renamed [the]{.underline} Office of
Policy Coordination (OPC). This became the [espionage and
counter-intelligence branch of the C]{.underline}entral
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [A]{.underline}gency. Later James Jesus
Angleton was to take this brand of counter intelligence work to the
highest levels of state assassinations. Wisner [had been
mandated]{.underline} told [to create]{.underline} an organization that
concentrated on ["propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct
action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation
measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to
underground resistance groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist
elements in threatened countries of the free world."]{.underline} It was
from this opaque sounding name of Office of Policy Coordination where
the brainwashing and virulent anti-communism of the Cold War era was
refined. Evan Thomas reported in The Very Best Men: the Daring Early
Days of the CIA, the OPC's charter gave it responsibility for
"propaganda, economic warfare; preventative direct action, including
sabotage, antisabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion
against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance
groups, and support of indigenous anti-Communist elements in threatened
countries of the free world." NATO as the principal prop for
international capitalism today. In the celebratory events to memorialize
the founding of NATO in 1949, it is usually forgotten that when the
North American Treaty was signed in April 1949 most of the founding
members were colonial overlords. [**Colonialism and imperialism took a
new form** under the leadership of US capitalists defending the dollar
and Wall Street.]{.underline} At that historical moment in 1949, [the
justification]{.underline} for starting this organization
[was]{.underline} that it constituted [a system of **collective
defense**]{.underline} whereby its member states agreed to mutual
defense in response to an attack by any external party. The external
party in question at that time was the USSR; insofar as NATO had been
formed as an alliance ostensibly to defend Western Europe against
'communist expansion'. In the Treaty's renowned Article 5, the new
Allies agreed "an armed attack against one or more of them... shall be
considered an attack against them all." **[The US military and
industrial leaders studied the terror and propaganda tactics of the
Nazis]{.underline}** in order [to learn the lessons of how to develop an
efficient military machine.]{.underline} James Whitman in the book,
Hitler's American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race
Law, outlined what the fascists had learnt from the eugenics movement in
the United States.\[10\] Although many anti-fascist scientists from
Germany had found a place in the US academy, [the top planners of the
Cold War **linked the US primacy to the global history of racism to the
efficient, bureaucratic and professionalism of conservative
Germany**.]{.underline} One of the unspoken aspects of the first years
of NATO was the question of containing the possible revolutionary
impulses of the German working peoples. To forestall such a possibility,
[the thinkers and planners of NATO collaborated with the former fascists
to learn their skills.]{.underline} The details of this alliance have
been spelt out in the book on the CIA by David Talbot in the book, The
Devil's Chessboard: Allen Dulles, the CIA, and the Rise of America's
Secret Government. [The **merging of fascist ideas with the ideas of Jim
Crow** in the United States were refined in]{.underline} the secret
operation called, [Operation Paperclip]{.underline}. Anne Jacobsen,
Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program to Bring Nazi
Scientists to America, \[11\] elaborated in great detail the secret
program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency (JIOA) largely
carried out by Special Agents of Army Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC),
in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians,
such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were taken from
Germany to America for U.S. government employment, primarily between
1945 and 1959. Many were former members, and some were former leaders,
of the Nazi Party. These elements were the foundation of a military
program that has brought us the weaponization of space. [The **creators
of NATO simultaneously mobilized the colonial and fascist elements** in
Belgium, Spain, Italy and France]{.underline}. Of the twelve [founding
members]{.underline}, six [were]{.underline} [outright colonial powers
and]{.underline} at [that]{.underline} moment, countries such as France,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and Portugal **[looked to the USA to
support their plunder of colonial societies]{.underline}**. In the
specific case of France, [in order **to assist French colonialism,
Algeria was named as a territory of NATO**.]{.underline} Sixty years
later when the President of France, Macron, apologized for the crimes of
killing more than one million Algerians, there is no reflection inside
western academic institutions on this role of NATO in Africa. Currently,
the French have been the most aggressive in promoting the fiction that
the defense radius of Europe stretches 4000 kilometers out from
Brussels, up to the arctic, well across the Russian frontier and down
into central Africa. It is not widely known that, initially, the
[Portuguese fascists were some of the principal beneficiaries of the
membership of NATO, with major **deployment of nuclear weapons in the
Azores as reward for the NATO support for colonialism** in Angola,
Mozambique, Guinea and other Portuguese outposts of colonial
domination.]{.underline} Prior to the formation of NATO in 1949, the
1947 document of [the State Department]{.underline} on Cooperative
Development of Africa had [stipulated that **colonialism would assist
the recovery of European capitalism**.]{.underline} \[12\]The State
Department had been explicit in outlining how cheap foodstuffs and raw
materials from Africa would assist Europe's recovery and create the
basis for unity and economic regeneration. [The USA set about creating a
number of international institutions to guarantee the survival of Europe
and of capitalism, the IMF]{.underline}, IBRD ([World
Bank]{.underline}), the [NATO]{.underline}, GATT, to [guarantee the
strength of the USA in international trade and finance]{.underline}. By
the time NATO was formed in 1949, the US planners had already made their
plans with Britain and France to extend their military control over
Africa. France was bequeathed the task of maintaining order in western
Africa while the British sought to maintain naval power incorporating
the British facilities from the Suez Canal down through Aden (Yemen), to
Mombasa (Kenya), Simons town [South Africa]{.underline} across to
Malaysia. \[13\] The racist [apartheid regime]{.underline} had
[persuaded NATO that it was necessary to integrate the South African
military into the western defense planning in order to protect the 'Cape
route.']{.underline} After the Suez crises of 1956 and the 1967 war this
alliance with the racist regime deepened. [Throughout its existence
**NATO assisted in the refinement of the racial status hierarchy in
which whites are dominant and people of color are
subordinate**.]{.underline} \[14\] [This **incorporation of racist ideas
into western defense** continued a **long tradition that shaped the
outlook of NATO** and reinforced the outlook of Frantz
Fanon]{.underline}: "Colonialism is violence in its natural state."
France and Britain excelled in this violence with the Belgians cementing
their communications and logistics coordination to kill Patrice Lumumba
and later support the killing of the Secretary General of the United
Nation, Dag Hammarskjold. \[15\] Britain, France, Belgium and Portugal
deepened their links to NATO but in 1956, Dwight Eisenhower halted the
planned offensive of the British and the French in the Suez war. After
this war, both the currencies of Britain and France suffered sharp
declines with France seeking cover inside the European Coal and Steel
Community (ECSC), while the British pound accepted its place as a prop
to the US dollar in the global economy. Within a year after the Suez
debacle, France had pushed for the Treaty of Rome that paved the way for
the European Economic Community to be a competitive force with US
capitalists. Within the context of the competition between European
capitalists and US capitalists, Charles De Gaulle exhibited pique at the
organization of NATO that supported the armaments culture of US capital.
Charles De Gaulle partially pulled France out of this alliance in 1966
after it became clear that this military organization was dominated by
the United States and Britain (supporting their military industries). De
Gaulle argued for an independent nuclear arsenal while remaining a
signatory to North Atlantic Treaty and participating in the North
Atlantic Council. Nicholas Sarkozy ended the farce when France returned
to the fold of the NATO military structures in 2009. The duplicitous
actions on the part of the French leadership were always based on
calculations meant to preserve the dominance of French capital in
Africa. When the US devalued the dollar in 1971 and broke the agreements
of the Bretton Woods Treaty, it was the French who complained about the
Exorbitant Privilege of the Dollar. For a short period, both the
President of France and the Chancellor of West Germany had chafed under
the privilege and had worked hard to bring into being the Maastricht
Treaty and the Europe Union to end the dominance of the dollar in the
international capitalist system. It was known than the one necessary
aspect of this emerging common currency in Europe would be the
dismantling of the military occupation of Europe by US military
personnel. Hence, both Giscard de Estaing and Helmut Schmidt had linked
the common currency, the European Central Bank and common foreign and
security policy (CFSP), with the expectation that ultimately Europe will
break from the traditions of NATO. It was in the face of this threat and
the fall of the centrally planned economy that the forward planners
expanded NATO. Emergence of Global NATO and the myth of 'humanitarian
intervention' [Usually, when an alliance is formed for a specific
purpose such as halting the spread of communism, that alliance is folded
when the mission is complete.]{.underline} Hence, after the fall of the
Soviet Union in 1991, it was expected by those seeking the 'peace
dividend' that the mission of NATO would be scaled down. [Instead, NATO
expanded, seeking to encircle Russia by extending its membership to
include former members of the Warsaw Pact countries.]{.underline}
Progressive scholars have documented the cynicism of the **[US military
planners who orchestrated the 'humanitarian intervention' in the Balkans
in order to advance the hegemony of US capitalism]{.underline}** [after
the fall of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} The scholarship on this
manipulation of the European working peoples to entrench NATO is rich
and needs to be revisited at this moment of the celebration of the
70thanniversary of the founding of NATO. Richard Aldrich in the book,
The Hidden Hand: Britain, America and Cold War Secret Intelligence'
brought out evidence to expose how the massacres in the Balkans, helped
give a new impetus to US hegemony.' \[16\] David Gibbs had argued, "How
the Srebrenica Massacre Redefined US Foreign Policy." It is worth
quoting at length how the Balkans war was used to manipulate public
opinion in Europe, "Perhaps most importantly, the massacre helped give a
new impetus to US hegemony, contributing to its post-Cold War
legitimacy. In bolstering America's hegemonic position, the significance
of [the Srebrenica massacre]{.underline} cannot be overstated: The
massacre [helped trigger a NATO bombing campaign that is]{.underline}
widely [credited with ending the Bosnian war]{.underline}, along with
the associated atrocities, and this campaign gave NATO a new purpose for
the post-Soviet era. Since that time, the Srebrenica precedent has been
continuously invoked as a justification for military force. [The
**perceived need to prevent massacres and oppression helped justify
later interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya**, as well
as the ongoing fight against ISIS.]{.underline} The recent UN doctrine
of Responsibility to Protect, which contains a strongly interventionist
tone, was inspired in part by the memory of Srebrenica." \[17\] The more
nefarious aspect of this manipulation of humanitarianism was the ways in
which elements such as Bernard Kouchner used their credentials as former
members of the left and progressive forces to give cover to US
imperialism. Since the war in the Balkans it is now accepted by the
military planners that humanitarian intervention acts as a force
multiplier. \[18\] This position was explicitly stated by General Colin
Powell who noted, "Just as surely as our diplomats and military,
American NGOs are out there serving and sacrificing on the front lines
of freedom NGOs are such a force multiplier for us, such an important
part of our combat team." These observations can shed light on the
relationship between NGOs such as Doctors without Borders and the
International Rescue Committee in global militarism. The fiction of
collective western security was effectively broken while [after the
Asian economic crisis, US capital mobilized NATO to defend Wall
Street.]{.underline} In this defense of Wall Street, [**NATO incessantly
bombed Kosovo for 79 days** in 1999 as it gave itself a new mission to
enlarge US military power right up to the doorstep of
Moscow.]{.underline} Gingerly, NATO expanded under US President Bill
Clinton from 12 members to 16, then to 19, then to 26 by 2004 and by
2009 to 28 members. Despite vocal opposition from Russia, [the
discussion of expanding NATO now proceeded to develop the idea of Global
NATO]{.underline}. In 2019 there were 29 members of NATO. In his
presentation before the US Congress Stoltenberg advocated for a further
expansion of NATO and boasted of the high state of readiness of the NATO
Response Force (NRF) which had been created in 2002. NATO and the
Weaponization of finance **[Global NATO was the preeminent force to
orchestrate the weaponization of everything.]{.underline}** Michael
Hudson has [outlined]{.underline} finance as warfare and [the
weaponization of finance in the current phase of
imperialism.]{.underline} It will be important to grasp the present
sanctions regime of the USA as a form of warfare. In the current
literature on imperialism, the term weaponization of finance refers to
the foreign policy strategy of using incentives (access to capital
markets) and penalties (varied types of sanctions) as tools of coercive
diplomacy. The [multiple wars agains Iran represent a model example of
the **weaponization of finance, the weaponization of information and the
weaponization of trade**.]{.underline} Under the Presidency of Barack
Obama,Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, noted that the weaponization of
finance offers to the US "a new battlefield...one that enables \[the
US\] to go after those who wish \[the US\] harm without putting \[US\]
troops in harm's way or using lethal force." Instead of fighting
countries militarily, the US can now "cripple them financially. The
Obama administration had retreated from a full scale weaponization of
finance with Iran by signing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action
(JCPOA ) with Iran in 2015. Under the terms of this agreement in Vienna
on 14 July 2015 between Iran, the P5+1 (the five permanent members of
the United Nations Security Council---China, France, Russia, United
Kingdom, United States---plus Germany),\[a\] and the European Union, it
was agreed that Iran would accept the P5+1 would ensure that Iran did
not develop nuclear weapons. Both Saudi Arabia and Israel had opposed
this agreement. When Donald Tromp became President of the United States,
his administration renounced the JCPOA in 2018 and then signed an
executive order reimposing sanctions on any foreign company that
continues to do business with Iran. The order gave companies 90-day or
180-day grace periods to extract themselves from existing Iranian
contacts or face punitive US measures. Those NATO partners of the USA
who signed the JCPOA refused to accept the sanctions imposed on Iran and
in 2019 agreed to create a special purpose vehicle to manage their trade
with Iran. Britain, Germany and France rolled out INSTEX in February
2019 as one way to break the weaponization of Finance by the USA but in
the cat and mouse game of economic warfare, the Foreign Ministers of
Europe have not yet been transparent on the full mandate of the special
purpose vehicle. These developments mirror the weaponization of trade
\[19\] and finance within NATO and the problems of inter imperialist
rivalry in West Asia. The threats against the countries that created a
special purpose vehicle (SPV) to help facilitate trade with Iran must be
taken very seriously, especially in the context of the political
insecurity generated by BREXIT. This period reminds the world that of
the depression when trade wars and currency wars eventually fueled open
fighting in World War II. Finance as warfare [Since the global financial
crisis of 2008-2009, there have been efforts by countries holding US
debt to limit their exposure to the dollar. In 2009, the Russians and
the Chinese worked to establish]{.underline} an alternative
international institution involving Brazil, Russia, India and China,
later including South Africa and called [BRICS]{.underline}. Within the
context of BRICS, the Chinese set about a slow process to
internationalize its currency, the RMB and undertook currency swaps to
avoid the US dollar. After failing to negotiate successfully within the
Bretton Woods institution for an increase of its drawing rights
commensurate with its volume of international trade, the Chinese
embarked on major economic and financial ventures under the banner of
One Belt One Road and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. When the
AIIB was launched in 2015 with 57 countries, the former Treasury
Secretary of the US, Lawrence Summers noted that the launch of the AIIB
was a turning point and 'the creation of the AIIB will undermine the
leadership role the U.S. has long enjoyed in global finance.' Both
Russia and China intensified their swap trading efforts and Russia
settled its crude sales to China. "In March 2018 news broke that Beijing
is planning a pilot project for the second half of the year to pay for
imported crude oil with renminbi instead of dollars. The two countries
allegedly selected for the pilot are Russia and Angola, with rumors that
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates may become involved. If this
venture is successful, it will act as a spur to similar schemes for
other imports and primary products." China was joining the leaders of
Europe and the countries in Asia and West Asia who were calling for a
multi-currency financial system. Many progressive economists noted that
it was not a matter if more countries would flee the dollar, but when.
One economist writing from Singapore wrote, "the emergence of a
multicurrency or multi-asset international payments system will take
time. It doesn't portend a collapse of the global payments system, but
does point to a redistribution of global wealth. The seigniorage
harvested by the US as the world's banker will gradually fall, narrowing
the room for maneuver in US economic policy, which for the last 70 years
has had the greatest influence on markets globally. As the power of the
dollar wanes, the US will be pressured to adjust to a world economy
vastly changed since 1945." \[20\] The German financial leaders along
with France were maneuvering to speed this change with the establishment
of the special purpose vehicle to continue trading with Iran. At this
time of writing the specific details of the specific purpose vehicle
called the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) is still
being worked out, but the statements of former Ambassador Nicholas Burns
before Congress on March 26 made it clear that the Foreign Policy
establishment in the USA will not retreat from the weaponization of
Finance, especially since INSTEX allows members of NATO to continue
trading and financial arrangements with Iran, China and Russia. In so
far as Global NATO is serving the task of defending the dollar, the
extent to which China has created an alternative clearing system in the
Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) will be seen as another
blow to US financial hegemony. Although in its first rollout of the CIPS
system, the Chinese went to great length that it would cooperate with
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
system, the current US intelligence war against the Chinese telecom firm
Huawei point to the integration between Finance, information warfare and
cyberwarfare. \[21\] In the book, The Perfect Weapon, David Sanger
discussed the debates within this highest levels of US intelligence and
the Federal Reserve of whether the USA should use its Federal Reserve
and cyber warfare to backdoor into the Russian Central Bank to make
money disappear. It is in this context where one can note in the
planning of NATO strengthening the cyber capabilities is at the top of
the Agenda. The Harvard study emphasized the importance of winning the
Technology Battle in the Digital Age. [The convergence of cyberwarfare,
economic warfare and information warfare is being taken to new levels
under the current administration with its wide ranging sanctions against
countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean.]{.underline}
Traditional books on NATO had surveyed the integration of diplomacy,
sanctions and weapons procurement, but [the new push of the USA in
formulating its position of unrivalled dominance is turning out to be
another front for defending the dollar. In a world where the USA had
imposed sanctions on Cuba, Russia, China, Iran, Venezuela, Turkey, North
Korea, Syria, Sudan along with individual sanctions against individuals
in Somalia, South Sudan, Libya, Ukraine and Zimbabwe, the logic of these
sanctions]{.underline} enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control
(OFAC) of the US Treasury has [now clarified to]{.underline} the allies
of the USA in [NATO the importance finance was warfare.]{.underline} It
was the former Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew, who had warned that the
over use of sanctions could dull their effectiveness. His logic was
simple: Sanctions work because they cut targets off from dealing with
U.S. citizens and American financial institutions---a complete severance
from the world's largest economy and its most important financial
center. If Washington used this power idly, Lew suggested, it could
encourage countries to find partners outside of the United States, and
undermine sanctions' deterrent effect. [What Lew did not acknowledge was
**the relationship between the Treasury, Global NATO and the financial
wars**.]{.underline} Much of the scholarship on the printing of dollars
miss the way in which the infusion of capital in emerging economies
further enmesh these societies into the instability of the system.
Ultimately, the export of the oscillation of the US economy deepens
social and political challenges on the world and reinforces the
militarization of the international political economy. Michael Hudson
outlined three ways in which flooding of dollars through debt leverage
and QE supported the military: (1) the surplus dollars pouring into the
rest of the world for yet further financial speculation and corporate
takeovers; (2) the fact that central banks are obliged to recycle these
dollar inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bonds to finance the federal U.S.
budget deficit; and most important (but most suppressed in the U.S.
media, (3) the military character of the U.S. payments deficit and the
domestic federal budget deficit. He continued, "Strange as it may seem
and irrational as it would be in a more logical system of world
diplomacy the "dollar glut" is what finances America's global military
build-up. It forces foreign central banks to bear the costs of America's
expanding military empire effective "taxation without representation."
Keeping international reserves in "dollars" means recycling their dollar
inflows to buy U.S. Treasury bills U.S. government debt issued largely
to finance the military." After the financial crisis in Europe,
Quantitative Easing was extended to the Eurozone and Japan, but in the
continuing re alignment, of global capitalism, US capital is working
hard to decapitate Russia and China as opponents of Global NATO. [The
currency wars and weaponization of finance is now accompanied by the
weaponization of trade and the weaponization of
information.]{.underline} Sanger's The Perfect Weapon War, Sabotage, and
Fear in the Cyber Agehas opened one window into how [**full spectrum
dominance** and the militarization of space is now linked to the
**weaponization of information and cognitive hacking**. We now have new
terms of warfare, terms such as "fake news", "disinformation,"
"weaponized information," "post-truth" and "alternative
facts."]{.underline} Weaponized information (WI) [defines a new method
messaging and dissemination of content that contains falsehoods, facts
taken out of context and pieces of truth strategically released, in an
attempt **to manipulate knowledge and beliefs**.]{.underline} The NATO
destruction of Libya was one clear example of how falsehoods were
refined to lull workers in Europe to support the destruction of Libya
The weaponization of Finance and the Destruction of Libya [Not enough is
being done to expose the real role of Global NATO and the role of so
called humanitarian operatives in ensuring that humanitarian
interventions become a force multiplier.]{.underline} Currently, many
countries of the EU collaborate with France in the North African region
in the fabrication of terror to ensure the deployment of the US Africa
Command and French forces in Africa. [In Western Europe, NATO has been
very successful in ensuring confusion, demoralization,]{.underline}
paralysis, [and apathy in relation to western imperialism in
Africa.]{.underline} African scholars and progressives are very clear
that while calling for the dismantling of NATO there must be a call for
the EURO to break from the CFA franc zone. Nicolas Sarkozy was very
clear that the intervention in Libya was to save the Euro. Africans
cannot have a Newtonian view of the struggle against imperialism to
assure those from the European left who want solidarity with Africans
while supporting French imperialism in Africa. Global NATO and French
machinations are involved in a delicate dance and there is silence from
the left in the EU when it comes to Europe's 4000 km strategic radius
that covers the entire area of West Africa, North Africa and down
through East Africa to Somalia. It is beyond this commentary to
delineate the ways in which German scholars, religious organizations,
German foundations and non-governmental organizations are now implicated
in the criminal acts of France in Africa, especially the war on terror.
It is the task of the progressive movement to penetrate the areas of
cooperation and conflict between European capitalists and Wall Street so
that European workers do not continue to complicity support
'humanitarian interventions.' [When 200 African scholars wrote the open
letter on the impending crime against the peoples of Libya, there has
been and continue to be **silence on the part of the left in Europe and
the United States**.]{.underline} Barack Obama had described the
intervention in Libya as a mistake and the British Parliamentary
Committee outlined how the Libyan intervention had been based on lies.
Obama may have considered the intervention a mistake, but his
understanding of the process did not reveal how Goldman Sachs was
thoroughly implicated the destruction of Libya. The case in the London
High Court of the Libyan Investment Authority vs Goldman Sachs brought
out revealing evidence of how [firms such as Goldman Sachs and others
involved in the financialization of the energy markets sought to
mobilize the resources of oil rich states]{.underline} with Sovereign
Wealth Funds [to keep alive the]{.underline} private equity, hedge funds
and structured derivatives [markets of the global capitalist
economy.]{.underline} Most societies and peoples in the world want these
banks to be brought under control. But Goldman Sachs benefitted in the
ruling because in 2014, two and a half years after the case was brought
before the High Court, there was a war in Libya and there was no
government therefore one could not represent the Libyan Investment
Authority in this arena. We see therefore that the financial
institutions are direct beneficiaries of the warfare that is going on in
Libya. When the United Nations passed Resolution 1970 and resolution
1973 in 2011, those who had signed these resolutions did not understand
then that the resolution was for regime in Libya.\[22\] The current
fighting in Libya remains one of the most inglorious aspects of the 70
year history of NATO but there is silence among those celebrating 70
years of NATO. \[23\] [Since the writings on Finance capital over a

Different authors offer a variety of reasons for the establishment of
NATO. For example, Yves Engler argues that [two of the factors driving
the creation of NATO were 'to blunt the European Left' and '**a desire
to bolster colonial authority and bring the world under a US
geopolitical umbrella**'.]{.underline} See 'On NATO's 70th anniversary
important to remember its anti-democratic roots' and 'Defense of
European empires was original NATO goal'. [But]{.underline} few would
disagree with Professor Jan Oberg's brief statement on the origin of
NATO: ['Its raison d'etre... had always and unambiguously been the very
existence of the Soviet Union... and its socialist/communist
ideology.']{.underline} See 'NATO at 70: An unlawful organisation with
serious psychological problems'. In other words, [NATO was established
as one response to the deep fear the United States government harbored
in relation to the Soviet Union which, despite western propaganda to the
contrary and at staggering cost to its population and industrial
infrastructure, had led the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War
II.]{.underline} As Professor Michel Chossudovsky elaborates this point:
[The NATO 'alliance' of 29 member states (with Israel also a de facto
member), most with US military bases,]{.underline} US military (and
sometimes [nuclear]{.underline}) [weapons and significant or substantial
deployments of US troops on their territory, was **designed to sustain
'the de facto "military occupation" of Western Europe'** and to confront
the Soviet Union **as the US administration orchestrated the Cold War to
justify its imperial agenda** -- **global domination guaranteed by
massive US military expansion** -- in service of elite interests
(including the profit maximization of the military industrial complex,
its fossil fuel and banking corporations, and its media and information
technology giants). While NATO has the appearance of a multinational
military alliance, **the US controls NATO command structures with the
Pentagon dominating NATO decision-making**. NATO's Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR) and Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic
(SACLANT) are Americans appointed by Washington]{.underline} with the
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg performing merely bureaucratic
functions. In light of the above, Chossudovsky observes: '[**Under the
terms of the military alliance, NATO member states are harnessed into
endorsing Washington's imperial design of World conquest under the
doctrine of collective security**.]{.underline}' [Even
worse,]{.underline} he argues, [given the lies and fabrications that
permeate US-NATO military doctrine, **key decision-makers believe their
own propaganda**. 'Immediately after the Cold War, a new nuclear
doctrine was formulated, focused on the preemptive use of nuclear
weapons, meaning a **nuclear first strike as a means of
self-defense**.']{.underline} [More recently: 'Not only do **they
believe that tactical nuclear weapons are peace-making bombs**, they are
now putting forth the concept of a "Winnable Third World
War".]{.underline} **[Taking out China and Russia is on the drawing
board of the Pentagon]{.underline}**.' See 'NATO-Exit: Dismantle NATO,
Close Down 800 US Military Bases, Prosecute the War Criminals' and 'NATO
Spending Pushes Europe from Welfare to Warfare'. So, [given the ongoing
military threats -- with an expanding range of horrific
weapons]{.underline} ([including]{.underline}, to nominate just two,
'more usable' [low yield nuclear weapons and technologies on 'weather
warfare' offered by the military/nuclear corporate war
planners]{.underline}) that threaten previously unimagined outcomes --
[and interventions by a US-led NATO, with Venezuela and now Iran the
latest countries to be directly threatened]{.underline} -- see
'"Dangerous game": US, Europe and the "betrayal" of Iran' -- [as well as
a gathering consensus among peace activists and scholars of the
importance of stopping NATO]{.underline} (particularly given the many
opportunities, beginning with aborting its origin, that have been missed
already as explained by Professor Peter Kuznick: see '"Obscene"
Bipartisan Applause for NATO in Congress') **[how do we actually stop
NATO?]{.underline}** While several authors, including those with
articles cited above, offer ideas on what should be done about ending
NATO, Chossudovsky offers the most comprehensive list of ideas in this
regard well aware that stopping NATO is intimately connected to the
struggle to end war and globalization. Chossudovsky's ideas range from
organizational suggestions such as integrating anti-war protest with the
campaign against the gamut of neoliberal economic 'reforms' and the
development of a broad based grassroots network independent of NGOs
funded by Wall Street, objectives such as dismantling the propaganda
apparatus which sustains the legitimacy of war and neoliberalism,
challenging the corporate media (including by using alternative media
outlets on the Internet), providing encouragement (including information
about the illegality of their orders) for military personnel to refuse
to fight (perhaps like the GI coffeehouse movement during the US war on
Vietnam: see 'The story of the GI coffeehouses'), working to close down
weapons assembly plants and many other suggestions. See Towards a World
War III Scenario: The Dangers of Nuclear War and 'NATO-Exit: Dismantle
NATO, Close Down 800 US Military Bases, Prosecute the War Criminals'.
Given my own deep interest in this subject of US/NATO wars and in
developing and implementing a strategy that ends their war-making, let
me elaborate Chossudovsky's explanation of NATO's function in the world
today by introducing a book by Professor Peter Phillips. In his book
Giants: The Global Power Elite, Phillips observes that [the power elite
continually worries about rebellion by the 'unruly exploited masses'
against their structure of concentrated wealth. **This is why the US
military empire has long played the role of defender of global
capitalism**. As a result, the United States has more than 800 military
bases]{.underline} (with some scholars suggesting 1,000) [in 70
countries and territories.]{.underline} In comparison, the United
Kingdom, France, and Russia have about 30 foreign bases. In addition,
[US military forces are now deployed in 70 percent of the world's
nations with US]{.underline} Special Operations Command
([SOCOM]{.underline}) [having troops in 147 countries, an increase of 80
percent since 2010. These forces conduct counterterrorism strikes
regularly, including drone assassinations and kill/capture
raids.]{.underline} '**[The US military empire stands on hundreds of
years of colonial exploitation]{.underline}** [and continues to support
repressive, exploitative governments that cooperate with global
capital's imperial agenda. Governments]{.underline} that [accept
external capital investment]{.underline}, whereby a small segment of a
country's elite benefits, do so [knowing that capital inevitably
**requires a return on investment that entails using up resources and
people for economic gain**.]{.underline} [The whole system continues
wealth concentration for elites and expanded wretched inequality for the
masses....]{.underline} '**[Understanding permanent war as an economic
relief valve for surplus capital is a vital part of comprehending
capitalism in the world today]{.underline}**. [War provides investment
opportunity for the]{.underline} Giants and [TCC elites and a guaranteed
return on capital. **War also serves a repressive function of keeping
the suffering masses of humanity afraid and compliant**.]{.underline}'
As Phillips elaborates: [This is why **defense of global capital is the
prime reason that NATO countries now account for 85 percent of the
world's military spending**; the United States spends more on the
military than the rest of the world combined.]{.underline} In essence,
'[the Global Power Elite uses NATO and the US military empire for its
worldwide security. This is part of an expanding strategy of US military
domination around the world, whereby the US/ NATO military
empire]{.underline}, advised by the power elite's Atlantic Council,
[operates **in service to the Transnational Corporate Class for the
protection of international capital everywhere in the
world'**]{.underline}. [In short, **ending NATO requires recognition of
its fundamental role in preserving the US empire**]{.underline} (at the
expense of national sovereignty) [and maintaining geopolitical control
to defend the global elite's capital interests -- reflected in the
capitalist agenda to endlessly expand economic growth -- and
particularly the profits the elite makes by]{.underline} inciting,
supplying and [justifying the massively profitable wars that the US/NATO
conduct on its behalf.]{.underline} So [if you thought that wars were
fought for reasons other than profit (like defense, a 'just cause' or
'humanitarian' motives) you have missed the essential function of
US/NATO wars. And while these wars might be promoted by the corporate
media as conflicts over geostrategic considerations]{.underline} (like
'keeping open the Straits of Hormuz'), [access to resources]{.underline}
('war for oil') [or even markets]{.underline} (so that we can have US
junk-food chains in every country on Earth), [these **explanations are
all merely more palatable versions of the word 'profit'** and are
designed to **obscure the truth.**]{.underline} And this raises another
question worth pondering. Given [that wars are the highly organized
industrial-scale killing of fellow human beings (for profit) as well as
the primary means of expanding the number of fellow human beings who are
drawn into the global capitalist economy to be exploited (for profit)
and the primary method used for destroying Earth's climate and
environment (for profit)]{.underline}, you might wander if those who
conduct wars are sane. Well, as even posing the question suggests, [the
global elite]{.underline} -- which [drives wars, the highly exploitative
capitalist economy and **destruction of the biosphere**]{.underline} --
is quite insane. And there is a brief explanation of this insanity and
how it is caused in the article 'The Global Elite is Insane Revisited'.

compounding this general process of **biodiversity loss**]{.underline}.
Biologists expect that [half of all species will be]{.underline}

[If present climate-change trends continue, the "global carbon

temperature]{.underline}---staying beneath which is the [key to

are]{.underline} simply **[incalculable]{.underline}**.40

Nevertheless, [major energy corporations **continue to lie** about

their]{.underline} **[internal documents]{.underline}**. [These

most greenhouse gas-generating varieties, [reaping enormous
profits]{.underline} in the process. [The melting of the **Arctic

[to be]{.underline} **[exploited without regard]{.underline}** [to the
consequences for the earth's climate.]{.underline} In response to
scientific reports on climate change, Exxon Mobil declared that it
intends to extract and sell all of the fossil-fuel reserves at its
disposal.41 [Energy **corporations** continue to **intervene** in

are putting]{.underline} the **[accumulation of wealth]{.underline}**

very]{.underline} **[future of humanity]{.underline}**.

[Capitalism is best understood as a]{.underline} [**competitive
class-based** mode of production and exchange geared to the
**accumulation of capital**]{.underline} [through the]{.underline}
**[exploitation]{.underline}** [of workers' labor power and the private
appropriation of **surplus value**]{.underline} (value generated beyond
the costs of the workers' own reproduction). [The mode of economic
accounting]{.underline} **[intrinsic to capitalism]{.underline}**
[designates as a value-generating good or service **anything** that
passes through the **market**]{.underline} [and therefore **produces
income**]{.underline}. [It follows that the greater part of the **social
and environmental costs** of production **outside the
market**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[excluded]{.underline}** [in
this form of valuation and are treated as mere negative "externalities,"
unrelated to the capitalist economy]{.underline} itself---whether in
terms of the shortening and degradation of human life or the destruction
of the natural environment. As environmental economist K. William Kapp
stated, "capitalism must be regarded as an economy of unpaid costs."42

[We have now reached a point]{.underline} in the twenty-first century
[in which the]{.underline} **[externalities]{.underline}** [of
this]{.underline} [**irrational system**, such as the costs
of]{.underline} **[war]{.underline}**, [the **depletion** of **natural

**Their cessation of revolutionary institution building

be a question of the [speed,]{.underline} [scope,]{.underline} and
[scale]{.underline} of revolutionary strategy. Only dual power

Approach,\" *Failing That, Invent*,
https://failingthatinvent.home.blog/2019/02/15/communism-and-climate-change-a-dual-power-approach/\]//AD

I have previously argued that a crucial advantage to [**dual power**
**strategy**]{.underline} is that it [gives the masses an infrastructure
of socialist **institutions** which can directly provide for **material
needs** in times of **capitalist crisis.** **Socialist agricultural**
and **food distribution programs** can take ground that the **capitalist
state** cedes by simultaneously meeting the needs of the masses while
proving that socialist **self-management** and **political**
**institutions** can function **independently** of
capitalism]{.underline}. This approach is [not only capable of
**literally saving lives** in]{.underline} the case of [crisis,
but]{.underline} of [demonstrating the **possibility of a revolutionary
project** which seeks to **destroy rather than reform** capitalism. One
of the most pressing]{.underline} of the various [crises]{.underline}
which humanity faces today [is climate change]{.underline}. Capitalist
production has devastated the planet, and everyday we discover that the
small window of time for avoiding its most disastrous effects is shorter
than previously understood. [The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change predicts that we have **12 years** to limit]{.underline}
([not]{.underline} even [prevent]{.underline}) the more
[catastrophic]{.underline} effects of [climate change. The]{.underline}
simple, and [horrific, fact that we all must face is that climate change
has reached a point where many]{.underline} of its [effects are
**inevitable**, and we are]{.underline} now [in a **post-brink
world**]{.underline}, [where damage control is the primary concern.
**The question is not whether we can escape**]{.underline} a future of
[**climate change, but whether we can survive it**. Socialist strategy
must adapt accordingly]{.underline}. In the face of this crisis, the
[democratic socialists]{.underline} and social democrats in the United
States have [largely settled on market]{.underline} based [reforms. The
Green New Deal,]{.underline} championed by Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and
the left wing of the Democratic Party, remains a thoroughly capitalist
solution to a capitalist problem. The proposal [does nothing to
challenge capitalism]{.underline} itself, [but]{.underline} rather
[seeks to subsidize market solutions to reorient]{.underline} the [US
energy infrastructure towards renewable energy]{.underline} production,
to develop less energy consuming transportation, [and]{.underline} the
[development of public investment towards these ends.]{.underline}
**[The plan does nothing to call into question the profit incentives and
endless resource consumption of capitalism which led us to this
point]{.underline}**. Rather, it [seeks to reorient]{.underline} the
[relentless market forces of capitalism towards slightly less
destructive technological developments. While the plan would lead to a
massive investment in the manufacturing and deployment of solar energy
infrastructure]{.underline}, National Geographic reports that,
"[Fabricating \[solar\] panels **requires caustic chemicals** such as
sodium hydroxide and hydrofluoric acid, and **the process uses water as
well as electricity**, the production of which **emits greenhouse
gases**]{.underline}." [Technology alone cannot sufficiently combat this
crisis, as the production]{.underline} of such technology [through
capitalist manufacturing infrastructure **only perpetuates environmental
harm**.]{.underline} Furthermore, [subsidizing and incentivizing
renewable energy stops far short of actually combating the fossil fuel
industry]{.underline} driving the current climate crisis. The
technocratic market solutions offered in the Green New Deal fail to
adequately combat the driving factors of climate change. What is worse,
they rely on a violent imperialist global system in order to produce
their technological solutions. The [development of high-tech energy
infrastructure and]{.underline} the development of [low]{.underline} or
zero [emission transportation requires]{.underline} the import of [raw
material and rare earth minerals which the United States can only access
because of the imperial division of the Global South.]{.underline} This
imperial division of the world [requires constant **militarism**
from]{.underline} the [imperial core nations]{.underline}, and as Lenin
demonstrates in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism,
[facilitates **constant warfare** as imperial states compete for
**spheres of influence** in order to facilitate cheap resource
extraction]{.underline}. [The US military]{.underline}, one of many
imperialist forces, [is the single largest user of
petroleum]{.underline}, and [one of its main functions is to ensure oil
access for the United States.]{.underline} Without challenging this
imperialist division of the world and the role of the United States
military in upholding it, the Green New Deal fails even further to
challenge the underlying causes of climate change. Even with the failed
promises of the Green New Deal itself, it is unlikely that this tepid
market proposal will pass at all. Nancy Pelosi and other lead Democrats
have largely condemned it and consider it "impractical" and
"unfeasible." This dismissal is crucial because it reveals the total
inability of capitalism to resolve this crisis. If the center-left party
in the heart of the imperial core sees even milquetoast capitalist
reforms as a step too far, we ought to have very little hope that a
reformist solution will present itself within the ever shrinking 12 year
time frame. There are times for delicacy and there are times for
bluntness, and we are in the latter. To put things bluntly: the
[capitalists are not going to save us, and **if we don't find a way to
save ourselves, the collapse of human civilization is a real
possibility.**]{.underline} The pressing question we now face is: **[how
are we going to save ourselves?]{.underline}** Revolution and Dual Power
If capitalism will not be able to resolve the current encroaching
climate crisis, [we must find a way to organize outside the confines of
capitalist institutions, towards the end of overthrowing
capitalism]{.underline}. If the Democratic Socialists of America backed
candidates cannot offer real anti-capitalist solutions through the
capitalist state, we should be skeptical of the possibility for any
socialist organization doing so. [The DSA is far larger and]{.underline}
far more [well funded than any]{.underline} of the [other socialist
organizations]{.underline} in the United States, [and]{.underline} they
have [failed to produce anything more revolutionary than the Green New
Deal]{.underline}. [We have to abandon the idea that electoral strategy
will be sufficient to resolve the underlying causes of this crisis
within 12 years.]{.underline} While many radicals call for revolution
instead of reform, the [reformists]{.underline} often [raise the same
response]{.underline}: revolution is well and good, but [what are you
going to do in the mean time?]{.underline} In many ways this question is
fair. The socialist left in the United States today is not ready for
revolutionary action, and a mass base does not exist to back the various
organizations which might undertake such a struggle. Revolutionaries
must concede that [we have much work to be done before a revolutionary
strategy can be enacted.]{.underline} This is a hard truth, but it is
true. Much of [the left has sought to ignore this truth by embracing
adventurism and violent protest theatrics, in the]{.underline} vain
[hope of sparking]{.underline} revolutionary [momentum]{.underline}
which does not currently exist. [If this is the core strategy of the
socialist left, **we will accomplish nothing in the next 12
years**]{.underline}. Such approaches are as useless as the opportunist
reforms pushed by the social democrats. Our task in these 12 years is
not simply to arm ourselves and hope that magically the masses will wake
up prepared for revolution and willing to put their trust in our small
ideological cadres. [We must]{.underline} instead, [build a
movement]{.underline}, and [with]{.underline} it we must build
[infrastructure which can survive revolution and provide a framework for
socialist development]{.underline}. [Dual power is tooled towards this
project best. **The Marxist Center** network has done an impressive
amount of work developing socialist institutions across the
US]{.underline}, largely [through **tenants organizing** and **serve the
people programs**]{.underline}. The [left wing factions within the
DSA]{.underline} itself have also begun to [develop **mutual aid
programs** that could be useful for dual power strategy]{.underline}.
[At the same time, **mutual aid is not enough**. We cannot simply build
these institutions as a reform to make capitalism more
survivable.]{.underline} Rather, [we must make these institutions part
of a **broader revolutionary movement** and]{.underline} [they ought to
function as a material prefiguration to a socialist society and
economy]{.underline}. The institutions we build as [dual power outside
the capitalist state today ought to be structured towards revolutionary
ends, such that they will someday function as the early institutions of
a revolutionary socialist society.]{.underline} To accomplish this goal,
[we cannot simply declare these institutions to be
revolutionary]{.underline}. Rather **[they have to be linked together
through an actual revolutionary movement working towards revolutionary
ends]{.underline}**. [This means that dual power institutions cannot
exist as ends in and of themselves, nor can abstract notions of mutual
aid cannot be conceptualized as an end in itself]{.underline}. [The
explicit purpose of these institutions has to be to **radicalize** the
masses through meeting their needs, and providing an infrastructure for
a socialist movement to meet **the needs of** its members and the
**communities** in which it operates. **Revolutionary institutions**
that **can provide food, housing**, and other needs for a revolutionary
movement will be crucial for **build**ing **a base**]{.underline} among
the masses [and]{.underline} for [constructing]{.underline} the
[beginnings of a socialist infrastructure for when we]{.underline}
eventually [engage in revolutionary struggle.]{.underline}

**Thus the alternative is to affirm [the model of the Communist
Party]{.underline} -- only [democratic centralist dual power
organizing]{.underline} can provide [effective accountability
mechanisms]{.underline} to correct unproductive tendencies, [educate and
mobilize]{.underline} marginalized communities, and [connect local
struggles]{.underline} to a movement for [international
liberation]{.underline}.**

I would argue that within the base building movement, there is a move
towards party organizing, but this trend has not always been explicitly
theorized or forwarded within the movement. My goal in this essay is to
argue that [base building and dual power strategy can be best forwarded
through party organizing, and that party organizing can allow this
emerging movement to solidify into a powerful revolutionary socialist
tendency in the United States.]{.underline} One of the crucial insights
of the base building movement is that [the current state of the left in
the United States is one in which revolution is not currently
possible.]{.underline} There exists very little popular support for
socialist politics. A century of anticommunist propaganda has been
extremely effective in convincing even the most oppressed and
marginalized that communism has nothing to offer them. [The base
building emphasis on dual power responds directly to this insight. By
building institutions which can meet people's needs, we are able to
concretely demonstrate that communists can offer the oppressed relief
from the horrific conditions of capitalism.]{.underline} Base building
strategy recognizes that actually doing the work to serve the people
does infinitely more to create a socialist base of popular support than
electing democratic socialist candidates or holding endless political
education classes can ever hope to do. Dual power is about proving that
we have something to offer the oppressed. The question, of course,
remains: once we have built a base of popular support, what do we do
next? [If it turns out that establishing socialist institutions to meet
people's needs does in fact create sympathy towards the cause of
communism, how can we mobilize that base?]{.underline} Put simply: **[in
order to mobilize the base which base builders hope to create, we need
to have already done the work of building a communist
party.]{.underline}** [It is not enough to simply meet peoples needs.
Rather, we must build the institutions of dual power in the name of
communism.]{.underline} [We must refuse covert front organizing and
instead have a public face as a communist party.]{.underline} When we
build tenants unions, serve the people programs, and other dual power
projects, we must make it clear that we are organizing as communists,
unified around a party, and are not content simply with establishing
endless dual power organizations. [We must be clear that our strategy is
revolutionary and in order to make this clear we must adopt party
organizing. By "party organizing" I mean an organizational strategy
which adopts the party model. Such organizing focuses on building a
party whose membership is formally unified around a party line
determined by democratic centralist decision making.]{.underline} [The
party model creates internal methods for **holding party members
accountable**, unifying party member action around democratically
determined goals, and for educating party members in communist theory
and praxis.]{.underline} A communist organization utilizing the party
model works to build dual power institutions while simultaneously
educating the communities they hope to serve. [Organizations which adopt
the party model focus on propagandizing around the need for
revolutionary socialism. They function as the forefront of political
organizing, empowering local communities to theorize their liberation
through communist theory while organizing communities to literally fight
for their liberation.]{.underline} A party is not simply a group of
individuals doing work together, but is a formal organization unified in
its fight against capitalism. Party organizing has much to offer the
base building movement. By working in a unified party, base builders can
ensure that local struggles are tied to and informed by a unified
national and international strategy. While the most horrific
manifestations of capitalism take on particular and unique form at the
local level, we need to remember that [our struggle is against a
material base which functions not only at the national but at the
international level. The formal structures provided by a democratic
centralist party model allow individual locals to have a voice in open
debate, but also allow for a unified strategy to emerge from democratic
consensus.]{.underline} Furthermore, **[party organizing allows for
local organizations and individual organizers to be held accountable for
their actions.]{.underline}** [It allows criticism to function not as
one independent group criticizing another independent group, but rather
as comrades with a formal organizational unity working together to
sharpen each others strategies and to help correct chauvinist ideas and
actions.]{.underline} In the context of the socialist movement within
the United States, such [accountability is crucial.]{.underline} [As a
movement which operates within a settler colonial society, imperialist
and colonial ideal frequently infect leftist organizing. Creating formal
unity and party procedure for dealing with and correcting these ideas
allows us to address these consistent problems within American socialist
organizing.]{.underline} Having a formal party which unifies the various
dual power projects being undertaken at the local level also allows for
base builders to not simply meet peoples needs, but to pull them into
the membership of the party as organizers themselves. The party model
creates a means for sustained growth to occur by unifying organizers in
a manner that allows for skills, strategies, and ideas to be shared with
newer organizers. It also allows community members who have been served
by dual power projects to take an active role in organizing by becoming
party members and participating in the continued growth of base building
strategy. It ensures that there are formal processes for educating
communities in communist theory and praxis, and also enables them to act
and organize in accordance with their own local conditions. We also must
recognize that the current state of the base building movement precludes
the possibility of such a national unified party in the present moment.
Since base building strategy is being undertaken in a number of already
established organizations, it is not likely that base builders would
abandon these organizations in favor of founding a unified party.
Additionally, it would not be strategic to immediately undertake such
complete unification because it would mean abandoning the organizational
contexts in which concrete gains are already being made and in which
growth is currently occurring. What is important for base builders to
focus on in the current moment is building dual power on a local level
alongside building a national movement. This means aspiring towards the
possibility of a unified party, while pursuing continued local growth.
The movement within the Marxist Center network towards some form of
unification is positive step in the right direction. The independent
party emphasis within the Refoundation caucus should also be recognized
as a positive approach. It is important for base builders to continue to
explore the possibility of unification, and to maintain unification
through a party model as a long term goal. In the meantime, [individual
base building organizations ought to adopt party models for their local
organizing. Local organizations ought to be building dual power
alongside recruitment into their organizations, education of community
members in communist theory and praxis, and the establishment of armed
and **militant party cadres** capable of defending dual power
institutions from state terror.]{.underline} Dual power institutions
must be unified openly and transparently around these organizations in
order for them to operate as more than "red charities." Serving the
people means meeting their material needs while also educating and
propagandizing. It means radicalizing, recruiting, and organizing. [The
party model remains the most useful method for achieving these
ends.]{.underline} The use of the party model by local organizations
allows base builders to gain popular support, and most importantly, to
mobilize their base of popular support towards revolutionary ends, not
simply towards the construction of a parallel economy which exists as an
end in and of itself. [It is my hope that we will see future unification
of the various local base building organizations into a national
party,]{.underline} but in the meantime we must push for party
organizing at the local level. If local organizations adopt party
organizing, [it ought to become clear that]{.underline} **[a unified
national party will have to be the long term goal of the base building
movement.]{.underline}** Many of the already existing organizations
within the base building movement already operate according to these
principles. I do not mean to suggest otherwise. Rather, my hope is to
suggest that we ought to be explicit about the need for party organizing
and emphasize the relationship between dual power and the party model.
Doing so will make it clear that the base building movement is not
pursuing a cooperative economy alongside capitalism, but is pursuing a
revolutionary socialist strategy capable of fighting capitalism. The
long term details of base building and dual power organizing will arise
organically in response to the conditions the movement finds itself
operating within. [I hope that I have put forward a useful contribution
to the discussion about base building organizing, and have demonstrated
the need for party organizing in order to ensure that the base building
tendency maintains a revolutionary orientation.]{.underline} The finer
details of revolutionary strategy will be worked out over time and are
not a good subject for public discussion. I strongly believe party
organizing offers the best path for ensuring that such strategy will
succeed. My goal here is not to dictate the only possible path forward
but to open a conversation about how the base building movement will
organize as it transitions from a loose network of individual
organizations into a unified socialist tendency. These discussions and
debates will be crucial to ensuring that this rapidly growing movement
can succeed.

**\*edited for gendered language**

**[NATO is developing new forms of warfare to wage a "battle for the
brain,"]{.underline}** as the military alliance put it.

**[The US-led NATO military cartel has tested novel modes of hybrid
warfare against its self-declared adversaries, including economic
warfare, cyber warfare, information warfare, and psychological
warfare]{.underline}**.

Now, **[NATO is spinning out an entirely new kind of combat it has
branded cognitive warfare]{.underline}**. **[Described as the
"weaponization of brain sciences," the new method involves "hacking the
individual" by exploiting "the vulnerabilities of the human brain" in
order to implement more sophisticated "social
engineering."]{.underline}**

[Until recently, NATO had divided war into five different operational
domains]{.underline}: air, land, sea, space, and cyber. But with its
development of cognitive warfare strategies, [the military alliance is
discussing a new, sixth level: the "human domain."]{.underline}

A 2020 NATO-sponsored study of this new form of warfare clearly
explained,

While actions taken in the five domains are executed in order to have an
effect on the human domain, cognitive warfare's objective is to make
everyone a weapon.

"**[The brain will be the battlefield of the 21st century," the report
stressed]{.underline}**. "**[Humans are the contested
domain]{.underline}**," **[and]{.underline}** "**[future conflicts will
likely occur amongst the people digitally first and physically
thereafter in proximity to hubs of political and economic
power]{.underline}**."

While the NATO-backed study insisted that much of its research on
cognitive warfare is designed for defensive purposes,
**[it]{.underline}** also **[conceded that the military alliance is
developing offensive tactics]{.underline}**, stating,

The human is very often the main vulnerability and it should be
acknowledged in order to protect NATO's human capital but also to be
able to benefit from our adversaries's vulnerabilities.

**[In a chilling disclosure, the report said explicitly that "the
objective of Cognitive Warfare is to harm societies and not only the
military]{.underline}**."

**[With entire civilian populations in NATO's crosshairs, the report
emphasized that Western militaries must work more closely with academia
to weaponize social sciences and human sciences and help the alliance
develop its cognitive warfare capacities]{.underline}**.

The study described this phenomenon as "the militarization of brain
science." But **[it appears clear that NATO's development of cognitive
warfare will lead to a militarization of all aspects of human society
and psychology, from the most intimate of social relationships to the
mind itself]{.underline}**.

**[Such all-encompassing militarization of society is reflected in the
paranoid tone of the NATO-sponsored report, which warned of "an embedded
fifth column, where everyone, unbeknownst]{.underline}** to ~~him or
her~~ \[**[themselves]{.underline}**\], **[is behaving according to the
plans of one of our competitors]{.underline}**." [The study makes it
clear that those "competitors" purportedly exploiting the consciousness
of Western dissidents are China and Russia]{.underline}.

In other words, **[this document shows that figures in the NATO military
cartel increasingly see their own domestic population as a threat,
fearing civilians to be potential Chinese or Russian sleeper
cells]{.underline}**, **[dastardly "fifth columns" that challenge the
stability of "Western liberal democracies]{.underline}**."

**[NATO's development of novel forms of hybrid warfare come at a time
when member states' military campaigns are targeting domestic
populations on an unprecedented level]{.underline}**.

The Ottawa Citizen reported this September that the [Canadian military's
Joint Operations Command took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic to wage
an information war against its own domestic population, testing out
propaganda tactics on Canadian civilians]{.underline}.

**[Internal NATO-sponsored reports suggest that this disclosure is just
scratching the surface of a wave of new unconventional warfare
techniques that Western militaries are employing around the
world]{.underline}**.

Canada hosts 'NATO Innovation Challenge' on cognitive warfare

**[Twice each year, NATO holds a "pitch-style event" that it brand as an
"Innovation Challenge."]{.underline}** These campaigns--one hosted in
the Spring and the other in the Fall, **[by alternating member
states--call on private companies, organizations, and researchers to
help develop new tactics and technologies for the military
alliance]{.underline}**.

**[The shark tank-like challenges reflect the predominant influence of
neoliberal ideology within NATO, as participants mobilize the free
market, public-private partnerships, and the promise of cash prizes to
advance the agenda of the military-industrial complex]{.underline}**.

NATO's Fall 2021 Innovation Challenge is hosted by Canada, and is titled
"The invisible threat: Tools for countering cognitive warfare."

"**[Cognitive warfare seeks to change not only what people think, but
also how they act]{.underline}**," the Canadian government wrote in its
official statement on the challenge.

**[Attacks against the cognitive domain involve the integration of
cyber, disinformation/misinformation, psychological, and
social-engineering capabilities]{.underline}**.

Ottawa's press release continued:

Cognitive warfare positions the mind as a battle space and contested
domain. **[Its objective is to sow dissonance, instigate conflicting
narratives, polarize opinion, and radicalize groups]{.underline}**.
**[Cognitive warfare can motivate people to act in ways that can disrupt
or fragment an otherwise cohesive society]{.underline}**.

NATO-backed Canadian military officials discuss cognitive warfare in
panel event

An advocacy group called the NATO Association of Canada has mobilized to
support this Innovation Challenge, working closely with military
contractors to attract the private sector to invest in further research
on behalf of NATO--and its own bottom line.

While the NATO Association of Canada (NAOC) is technically an
independent NGO, its mission is to promote NATO, and the organization
boasts on its website,

The NAOC has strong ties with the Government of Canada including Global
Affairs Canada and the Department of National Defence.

As part of its efforts to promote Canada's NATO Innovation Challenge,
the NAOC held a panel discussion on cognitive warfare on October 5.

The researcher who wrote the definitive 2020 NATO-sponsored study on
cognitive warfare, François du Cluzel, participated in the event,
alongside NATO-backed Canadian military officers.

The panel was overseen by Robert Baines, president of the NATO
Association of Canada. It was moderated by Garrick Ngai, a marketing
executive in the weapons industry who serves as an adviser to the
Canadian Department of National Defense and vice president and director
of the NAOC.

Baines opened the event noting that participants would discuss
"cognitive warfare and new domain of competition, where state and
non-state actors aim to influence what people think and how they act."

The NAOC president also happily noted the lucrative "opportunities for
Canadian companies" that this NATO Innovation Challenge promised.

NATO researcher describes cognitive warfare as 'ways of harming the
brain'

The October 5 panel kicked off with François du Cluzel, a former French
military officer who in 2013 helped to create the NATO Innovation Hub
(iHub), which he has since then managed from its base in Norfolk,
Virginia.

Although the iHub insists on its website, for legal reasons, that the
"opinions expressed on this platform don't constitute NATO or any other
organization points of view," the organization is sponsored by the
Allied Command Transformation (ACT), described as "one of two Strategic
Commands at the head of NATO's military command structure."

The Innovation Hub, therefore, acts as a kind of in-house NATO research
center or think tank. Its research is not necessarily official NATO
policy, but it is directly supported and overseen by NATO.

In 2020, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (SACT) tasked du
Cluzel, as manager of the iHub, to conduct a six-month study on
cognitive warfare.

Du Cluzel summarized his research in the panel this October. He
initiated his remarks noting that **[cognitive warfare "right now is one
of the hottest topics for NATO," and "has become a recurring term in
military terminology in recent years]{.underline}**."

Although French, Du Cluzel emphasized that cognitive warfare strategy
"is being currently developed by my command here in Norfolk, USA."

The NATO Innovation Hub manager spoke with a PowerPoint presentation,
and opened with a provocative slide that described cognitive warfare as
"A Battle for the Brain."

"[Cognitive warfare is a new concept that starts in the information
sphere, that is a kind of hybrid warfare]{.underline}," du Cluzel said.

"**[It starts with hyper-connectivity. Everyone has a cell
phone]{.underline}**," he continued.

**[It starts with information because information is]{.underline}**, if
I may say, **[the fuel of cognitive warfare]{.underline}**. **[But it
goes way beyond solely information, which is a standalone
operation--information warfare is a standalone operation]{.underline}**.

**[Cognitive warfare overlaps with Big Tech corporations and mass
surveillance, because "it's all about leveraging the big
data,"]{.underline}** du Cluzel explained.

[We produce data everywhere we go. Every minute, every second we go, we
go online]{.underline}. **[And this is extremely easy to leverage those
data in order to better know you and use that knowledge to change the
way you think]{.underline}**.

[Naturally, the NATO researcher claimed foreign "adversaries" are the
supposed aggressors employing cognitive warfare]{.underline}.
**[But]{.underline}** at the same time, **[he made it clear that the
Western military alliance is developing its own tactics]{.underline}**.

Du Cluzel **[defined cognitive warfare as the]{.underline}** "**[art of
using technologies to alter the cognition of human
targets]{.underline}**."

**[Those technologies]{.underline}**, he noted,
**[incorporate]{.underline}** the fields of NBIC--**[nanotechnology,
biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive
science]{.underline}**. **[All together, "it makes a kind of very
dangerous cocktail that can further manipulate the
brain,]{.underline}**" he said.

Du Cluzel went on to explain that the exotic new method of attack "goes
well beyond" information warfare or psychological operations (psyops).

"**[Cognitive warfare is not only a fight against what we think, but
it's rather a fight against the way we think, if we can change the way
people think]{.underline}**," he said.

**[It's much more powerful and it goes way beyond the information
\[warfare\] and psyops.]{.underline}**

De Cluzel continued:

It's crucial to understand that it's a game on our cognition, on the way
our brain processes information and turns it into knowledge, rather than
solely a game on information or on psychological aspects of our brains.
It's not only an action against what we think, but also an action
against the way we think, the way we process information and turn it
into knowledge.

In other words, cognitive warfare is not just another word, another name
for information warfare. **[It is a war on our individual processor, our
brain]{.underline}**.

**[The NATO researcher stressed that "this is extremely important for us
in the military," because "it has the potential, by developing new
weapons and ways of harming the brain, it has the potential to engage
neuroscience and technology in many, many different approaches to
influence human ecology]{.underline}**... **[because you all know that
it's very easy to turn a civilian technology into a military
one]{.underline}**."

As for who the targets of cognitive warfare could be, du Cluzel revealed
that anyone and everyone is on the table.

"**[Cognitive warfare has universal reach, from starting with the
individual to states and multinational organizations]{.underline}**," he
said.

**[Its field of action is global and aim to seize control of the human
being, civilian as well as military.]{.underline}**

**[And the private sector has a financial interest in advancing
cognitive warfare research]{.underline}**, he noted:

The massive worldwide investments made in neurosciences suggests that
the cognitive domain will probably one of the battlefields of the
future.

The development of cognitive warfare totally transforms military
conflict as we know it, du Cluzel said, adding "a third major combat
dimension to the modern battlefield: to the physical and informational
dimension is now added a cognitive dimension."

This "creates a new space of competition beyond what is called the five
domains of operations--or land, sea, air, cyber, and space domains.
Warfare in the cognitive arena mobilizes a wider range of battle spaces
than solely the physical and information dimensions can do."

In short, humans themselves are the new contested domain in this novel
mode of hybrid warfare, alongside land, sea, air, cyber, and outer
space.

NATO's cognitive warfare study warns of "embedded fifth column"

The study that NATO Innovation Hub manager François du Cluzel conducted,
from June to November 2020, was sponsored by the military cartel's
Allied Command Transformation, and published as a 45-page report in
January 2021 (PDF).

The chilling document shows how contemporary warfare has reached a kind
of dystopian stage, once imaginable only in science fiction.

"The nature of warfare has changed," the report emphasized.

The majority of current conflicts remain below the threshold of the
traditionally accepted definition of warfare, but new forms of warfare
have emerged such as Cognitive Warfare (CW), while the human mind is now
being considered as a new domain of war.

**[For NATO, research on cognitive warfare is not just defensive; it is
very much offensive as well]{.underline}**.

"[Developing capabilities to harm the cognitive abilities of opponents
will be a necessity," du Cluzel's report stated clearly]{.underline}.

In other words, **[NATO will need to get the ability to
safeguard]{.underline}** ~~her~~ \[**[its]{.underline}**\] **[decision
making process and disrupt the adversary's one]{.underline}**.

**[And anyone could be a target of these cognitive warfare
operations]{.underline}**: "**[Any user of modern information
technologies is a potential target. It targets the whole of a nation's
human capital]{.underline}**," the report ominously added.

"**[As well as the potential execution of a cognitive war to complement
to a military conflict, it can also be conducted alone, without any link
to an engagement of the armed forces]{.underline}**," the study went on.

Moreover, **[cognitive warfare is potentially endless since there can be
no peace treaty or surrender for this type of conflict]{.underline}**.

**[Just as this new mode of battle has no geographic borders, it also
has no time limit:]{.underline}**

**[This battlefield is global via the internet. With no beginning and no
end, this conquest knows no respite, punctuated by notifications from
our smartphones, anywhere, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week]{.underline}**.

The NATO-sponsored study noted that "some NATO Nations have already
acknowledged that neuroscientific techniques and technologies have high
potential for operational use in a variety of security, defense and
intelligence enterprises."

It spoke of breakthroughs in "neuroscientific methods and technologies"
(neuroS/T), and said "uses of research findings and products to directly
facilitate the performance of combatants, the integration of human
machine interfaces to optimise combat capabilities of semi autonomous
vehicles (e.g., drones), and development of biological and chemical
weapons (i.e., neuroweapons)."

The Pentagon is among the primary institutions advancing this novel
research, as the report highlighted:

Although a number of nations have pursued, and are currently pursuing
neuroscientific research and development for military purposes, perhaps
the most proactive efforts in this regard have been conducted by the
United States Department of Defense; with most notable and rapidly
maturing research and development conducted by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Intelligence Advanced Research
Projects Activity (IARPA).

Military uses of neuroS/T research, the study indicated, include
intelligence gathering, training, "optimising performance and resilience
in combat and military support personnel," and of course "direct
weaponisation of neuroscience and neurotechnology."

**[This weaponization of neuroS/T can and will be fatal, the
NATO-sponsored study was clear to point out]{.underline}**. **[The
research can "be utilised to mitigate aggression and foster cognitions
and emotions of affiliation or passivity; induce morbidity, disability
or suffering; and 'neutralise' potential opponents or incur
mortality]{.underline}**"--**[in other words, to maim and kill
people]{.underline}**.

The report quoted U.S. Major General Robert H. Scales, who summarized
NATO's new combat philosophy:

Victory will be defined more in terms of capturing the psycho-cultural
rather than the geographical high ground.

And **[as NATO develops tactics of cognitive warfare to "capture the
psycho-cultural," it is also increasingly weaponizing various scientific
fields]{.underline}**.

The study spoke of "the crucible of data sciences and human sciences,"
and stressed that "the combination of Social Sciences and System
Engineering will be key in helping military analysts to improve the
production of intelligence."

"If kinetic power cannot defeat the enemy," it said,

psychology and related behavioural and social sciences stand to fill the
void.

"Leveraging social sciences will be central to the development of the
Human Domain Plan of Operations," the report went on.

It will support the combat operations by providing potential courses of
action for the whole surrounding Human Environment including enemy
forces, but also determining key human elements such as the Cognitive
center of gravity, the desired behaviour as the end state.

All academic disciplines will be implicated in cognitive warfare, not
just the hard sciences. "Within the military, expertise on anthropology,
ethnography, history, psychology among other areas will be more than
ever required to cooperate with the military," the NATO-sponsored study
stated.

**[The report nears its conclusion with an eerie quote]{.underline}**:

**[Today's progresses in]{.underline}** nanotechnology,
**[biotechnology, information technology and cognitive
science]{.underline}** (NBIC), **[boosted by the seemingly unstoppable
march of a triumphant troika made of Artificial Intelligence, Big Data
and civilisational 'digital addiction' have created a much more ominous
prospect: an embedded fifth column, where everyone]{.underline}**,
**[unbeknownst to]{.underline}** ~~him or her~~
\[**[themselves]{.underline}**\], **[is behaving according to the
plans]{.underline}** of one of our competitors.

"**[The modern concept of war is not about weapons but about
influence]{.underline}**," it posited.

Victory in the long run will remain solely dependent on the ability to
influence, affect, change or impact the cognitive domain.

**[The NATO-sponsored study then closed with a final paragraph that
makes it clear beyond doubt that the Western military alliance's
ultimate goal is not only physical control of the planet, but also
control over people's minds]{.underline}**:

Cognitive warfare may well be the missing element that allows the
transition from military victory on the battlefield to lasting political
success. The human domain might well be the decisive domain, wherein
multi-domain operations achieve the commander's effect. The five first
domains can give tactical and operational victories; only the human
domain can achieve the final and full victory.

Canadian Special Operations officer emphasizes importance of cognitive
warfare

When François du Cluzel, the NATO researcher who conducted the study on
cognitive warfare, concluded his remarks in the October 5 NATO
Association of Canada panel, he was followed by Andy Bonvie, a
commanding officer at the Canadian Special Operations Training Centre.

With more than 30 years of experience with the Canadian Armed Forces,
Bonvie spoke of how Western militaries are making use of research by du
Cluzel and others, and incorporating novel cognitive warfare techniques
into their combat activities.

"Cognitive warfare is a new type of hybrid warfare for us," Bonvie said.

And [it means that we need to look at the traditional thresholds of
conflict and how the things that are being done are really below those
thresholds of conflict, cognitive attacks, and non-kinetic forms and
non-combative threats to us]{.underline}. We need to understand these
attacks better and adjust their actions and our training accordingly to
be able to operate in these different environments.

**[Although he portrayed NATO's actions as "defensive," claiming
"adversaries" were using cognitive warfare against them, Bonvie was
unambiguous about the fact that Western militaries are developing these
tecniques themselves, to maintain a "tactical advantage."]{.underline}**

"We cannot lose the tactical advantage for our troops that we're placing
forward as it spans not only tactically, but strategically," he said.

Some of those different capabilities that we have that we enjoy all of a
sudden could be pivoted to be used against us. So we have to better
understand how quickly our adversaries adapt to things, and then be able
to predict where they're going in the future, to help us be and maintain
the tactical advantage for our troops moving forward.

'**[Cognitive warfare is the most advanced form of manipulation seen to
date']{.underline}**

Marie-Pierre Raymond, a retired Canadian lieutenant colonel who
currently serves as a "defence scientist and innovation portfolio
manager" for the Canadian Armed Forces' Innovation for Defence
Excellence and Security Program, also joined the October 5 panel.

"**[Long gone are the days when war was fought to acquire more
land]{.underline}**," Raymond said.

[Now the new objective is to change the adversaries' ideologies, which
makes the brain the center of gravity of the human. And it makes the
human the contested domain, and the mind becomes the
battlefield]{.underline}.

"When we speak about hybrid threats, cognitive warfare is the most
advanced form of manipulation seen to date," she added, noting that it
aims to influence individuals' decision-making and "to influence a group
of a group of individuals on their behavior, with the aim of gaining a
tactical or strategic advantage."

Raymond noted that **[cognitive warfare also heavily overlaps with
artificial intelligence, big data, and social media, and reflects "the
rapid evolution of neurosciences as a tool of war."]{.underline}**

Raymond is helping to oversee the NATO Fall 2021 Innovation Challenge on
behalf of Canada's Department of National Defence, which delegated
management responsibilities to the military's Innovation for Defence
Excellence and Security (IDEaS) Program, where she works.

In highly technical jargon, Raymond indicated that the cognitive warfare
program is not solely defensive, but also offensive:

This challenge is calling for a solution that will support NATO's
nascent human domain and jump-start the development of a cognition
ecosystem within the alliance, and that will support the development of
new applications, new systems, new tools and concepts leading to
concrete action in the cognitive domain."

She emphasized that this "will require sustained cooperation between
allies, innovators, and researchers to enable our troops to fight and
win in the cognitive domain. This is what we are hoping to emerge from
this call to innovators and researchers."

To inspire corporate interest in the NATO Innovation Challenge, Raymond
enticed, "Applicants will receive national and international exposure
and cash prizes for the best solution." She then added tantalizingly,

This could also benefit the applicants by potentially providing them
access to a market of 30 nations.

Canadian military officer calls on corporations to invest in NATO's
cognitive warfare research

The other institution that is managing the Fall 2021 NATO Innovation
Challenge on behalf of Canada's Department of National Defense is the
Special Operations Forces Command (CANSOFCOM).

A Canadian military officer who works with CANSOFCOM, Shekhar Gothi, was
the final panelist in the October 5 NATO Association of Canada event.
Gothi serves as CANSOFCOM's "innovation officer" for Southern Ontario.

He concluded the event appealing for corporate investment in NATO's
cognitive warfare research.

The bi-annual Innovation Challenge is "part of the NATO battle rhythm,"
Gothi declared enthusiastically.

He noted that, in the spring of 2021, Portugal held a NATO Innovation
Challenge focused on warfare in outer space.

In spring 2020, the Netherlands hosted a NATO Innovation Challenge
focused on COVID-19.

**[Gothi reassured corporate investors that NATO will bend over backward
to defend their bottom lines]{.underline}**:

I can assure everyone that the NATO innovation challenge indicates that
all innovators will maintain complete control of their intellectual
property. So NATO won't take control of that. Neither will Canada.
Innovators will maintain their control over their IP.

**[The comment was a fitting conclusion]{.underline}** to the panel,
**[affirming that NATO and its allies in the military-industrial complex
not only seek to dominate the world and the humans that inhabit it with
unsettling cognitive warfare techniques, but to also ensure that
corporations and their shareholders continue to profit from these
imperial endeavors]{.underline}**.

global politics scholar Liz Philipose (2008) has noted, [international
law has "developed in tandem with imperial needs to justify
colonization, slavery, occupation and decision-making authority over the
lands and peoples of non-European extraction" and, further, reflects a
civilizing project aiming to "sustain the ongoing dichotomy between the
civilized and the backward"]{.underline} (104--105). [The 1972
international ban on biological weapons, the]{.underline} Biological
Weapons Convention ([BWC]{.underline}), [arose in the context of global
powers]{.underline} (notably the United States, the United Kingdom, and
France) [abandoning biological weapons in favor of nuclear
ones]{.underline}, which they both possessed and believed much more
effective (Guillemin 2005a). **[Thus, the protocol banned a weapon
global powers presumed they no longer needed, while arming them with a
regulatory mechanism to police the biological weapons of other
nations]{.underline}**. The BWC, coupled with subsequent verification
processes authorized by the UN Security Council in the early 1990s,
provided the basis for the United States and its allies to control
targets like Iraq. [U.S.]{.underline} (and European) [control over Iraq
had begun in the 1980s when they supplied Iraq with biological and
chemical weapons as a strategic move against Iran during the Iran-Iraq
War]{.underline} (Barnaby 2000; Central Intelligence Agency 2007; L.
Cole 1997). The United States had overlooked Iraq's use of chemical
weapons against Iran, even though it violated the Geneva Protocol's ban
on the first use of chemical and bacteriological weapons in war
(Rapoport 1999).2 [But once Iraq fell out of favor with the United
States, leading to the First Gulf War in 1991, the United States and
other powerful nations targeted Iraq's weapons programs with the
verification protocols of the BWC]{.underline}. Iraq was subject to UN
weapons inspections following the war, and again in 2002. [These
inspections set the stage for further U.S. domination of Iraq: Iraqi
biological weapons possession served as a primary rationale for a second
invasion of the country in 2003.]{.underline} **[The pro-war propaganda
leading up to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 maligned Iraq as
flouting international law]{.underline}**---[the United States accused
Iraq of possessing biological weapons (and other WMDs).]{.underline}
[President Bush, members of the Defense Department, and high-level
weapons experts, as well as mass media and other pundits, vigorously
painted the specter of Iraq as embodying the threat of
bioterrorism]{.underline}. Iraq and its leader, Saddam Hussein, had been
demonized as an Arab / Muslim Other since the First Gulf War, and in the
post-9 / 11 context U.S. pundits easily floated connections between Iraq
and Al Qaeda, WMDs, terrorism, and the anthrax attacks.3 While most of
these claims proved baseless, and were later revealed to be either
exaggerated or altogether false (Center for Public Integrity 2008;
Kimball 2003; Pitt 2002), in the lead-up to the invasion their symbolic
utility proved undeniable. On February 5, 2003, Secretary of State Colin
Powell gave a speech to the UN Security Council about Iraqi biological
weapons. He showed pictures of mobile research laboratories and held up
a small container of white talcum powder (figure 2) meant to simulate
dry anthrax (Vogel 2012), stating, "Less than a teaspoon full of dry
anthrax in an envelope shut down the United States Senate in the fall of
2001," followed by "Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 liters. If
concentrated into this dry form, this amount would be enough to fill
tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons" (Powell 2003). By
visually and rhetorically reducing Iraqi bioweapons capability to
anthrax powder, Powell drew on the gripping image of the Arab / Muslim
Other as menacing germ. Like the figure of the suicide infector I
described in the previous chapter, this germ figure further stoked the
construction of Iraq as a potent biothreat, and state officials used it
to rally action. **[This threat imaginary about Iraq bolstered U.S.
rationale for invasion, reinforcing the United States' ostensible role
as global police of the biological weapons capacity of nations around
the world]{.underline}**. [The image of Colin Powell also represented
U.S. exceptionalist narratives during the period: pictorial and
rhetorical invocations of high-ranking people of color in the Bush
administration, particularly Secretary of State Powell and his
successor, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, served in the political
theater of the war on terror to present the United
States]{.underline}---[by virtue of its
multiculturalism]{.underline}---[as democratic and fair, a land of
equality and justice]{.underline}.4 Like discursive gestures to
morality, civilizational advancement, and feminism described in the
previous chapter, [these depictions rendered U.S. actions domestically
and abroad as serving these lofty, benevolent ideals]{.underline}.
**[The horrific effects of U.S. empire cannot be
overstated]{.underline}**. Consider the catalogue of topics about the
U.S. invasion of Iraq in the anthology Feminism and War: Confronting
U.S. Imperialism (Riley, Mohanty, and Pratt 2008): [record numbers of
civilian casualties; the body count in general; racialized, sexualized
torture; enlistment of U.S. women into the dangerous culture of gendered
violence in the U.S. military; an increase in domestic and sexual
violence against women and children worldwide; not to mention the
decimation of the economies and infrastructure of targeted countries and
the cuts to U.S. social services and the effects on marginalized
populations within the United States]{.underline}. In this context,
**[U.S. ability to determine the course of biological warfare globally
constitutes cause for great concern]{.underline}**---**[it is one more
node in a constellation of U.S. power augmented during the war on
terror]{.underline}**.

#### Militarism, capitalism, and imperialism are all [intimately]{.underline} tied to the development of biodefense

[Laboratories that are designed to enclose infectious agents are
designated with]{.underline} Biological Safety Levels
([BSL]{.underline}) set from 1 through 4 (with 4 pertaining to the most
dangerous pathogens, such as smallpox or Ebola); [they house specialized
equipment and require scientists to follow specific safety protocols and
best practices]{.underline}. In 2002 the Department of Homeland Security
spent \$70 million to open more of these labs (Guillemin 2005a). The
Sunshine Project, an international bioweapons watchdog NGO, took a
snapshot in November 2004 of the national array of high-containment labs
---specifically BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs for containing lethal pathogens.
The map (figure 3) showed existing as well as planned labs: the former
designated with a biohazard sign, the latter designated with a biohazard
sign plus a dot in the sign's upper-right corner (Sunshine Project
2004). [This proliferation of biodefense continued to be outsourced to
the civilian sector]{.underline} (mainly the Department of Health and
Human Services \[HHS\] agencies) [as well as private
industry]{.underline}. The National Institutes of Health (NIH)---the
research agency of HHS---was funded to conduct research and development
for new biomedical countermeasures at over \$1.5 billion per year in
fiscal year 2003---thirty times the investment in fiscal year 2001 (Bush
2004a).13 [The pharmaceuticals industry]{.underline}---**[the face of
neoliberal capitalism in the biomedical sphere]{.underline}**---[played
an increasingly large role]{.underline}. The government enlisted this
large and powerful congressional lobby14 to produce vaccines and other
drugs against biological agents by offering incentives such as tax
breaks and indemnities (since vaccines are not the most lucrative of
pharmaceutical products).15 [This reliance of government on private
industry, begun under the Clinton administration, has reduced compliance
monitoring]{.underline}. [Since the late 1990s, the U.S. state has
sought to decrease U.S. transparency in international weapons
compliance.]{.underline} [In particular, the U.S. Congress and the
pharmaceutical industry, arguing that transparency through onsite
inspections of military and pharmaceutical facilities would endanger
commercial proprietary and national security interests,]{.underline}
pressured Clinton into weakening the treaty's inspections regime at the
fourth review of the BWC in 199716 (Guillemin 2005b; S. Wright 2002).
[The Bush administration unabashedly maintained this corporate
biodefense policy, rejecting the ratification of a strengthened
international bioweapons treaty during its quintennial review in 2001,
and thereby halting the verification protocol]{.underline}. Once again,
the United States cited national security and commercial interests
(Dando 2006; Findlay 2006). [In this way, the profit imperative of the
private sector worked hand in hand with U.S. imperialism, further
enabling what some have termed the "biodefense industrial
complex"]{.underline} (Fidler and Gostin 2007, 148). **[Empire and
capitalism easily superseded international disarmament aims, enabling
the U.S. state to shrug off substantive limits to its industry's
activities]{.underline}**.

### Biotechnology Link

#### NATO biotechnology schemes are driven by a desire to win geoeconomics competition and secure hegemony of capital

[Emerging technologies are the geo-economics Achilles heel NATO needs to
address to deter aggressors]{.underline}, write General John Allen,
Heiko Borchert and Marcin Zaborowski. [To ensure NATO's relevance and to
keep "our people safe", the Alliance "must continue to strengthen and
modernize our deterrence and defence," NATO Secretary-General Jens
Stoltenberg said]{.underline} at the Riga Summit on 30 November 2021.
Innovation plays a critical role in modernizing armed forces amid a
complex strategic environment.

[To this purpose, Stoltenberg unveiled]{.underline} the Defence
Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic ([DIANA]{.underline}) on
22 October 2021. **[DIANA shall bring defence and commercial companies
together with military users]{.underline}** to develop novel solutions
that meet the needs of the future battlefield. He also launched the NATO
Innovation Fund to invest up to €1bn to support innovators developing
emerging technologies. The announcement comes at a time when the
Alliance is working on a new Strategic Concept. Innovation will be key
to preserving NATO's edge, as the Secretary-General pointed out in his
2030 food for thought paper. [Although NATO is a potent defence
organization, emphasis on emerging technologies reveals its Achilles'
heel]{.underline}. **[Artificial intelligence]{.underline}**, autonomy,
**[biotechnology]{.underline}**, quantum technology, **[and other
technologies are at the heart of geo-economic
competition]{.underline}**. [Geoeconomic competition unfolds around the
projection of economic power within and across the domains of land, air,
sea, space, and cyberspace to achieve political goals]{.underline}.

[Today's geoeconomic dynamic defines winning business models amid a
growing dichotomy between market-driven and state-driven nations**. It
aims to set the rules, principles, and standards that guide economic
activities and access to and ownership of emerging
technologies**]{.underline}. **[NATO's current emphasis on emerging
technologies with defence and commercial applications risks making the
Alliance subject to this new geoeconomic dynamic]{.underline}**. This
dynamic can undermine NATO's innovation agenda and endanger its
strategic edge. Therefore, NATO needs to respond.

#### Biotech greed is at all time highs with very little of the money going to "innovation" -- don't buy the aff's lies

Jag **Bhalla '21**, is an entrepreneur and writer. His current project
is Errors We Live By, a series of short illustrated exoteric essays
atbigthink.com. They include errors in how evolution and economics are
understood and used, "Biotechnology greed is prolonging the pandemic.
It's inexcusable", Salon, 8/13/21,
https://www.salon.com/2021/08/13/biotechnology-greed-is-prolonging-the-pandemic-its-inexcusable_partner/

[Among the pandemic\'s many lessons, however, is that greed can easily
work against the common good]{.underline}. We **[rightly celebrate the
near-miraculous development of effective vaccines, which have been
widely deployed in rich nations. But the global picture reveals not even
a semblance of justice]{.underline}**: As of May, **[low-income nations
received just 0.3 percent of the global vaccine supply]{.underline}**.
**[At this rate it would take 57 years for them to achieve full
vaccination]{.underline}**.

**[This disparity has been dubbed \"vaccine apartheid,\" and it\'s
exacerbated by greed]{.underline}**. **[A year after the launch of the
World Health Organization\'s Covid-19 Technology Access
Pool]{.underline}** --- a program aimed at encouraging the collaborative
exchange of intellectual property, knowledge, and data --- \"**[not a
single company has donated its technical knowhow]{.underline}**,\" wrote
politicians from India, Kenya, and Bolivia in a June essay for The
Guardian. [As of that month, the U.N.-backed COVAX initiative, a vaccine
sharing scheme established to provide developing countries equitable
access, had delivered only about 90 million out of a promised 2 billion
doses]{.underline}. **[Currently, pharmaceutical companies, lobbyists,
and conservative lawmakers continue to oppose proposals for patent
waivers that would allow local drug makers to manufacture the vaccines
without legal jeopardy]{.underline}**. They claim the waivers would slow
down existing production, \"foster the proliferation of counterfeit
vaccines,\" and, as North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr said,
\"undermine the very innovation we are relying on to bring this pandemic
to an end.\"

**[All these views echo the idea that patents and high drug prices are
necessary motivators for biomedical innovation. But examine that logic
closely, and it quickly begins to fall apart]{.underline}**.

**[A great deal of difficult, innovative work is done in industries and
fields that lack patents]{.underline}**. Has the lack of patent
protections for recipes led to any dearth of innovation in restaurants?
[An irritating irony here is that economists who espouse the need-greed
theory themselves innovate for comparative peanuts]{.underline}. For
instance, in 2018, the median compensation for economists was about
\$104,000. The typical pharmaceutical CEO, meanwhile, earned a whopping
\$5.7 million in total compensation that year. (The hands-on innovators
aren\'t the need-greeders here; the median compensation for
pharmaceutical employees --- including benefits --- was about \$177,000
in 2018.) Even in Silicon Valley, writes ever-astute technology insider
Tim O\'Reilly, \"the notion that entrepreneurs will stop innovating if
they aren\'t rewarded with billions is a pernicious fantasy.\"

To be sure, it was not greed but rather a vast collaborative effort ---
funded largely with public dollars --- that generated effective
coronavirus vaccines. The technology behind mRNA vaccines such as those
produced by Pfizer and Moderna took decades of work by University of
Pennsylvania scientists you\'ve likely never heard of. According to The
New York Times, one of those scientists, Katalin Kariko, \"never made
more than \$60,000 a year\" while doing her innovative foundational
research. The researchers at Oxford University who developed the
technology behind AstraZeneca\'s vaccine, which was mostly publicly
funded, initially set out with the intention of \"non-exclusive,
royalty-free\" licensing for their vaccine. Only after pressure to work
with a multinational pharmaceutical company from the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation, among others, did they renege and license the
technology solely to AstraZeneca.

It was astonishing, then, when Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca\'s CEO, said
that intellectual property, or IP, \"is a fundamental part of our
industry and if you don\'t protect IP, then essentially there is no
incentive for anybody to innovate.\" The Oxford scientists whose work
AstraZeneca licensed literally just innovated without the incentives
Soriot claimed are essential. Why do journalists present need-greeder
claims, such as Soriot\'s, without holding the specific role of profit
seeking to account?

It\'s no secret that innovators (and people generally) often aren\'t
necessarily greed-driven. For instance, as Walter Isaacson notes in his
book about superstar biochemist Jennifer Doudna\'s work on Crispr gene
manipulation technology, she was never motivated primarily by money. In
fact, he reports that corporate maneuvering over her work made her
\"physically ill.\" Countless cases like hers show that innovations in
science and technology typically aren\'t the result of genius lightning
strikes but rather of field-wide efforts with multiple teams circling
the same goal. If anyone withdraws for lack of greed-gratifying
incentives, no problem: They\'re welcome to write themselves out of
history. Others will gladly grasp the glory. And we, the public, lose
nothing.

Perhaps Soriot meant, more generally, that reduced revenues would cut
AstraZeneca\'s overall research and development (R&D) spending. But even
that claim is detectably dubious. **[When drug makers claim that high
prices are essential for innovation, they are \"flat out
lying\"]{.underline}** financial expert Yves Smith wrote in 2019. Smith
cited data published with the Institute for New Economic Thinking
showing that, **[between 2009 and 2018, 18 drug makers listed in the S&P
500 spent 14 percent more on stock buybacks and dividends than they did
on R&D.]{.underline}** These companies could easily ramp up investments
in innovative drugs, the authors wrote, simply by reining in
distributions to shareholders. (Don\'t forget that share buybacks were
effectively classified as illegal market manipulation until the
Securities and Exchange Commission, under Reagan, relaxed the rules in
1982.)

**[Of the money that drug companies do invest in R&D, a significant
amount for many goes not toward innovative research but to \"finding
ways to suppress generic and biosimilar competition while continuing to
raise prices,\" according to a recent report from the U.S. House
Committee on Oversight and Reform]{.underline}**. **[In these cases,
executive and investor greed demonstrably impede
innovation]{.underline}**. A recent Congressional hearing dramatized
this issue when Rep. Katie Porter, a California Democrat, grilled the
CEO of AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical company which she said spent \$2.45
billion on research and development, \$4.71 billion a year on marketing
and advertising, and \$50 billion on shareholder payouts between 2013
and 2018. She characterized **[the idea that R&D justified astronomical
prices as \"the Big Pharma fairy tale.\"]{.underline}**

Even if greed makes sense for some for-profit ventures, it would be
unwise for us to rely only on for-profit enterprise to harness
innovation for social goals. **[There are many things that we must do
whether they are profitable or not, and the horrific fiasco over vaccine
patents has shown us that biotech executives and other members of the
\"thinkerati\" are not above putting profits ahead of saving
lives]{.underline}**. As White House adviser Anthony Fauci noted to the
Hill earlier this year, America has a \"moral obligation\" to \"make
sure that the rest of the world does not suffer and die\" from something
that we can help to prevent. [Our government is failing in its duty to
act in the public interest if it allows \"your money or your life\" to
pass as an acceptable business model.]{.underline}

As an open letter signed by more than a hundred intellectual property
scholars recently stated, IP rights (which includes patents) \"are not,
and have never been, absolute rights and are granted and recognized
under the condition that they serve the public interest.\" The scholars
noted precedents like last year\'s use of the Defense Production Act to
increase production of medical supplies, and the U.S.\'s commandeering
of penicillin production during World War II. If Covid-19 vaccine makers
refuse to make life-saving technology publicly available, governments
should enact mandatory licensing or similar measures.

There are also compelling reasons to develop a standing, publicly
operated rapid-response vaccine manufacturing capability. Pfizer\'s CFO
suggested that prices on vaccines will go up once we are out of the
\"pandemic-pricing environment,\" noting that the company can charge
nearly nine times more than they have been (\"\$150, \$175 per dose,\"
the CFO said, versus the \$19.50 Pfizer is charging the U.S. in one
supply deal). Even if those who haven\'t received a single dose of the
vaccine never do, that could mean roughly a \$30 billion bonanza from
U.S. booster shots alone. Patient advocates estimate that it would cost
just \$4 billion for the U.S. to set up a public-private operation
capable of manufacturing enough mRNA vaccines to immunize the whole
planet, with each shot costing \$2. This would be a great way for
America to show global leadership, and would surely be way cheaper, both
individually and collectively, than being annually \"Pfizered.\" Plus,
the usefulness of such a facility would long outlast the current
pandemic, with climate change making zoonotic spillover events more
likely (not to mention the risks of weaponized viruses). Covid-19 was
our \"starter pandemic,\" as Ed Yong usefully dubbed it.

If greed-driven companies fail to exercise their powers responsibly,
they should face competition from the public sector. President Biden let
the cat out of the bag when he said that \"capitalism without
competition isn\'t capitalism; it\'s exploitation.\" While many people
applauded his sentiment, stop and think about the implication: The
president was, in essence, saying that we expect corporations to exploit
us if given half a chance.

**[We pay a huge price in blood and treasure when we give the
need-greeders free rein to lie to and exploit the public with
impunity]{.underline}**. We must be clear-eyed about exactly when greed
can help our collective interests and when it hinders them. [During a
crisis as dire as a global pandemic, greed won\'t save us]{.underline}.

### Bioterror Link

#### Their deployment of fear of a bioterror attack is rooted in a Cold War suspicion of "communist" threats and mobilization to protect racialized capitalism from unnamed "terrorists" in Eurasia while ignoring the [bio attacks]{.underline} by [white men]{.underline} within their own borders

[Not more than a month after the events of September 11, 2001, letters
laced with deadly anthrax spores arrived at the offices of several news
media outlets and two U.S. senators, causing five deaths and seventeen
injuries]{.underline}.1 [The "anthrax attacks" swiftly shifted into
position as a central node of the burgeoning war on terror, elevating
its focus on bioterrorism, that is, the intentional spread of disease
via germ or biological weapons]{.underline}. The FBI launched a massive,
broad-scale investigation to find the perpetrator, enlisting advisers
from science, national security, and policy and scholarly bodies, and
even investigative journalists. [Early speculation reflected dominant
national security discourse: the perpetrator was thought to be Al Qaeda
or Iraq]{.underline}---[the "usual suspects"]{.underline} of the post-9
/ 11 era---[or possibly Russia, a remnant of earlier Cold War era
antagonism]{.underline}. Former vice president Dick Cheney conjectured
that Al Qaeda "actually used to train people" in how "to deploy and use
these kinds of substances \[biological and chemical weapons\]" ("The
Anthrax Source" 2001). Weapons inspector Dick Spertzel was quoted in a
Wall Street Journal article, "The Anthrax War," suggesting that "there
are people in Iraq who know how to do it" (Wall Street Journal 2001b).
[There was little evidence for these theories]{.underline}.2 [It took
the FBI only a few months to determine that the anthrax used was the
potent Ames strain, which derived from a U.S. government biodefense
lab]{.underline} (USAMRIID).3 By early 2002, the FBI had turned to
investigating the high-level scientists who research pathogens for the
U.S. national security apparatus, [eventually identifying its final
suspect, U.S. white male scientist Bruce E. Ivins]{.underline}.4 **[The
investigation's findings were consistent with bioterrorism's historical
pattern in the United States as a phenomenon carried out almost
exclusively by domestic sources, specifically, white
men]{.underline}**.5 [While the federal government did not commission
any political or other social scientific studies of white male violence,
it continued to invest vast resources in soliciting scholars to study
Arab and Muslim cultures as part of the war on terror]{.underline}. 6
(**[In fact, profilers in the anthrax investigation continued to focus
on Al Qaeda and Iraq even after evidence pointed toward involvement by a
U.S. government lab scientist]{.underline}**.)7 [The lack of scrutiny of
white male violence was consonant with dominant ideas about white
masculinity as sources of authority and protection, ideas particularly
entrenched during the war on terror]{.underline} (Shepherd 2006). As has
been theorized by cultural studies scholars,
[discourse]{.underline}---[or ways of speaking about the
world]{.underline}---[constrains and limits the way that knowledge is
constructed]{.underline}. Cultural theorist Stuart Hall defines
discourse as "a group of statements which provide a language for talking
about---i.e. a way of representing---a particular kind of knowledge
about a topic. **[When statements about a topic are made within a
particular discourse, the discourse makes it possible to construct the
topic in a certain way]{.underline}**. [It also limits the other ways in
which the topic can be constructed"]{.underline} (Hall 1992, 291).
[Dominant discourse marginalizes explanations]{.underline}---[in this
case the culpability of white masculinity]{.underline}---[that do not
fit its dictates.]{.underline} Discourse is connected to power:
knowledge production promotes some power arrangements over others. Again
I cite Hall, who draws on social theorist Michel Foucault to explain the
connection between thought and action, between language and practice:
"[Discourse is about the production of knowledge through language. But
it is itself produced by a practice: 'discursive
practice']{.underline}---the practice of producing meaning. [Since all
social practices entail meaning, all practices have a discursive aspect.
So discourse enters into and influences all social
practices]{.underline}" (Hall 1992, 291). [Discourse, then, has material
effects; it is in fact formative of the material]{.underline}.
**[Failure to problematize white masculinity in the anthrax case
supported existing arrangements keeping white men in
power]{.underline}**---**[in the high-level U.S. biodefense industry,
and at the helm of the U.S. national security apparatus more
generally]{.underline}**. 8 [Discourse surrounding the anthrax mailings
not only marginalized the culpability of white masculinity; it also
carefully bounded discussions about the vast research industry from
which the anthrax came.]{.underline} [The biodefense research apparatus
spanned government, university, and industry labs, where bioscientists,
mainly microbiologists, toil away on dangerous
pathogens]{.underline}---[in the name of national security]{.underline}.
Over the course of the nearly nine-year anthrax investigation[, the mass
news media brought attention to the industry's ongoing lab
accidents]{.underline}---**[accidental exposures, lab leakages, and
unintentional shipments of live germs instead of dead
ones]{.underline}**. Media attention peaked in 2006, when several lab
workers at Texas A&M University were exposed to and infected with Q
fever and brucellosis, resulting in the lab's temporary suspension of
activities. [In response, federal officials insisted that the gains for
national security outweighed the costs; security pundits concentrated on
better training for scientists to reduce accidents]{.underline}. [Absent
among the proposed solutions, however, was a deeper questioning of the
merits of the industry itself: What purpose does an active U.S.
biodefense program serve?]{.underline} [Bio-Imperialism seeks to unravel
the discursive edifices of U.S. biodefense: assumptions about
bioterrorism and U.S. vulnerability, about germs and technoscientific
capabilities to control them]{.underline}. [It examines, moreover, the
constitutive role that gender and race, along with U.S. imperial
ambitions, play in U.S. bioterror and disease response]{.underline}.
Post--Cold War National Security Discourse: Race, Gender, Terror The
focus on Al Qaeda and Iraq during the anthrax investigation highlights
the role of the racial Other in dominant national security discourse.
[The end of the Cold War saw the U.S.-USSR axis, and the concomitant
capitalismcommunism binary]{.underline}, 9 [give way to the geopolitical
and military supremacy of the United States, and the unprecedented
acceleration of neoliberal capitalism and U.S.-led
globalization]{.underline} (Masco 1999). [The new lone superpower
shifted its attention from the Soviet Union and nuclear stalemate to an
increasingly visible number of smaller enemies]{.underline}
---"[terrorists]{.underline}"10 [and]{.underline} "[rogue
states]{.underline}"---[and their possible acquisition of]{.underline}
weapons of mass destruction ([WMDs]{.underline}), [which include weapons
of chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear warfare]{.underline}.
Foreswearing de-escalation and disarmament, the United States turned to
the platform of counterterrorism, most notably intervening in the Middle
East. [U.S. involvement in the Middle East resulted in the targeting of
Arabs and Muslims in the region as well as domestically]{.underline}.
The United States passed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act of 1996 (AEDPA) in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing
perpetrated by U.S. white male Timothy McVeigh and two others, resulting
in the deaths of 168 people and injuring over 800 in April 1995.
[Despite the domestic origins of the perpetrators, AEDPA focused heavily
on "international terrorism" and "alien terrorists," and in practice was
used to apprehend Arabs and Muslims]{.underline}. [It authorized the
secretary of state to designate "foreign terrorist organizations" that
the United States could sanction]{.underline}. About half were Muslim or
Arab groups (Whidden 2001).11 As Arab American studies scholars have
demonstrated, [the U.S. state justified these actions by mobilizing
trenchant U.S. racial discourses villainizing Arabs and Muslims as
uncivilized, violent Others]{.underline}12 (Cainkar 2008; Naber 2000).
By the time of the September 11 incident, the specter of Arab /Muslim13
terror had been firmly entrenched, serving as the lynchpin for a new
iteration of U.S. empire. The war on terror entailed the brutal
invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq to maintain U.S. oil interests and a
foothold in the Middle East.14 In President George W. Bush's address to
a joint session of Congress on September 20, 2001, he called for
military action that would begin with Al Qaeda and continue "until every
terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated"
(Bush 2001a). [The war's boundless scope was in part enabled through the
larger shift in governmental power during the war on
terror]{.underline}---what social theorist Brian Massumi (2010) has
[called "preemptive power."]{.underline} [**This anticipatory mode of
governance enhanced the U.S. state's ability to act upon security
threats of indeterminate potential in the name of preserving life.**
Preemptive state power was, moreover, yoked to the language of freedom
and civilization]{.underline}. In his September 20 speech, Bush
justified military action as necessary to "defend freedom" and invoked
"civilization" as the war's protagonist: "This is civilization's fight"
(Bush 2001a). [Narratives of the United States as freedom-loving,
democratic, just, and other markers of "civilized" can be traced to
long-standing Orientalist discourse that positions the West as beacon of
progress and opposes it to the Arab / Muslim Other]{.underline}. These
discursive practices began in the late eighteenth century, when European
narratives of the "East" extolled the superiority of the "West" in order
to rationalize colonial endeavors in the Middle East (Said 1978).
Critical race and ethnic studies scholar Sylvia Chan-Malik discusses how
[this Orientalist narrative has functioned in relation to U.S.
aggression in the Middle East: as "the liberal vision of a free,
feminist, and multicultural nation as a fundamental necessary
counterpart to the decidedly unfree, antifeminist, and antidemocratic
ideology of Islamic Terror]{.underline}" (2011, 134). [In other words,
the construction of Arabs and Muslims as a racialized enemy Other helped
inculcate a national imaginary of the United States as progressive
vis-à-vis feminism and multiculturalism]{.underline}.15 Bush's speech on
September 20 included numerous nods to multicultural tolerance, such as
"The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many
Arab friends" (Bush 2001a). This rhetoric belied the fact that the war
clearly targeted Arabs, Muslims, and the Middle East. Bush's speech also
touched on the plight of women in Afghanistan: "Women are not allowed to
attend school" (Bush 2001a). Arab American feminist studies scholars
have thoroughly described the construction of Arab and Muslim women as
always and everywhere oppressed, wherein regional distinctions are
flattened, and women are seen solely as victims of a patriarchal
culture. These scholars have demonstrated how this image has propped up
the war on terror---the war's proponents articulate the war as an
attempt to liberate oppressed Arab and Muslim women (Moallem 2002; Nayak
2006). In fact, Chan-Malik's discussion of [the role feminism has played
in exceptionalist constructions of the United States illustrates a
dialectic in which the oppressed Arab /Muslim woman is the counterpoint
to the liberated Western woman, further bolstering an image of U.S.
progressivism despite U.S. imperial aggression]{.underline}.

[As the bioterror imaginary took root, government officials, with the
help of pundits from the national security and bioscience fields,
formulated a regime of bioterrorism preparedness]{.underline}. Prominent
biodefense pundits Tara O'Toole and Thomas Inglesby outlined three focal
areas in the inaugural issue of the peer-reviewed journal Biosecurity
and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science: 19
biodefense research and development, medical and public health capacity,
and prevention of bioweapons development and use (2004, 2). The first,
the revamping of the biodefense industry, tackled the system of
high-level labs that Ivins was involved in, where scientists conduct
research and development on lethal pathogens and their countermeasures
(e.g., diagnostic tests and vaccines). From fiscal years 2002 to 2004,
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the
government agency responsible for conducting infectious disease
research, had increased its budget by more than twentyfold for research
into anthrax, smallpox, plague, and other lethal pathogens used in
biological warfare (Sunshine Project 2005). [This research on lethal
pathogens was driven not only by the bioterror imaginary, but also by a
faith in the ability of technoscience to yield solutions to social
problems]{.underline}.20 [This faith has its origins in Euro-American
modernity and its centering of science and technology as vehicles of
cultural progress and advancement]{.underline} (Foucault 1977). It has
meant the promotion of innovation and the prioritization of
technological solutions over social ones. [In the context of biodefense,
it has entailed pouring resources into, for example, new vaccine
development and "threat characterization" studies.]{.underline} [The
latter entail research involving the production of lethal
pathogens]{.underline}---sometimes new variants such as the anthrax
Ivins worked with---[so that new vaccines may be tested against them, or
simply to gain knowledge about possible new biological weapons that
enemies of the United States might produce.]{.underline} While many
bioweapons specialists were supportive of the lean into technoscientific
innovation in germ research, [bioweapons specialist Jonathan B. Tucker
voiced a cautionary note on this unbounded germ research, noting that
"creating putative bioengineered pathogens in the laboratory for
purposes of threat characterization would be exceedingly dangerous and
counterproductive" and that "there is an important distinction between
'knowledge gaps' that are worth filling and those whose exploration
could generate new dangers"]{.underline} (Tucker 2006, 195--196). For
Tucker, **[the production of dangerous new pathogens had myriad issues
whose blowback would inevitably harm the United States: the danger posed
to scientists via accidental exposure, the acquisition of U.S. weapons
by its enemies, and possible negative perception that U.S. creation of
biological weapons for research was a ruse for the creation of
biological weapons for warfare]{.underline}** (Tucker 2006). Tucker's
critique highlights that the Bush administration's pursuit of innovation
in the name of bioterrorism preparedness, and its expectation of future
benefit deriving from technoscientific advancements, obscures the
significant dangers such innovation produces. In chapter 2, I discuss
the way the dangers of germ research were sidelined vis-à-vis discourses
of the racial Other encoded in both legal measures (the Bioterrorism
Preparedness and Response section of the PATRIOT Act and the new
Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2002) and "biosecurity" practices
instituted in the biosciences. A Short History of Biological Warfare
[Biodefense research has a longer history that precedes its post-9 / 11
makeover]{.underline}. Biodefense research on lethal pathogens was the
legacy of earlier regimes of biological warfare. [European
settler-colonists during the 1700s waged the very first intentional
deployment of lethal pathogens in the United States---spreading smallpox
to indigenous populations, decimating them]{.underline} (Christopher et
al. 1997; Duffy 2002; USAMRIID 2004). Following its role in the genesis
of U.S. settler-empire, biological warfare played an important role in
U.S. military programs during the early- to mid-twentieth century, when
many nations developed large-scale programs21 to weaponize a variety of
germs (i.e., bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa) and other biological
weapons22 (Barnaby 2000; Bernstein 1987; Clarke 1968; Hersh 1968). After
World War II, U.S. engagement with biological weapons receded in light
of the rise of nuclear weapons as well as the global decline of state
biological weapons programs. In 1972, an international treaty, the
Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), banned the development, possession,
and transfer of biological weapons. Only scaled-down "defensive"
programs remained. These programs ebbed and flowed over subsequent
presidencies, until the late 1990s, when they received a substantial
boost. [The Clinton administration]{.underline} developed a two-pronged
program. On one end, the administration focused on domestic
preparedness, emphasizing broad technological solutions and emergency
response, establishing the National Pharmaceutical Stockpile and the
Health Alert Network and Laboratory Response Network in 1999 (Guillemin
2005a; Khan, Morse, and Lillibridge 2000). On the other end, the
administration [monitored enemy nations such as the former Soviet Union
as well as nonstate groups and individuals the United States deemed
terrorists]{.underline}. The United States surveilled, for example, the
biological warfare activities of nonstate groups such as Aum Shinrikyo23
and investigated whether the dissolved former Soviet Union24 had
transferred any biological weapons to states in the Middle East, such as
Iraq25 (Fidler 2002; Mueller 2005; O'Toole 2001). [The attention to
biological weapons stemmed in part from U.S. post-- Cold War focus on
terrorism and efforts to secure its global hegemony]{.underline}.
Another basis of concern was the advances in biotechnology that had
emerged since the birth of genomics in the 1980s, and in genetic
engineering in the 1990s, which created the possibility of enhanced germ
weaponry. 26 **[Since offensive biological weapons were banned, the U.S.
government exerted dominance by developing biodefense and suppressing
weapons capacity in others]{.underline}**. Clinton's global watchdog
approach would become the foundation for post-9 / 11 engagement. [Under
the Bush administration, the United States invaded Iraq in 2003 with the
rationale of preempting Iraqi use of bioweapons]{.underline} (and other
WMDs). [The administration offered no proof of either Iraqi weapons
possession or plans to attack the United States; instead, it offered
alarmist allusions]{.underline}---[to, for example, Iraqi connections to
Al Qaeda or the active Iraqi bioweapons program in the 1970s and
1980s]{.underline} (**[which had been destroyed during UN inspections in
the 1990s]{.underline}**). Bioweapons had become a powerful rhetorical
tool in U.S. designs on Iraq and signaled that the United States would
attempt to justify drastic military action in the name of countering
bioweapons threats. At the same time the Bush administration maintained
a tight grip over the bioweapons capacities of others, it dramatically
expanded Clinton's domestic preparedness program---in areas such as
biodefense research, vaccine stockpiling, disease surveillance networks,
and response planning infrastructure. On June 12, 2002, Bush outlined
this far-reaching approach in his remarks accompanying the signing of
the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response
Act of 2002: "Bioterrorism is a real threat to our country. It's a
threat to every nation that loves freedom. Terrorist groups seek
biological weapons; we know some rogue states already have them.... It's
important that we confront these real threats to our country and prepare
for future emergencies" (Bush 2002c). The quote illustrates the key
logic of preparedness---it assumes the inevitability of catastrophes
like bioterrorism and opts to prepare for their aftermath (Ben Anderson
2010).27 [Moreover, the degree of resources devoted to preparing for a
given catastrophe is determined not by the catastrophe's probability of
occurrence, but by its potential magnitude; **thus, threats viewed as
low probability, high impact**]{.underline}---**[like
bioterrorism]{.underline}**---**[garnered massive resources that would
otherwise be devoted to more frequent, everyday concerns]{.underline}**
(Lakoff 2008b). [Like preemption, preparedness has the effect of making
extreme actions seem necessary, and other options, namely, complete
disarmament and an end to biodefense research, seem
inadequate]{.underline}. Preparedness is an anticipatory mode of
governance that, as social theorist Melinda Cooper (2008) has described,
is highly generative---it calls forth a future that "is effectively
generated de novo out of our collective apprehensiveness" (125).
[Preparedness, then, typified the profound feat of the war on
terror]{.underline}---[its adoption of the narrative of
victimhood]{.underline}. **[To be prepared for outside threats presumed
U.S. fragility,]{.underline}** 28 **[rendering U.S. global aggression
invisible]{.underline}**. [Centuries after European settlers used
biological weapons against Native Americans, the United
States]{.underline}---**[now a white-dominant imperialist nation with an
augmented biowarfare capacity]{.underline}**---[articulated itself as at
the mercy of Iraq, Al Qaeda, and other Arab / Muslim groups and
nations]{.underline}.29

### Cybersecurity Link

#### Cybersecurity materializes the boundary conflicts of peoples, territories, and orders-of-meaning [into constitutive threats that are then installed at the center of security concerns]{.underline} 

**Kaiser, 15** (Robert, Professor of Geography @ Univ.
Wisconsin-Madison, PhD (Geography) from Columbia University, recipient
of a Visiting Fellowship on Estonia and the Birth of Cyberwar @
Aleksanteri Institute via the University of Helsinki; \"The Birth of
Cyberwar,\" *Political Geography*. 46 (2015) 11-20.)

[It is not as if cyberwar had not been conceived of prior to
2007]{.underline}. It [was imaginatively produced in]{.underline}
[**science fiction** novels and films]{.underline}, [from Shockwave
Rider in 1975 (Lesk 2007: 77), to War Games (1983) and Terminator
(1984), capping the period off with the 2007 blockbuster Live Free or
Die Hard, which was playing in theaters in Tallinn during the summer of
the cyberattacks.]{.underline} [The 2007 film is particularly important
here, since it featured a disgruntled former cybersecurity military
analyst who used a broad-based cyberassault to take down the critical
infrastructure (CI) of the United States]{.underline}. [In Tallinn, the
movie **fed into the affective intensity surrounding the riots and
cyberattacks, firing the imagination of policymakers and publics
alike**.]{.underline} [**Cyberwar was** also being **discursively
produced** in political and military **think tanks** beginning in the
early 1990s]{.underline}. One of the first examples of this is the 1993
publication "[Cyberwar is coming!]{.underline}" which recently
celebrated its 20th anniversary ([Arquilla, 2013, Arquilla and Ronfeldt,
1993]{.underline}). This work too [sought to fire the imagination
of]{.underline} its [readers, **spinning out anticipatory cyberwar
scenarios** and advocating a cyberwar **doctrine** to military and
political analysts and other cyberwar "managers of unease]{.underline}"
(Bigo 2002). Published [at]{.underline} about [the same
time]{.underline}, and [foreshadowing the proliferation of drone
strikes]{.underline} in what Gregory, 2011, Gregory, 2014 has called
"the everywhere war," "[Welcome to hyperwar" painted a more dystopian
vision of smart weaponry and war machinery taking over the battlespaces
of the future]{.underline} (Arnett 1992). Later in the 1990s, [due in
part to concerns surrounding Y2K and also to the rising number of denial
of service (DoS) cyberattacks, increasing US governmental attention was
devoted to computer security and the threat posed by
cyberwarfare]{.underline}. In 1998, the Clinton White House issued
Presidential Decision Directive 63 to assess the vulnerabilities of CI
to cyberattack, and followed this up with the National Plan for
Information Systems Protection [in 2000. Titled Defending America\'s
Cyberspace, this document presented cyberspace as a vulnerable dimension
of the sovereign territory needing protection, largely due to the
failure to build in adequate defenses when cyberspace first
emerged.]{.underline} The authors of this document -- including
President Clinton and Richard Clarke, then National Coordinator for
Security, Infrastructure Protection and Counter-Terrorism -- [billed it
as "the first attempt by any national government to design a way to
protect its cyberspace" (White House, 2000, iv), and also sought to fire
the imaginations of their readership, conjuring up a whole host of
cyber-villains meaning to do America harm.]{.underline} We are at risk.
The United States depends more on computers today then ever before ...
We have created a gaping vulnerability in our national security and
economic stability ... We are vulnerable to mischief-making hackers,
hardware and software failures, cyber criminals and, most alarmingly, to
deliberate attack from nation states and terrorists (White House, 2000,
1). These efforts were paralleled by Congressional hearings on the
threat of cyberwar and America\'s preparedness -- or lack thereof -- to
counter it (e.g., US House of Representatives, 2000). [The increasing
academic, political and popular attention paid to cyberwar was matched
by a growing number of high profile cyberattacks]{.underline}. In 1998,
[Tamil 'hacktivists' organized an email inundation campaign of Sri
Lankan embassies]{.underline}. In 1999, [Chinese hackers responded to
the US bombardment of China\'s Embassy in Belgrade by attacking the
American Embassy\'s webpage in Beijing]{.underline}. [In 2000, Israeli
and Palestinian hackers attacked the websites of Hezbollah and Israel\'s
Foreign Ministry respectively, and American and Chinese hackers
exchanged broad-based attacks against Chinese and US websites following
the downing of an American spy plane over Chinese territorial waters in
2001]{.underline} (Denning, 2001, Lesk, 2007). On the cusp of the new
millennium, **[a rapid escalation and intensification of discursive
practices were working to materialize cyberwar as a new policy
object]{.underline}**. The events of [September 11]{.underline}, 2001
[changed all that, as the]{.underline} "global [war on
terror]{.underline}" (GWOT) [remade the security landscape]{.underline}.
[Initiatives begun to prepare for cyberwarfare were shelved, meetings
were canceled, and "critical infrastructure protection" shifted from
cyberspace to more conventional spaces of security]{.underline}.
Although some policy documents and studies continued to be produced
(e.g., Billo and Chang, 2004, Clarke and Knake, 2010, 120),
[cyberspace]{.underline} and cybersecurity themselves [were re-imagined
and re-purposed to combat global terrorist networks]{.underline}, and
were folded into and made an integral part of the Patriot Act of 2001
and the Department of Homeland Security in 2002. [If cyberwar\'s
performative materialization had been preempted by the GWOT in the
United States, in Europe it had not yet been taken up]{.underline}.
Although the Council of Europe had passed a Convention on Cybercrime in
2001, **[cyberwar itself was not considered]{.underline}**. And [**at
NATO\'s 2002 Prague Summit**, which went to great lengths in discussing
the ways NATO needed to transform and adapt in the wake of 9/11,
cybersecurity was barely mentioned]{.underline} (NATO, 2002). **[The
birth of cyberwar would have to await both the declining importance of
terror as a policy object and a catalyzing event.]{.underline}** The
birth of cyberwar On 26 April 2007, [workers under orders from the
Estonian government began the process of removing a bronze soldier
statue and the bodies of Red Army soldiers from a public park in
Tallinn]{.underline}. [The monument, built to commemorate the Red
Army\'s liberation of Tallinn during WWII, had become the site of
intensifying contestation between self-identifying Russians and others
who felt **disenfranchised** in independent Estonia, and **Estonian**
**nationalists** who viewed the USSR, Russia, and Russians as unwanted
occupiers of their national homeland]{.underline} (Bruggemann and
Kasekamp, 2008, Kaiser, 2012, Lehti et al., 2008, LICHR., 2007, Paabo,
2008). [Throughout April 26th, a crowd of protesters gathered, growing
larger and angrier by nightfall. Rioting erupted at the site and spread
to Old Town, continuing off and on for two days, in an event named the
Bronze Night]{.underline}. Beginning on April 27 and lasting until
mid-May[, a series of cyberattacks were launched against governmental,
media, banking and political party websites, in a politically motivated
effort to participate in the Bronze Night and extend it into cyberspace.
Estonia\'s political and military elite, as well as news media, **blamed
Russia** and a disloyal fifth column of Russians living in Estonia for
both the riots and the cyberattacks, "remediating]{.underline}" (Grusin
2004) [the latter as a cyberwar launched by Russia against Estonia. A
cyberwar resonance machine quickly developed throughout western security
assemblages, and by the end of May 2007 the cyberattacks were being
widely hailed as the world\'s first cyberwar]{.underline} (BBC, 2007,
Kirk, 2007, Landler and Markoff, 2007, Mite, 2007, Tanner, 2007,
Traynor, 2007). First, it is important to acknowledge that if [this
event had happened immediately after 9/11, its affective capacity would
almost certainly not have been sufficient to actualize
cyberwar.]{.underline} [Coming at a time when public and political
support for the GWOT had significantly waned provided the event with the
temporal distance needed for cyberwar managers of unease to capture the
imagination of western policymakers and publics.]{.underline} However,
not just any cyberattack would do. Both **[the sociospatial context of
the event]{.underline}**, and also how it was managed, [**were critical
for the production of resonance.** The success of Estonia\'s
cyberwarriors "in providing a compelling narrative for their
analysis]{.underline}" (Salter, 2008, 237) [may be attributed to their
**performative enactment of a familiar** and believable **set of Cold
War** place-**identities** featuring Russia and **Russian-ness as enemy
Other of Estonia, Europe and the US**]{.underline}, and Estonia and
Estonian-ness as small, vulnerable victim. **[Western imaginations,
primed for such a threat scenario, were easily captured]{.underline}**
(Blank, 2008, Davis, 2007, Robert, 2012, Ruus, 2008, Weiss, 2007).
Waking the World Up to Cyberwar World governments are trying to figure
out how to defend themselves against cyber-warfare, and Estonia leads
the way (Public Radio International, 2010). That cyberspace "makes us
vulnerable" is a central characteristic of cybersecurity discourse, and
the more technologically advanced, the more vulnerable one is imagined
to be (Bernard-Wills and Ashenden 2012, 118). [Since independence
Estonia had become one of the most wired countries in the world, and in
this regard at least is imagined to occupy a future timespace toward
which the rest of the world is headed]{.underline}. This, [coupled with
Estonia\'s small size and location on the border of Europe\'s 'Other',
was prominently featured in explanations of why the cyberattacks had
occurred]{.underline}. [This "architecture of enmity]{.underline}"
(Amoore, 2009) [**displaced** the internal place-identity conflicts
between Russian-ness and Estonian-ness that produced the Bronze Night,
even as it remediated the cyberattacks into the world\'s first
cyberwar]{.underline}. Estonia as a small, modern, technology-savvy
country was an ideal test-ground for cyberattackers with political
motivations ... Estonia happened to experience the first large-scale
attacks, but ... vulnerabilities are growing in both the developed and
developing world (Tiirmaa-Klaar, 2011a, 1--2). **[The 2007 cyberattacks
were universally described in media, in official documents and by
cybersecurity specialists as a "wakeup call."]{.underline}** The first
question confronting policymakers charged with defending against the
cyberattacks was whether or not to issue the call, to go public. Given
the widespread use of the sites that were targeted, the cyberattacks
would have been difficult to deny. [A debate within government circles
occurred, and the decision to go public owed as much to international as
to domestic considerations]{.underline}. This event seemed to be just
what western cyberwar managers of unease were waiting for: Here we had
this example of cyberattacks actually being part of a political
campaign, affecting the whole of society ... In the United States lots
of agencies and lots of people recognized the problem (of cyberwar) but
were not successful in communicating it. Or were unable because of
classification reasons to communicate it. And now we have Estonia who is
willing to communicate it and to use their country as an example of what
may happen. And I think [Estonia and the United States]{.underline}
[together]{.underline} [sort of ... I mean, the level of conferences I
participated in after 2007 was just insane. We were in the Air Force
national conference with thousands of very high-ranking officers, we
were briefing Congress, we were briefing the White House, at the very
highest level]{.underline} (Interview, [former Estonian Defense Ministry
official]{.underline}, Tallinn, October 2012). [President Ilves took the
lead in issuing the wakeup call, and in remediating the cyberattacks as
a cyberwar launched by Russia -- imagined as the constitutive outside of
the civilized spaces of Estonia and Europe]{.underline}: ["Finally, I
turn to Russia, Estonia\'s neighbour, with a clear message -- **try to
remain civilized!** It is not customary in Europe to use computers
belonging to public institutions for cyber-attacks against another
country\'s public institutions" (Ilves, 2007a]{.underline}). [Describing
the Bronze Night as "the greatest challenge to the security" of Estonia
since independence and the cyberattacks as "cyber-war" (Ilves, 2007b),
Ilves proclaimed that "Estonia was attacked with a weapon and in a
manner whose full significance is just beginning to dawn on the whole
world in the 21st century"]{.underline} (Ilves, 2007c). Former
**[Defense Minister Aaviksoo raised the issue of invoking Article
5]{.underline}** (common defense) **[with NATO while the event was still
underway]{.underline}** (Traynor, 2007), and asserted that "[what took
place was according to our interpretation cyber warfare and cyber
terrorism. In essence, cyberattacks against Estonia demonstrated that
the Internet already is a perfect battlefield of the 21st
century]{.underline}" (Aaviksoo 2007a). **[Although]{.underline}**
"**[NATO\'s political leaders judged that the cyberattacks were not an
act of war, NATO\'s Department of Public Diplomacy later created a short
film about the episode entitled War in Cyberspace]{.underline}**"
(Singer and Friedman 2014, 122), **[allowing Estonia\'s cyberwarriors a
NATO-sanctioned platform from which to present their 'compelling
narrative'.]{.underline}** Following Derrida, Burke (2002, 4--5) defines
an [aporia as "an untotalizable problem at the heart of the concept,
disrupting its trajectory, emptying out its fullness, opening out its
closure]{.underline}." He identifies two interlocking aporias of
security: first, [that claims to universal security for all humans **are
challenged by a foundational "aporetic distance between our 'humanity'
and a secure identity bounded and defined by the state**]{.underline};"
and second, that [securing oneself "must be purchased at the expense of
another]{.underline}" (Burke, 2002, 6). **[These aporias are central to
the performative enactment of our sociospatial selves]{.underline}**,
[which are bordered against a constitutive outside that is both totally
excluded and at the same time occupies the very center of our
place-identities]{.underline} (Butler, 1993, Kaiser, 2014, Kaiser and
Nikiforova, 2008). **[The 2007 events that materialized cyberwar as a
new policy object were created by these aporias of
security]{.underline}**, **[and at the same time embedded them at the
very heart of cybersecurity.]{.underline}** [The Bronze Night and the
accompanying cyberattacks were a '**war event'** that ruptured the
surface calm in Estonian society, exposing the ways in which Russia and
Russian-ness performatively materialize as the constitutive outside of
Estonia and Estonian-ness through a wide range of everyday discursive
practices, and without which Estonia and Estonian-ness could not exist
in their present for]{.underline}m (Feldman, 2001, Kaiser, 2014, Kaiser
and Nikiforova, 2008). Through these performative enactments, Estonia\'s
and Estonians\' security are purchased at the expense of Russia and
Russians (Feldman, 2001, Kuus, 2004). [Both the Bronze Night and the
cyberattacks were remediated as acts of war, attacks on Estonia\'s
sovereignty by Russia and a disloyal fifth column of **Russian enemy
Others within**]{.underline} (Kaiser 2012). **[Cyberwar\'s
materialization through this event carried this aporia of security into
cyberspace, and helped to reconstitute a familiar geopolitical imaginary
from the Cold War in cyberspace, now conceived as a battlespace where
states -- aligned into camps of western defenders and eastern attackers
-- wage cyberwar]{.underline}**. "Of course, you know, when you look on
the map, then it\'s very clear. Estonia\'s a small nation but we have to
be concerned about our neighbors. **[Thank God we are now members of
NATO and the EU, and we are not alone anymore. And in cyberwar we are
not alone too" (Interview, Cyber Defense League, Tallinn, May
2011]{.underline}**). Within this battlespace, [Estonia is imagined as
occupying a vulnerable border between East and West, where cyberwar is
an ever-present threat]{.underline}. This danger is also seen as an
opportunity: "[We are still living between the East and the West -- we
are a playground for bad guys ... We are looking to increase cooperation
with the US. Why should the US cooperate with us? Because we are on the
border. If something happens, we can give you a warning that something
is coming" (Interview, Cyber Defense League, Tallinn, September
2012]{.underline}). Bigo argues that **[those acknowledged as security
experts "transfer the legitimacy they gain from struggles]{.underline}**
against terrorists, criminals, spies, and counterfeiters [toward other
targets, most notably transnational political activists,]{.underline}
people crossing borders, or people born in the country but with foreign
parents" (Bigo 2002, 63). However, **[given]{.underline}** the aporias
of security, and [**the reiterative citationality of security
practices**, it seems more accurate to assert that the **managers of
unease** derive their status **as** **security experts** from **the
boundary effects that performatively materialize such threatening
Others**]{.underline}, [who in turn become embedded at the very core of
the security discourse that such specialists claim expertise
over.]{.underline} **[Securitization is thus a border performative,
continually producing insecurity within the population and territory
that must then be secured]{.underline}**. [Insecurity can never be
banished and security finally procured, since insecurity occupies the
very heart of securitization practices, with security itself always
occupying the promised timespace of the future]{.underline} (Anderson,
2010a). **[The cyberattacks]{.underline}**, re-imagined as a cyberwar
launched against a small, technologically advanced state by a large and
aggressive neighbor, **[displaced the problematic relationship between
Estonian nationalists in power and self-identifying Russians who felt
victimized in independent Estonia]{.underline}** [that produced the
Bronze Night\'s actualization and the cyberattacks themselves. **The
remediation of the cyberattacks as Russia engaging in
cyberwar**]{.underline} against Estonia and the West also transposed a
familiar geopolitical b/ordering onto cyberspace: Estonia/Estonian-ness
-- good guys, small but capable cyberdefenders of 'the West' vs.
Russia/Russian-ness -- bad guys, perpetrators of cyberwar, 'the East'.
At the same time, the event **[provided]{.underline}** Estonian
**[security professionals an important opportunity to reiterate to

### Cyberwar Link

#### Computational propaganda mystifies occupations and conflicts to make any coherent theory of warfare or alliances impossible. In the sea of misattribution, there is always another opinion, and [the inescapably provisional and easily falsified nature of all accounts of cyberwar energizes the death of meaning itself]{.underline}. In the face of the opacity of cyberconflict, [desire tends toward militarized paranoia]{.underline}, accepting the experts of Empire just as easily as fake news. The impact is a global civil war operating at every level that far surpasses any Russian threat.

[Within cyberwar apparatuses]{.underline}, [humans]{.underline}, for the
moment, remain a necessary link or relay enlisted in multiple ways,
voluntary and involuntary. Yet while humans [remain in the
loop]{.underline}, or on the loop (that is to say, with a veto on
otherwise automatic processes), [it is within a war-fighting system that
increasingly decenters subjectivity as a "peripheral]{.underline}"
(Gibson 2015)[.]{.underline} Because of this, [the human subject of
cyberwar is dazed and confused]{.underline}. This is in part [a
consequence of the]{.underline} intentional **[secrecy of
cyberwar]{.underline}**, but the possibilities of such stealth[, and its
intensification by contingency and accident]{.underline}, arise from the
speed, scope, and complexity of the technology of cyberwar apparatuses.
Deeply [implicated]{.underline} as [users]{.underline} are [in the
militarization of networks]{.underline}, their [involvement is
frequently unknowing]{.underline} or misrecognized. [We are indeed
"empowered" by technology---but not necessarily in the way we are told.
Rather than acting as globally aware networked individuals, intervening
purposefully in great political events with a few deft touches to an
iPhone, our cyberwar involvement is as likely to be a misapprehending,
deceived, or involuntary conduit for war whose outbreak has either
passed by unnoticed or was only imagined]{.underline} (at least until
this imagined onset provoked real counteraction), [or whose combatants
are drastically misidentified.]{.underline} [In conflicts where a
crucial action may be the opening of virally contaminated email, the
retweeting of a message from a software agent mistaken for a human, or
the invisible contribution of a hijacked computer (or digitalized
refrigerator) to a massive botnet, we are in the realm of Marx's "they
do it, but they do not know it]{.underline}." "[Even if you do not see
the war, the war sees you" is the logic of the]{.underline} ~~blind~~
\[[unknowing\] gaze of]{.underline} [cyberwar]{.underline}, **[a regime
in which although "the subject does not see where \[this regime\] is
leading, he follows]{.underline}**" (Lacan 1998, 75). [The obscurity
inherent to cyberwar afflicts even those most expert in its
prosecution.]{.underline} [During the U.S. occupation of
Iraq]{.underline}, [the **CIA** and Saudi Arabia's
intelligence]{.underline} [service]{.underline} [set up a "fake" jihadi
website]{.underline} [to monitor Islamic extremist
activity]{.underline}. In 2008, [the]{.underline} U.S. Army and the
**[NSA]{.underline}** **[concluded that the "fake" site
was]{.underline}** **[actually serving as an operational planning hub
for attacks by Saudi Arabian jihadists]{.underline}** joining the Sunni
insurgency. [When they proposed the site be destroyed, the CIA objected,
but Pentagon hackers proceeded with the "take-down]{.underline}."
**[They inadvertently disrupted more than three hundred servers in Saudi
Arabia, Germany, and Texas.]{.underline}** As a task force participant
ruefully explained, "to take down a Web site that is up in Country X,
because [the cyber-world knows no boundaries,]{.underline} you may end
up taking out a server that is located in Country Y." [The Saudi Arabian
intelligence service, which regarded the "fake" site as a "boon," was
furious; mollification required "a lot of bowing and
scraping."]{.underline} **[The CIA]{.underline}**, too, **[was
resentful;]{.underline}** **[the agency "understood]{.underline}** that
intelligence would be lost, and it was; that relationships with
cooperating intelligence services would be damaged, and they were; and
that **[the terrorists would migrate to other sites, and they
did]{.underline}**" (Nakashima 2010[). A more serious
example]{.underline} of unintended consequences [is Stuxnet, the
computer worm planted in the computers at the uranium enrichment plant
outside Natanz to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb, an
operation now widely attributed to a joint U.S.--Israeli intelligence
operation. As]{.underline} we noted in chapter 1, the worm's impeccable
simulation of a mechanical failure apparently unrelated to software
performance is considered a watershed in the development of
cyberweaponry. What it is not so generally recognized, however, is that
it [went out of control]{.underline}. [Stuxnet's discovery by the
security company VirusBlokAda in mid-June 2010 was the result of the
virus accidentally spreading beyond its intended target due to a
programming error introduced in an update. This allowed the worm to
enter into an engineer's computer connected to the centrifuges and
thence travel to the internet. It then propagated to industrial sites
far from Natanz, not only in Iran but in Indonesia and India, and
beyond, reportedly infecting the systems of oil giant Chevron and a
Russian nuclear plant.]{.underline} As one cybersecurity expert puts it,
"[By allowing Stuxnet to spread globally, its authors committed
collateral damage worldwide]{.underline}" (Schneier 2010). Although in
many of these cases, the virus did not activate, because of differences
between the Natanz system it targeted and the others it accidentally
infected, another consequence was that [the Stuxnet code became widely
available for use or adaptation by hackers other than those who
developed it]{.underline}. [Such]{.underline} [probably inadvertent
propagation can be considered what Paul Virilio (2000) terms **an
"integral accident**," a malfunction intrinsic to, and **inevitable**
**for, viral cyberweapons**]{.underline}.15 [Once one passes to the
civilian perception of real or imagined cyberwar effects, the scope for
misrecognition increases and potentially ranges **from imagining wars
where none exists to not noticing those that are actually
raging**]{.underline}. Zetter (2016b) reports [**a "misrecognized"
attack on a power grid in Ukraine** that occurred on December 23, 2015,
when twenty-seven substations of the Prykarpattya Oblenergo, a Ukrainian
power distributor that serves 538,000 customers, went dead after the
company's computers were infected by a version of a high-powered
web-based malware BlackEnergy 3, in what is generally regarded as an act
of Russian aggression, although the attribution, **as always, is
inconclusive**]{.underline}. [The cyberevent attracted the attention of
cybersecurity and hacking communities]{.underline}: the blogosphere and
specialized online channels and platforms competed for the most informed
interpretation of the blackout. **[In Ukraine, however, where the
cyberattack took place, it was unnoticed,]{.underline}** [despite
successfully plunging hundreds of cities and villages into
darkness.]{.underline} With the exception of security, administration,
and technical personnel of the power station, [the local population took
the blackout for a common power shutdown, a nationally centralized
procedure aimed at saving electricity in the country's declining and
war-afflicted economy]{.underline}. In a reverse example, [in August
2008]{.underline}, [cyberattacks took place in the midst of a broader
**armed conflict** between Russia and Georgia]{.underline} [over the
disputed territory of South Ossetia]{.underline}. [Although these
attacks, allegedly coordinated or encouraged by the Russian state, did
not significantly affect the ongoing kinetic action, distribution of
malicious software; defacement of political, governmental, and financial
websites; and multiple DoS and DDoS attacks on governmental, financial,
news, and media websites generated confusion and panic among the
population of the country at a time when "Georgia was the most dependent
on the availability of information channels]{.underline}" (Tikk, Kaska,
and Vihul 2010, 69--79, 72). Then, on March 28, 2011, the internet in
Georgia and Armenia went down for nearly the entire day after a
seventy-five- year- old Georgian woman named Hayastan Shakarian, while
digging for scrap copper, accidentally cut a fiber-optic cable owned by
Georgian Railway Telecom that runs through the two countries (Millar
2011). [It would not have been too strange if, to a traumatized wartime
population, this accident had signaled another kinetic
offensive]{.underline} (Deibert 2013, 29). [How many times would such
suspicions need to be shared and commented on in social networks to
become someone's "knowledge"? To scale and speed up to the status of
"fake news"?]{.underline} To serve as a useful context or leverage for a
future cyberattack? To premediate an invasion? **[The cybernetic
autopoiesis of unplanned and undesired incidents, unavoidable and
unpreventable accidents, as well as the masterminded and preplanned
operations constitute the ongoing production of events and semblances
constitutive of cyberwar dynamics]{.underline}**. [Everything, even what
did not have place, did not happen, or was misattributed, has a positive
value in the cyberwar economy.]{.underline} **[This trompe l'oeil
creates ~~blind~~ spots in the field of vision of all observers of
cyberwar.]{.underline}**16 It **[accelerates]{.underline}** what Žižek
(1999, 322) calls **[the "decline of symbolic efficiency" in digital
capitalism.]{.underline}** As Jodi Dean (2014, 213) explains, this
develops the Lacanian idea that [there is no longer a **Master-Signifier
that stabilizes meaning**,]{.underline} th[at knits together the chain
of signifiers and hinders their tendencies to float off into
indeterminacy]{.underline}. While **[the absence]{.underline}** of such
a [master might seem to produce a situation of complete openness and
freedom---no authority is telling the subject what to do, what to
desire, how to structure its choices]{.underline}---Žižek argues that in
fact [the result is unbearable, suffocating closure]{.underline}. [A
"setting of electronically mediated subjectivity]{.underline} \[that\]
[is one of]{.underline} infinite doubt and [ultimate reflexifisation"
intensifies "the fundamental uncertainty accompanying the impossibility
of totalization" in a symbolic environment where "**there is always
another option, link, opinion**, **nuance** or contingency that we
haven't taken into account"]{.underline} (Dean 2014, 212).
**[Computational propaganda that aims to mystify invasions and
occupations, or promote cynical disaffection from an adversary's
political system, actively weaponizes the "decline in symbolic
efficiency," but it is endemic to the whole field of
cyberwar.]{.underline}** [The extreme uncertainty and opacity of
cyberwar do not]{.underline}, however, [inhibit the interpellative
effects of contending cyberwar apparatuses as they summon up
cybersoldiers, patriotic hackers, vigilante militias, and
security-conscious digital citizens. On the]{.underline} [contrary, the
problems of **verifying or disproving**]{.underline} multiple alarms and
accusations **[accelerates these processes and puts them into
overdrive]{.underline}**. To put this point in psychoanalytic terms, as
we noted previously, commentators on Althusser have criticized the
appropriation of Lacan's theories of the subject in his account of ISAs.
These critics point out that what Althusser misses in Lacan's account is
that [the subject is always incomplete; it is precisely what can never
be fixed by a specific subject position or identity]{.underline}.
However, [the implication of this incompletion is not that the subject
remains some untouched and primordial haven of authenticity but rather
that this lack drives to ever more compulsive]{.underline} (because
[unfulfillable) attempts to attain a definitive identity]{.underline}.
Translating this into political terms, we would say that it is
**[the]{.underline}** inescapably **[incomplete]{.underline}**,
provisional, **[and easily falsified nature of all accounts of
cyberwar]{.underline}** that **[energizes]{.underline}** the adoption of
**[increasingly militarized, extreme, paranoid, and unshakable subject
positions vis-à- vis its alleged events]{.underline}**. [For example,
shortly after the outbreak of the rebellion that grew into the Syrian
civil war, there was an abrupt but near-total shutdown of the Syrian
internet]{.underline}. [A]{.underline} [common]{.underline}
[assumption]{.underline}, at least [in the West, was that this was an
attempt by the Assad regime]{.underline} [to black out online dissent,
as Mubarak had attempted in Egypt]{.underline}. **[But]{.underline}**
**[according to Edward Snowden]{.underline}**, **[the event was caused
by intrusion into the system conducted by the NSA]{.underline}**---[not
intentionally, however, but **by accident**, **in a botched hack of the
Syrian state's communication** and electronic defense
system]{.underline} (Ackerman 2014). [Whereas the first attribution cast
the Assad regime in the conventional role of despotic suppressor of
civil rights, rightly opposed by liberal democracies, the second
reversed the significance of the blackout**, making it evidence
of---once again---NSA cyberaggression against foreign states, and
incompetent aggression at that.**]{.underline} But those opposed to this
characterization could point out that at the time Snowden made his
diagnosis, he was reliant on Russia, a supporter of the Assad regime,
for political asylum. [The blackout of Syria's internet connection thus
also **becomes an epistemological blackout** about its cause, a blackout
in which **every** initial **position** on the politics of Syria's civil
war **could be preserved and reinforced**.]{.underline} To provide a
final example that is closer to home for many readers, as we suggested
in chapter 1, [there is now fairly convincing evidence that Russian
intelligence agencies, whether directly or by proxy, attempted some
intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by way of "fake
news." It is also clear that some of the news reports claiming to
substantiate or expand this claim, by claiming, for example, to detect
Russian hackers in Vermont's power grid or by broadly characterizing a
sweepingly wide range of U.S. media outlets as accomplices of Russian
cyberwar, are inaccurate and tendentious.]{.underline} **[The abyss of
this double falsification]{.underline}**---" **[fake news" compounding
"fake news"---becomes a zero-gravity free-fire zone within which
contending factions within the U.S. political system trade charges of
treason, producing a civil war effect possibly beyond the wildest dreams
of the toilers at the dreary offices of St. Petersburg's Internet
Research Group.]{.underline}**

#### Cyberwar reveals the [collapse of meaning]{.underline} through [informatic erasure]{.underline}, as all information becomes flooded with computational propaganda where [militarized digital catastrophe shapes the present by its future possibility]{.underline} that mirrors and exceeds nuclear war.

Minnesota Press, 2018) \*modified for ableist language

The systems that are attacked through cyberwar are dual entities: on one
hand, they are defined by a series of connections, and on the other
hand, they are defined by the text of programs and messages that are
sent through the network. The networked structure of the global Internet
allows malicious programs to quickly propagate, but it is the insecurity
of individual systems and the computer programs they run that are
exploited to attack these networks. [Without the insecurity
of]{.underline} these [programs and messages]{.underline}, [cyberwar
would never be a strategic possibility]{.underline}. While [computer
programs are often considered to be]{.underline} overly
[deterministic]{.underline} and simply a series of rules for a machine
to follow, [the very existence of cyberwar suggests that programs are
not so straightforward]{.underline}. [Programming is a textual and
**linguistic practice** that is always carried out in languages and at
levels of complexity that preclude complete mastery over what is
written]{.underline}. [Cyberwar infiltrates and subverts these programs,
turning the **text** and logic of the program **against
itself**]{.underline}. [To fully grasp what is at stake in cyberwar, it
is then critical to understand the logic of writing, especially the
logic of writing at its most vulnerable]{.underline}. In this light,
[**cyberwar** is ultimately a process of deconstructing programs and
undermining them from within their own logical and linguistic
systems]{.underline}. As such, it [**is a form of writing itself**, a
writing that is aimed at both **shoring up and deconstructing** **other
texts**]{.underline}. To understand **[cyberwar]{.underline}** in this
way, then, also requires a reconceptualization of deconstruction and its
functioning. [Admitting the textual nature of code and the machinic
force of deconstruction overwhelms any attempt to maintain that
deconstruction has ever been an exclusively **theoretical** matter or
could ever be secured against its possible usage by **the state and
military.**]{.underline} [Cyberwar]{.underline}, [in harnessing and
exploiting the vulnerable and machinic nature of writing, is thus both a
form of deconstruction and a deconstructive threat to deconstruction
itself.]{.underline} Still, this threat to deconstruction and the logic
of writing does not spell the end of deconstruction but rather
guarantees its continued importance to the history of both writing and
metaphysics. GLIMPSES OF THE FUTURE CATASTROPHE One of [the earliest
glimpses of]{.underline} the possible impact of an [all-­out
cyberwar]{.underline} [occurred in June 1997]{.underline}. [A small team
of hackers]{.underline} [using publicly available tools]{.underline} and
programs [was supposedly able to gain access to the]{.underline} power
[grid in nine]{.underline} U.S. [cities]{.underline}, those cities'
emergency response systems, [and]{.underline} a number of [critical
Pentagon networks, including]{.underline} those that managed [military
supply chains and the command-­ and-­ control structure.]{.underline}
According to James Adams, who has written at length about these attacks,
[the]{.underline} [hackers]{.underline} also [managed to infect the
human command-­ and-­ control system with a ~~paralyzing~~ level of
mistrust.]{.underline} Orders that appeared to come from a commanding
general were fake, as were bogus news reports on the crisis and
instructions from the civilian command authorities. As a result, [nobody
in the chain of command, from the president on down, could believe
anything.]{.underline} [This group of hackers using publicly available
resources was able to prevent the United States from waging war
effectively.]{.underline}1 Luckily, [**the** series of **attacks**,
which have been code-­ named Eligible Receiver, **were carried out by the
\[NSA\] National Security Agency as an unannounced test** of military
and civilian digital infrastructure]{.underline}. The attackers, who
were working as part of a No-­Notice Interoperability Exercise Program,
were asked only to prove what was possible and not actually to destroy
anything. Though the military provided no substantial evidence about
Eligible Receiver, aside from interviews with the media and vague
congressional testimony, for a while, [Eligible Receiver was repeatedly
referenced as a brief glimpse of future war and the dark nature of our
digital technologies]{.underline}.2 Of course, there were those who were
sure it [**was** merely **the media-­ security complex displaying its
newest boogeyman.**]{.underline} In a hacking publication titled The
Crypt Newsletter, whose provenance and history seem to have gone the way
of dial-­ up modems but which still lingers in search-­engine-­indexed text
files in various parts of the Internet, [Joseph K refers to Eligible
Receiver as "**a Pentagon ghost story repeated ad nauseum to
journalists** and the easily frightened in which ludicrous or totally
unsubstantiated claims about menaces from cyberspace are passed off as
astonishing deeds of techno-­ legerdemain performed by **cybersoldiers
working within a highly classified wargame.**"]{.underline} Although
Joseph K meant to dismiss Eligible Receiver, the discourse surrounding
it still tells an interesting ghost story, especially if it is treated
as such and read not as baseless but as a myth that functions even
without proof. [John **Arquilla summed up the state of the public
relation** to the event aptly when, in an interview with PBS, he said,
"Eligible Receiver is a classified event about which I can't speak. What
I can say is that when people say there is no existence proof of the
seriousness of the cyber threat, to my mind, Eligible Receiver provides
a convincing existence proof of the nature of the threat that we
face]{.underline}."3 **[This Kafkaesque claim is telling: he cannot tell
us what transpired, but its existence, despite being under classified
erasure, proves his point]{.underline}**. [This event appears in this
light not then as an attack against military information systems but
instead as an attack against our belief in the digital systems that
increasingly provide the fabric of our everyday lives]{.underline}.
Perhaps in Adams's claims that no one could believe anything from the
president on down, we should read a warning that **[we]{.underline}**,
too, **[outside the wargame, can no longer believe
anything---]{.underline}** ­that, **[ultimately, the collapse of the
entire system may already be upon us.]{.underline}** [It takes little
extra imagination to suggest that the implied result is some
catastrophic social collapse, which may already be under way. It is not
merely our military communication technologies that are at stake in
Eligible Receiver but the entirety of society. Computer
systems]{.underline}, especially when seen as data storage devices,
[function to guarantee that past inscriptions persist into the
future]{.underline}. Computer security is often discussed as being
founded on the "CIA triad," standing for confidentiality, integrity, and
access. Confidentially requires that only authorized users have access
to information. Integrity is the need that the information that is put
into a system is the same information that is retrieved, and access
suggests that if authorized users cannot retrieve information, no matter
how secure that information is, the system is useless.4 All of these
function not just in the present but as guarantees of past and future.
[For a system to be secure under these conditions, the system must
assure that the data entered in the past extend into the future and
avoid unauthorized compromise]{.underline}. [Cyberattacks instantly call
all three of these into question in the past, present, and future. **The
futurity of a "real" attack like Eligible Receiver infects our belief in
these systems in the present.**]{.underline} Garrett Schubert, of EMC's
Critical Incident Response Center, tasked with protecting EMC's data
centers from cyberattacks, describes his work directly in relation to a
change in temporality: "**[When I started in my career, the idea was, we
wanted to stop a bad thing from happening. Now, we assume that the bad
thing has already happened.]{.underline}** Every single day, we walk in
and we assume there is an active attack going on."5 **[The future
catastrophe has become a part of the daily operations of our
technologies.]{.underline}** As Parikka claims, **[the inscription of
information in media is the invention of the accident of information
erasure.]{.underline}**6 The database always contains within it the
immanent possibility that the data are, or may be, corrupted. [As much
as this unannounced test exercise may have been a test of military
security, it is also a test of our belief in the future of our digital
world.]{.underline} Joseph K's mocking dismissal then appears, like a
pithy sermon by an unknown sage of our digital belief, to reassure us
that these events are merely phantasms thought up to terrify the
gullible and will never come to pass. At the same time, the complete
dismissal of this ghost story bifurcates the future: on one hand, the
possibility of utter collapse, and on the other, complete faith and
resilience. Likewise, it doubles the structure of belief and skepticism.
[Are the believers those who put faith in our technological world or
those who blindly take the military's word that the catastrophe is
around any corner? If we cannot believe "anyone from the president on
down," how can we believe those who call that belief into
question?]{.underline} THE INFORMATIONAL UNCANNY **[We arrive at an
impasse that mirrors the Cold War nuclear catastrophe, not in terms of
the destruction of life but in terms of the destruction of
meaning.]{.underline}** Though the relationship between the digital and
the symbolic is complex, if the material support of meaning--- be it
magnetic bits, flashes of light in a fiber optic cable, or paper
writing--- is destroyed, then so too is the possibility of meaning. If
the bits that store our digital writing are effaced, so too is any
message they may carry. [A nuclear catastrophe destroys meaning by
destroying potential readers and the material of writing, whereas a
digital catastrophe destroys meaning and inscription by destroying the
microscopic material support]{.underline}. As these digital
communications are entrusted more and more, what is at stake is the
whole system of believing in the integrity of one's information, and
with it the integrity of all systems. We arrive, then, at a similar
situation to what Paul Saint-­Amour refers to as the nuclear uncanny:
"[Because]{.underline} [it offers the possibility of a future without
symptoms, without a symbolic order--- ­ in other words, no future at
all--- the nuclear condition can, in a sense, only cause anticipatory
symptoms]{.underline}."7 Likewise, **[the militarized digital
catastrophe shapes the present by its future possibility.]{.underline}**
Saint-­Amour's argument is helpful in that it places the futurity of such
events clearly in the present. He suggests that [such a catastrophe,
especially because it destroys the symbolic, must produce its effects in
the present]{.underline}. [If this future catastrophe undermines the
symbolic in the present, **we begin to enter a space of what we could
call militarized deconstruction.**]{.underline} [The ability for any
program, database, or text to control its meaning and intent is
instantly destabilized]{.underline}. As Parikka argues, "[apocalypses
reveal new temporalities, new layers for a media archaeology of the
present."]{.underline}8 The possibility of a catastrophe places the full
meaning of programs and networks always in the future but their
symptomatic expression in the present. Their complete **[meaning can
only be understood after their looming breakdown]{.underline}**. In
short, despite the linear and programmatic nature of a program's
execution, [the deferral of meaning and the non-­ self-­ sameness opened
by its potential insecurity guarantee that the relation between the text
of the program and its action in the world is governed by play,
différance, and the impending possibility of its
deconstruction]{.underline}. [**This catastrophic threat** to the future
of databases suggests that they are ultimately shaped by the structure
of what Derrida calls **arche-­writing**]{.underline} ([the originary
structure of non-­ self-­ presence and externalization that shapes all
existence--- the ­ violence of our being in the wor]{.underline}ld). When
Hägglund explains arche-­ writing, we could easily imagine that he is
speaking about a computer rather than a human subject:

#### Cyberwarfare must be understood as fake wars and classified NSA cyberops turning nonwar into war - [a conflict over meaning]{.underline} that erases and rewrites the very archives and epistemes that trace its existence

"INTRODUCTION: Root Kit," Deconstruction machines: Writing in the age of
cyberwar. University of Minnesota Press, 2018)

There is no easily agreed-upon definition of cyberwar. Even within
closely related literatures, [there exists an ongoing debate over what
constitutes cyberwar]{.underline}. Some, such as Rid, who has written at
length declaring **[there is no such thing as cyberwar]{.underline}**,
question whether such a concept is a helpful lens for thinking the
present situation at all.1 The term [cyberwar]{.underline}, in most
invocations, [refers to the notion of cyberspace and the possibility of
a war carried out in this global networked space, wherein computer
systems are taken over to disrupt and surveil an enemy's communication
and networked infrastructure either as part of a "kinetic" war or as a
form of low-level conflict aimed at gaining geopolitical
advantages]{.underline}. Though it is important to follow authors,
strategists, legal scholars, and others wherever they happen to see
"cyberwar" occurring, one particular etymological meaning will guide
this inquiry. The prefix [cyber- refers to the term
cybernetics]{.underline}. **[Cybernetics]{.underline}**, originating
from the Greek kubernētēs ("steersman" or "governor"), [is the science
and study of systems, their structures, regulation, emergent properties,
and possibilities, spanning disciplines from technology to biology to
society]{.underline}. [By explicitly thinking the cyber- in cyberwar as
referring to systems, it will be fruitful to understand cyberwar as a
war against systems: computer systems, state systems, systems of
organization, and even **systems of meaning**.]{.underline} This
etymological understanding of cyberwar closely mirrors some of the
earliest deployments of this term[. One of the first unclassified uses
of the term cyberwar comes from a 1992 publication by
Arnett]{.underline}.2 For him, [the term means the replacement of human
operators with machines that decide on targets, trajectories, movement,
and so on]{.underline}---essentially the culmination of a long history
of the insertion of "intelligent machines" into the arsenal of war
fighting. [That same year, Der Derian used the term "in the sense of a
technologically generated, televisually linked, and strategically gamed
form of violence.]{.underline}"3 Arquilla and Ronfeldt subsequently
published a paper defining cyberwar as a tactical and strategic movement
whereby communication, information, and the visibility of the
battlespace become the central concern. They assert that while
information technology brings [cyberwar]{.underline} to the fore, it [is
not necessarily a technological phenomenon]{.underline}. In fact, [the
exemplary case of cyberwar]{.underline} they recount [is a
thirteenth-century Mongol offensive against Khwarizm, where the Mongols
succeeded in defeating a significantly larger army by cutting off
communications and disrupting the control of forces]{.underline}. These
definitions complement each other. Der Derian and Arnett's definitions
focus on carrying out a kinetic war through the cybernetic organization
of humans and technology, while Arquilla and Ronfeldt's definition
stresses disrupting all of the enemy's cybernetic systems regardless of
whether they are human, technological, or a combination[. We are faced,
then, with something much more expansive than war in cyberspace; rather,
what these authors begin to explore in the early 1990s is an
understanding of war in which one tries to construct and defend systems
of communicating, knowing, controlling, and, ultimately,
existing]{.underline}. Simultaneously, one attempts to disrupt,
infiltrate, corrupt, and destroy these same systems belonging to the
enemy. Arquilla and Ronfeldt state that such a strategy "may aim to
confound people's fundamental beliefs about the nature of their culture,
society, and government, partly to foment fear but perhaps mainly to
disorient people and unhinge their perceptions."4 **[Clearly this is not
completely new]{.underline}**. [Belligerents have always attempted to
deceive their opponents and disrupt economies and
governments]{.underline}. Furthermore, war has often had as a central
objective the destruction of one critical system and the infiltration of
another: the body and the territory of the opponent. Despite this, we
can outline three critical factors that mark cyberwar as a historical
shift. First, proponents of cyberwar, such as Arquilla and Ronfeldt,
stress that [in cyberwar, information and structures of knowing become
central rather than peripheral to conflict]{.underline}. They say that
[cyberwar "means disrupting if not destroying the information and
communications systems, broadly defined to include even military
culture, on which an adversary relies in order to know
itself]{.underline}."5 Second, [cyberwar attempts to disrupt not only
the enemy's knowledge but also the entire structure of
knowledge]{.underline}. In short, **[cyberwar invests epistemology
itself as a battlespace.]{.underline}** Third, [cyberwar seeps outside
of "war" proper]{.underline}. [In calling into question modes of
knowing, cyberwar breaks down the limits of the time and space of
war]{.underline}. Thus the term **[cyberwar describes two distinct but
related phenomena]{.underline}**. On one hand, [it is a strategy for
fighting war, and we will include whatever is named cyberwar by
strategists, legal theorists, authors, and warriors. On the other hand,
we will mean a historical shift---in a sense, a global cyberwar that
marks a tendency whereby the critical element in war becomes the flow of
information and the fortification and disruption of
system]{.underline}s. In making this shift, [cyberwar has opened an
**epistemological** and **cybernetic** **battlespace** wherein **notions
of war**, enmity, and knowing become **directly**
**contestable**]{.underline}. While these concepts have always been
unstable and problematic, [**cyberwar seizes them as systems of direct
military intervention**, turning what was once a question for
**philosophers into a domain of the global battlespace**]{.underline}.
In its most abstract sense, **[cyberwar has become an event that calls
everything including itself into question at the moment it
arrives]{.underline}**. It is the historical possibility that all
systems may break down---or, in their military occupation, be caused to
break down---but [it is also possible that cyberwar may undermine itself
before anything actually "happens]{.underline}." **[Cyberwar as
historical event marks a moment of radical militarized
unknowability.]{.underline}** Many [discussions of cyberwar, be they
historical, strategic, or legal, begin not with the earliest examples or
contemporary attacks but rather with a **future catastrophe** that
demonstrates the danger of our overreliance on vast, connected, yet
vulnerable systems]{.underline}. [These catastrophes normally start with
a **nonstate actor or** a "**rogue**" **state** hacking into key
networks, destroying critical infrastructure in the **United States** or
multiple **European countries.**]{.underline} [Airplanes crash into each
other, trains derail, communication channels shut down, and electrical
systems are disabled]{.underline}. Not only are these systems forced to
shut down but they are hijacked and made to spin out of control,
sometimes destroying themselves so completely that they would take
months to return to normal usage. [These **imagined** **scenarios**
often place the reader at the time immediately following the
catastrophe.]{.underline} At this point in time, one can survey the
wreckage of our technological hubris before the aftermath begins in
earnest. [It is the moment when the full scale of a possible collapse is
revealed but not yet realized]{.underline}.6 **[Where a historical
account begins in the past, it often starts with a CIA attempt to
secretly destroy a Soviet gas pipeline]{.underline}**.7 According to
Thomas Reed, a National Security Council staffer, [in 1982, the CIA was
able to insert an intentionally faulty piece of code into a pump that
the Soviet Union obtained from a Canadian company]{.underline}.
According to Reed's account, [the pump was installed in the
Trans-Siberian gas pipeline; varying pump speeds and valve settings
produced extreme pressures that caused an explosion large enough to be
detected by U.S. satellites]{.underline}. [The secret introduction of a
so-called logic bomb---a somewhat antiquated term for a malicious piece
of code inserted into software---has been touted by a number of
commentators as one of the earliest examples of cyberwar]{.underline}.
Although Reed, who made this story public for the first time in a 2004
book, never referred to this attack as cyberwar, this story has become
something of an origin myth for those who write about cyberwar more
generally.8 [**The event prefigures**]{.underline} a number of issues
that arise again and again in the myriad **[discourses surrounding
cyberwar.]{.underline}** Most important, it becomes clear how vulnerable
complex systems of computation have become. These [systems aggregate
code written across the globe and parts manufactured outside the purview
of their owners into complex networks that belie attempts to control
them. Computation is exposed to the exterior places in which it is
produced.]{.underline} Furthermore, [even if unintentionally, the use of
this event as the first in a series of international cyberattacks offers
an answer to a question that is often asked of theorists of cyberwar:
how can such an event lay claim to being "war"? **Is this merely
sabotage?**]{.underline} [Placing the origin in the Cold
War]{.underline} responds to those critics of cyberwar hype who believe
it is nothing more than a collection of high-tech tools in service of
the ancient techniques of spying, deception, and sabotage. For [the Cold
War proved that wars need not be explosive and could consist of decades
of low-level conflict]{.underline}. [As Virilio says of the threat posed
by nuclear weapons, "the weapon's serious danger is not that it could
explode tomorrow. . . but that for thirty years it has been destroying
society]{.underline}."9 The bomb's destructive power has been felt
directly through its threat. Likewise[, as can be seen in the futuristic
scenarios described earlier, cyberwar seems always to threaten
catastrophe]{.underline}. **[Placing cyberwar's origins in the Cold War
suggests the possibility of a nonwar that is as destructive as a kinetic
war.]{.underline}** The second half of the twentieth century has
demonstrated that even in the absence of a hot war, conflict can destroy
governments and societies. Furthermore, at least for those theorists and
strategists of cyberwar in the United States, this origin story
contextualizes contemporary cyberwar discourses in another way. [Several
military and political commentators writing about cyberwar as a
strategic area of study were the **same theorists** who worked on
nuclear deterrence strategy in the latter part of the Cold
War]{.underline}. [A number of authors]{.underline}---many of [whom work
for the **RAND Corporation**]{.underline}, a think tank that was created
in 1948 to provide research and analysis to the U.S. military---[even
attempt to employ strategies learned from nuclear deterrence research to
mitigate military hacking and offensive use of global
networks]{.underline}.10 Tying the origin of cyberwar to Cold War global
strategic thinking offers an opportunity for those making the transition
from strategizing in a bipolar world defined by nuclear weapons to a
multipolar, interconnected global economy. [While the Siberian pipeline
attack's similarity to contemporary issues surrounding cyberwar is
noteworthy, the most striking aspect of the whole affair **is that it
possibly never happened.**]{.underline} Following the release of Reed's
book, [an ex-KGB officer with direct knowledge of the region at the time
disputes Reed's account]{.underline}. [He acknowledged there was an
explosion but claims it was at a different, smaller pipeline and was
caused by specific construction mistakes, not by faulty
equipment.11]{.underline} Moreover, [no known media reports from the
time confirm an explosion, which Reed claims was the size of a small
nuclear blast]{.underline}. Other than Reed's account, [no other
documentation has been found, and the CIA has never confirmed the
event]{.underline}.12 The origins of cyberwar in this event are
seemingly impossible to verify. Pipeline explosions were common at the
time, and there would have been no way for the CIA to know for certain
if it was caused by their purposefully faulty equipment or accidently
faulty Soviet equipment. Given our current evidence, **[the event is
completely unknowable]{.underline}**. Moreover, even if there was an
explosion, [it is impossible to verify if it was the logic bomb or a
mechanical failure]{.underline}. Depending on one's perspective, [either
the fake event or fake refutations seep into the historical record like
a computer virus corrupting the system's memory]{.underline}. Thus, in a
largely unrecognized way, **[this event is archetypal for
cyberwar.]{.underline}** Cyberwar and cybersecurity weave a complicated
relationship between the knowable and the unknowable. [Our networked
world has become so complex in sheer technical terms that the system as
a whole cannot be known from the outside.]{.underline} [Mapping even
just the public Web has become a scholarly pursuit in its own
right.]{.underline} Computers and networks represent information as tiny
bits on a magnetic disk or pulses of light across a cable that, owing to
their size, speed, and complexity, are on their own essentially
meaningless and impenetrable to human observers. [One always interacts
with abstractions and complex representations of the material reality of
computing.]{.underline} **[Cyberwar, in attacking these systems, is
always on the verge of being meaningless itself]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [in attacking systems of knowing that guarantee information,
**a successful attack impairs even our ability to know if something has
happened**]{.underline}. Cyberwar is fought precisely in this space
between the possible catastrophe and the possibility of nothing
happening at all. The event itself is ambiguous and our public
historical record is already compromised. It could of course be argued
that all history is ambiguous, constructed, and selective. [What is
unique in the case of cyberwar is that the whole structure of knowing
and observing is opened as a site of direct military
intervention]{.underline}. It is not only a question of interpretation
and selective archives. **[The entire archive and our ability to
comprehend the archive may be attacked at any moment]{.underline}**. In
a sense, [we are dealing with a limit case of historical
unknowability---not just ambiguity but **a military attack on the data
of history itself**]{.underline}. Now, [even if the victors write
history, it may no longer be written from data they
control]{.underline}. Thus an effective understanding of cyberwar will
only be possible by not prematurely deciding in favor of an event
happening or not happening. [Cyberwar operates both as a strategy and as
a mediatized cultural phenomenon directly in the space between happening
and not happening]{.underline}. [**It succeeds as a military strategy by
never succeeding too much.** It always seems to be leading us to the
verge of catastrophe and at the same time to an **interminable boredom
where nothing will ever actually happen**]{.underline}. Cyberwar could
easily be dismissed as not really being war or violent, but **[what is
so virulent and dangerous about cyberwar is its ability to atomize and
distribute warfare into everyday life.]{.underline}** Cyberwar succeeds
so much more effectively for being either overhyped or dismissed.
[Ultimately, we must resist deciding in favor of catastrophe or boredom,
for in doing so, the entirety of cyberwar will certainly escape us.
**Instead, we must attempt to interrogate the history and discourses of
cyberwar** by following its vacillations between these two poles as it
hides **in the theoretical space between war and nonwar**]{.underline}.

### Eastern Europe Link

**[Animosity between the United States and the Soviet Union predated the
Cold War, and even Russia's Bolshevik revolution]{.underline}**.38 For
example, the United States and Russia confronted each other in the late
nineteenth century over Manchuria, the United States wanting an open
door and the Russians seeking political and territorial control.
[Contrasting strategies for seeking influence beyond their respective
borders]{.underline}---[informal versus formal
empire]{.underline}---[were thus evident even before the advent of
communism]{.underline}. **[These animosities deepened with the coming of
communism in Russia]{.underline}**. Wilson sent 10,000 US troops between
1918 and 1920 to destroy the Bolsheviks, an effort that obviously failed
but underscored American hostility to Lenin and communism. Again, Stalin
wanted American help to limit the Japanese influence over Manchuria but,
after coming to power in 1933, President Roosevelt did not respond.
Whereas Adolf Hitler forced the Allied powers to work together, even
during the war, Roosevelt and Churchill delayed Stalin's plea to open a
second front in France, leaving the Soviet troops to engage 80 percent
of the German army.39 **[A paranoid man under the best of circumstances,
Stalin, then, had his own reasons to distrust the deeper motives of his
wartime allies]{.underline}**. [Despite this suspicious past, there was
a brief moment of hope following the famous meeting at Yalta that the
Big Three would be able to work together because the United States and
Britain might be willing to concede a sphere of influence in Eastern
Europe to Stalin]{.underline}. **[As we know, this was not to
be]{.underline}**. **[With Roosevelt's death and the atomic bomb, the
American position hardened]{.underline}**. **[Truman recognized clearly
that US power was now preponderant and argued that the United States
"had to have its way 85 percent of the time."]{.underline}**40 **[Stalin
was not willing to accept such constraints, especially in his
"backyard."]{.underline}** **[For both security and economic reasons, he
imposed brutal Soviet-style regimes on Eastern European
countries]{.underline}**. **[Eastern Europe was not of great economic
importance to the United States]{.underline}** **[The reasons Stalin's
control of the region added deeply to American anxieties lay
elsewhere]{.underline}**. **[First, it signaled to American policymakers
that Stalin was not willing to "accept a subordinate role in Pax
Americana]{.underline}**."41 **[Second, Stalin's refusal to allow
elections in these countries violated deeply cherished preference in the
United States for democratic rule]{.underline}**. **[And finally, prior
to World War II, Eastern European countries had been important source of
raw materials and markets for Western Europe]{.underline}**.42 **[Soviet
control over these economies was now a serious blow to the US design to
control the Eurasian landmass, rebuild Western Europe, and keep the
economies of the region open as part of an open global economic
order]{.underline}**. In sum, **[Soviet efforts to establish a more
traditional land empire over its neighboring countries collided with
American ambition to establish a global informal empire of open
economies, precipitating the Cold War]{.underline}**. Following the
Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, **[the United States took the
lead in creating the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO, a
military alliance of Western powers]{.underline}**. In retrospect,
**[some scholars have wondered why NATO was needed if US power was
already preponderant]{.underline}**. **[Besides containing any possible
future expansionism on the part of the Soviet Union and controlling
Germany, one important suggestion has been that a key purpose of NATO
was to ensure that Western European countries did not drift toward
neutralism]{.underline}**. **[Senior American
policymakers]{.underline}**, such as Acheson, **[considered neutralism
"a shortcut to suicide."]{.underline}**43 During the Senate debate over
the formation of NATO, [one US senator bluntly stated the core American
motive: "\[T\]he Atlantic Pact is but the logical extension of the
principle of the Monroe Doctrine."]{.underline}44 **[Over time,
containing communism and establishing friendly control over Western
Europe was, of course, not enough]{.underline}**. **[After the Soviets
announced that they, too, had an atomic bomb, and after China fell to
Mao's forces, American anxieties about the communist threat
deepened]{.underline}**. At home, **[the debate on who lost China fed
the anticommunist hysteria in the form of McCarthyism]{.underline}**.
**[Feeling on the defensive, American foreign policymakers turned more
aggressive, which led to the policy changes laid out in
NSC-68]{.underline}**. As is well known, these policy changes led
Americans to sharply increase military expenditures; pursue the hydrogen
bomb; and, if possible, to undermine "totalitarianism" and to roll back
communism.45 With the communist revolution in China, the focus of the
Cold War shifted to Asia, a set of developments to which I will return
after a brief discussion of how the developing world fit into America's
global design during this early phase of the Cold War. [Rebuilding the
industrial core and containing communism provided the essential context
for the emerging American approach to the developing world]{.underline}.
Scholars have debated whether the importance of the developing world to
the United States during the Cold War was more economic or political.46
This is a false debate. As Truman declared rather early, "\[O\]ur
foreign relations, political and economic, are indivisible."47 **[More
specifically, in the postwar period, American foreign policymakers
understood national power in terms of economic strength, and to them,
economic strength included reliable access to raw materials and markets
abroad]{.underline}**.48 **[This is where the developing world fit into
America's global ambitions; it, too, had to be integrated into an open
global economy]{.underline}**. The importance of different regions of
the developing world naturally varied. American decision-makers never
doubted that Central America and South America would need to remain
within the American orbit.49 Not only was the region important for
trade, it also attracted the attention of foreign investors. Both
communist and other capitalist European powers would thus have to be
kept out of the region. Given America's global power superiority, this
would not be difficult in its own backyard. The policy problem instead
would be how to maintain regional influence in an era of assertive
nationalism within Latin American countries.

Shliapentokh and Matveeva write in their book, Strakhi v Rossii \[Fears
in Russia\], that **[the Soviet Union was marked by a 'catastrophe
consciousness', rooted in the trope of Western counter-revolution
threatening the future of communism]{.underline}**. **[This social
imaginary revolved around the themes of famine]{.underline}**
(particularly among peasants), **[espionage]{.underline}**
(predominantly among low-educated urbanites), **[nuclear apocalypse, and
foreign currency speculation]{.underline}**.7 **[Catastrophic
consciousness played a particularly destructive role in the state's
programme of repopulation of East Prussia and that it needed not to be
grounded in an actual state of an affairs is beyond the
point]{.underline}**: **[fears arise in social organization itself; they
have a social basis in the state of uncertainty]{.underline}**, which
presents a breach in the familiar order of things and daily life.8
**[Kaliningrad of the second half of the 1940s had such an
organization.]{.underline}** In the spring of 1946, something unusual,
something inconceivable was going on in the newly annexed Western
borderland of the Soviet Union that our contemporary thinking fails to
grasp. [Without official permission, the men of a newly established
kolkhoz (collective farm) left for Belarus]{.underline}. [When
interrogated by a military patrol, they spoke about recent bombings of
its capital city, Minsk: 'Fifteen of our airplanes were shot down over
there, while here we sleep tight at night and live in ignorance.' They
resolved to form a guerrilla battalion and marched eastward 'to defend
the Motherland']{.underline} (the men were natives of Belarus).9 [In
another kolkhoz, exactly the opposite had occurred: news had arrived
that 'Turkey, together with England and America, declared a war on the
Soviet Union', but instead of taking up arms, the male villagers fed
into the woods in fear of conscription, leaving the fields and livestock
to their female co-workers.]{.underline}10 The mood was no calmer in the
province's capital city. Letters were sent to relatives of the volunteer
settlers in other provinces, speaking of decapitations committed by
Germans, as well as poisoning and arson. **[The nightmares of
thecollective imagination were echoed in internal memos that circulated
between different departments of the local government. These newly
crystallizing fears reflected the uneasy circumstances of everyday life
that awaited those settlers who arrived in the province in
1946,]{.underline}** misled by the recruiting agents: **[the vast
majority had to get by in half-destroyed tenement-like buildings, with
several families in one room, or in barracks, without electricity or
water, and move cautiously between the corroded and mined tram tracks in
debris-filled streets]{.underline}**.11 The city's resources were
stretched so thin that the dead were often left in the open for days
before being removed.12

### Enlargement Link

#### NATO enlargement represents a deeper relationship between the West and white supremacy that undergirds the entire conflict with Russia -- ignoring the role of US imperialism ensures the global spread of fascist violence against revolutionary forces

a Hub for International White Supremacist Fighters?", Russia Matters,

[The start of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014 led to the
emergence of over 40 pro-government volunteer battalions fighting on
Kyiv's side]{.underline}. The [inability of the Ukrainian armed
forces]{.underline}---plagued by corruption, low conscription rates and
lack of funding---[to halt advances by pro-Russian separatists in some
of the initial phases of the conflict were among the key factors behind
the rise of these paramilitary battalions]{.underline}. While some of
them lacked a distinct political ideology, others were **[offshoots of
far-right and ultranationalist groups]{.underline}**, [which functioned
as skinhead gangs or football hooligan clubs in pre-Maidan
Ukraine]{.underline}. My research indicates that [almost from the start
of armed conflict in the Donbass in spring 2014, some of Ukraine's
volunteer battalions served as magnets for neo-Nazis, white supremacists
and other adherents of far-right ideologies who traveled from all over
the world to join the fighting]{.underline}. However, this soon became
considerably more difficult: Starting as early as in late 2014,
[Ukraine's process of disbanding paramilitary groups and integrating
them into official forces resulted in an outflow of foreign fighters
even as claims that the volunteer battalions remained a magnet for white
supremacists persisted into 2019]{.underline} (see examples here and
here). That said, **[there is evidence that a small number of Western
white supremacists are still trying to go to Ukraine to
fight]{.underline}**---perhaps unaware of the changes on the
ground---[and that ties between Ukrainian and Western far-right groups
persist in the form of direct communication and visits to each other's
countries]{.underline}. Magnet for Foreign White Supremacist Fighters
Since the start of armed conflict in eastern Ukraine in the spring of
2014, some Ukrainian pro-government paramilitary battalions, as well as
pro-Russian separatist units, attracted foreign white supremacists and
other far-right-wingers to their ranks. [The main destinations for these
fighters included several Ukrainian pro-government volunteer battalions
openly espousing far-right ideologies, such as Azov, Right Sector1 and
OUN battalions]{.underline} (Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists).
[Foreign fighters also joined international battalions such as the
Georgian National Legion, which]{.underline} called itself neither far
right nor white supremacist but [gave foreigners entrée onto the
battlefield and a chance for combat experience---which is, in my view,
what foreign fighters traveling to Ukraine wanted]{.underline}. (The
commander of the Georgian National Legion, which was formed as a
volunteer battalion in 2014 and later absorbed into the Ukrainian
military, claimed in 2018 that 70 percent of his fighters are Georgian
and the rest are from elsewhere---\"Germany, U.S.A., U.K., Australia,
Greece, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Armenia and Israel," he told the BBC.)
[Since volunteer battalions typically did not require their members to
sign a contract in the initial phases of the conflict and few (if any)
records of members' citizenship were kept until the battalions'
incorporation into the state security services between late 2014 and
2016, a reliable count of the number of foreign fighters is
unavailable]{.underline}---and [it is even more difficult to calculate
how many of those fighters had neo-Nazi or other far right
views]{.underline}. Nonetheless, a 2019 report by the Soufan Center
estimated that [between 2014 and June 1, 2019, about 880 foreign
fighters, not counting some 3,000 Russians]{.underline},2 [traveled to
Ukraine to fight on Kyiv's side]{.underline}. While the report notes, as
have others, that the fighters came for a variety of reasons, its
authors argue that "**[many fighters, particularly from Western
countries, have taken advantage of the conflict in Ukraine to expand the
global white supremacy extremist movement]{.underline}**." Reports of
foreign white supremacists and far-right activists fighting among the
Ukrainian pro-government paramilitary battalions date back to the summer
of 2014, and the [volunteer battalions---some of them accused of
robbery, torture and other questionable practices---soon emerged on the
radar of U.S. policymakers.]{.underline} [Members of Congress tried and
failed for three years to ban U.S. funding from going to the Azov
battalion]{.underline} before finally passing the necessary legislation
in 2018, according to reporting by The Hill. [More recently, on Oct.
16,2019, a group of 40 Democratic lawmakers led by Rep. Max Rose signed
a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanding to know why
the Ukrainian National Guard regiment Azov had not yet been designated a
terrorist organization]{.underline}. Echoing a 2017 warning from the
FBI, [the letter claimed that Azov has a history of collaborating with
and training white supremacists from the U.S. and other Western states,
including the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter, Brenton
Tarrant]{.underline}. (The Christchurch killer did not write about
training with Azov in his manifesto; he mentions Ukraine once in the
document, claiming to have visited. The flak jacket he wore during his
shooting spree, however, included a symbol "commonly used" by the Azov
battalion, according to the New York Times.) The congressional letter
equated Azov with white supremacist groups in Europe, such as the U.K.'s
National Action and the Nordic Resistance Movement, which the
signatories also felt should be added to the Foreign Terrorist
Organization list. [While Tarrant's connections with Azov have been
widely publicized, other Western white supremacists and
ultranationalists who fought with Ukraine's far right are less well
known.]{.underline} [Swedish sniper]{.underline} Mikael [Skillt, a
self-described "ethnic nationalist" who told the BBC in 2014 that he
believes races should not mix, served with the Azov battalion early in
the war, as did a handful of other far-right Swedes,
including]{.underline} Robin [Holmgren]{.underline}. [A middle-aged
Italian with "a past in the far right,"]{.underline} according to press
reports, **[also fought with the battalion in 2014]{.underline}**. Vice
magazine reported on [two Austrian ex-soldiers]{.underline}, Ben
[Fischer and]{.underline} Alex [Kirschbaum, who fought with the Right
Sector and had found "an outlet for \[their\] nationalism" in Ukraine.
Former U.S. army soldier]{.underline} Craig [Lang]{.underline}---now
wanted in the U.S. for the 2018 murder of a Florida couple---[fought in
Ukraine in 2015-2016, first with Right Sector, then with the Georgian
National Legion]{.underline}; although [Lang]{.underline} has [described
himself as a "strict constitutionalist" and anti-communist]{.underline},
and a recent article claimed that "soldiers who served with Lang in
Ukraine said they never heard him express any racist or extremist
views," the [FBI accused him last year of providing advice on joining
the Azov battalion to Jarrett William Smith, an American white
supremacist and U.S. Army soldier who was arrested in September 2019 in
connection with plans to bomb a U.S. news network and to assassinate
liberal politicians and "antifa" activists.]{.underline} Not Your
Typical White Supremacist Groups Notwithstanding multiple alleged and
proven connections to white supremacists and far-right groups around the
world, the Ukrainian volunteer battalions varied widely, as did the
motives of the foreign fighters who joined them, and sometimes even the
battalions with strong ultranationalist inclinations differed starkly
from Western white supremacist organizations---if only because they
attracted fighters whom hard-core racial supremacists would not have
allowed in their ranks. Members of Ukraine's Jewish community, such as
Natan Khazin, have reportedly served with Azov, as have ethnic Greeks,
while the motley Right Sector incorporated Muslim Chechen and Crimean
Tatar fighters into its battalions. That such ultranationalist
battalions as Azov and Right Sector reportedly received financing from
oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky, who is a dual Israeli-Ukrainian citizen and a
prominent member of Ukraine's Jewish community, also undermines the
notion that these units adhered to the anti-Semitic tenets of
traditional white supremacist ideology. Big Changes While the conflict
in eastern Ukraine initially served as a magnet for international
fighters of various stripes, the situation began to change around the
end of 2014. The initial chaos of the war in Donbass, which had allowed
volunteer battalions to operate across the country with limited
accountability, was relatively short-lived, as Kyiv's signing of the
Minsk I and Minsk II peace accords was accompanied by efforts to rein in
the volunteer battalions and ultimately end their independence. Although
my research indicates that some rogue volunteer units persisted until as
recently as last summer, most of them had been either disbanded or
incorporated into Ukraine's ministries of Interior or Defense by the end
of 2015. The new formalities and discipline introduced during this
process, coupled with fewer opportunities for active combat and for
those who do not speak Russian or Ukrainian, seem to have motivated many
foreign fighters to leave the country. With the onset of reforms, all
ex-battalion members were required to sign service contracts and adhere
to the military code of conduct. The Ukrainian military tried to enforce
rigid discipline across the ex-battalions and most were no longer
allowed even to be based in the Donbass region, let alone to participate
in armed confrontations with pro-Russian separatists. From November
2014, Azov and many smaller battalions became officially registered
regiments within Ukraine's National Guard. By mid-2015, all
ex-battalions were reportedly staffed only by contracted professional
military servicemen. This process of institutionalizing the volunteers
eventually applied to foreigners as well, and included measures to weed
out undesirables. A June 2016 presidential decree laid out the rules
under which foreigners could serve in the Ukrainian military and
mandated identity checks. While the law explicitly banned foreigners
with a criminal record from serving, military recruiters have also been
extremely careful about individuals with other reputational risks,
according to a Defense Ministry official interviewed in November. In
practice, adhering to these standards has sometimes been a challenge, as
demonstrated by the tortuous extradition hearings of Lang, the ex-U.S.
soldier wanted in the Florida murder case, who is still in Ukraine and
regarded by some as a hero. Two other factors that have made the war in
Ukraine less appealing to foreign fighters have been the decrease in
combat activity and language constraints. With the end of large-scale
combat in Donbass beginning in March 2015, foreign fighters could no
longer be sure they would be deployed on the frontlines where they could
gain sought-after combat experience. Over the past three to four years,
the fighting has mostly been reduced to artillery exchanges and
occasional small-level skirmishes, while most of the soldiers' time is
spent in garrisons. The above-mentioned Defense Ministry source also
said that the Ukrainian military does not provide translators, so all
foreigners are expected to understand commands and generally communicate
in Ukrainian or Russian. As a result, my research indicates the number
of foreigners fighting in Ukraine has fallen and many of those who
remain are likely from the former Soviet Union. A journalist reporting
from Ukraine in 2016, told DFRLab that, "with the ongoing implementation
of the second Minsk agreement, the number of foreign fighters has
significantly decreased. There's definitely been a big change; most of
them have left. You used to see foreign fighters around all the time,
but the majority moved on in 2015." In June 2019, Ukraine's Channel 5
reported that about 500 foreigners were serving on contract with the
Ukrainian military (although it attributed the estimate to "volunteers"
rather than official sources). For those foreigners who want to stay in
the country, whether fighting or not, Ukraine is simplifying procedures
for getting residency and citizenship. [Fighters Leave, But
Contacts---and a Desire to Fight---Remain While the end of the
battalions' free reign may have marked the end of the "Ukraine
pilgrimage" for white supremacist fighters from other countries,
contacts between Ukrainian volunteer battalions and Western far-right
groups persist, with Azov and other ultranationalist Ukrainian
ex-battalions continuing to serve as inspiration for Western
far-right-wingers, including would-be militants]{.underline}. I believe
that as with foreign fighters from jihadist groups, international
ultranationalist volunteers pose obvious security risks for their home
countries. Some [of the Western far-right volunteers in Ukraine were
seasoned and experienced soldiers, and Ukraine was hardly more than
another stop on their personal crusades]{.underline}. A report on "white
supremacist terror" released in April 2020 by the Anti-Defamation League
and George Washington University describes the [**desire to** travel to
Ukraine, sometimes in order **to fight**, as "a trend that is becoming
more and more common for individuals in both The Base and Atomwaffen
\[Division\]," two white supremacist groups keen to further their
international connections]{.underline}. In addition to Smith, the
American soldier who sought advice on joining Azov from Lang, [the
report names William Garfield Bilbrough, a 19-year-old Base member
arrested by the FBI early this year who had been "preparing to travel
abroad to fight in Ukraine" since late 2019]{.underline}, according to
court documents, although it was not clear on which side he'd fight.
[Others have managed to make the journey: Ethan Tilling---a former
Australian soldier who describes himself as an ex-Nazi, "very much right
wing," "anti-immigration" and "definitely anti-Muslim"---fought in
Ukraine for a couple of months in 2017, arriving there a year after a
fellow Australian ex-soldier with far-right sympathies, Jared Bennett,
who had fought with Right Sector.]{.underline} In addition to attracting
international fighters, [some of Ukraine's far-right-leaning
ex-battalions---most notably, Azov, the largest and most influential of
the lot---have also been fostering civilian links with **U.S. and
European white supremacist groups. \"We think globally,\"**]{.underline}
Olena Semenyaka, the international secretary for the National Corps
party, which includes many Azov veterans, told RFE/RL in November 2018,
soon after organizing events in Kyiv with Greg Johnson, a prominent
figure in U.S. white supremacist circles. [About half a year earlier,
Semenyaka had hosted a leader of the California-based white supremacist
Rise Above Movement (R.A.M.) and his entourage]{.underline}. While these
connections are more defined by ideological solidarity than by military
activity, **[there have also been reports of attempted recruitment for
fighting]{.underline}**. Bellingcat recently alleged, for instance, that
in the fall of 2018 the [National Corps "supported an effort by Joachim
Furholm, a Norwegian citizen and self-described 'national socialist
revolutionary,' to **bring American right-wingers to Ukraine to fight
against Russian aggression**]{.underline}. **[The effort specifically
framed participation in Ukraine's war]{.underline}** ... **[as an
opportunity for American right-wingers to acquire combat and other
practical experience to be deployed later within the United States after
returning home]{.underline}**." Furthermore, according to a February
2020 report by British anti-extremism watchdog Hope Not Hate, the
Misanthropic Division--- "the international recruiting arm of ... the
Azov battalion," the report alleges---has been recruiting among British
far-right groups, albeit with minimal success thus far.

**[It is important to set aside some misleading views about
imperialism]{.underline}**. **[First is the tendency among some
observers to deny that imperialism continues in the modern
world]{.underline}**. Leaving aside apologists and court scholars,
**[serious proponents of this view hold it because they tend to equate
modern imperialism with colonialism]{.underline}**.4 Although I do not
share this view, it is a respectable one. [I have in this study instead
treated the formal control and the informal control of one state over
another as variants of imperialism]{.underline}. Understood this way,
**[imperialism is well and alive in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}**. Second, [a variety of observers still propose
modern-day versions of the white man's burden to explain what drives
contemporary imperialism]{.underline}. **[One serious version of this
standpoint treats American efforts to promote democracy overseas as a
driving force behind American expansionism]{.underline}**.5 **[This may
be true here and there, but it will certainly not do as a general
explanation of American interventions in the poor parts of the
world]{.underline}**. Missionaries notwithstanding, **[there is very
little in the historical record to support a suggestion that the United
States]{.underline}**, or Britain, **[expanded overseas primarily to
promote the well-being of peripheral countries]{.underline}**. A
somewhat more serious suggestion that also needs to be set aside is that
imperialism in the modern world does not pay, that it is often a
mistake. This was the logic behind Joseph Schumpeter's argument against
Lenin, in which he proposed that imperialism was moved, not so much by
the profit motive of capitalists, as by the atavistic elements in
society who still care about status and militarism.6 [Over the
subsequent decades, numerous versions of the idea that imperialism is
irrational or a mistake have been put forward]{.underline}. [For
example, a strong criticism of the American war in Vietnam was that it
was a giant mistake: it was a product of mistaking nationalists for
communists or of the mistaken concerns of ideologues worried about
falling dominoes; or it was perpetuated by status-obsessed leaders who
could not face defeat at the hands of a "fourth rate
power]{.underline}." 7 **[This view allows well-meaning observers to
criticize imperialist actions here and there, but it avoids a central
question, why are such "mistakes" repeated over and over again, across
space and time? The answer is, imperialism is not a
mistake.]{.underline}** **[There are instances in which imperialists
fail to achieve their objectives, such as in Vietnam]{.underline}**.
**[However, a theory of motives ought not to be deduced from the
outcomes]{.underline}**. **[Imperialists imperialize because they hope
to gain from such actions]{.underline}**. **[Whether metropolitan states
interpret the national economic interest narrowly, equating it with the
interests of select capitalists, or more broadly has varied over time
and place; what has not varied is that metropolitan states take the lead
in imperialism, hoping for gain]{.underline}**. Starting with the East
India Company and culminating in the most recent American invasion of
Iraq, one aim of the historical analysis in this book has been to
identify what imperialists hoped to gain from imperialism. Serious
analyses of what drives imperialism need to focus on the selfinterested
behavior of imperialists. I have suggested that both Britain and the
United States expanded into the global periphery to enhance national
economic prosperity. **[This proposition competes with two other
venerable, interest-oriented hypotheses: realist and
Marxist]{.underline}**. [Realists often suggest that political interests
of national security move imperialism; Marxists, by contrast, argue that
imperial expansion really happens at the behest of the capitalists of
the hegemonic powers]{.underline}.8 Before revisiting the historical
evidence in support of either proposition, it may be useful to focus for
a moment on the underlying logic of these competing arguments. **[My
argument that the pursuit of national economic prosperity is the taproot
of imperialism begins with the claim that modern states pursue
prosperity, both as an end in itself and because state leaders believe
that national power is a function of economic buoyancy]{.underline}**.
**[For hegemonic capitalist states, the world is their oyster. Leaders
of these states seek opportunities for national capitalists abroad as a
means to enhance both prosperity and power]{.underline}**. **[Hegemonic
capitalist states typically seek to open peripheral economies, hoping
that such openness will facilitate trade, investment, and financial
opportunities for their national firms]{.underline}**. **[When stable
openness is not readily achievable in peripheral countries, imperialism
becomes likely]{.underline}**. **[Limiting the sovereignty of peripheral
countries is the means by which hegemonic capitalist states ensure
economic access in the world. Both formal and informal empire originates
from this national logic of dominant capitalist states]{.underline}**.
**[It will be evident to careful readers that the logic of my argument
overlaps with that of both realism and Marxism]{.underline}**,
especially at the theoretical edges of these venerable paradigms. This
is not surprising, since I draw on both scholarly traditions. But I am
also seeking to move beyond. If the realist argument is that states
pursue national security and admits that national security depends
largely on a growing national economy, then my argument is nearly
indistinguishable from some versions of realism. However, a focus on
national-level factors as determinants of foreign behavior of dominant
states is only a minority strain among realists. Following Kenneth
Waltz, the majority view is instead attracted to "system level
explanations" in which national behavior is understood mainly as a
product of balance-of-power politics in an "anarchic" world.9 Benjamin
Cohen thus argues that imperialism results from the urge of nations to
maximize their power positions in an insecure world.10 This is the core
realist explanation of imperialism. I return below to the discussion of
the empirical validity of such arguments and suggest that the real
empirical challenge to a number of balance-of-power arguments arises
when dominant capitalist states continue imperial expansion even when
the global balance of power is not tight.11 Similarly, if the Marxist
argument is that capitalist states have enough autonomy from the
interests of specific capitalists to pursue the interests of capitalism
as a national economic system, then my argument is, again, nearly
indistinguishable from some versions of Marxism. However, once Marxist
scholars admit that states can pursue what is good for the national
economy irrespective of the demands of specific capitalists, then they
have very nearly thrown the baby out with the bathwater; the argument is
not really a Marxist one anymore.12 The core Marxist argument of
imperialism, which is deeply persuasive in some historical instances,
instead, is when capitalists actually influence state elites to
undertake aggressive actions aimed at opening markets or protecting
investments or ensuring that loans are paid off. We have encountered
many such cases in this volume. However, we have also encountered
numerous other cases of imperial expansion in which the direct pressure
of capitalists was missing, in which the state elite took the lead in
both diagnosing what ailed the national economy and in suggesting cures,
which included aggressive imperialism. The Weberian theoretical
assumption that I embrace instead of strained Marxism is that state and
class---or authority and association---are autonomous realms of human
activity that influence each other.13 This theoretical standpoint
enables one to accommodate class analysis of state and
imperialism---when needed--- but without embracing a Marxist framework.
Such a theoretical position is also consistent with a normative
preference for social democracy and state sovereignty in the modern
world. **[If realists underemphasize the importance of economic elites
as a force behind imperial expansion, Marxists underestimate the power
of nationalism that also drives imperial interventions]{.underline}**.
**[To overcome these limitations, I have focused on the pursuit of
national economic interest overseas as the key motive that propels
imperialism. The core intuition is that imperialism is moved by a
convenient marriage of the power interests of the state and the profit
interests of the economic elite]{.underline}**. How well does this
proposition hold up against the empirical evidence analyzed in this
book? On balance, the proposition holds up well against much of it, but
not all. In what follows I provide a quick summary of this historical
evidence.

#### The aff's "negative state action" is Reaganomics acting at its peak -- a simultaneous decrease in [governmental]{.underline} accountability and influx of [private]{.underline} contracts for militarism proves the aff is just imperial propaganda

[Instead of turning inward, however, Americans elected]{.underline}
Ronald [Reagan as its president, who became the instrument for the
global reassertion of American power]{.underline}. **[Reagan was a
strong anticommunist.]{.underline}** His foreign affairs focus was
mainly on the Soviet Union. Yet, circumstances soon demanded that he
focus on other parts of the world, especially the debt crisis in Latin
America. (I will return to a fuller discussion of U.S. economic
interventions in Latin America during the last decades of the century.
For now, some background on the Reagan era that sheds light on the
nature of U.S. interventions may be useful.) **[Reagan's genius was an
effort to beat the usual trade-off between guns and
butter]{.underline}**. **[Early in his presidency, he gave tax breaks to
the rich and sharply increased defense spending]{.underline}**. [As the
budget deficit grew, so did the pressure to cut social
spending]{.underline}. **[Reagan packaged such cuts in a broader program
of releasing market forces by shrinking the state]{.underline}**. **[The
outlines of a neoliberal revolution were now in place]{.underline}**.
**[The lower strata and the future generations in the United States
would pay for the rapid increase in military spending. Foreigners would
also help finance America's military buildup]{.underline}**. The high
interest rates triggered by Volcker's policies attracted large capital
inflows that, in turn, helped both the budgetary and balance-of-payment
deficits.14 [Further global implications of America's neoliberal turn
included the fact that, supported by a more robust military, the United
States was again ready to pressure other
states]{.underline}---especially the Soviet Union, but also others---[to
fall in line with American goals and interests]{.underline}. **[Even
allies would have to bend to the new American
assertiveness]{.underline}**: for example, the Plaza Accord of 1984
pressured Japan and Germany to revalue their currencies to make American
exports more competitive; **[and, of course, as we will see, the state
had to be rolled back in much of the developing world to serve the
American interest in a more open global economy]{.underline}**.
**[During this period, a major economic shift that is relevant for
understanding patterns of American interventions in the developing world
was the ascendance of finance, both within the American political
economy and globally]{.underline}**. **[Trends within the United States
and in the international economy fed each other.]{.underline}** [The
shift toward the dominance of finance began even before the Reagan era,
was encouraged by Reagan's deregulation policies, and matured during the
Clinton years]{.underline}. As noted, the economic recovery of Japan and
Europe threatened the competitiveness of the American economy,
especially in manufacturing. Between 1979 and 1995, for example, some 43
million jobs were lost in the United States. If manufacturing
contributed 28 percent, and finance 18 percent of the American GDP in
1975, by 1995 the share of manufacturing had declined to 22 percent and
that of finance had increased to 27 percent.15 Measured somewhat
differently, the value of assets created by financial institutions
within the United States grew from some 55 percent to 95 percent of the
GDP between 1980 and 2000.16 Not surprisingly, this shift was also
reflected in who within the US economy was making the most profits:
between 1980 and 2005, the profits of the financial sector grew by 800
percent, whereas that of nonfinancial sectors grew "only" by 250
percent.17 **[The importance of Wall Street]{.underline}**---**[that is,
of finance]{.underline}**---**[in American politics then grew, in part
because American politicians were forced to recognize the structural
shifts in the American economy, and also because the financial and
personnel links adjoining Wall Street and American politics increasingly
became denser]{.underline}**. **[These developments within the United
States were influenced by changes abroad and in turn, pushed the world
further toward financial globalization]{.underline}**. The issue of the
destruction of the Bretton Woods system is discussed above. And again,
the OPEC price increases, along with the agreement of America's client
states in the Middle East to denominate oil sales in dollars, further
contributed to a sharp increase in Eurodollars[. So, just as American
industry was facing stiff competition from Japan and others, US-based
banks found new economic opportunities overseas. Overseas branches of
American commercial banks, which were not regulated by American banking
laws, became a major depository of OPEC dollars]{.underline}. Awash in
oil money and believing that "countries do not go bankrupt," American
banks then pushed loans to middle-income, developing countries---
especially in Latin America---at relatively low, but variable, interest
rates. More than exports and direct investments, financial flows across
national boundaries now emerged as the key dimension of globalization:
if, in 1979, global financial transactions amounted to a sum twelve
times greater than total exports, by 1984, this sum had jumped to nearly
twenty times.18 For American banks, domestic business had languished
during the 1970s. **[In search of new sources of profit, the
"international activities" of American banks "exploded" instead,
"accounting for 95 percent of the earnings growth of the nation's ten
largest banks" during the 1970s and "probably more than half their total
earnings."]{.underline}**19 As we will see, the approach of the US
government to Latin America's debt crisis in the 1980s was deeply
influenced by the need to ensure that major American banks---now heavily
exposed beyond the national borders---remained profitable. **[Reagan, in
sum, increased defense spending sharply, deregulated the domestic
economy, and preached the ideology of free-market
capitalism]{.underline}**. **[This militaristic neoliberalism at home
had its global counterparts, too: structural adjustment programs in
debt-ridden developing countries and military interventions in such
small places as Grenada]{.underline}**. Reagan's overseas interventions
were relatively limited, though, certainly compared to what followed.
[Reagan's morning-in-America notwithstanding, the Vietnam Syndrome had
still not been fully defeated within the United States and the Soviet
Union was still intact. **It would take the end of the Cold War---and,
eventually, 9/11---to overcome these hesitations**]{.underline}. The
Cold War started to decline in the mid-1980s with Gorbachev's rise to
power in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev then took unprecedented steps aimed
at modernizing the Soviet Union. These actions unleashed
forces---probably unanticipated--- that led to the reunification of
Germany, the toppling of dominoes within the Soviet empire, and the end
of the Soviet Union. The Cold War was over. While Americans were more
surprised than anything by these developments, they were quick to claim
"victory."20 What followed was first a sense of triumphalism---the "end
of history" variety21---and then the hubris to finally remake the world
in the American image.

lock Russia in a Cold War Box that dooms solvency and makes miscalc
inevitable.**

There have been numerous articles on the authoritarian strengthening of
power in Russia and Putin's backsliding from democracy throughout the
2000s. [Russian positions and initiatives in Syria and Ukraine have been
portrayed within media venues across the West as evidence of
quasi-Soviet revanchism.]{.underline} In the midst of this [there has
been very little consideration of the impact of American positioning on
the Russian perspective.]{.underline} This article examines that
influence, whether it is the openly adversarial neoconservative
foundation under George Bush or the Republican Party in general, the
so-called 'reset' interaction under Barack Obama, or American foreign
policy analysts and academics meant to be experts on Russia. What will
be exposed is a [fairly uninspired and non-innovative American policy
that not only fails to consider Russian initiatives from Russia's own
national security interests, but aims to contain Russia within a
continued **Cold War box that** not only sours opportunities for
collaboration but **guarantees the absence of partnership** **in**
important **global security** areas. The idea that Russia's contemporary
positions have not evolved beyond the residue of Cold War mentalities
seems to be more a product of scholars and practitioners in the West
rather than in the institutions of Russia itself. This piece examines
the consequences of imagining Russia only as nemesis and whether the
West is more responsible for this Cold War pathology than it is willing
to admit.]{.underline} Unlike many pundits that have considered Russia a
superpower also-ran since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, or even
those who simply bristle at the idea of giving Russia a major global
platform on international issues today, [the fact of the matter is that
Russia does indeed still matter]{.underline}: it will remain a key
United Nations member; a new entrant into the World Trade Organization;
a formidable military power; and a significant player with countries
that overall tend to be unfriendly or openly adversarial to the United
States.1 [America]{.underline}, however, [seems either reluctant to
accept this reality and thus cuts itself off from creating new dialogues
with Russia.]{.underline} There seems to be an element of purposeful
disdain in the way Russia is viewed, analyzed, and engaged. [Russia most
certainly is not blameless and at times only intensifies its bravado,
apparently in a fairly petulant display meant to encourage American
irritation.]{.underline} Perhaps most disappointing, it will be shown
that [two of the biggest culprits in this process will be none other
than the two respective presidents, Barack Obama and Vladimir
Putin.]{.underline} This article highlights some fairly intriguing and
balanced work being done on Russian national security positions and how
American interests endemically conflict with those policies.
Unfortunately, these works are not getting near enough attention.
Instead [there is a public American perspective that seems wholly
committed to portraying all Russian initiatives in the harshest light.
Whether that portrayal accurately reflects on-the-ground reality
sometimes seems recklessly uneven.]{.underline} The raging and
disjointed conflict in Eastern Ukraine will be highlighted as a critical
case example, where an obvious line of thought has been pushed and
trumpeted regardless of ambiguous facts and vetted counter-information.
When taken in sum, all of these angles reveal what should be considered
**[a 'Cold War pathology']{.underline}** that [**is** actually
**emanating** most **vociferously from the American side** rather than
the Russian.]{.underline} A final section will elaborate how [this
pathology, based on historical legacies, may carry stark political
consequences far into the future, leaving what could be a major
potential partner no choice but to be the enemy.]{.underline} Flaming
Punditry and Cold War Triumphalism: Pushing an Adversarial Agenda [There
are numerous think tanks, both in the United States and Russia, which
are deeply concerned about the state of Russian-American
relations.]{.underline} Places like the [Moscow Carnegie Centre or the
Brookings Institute]{.underline} in Washington DC [are regular go-to
places for the media when seeking expert opinion and
analysis.]{.underline} However, [these centers have had a decided slant
in allocating blame for the poor bilateral relations to the Russians,
with the explanations ranging from the fairly simple to the rather
mystically esoteric.]{.underline} "If America did not exist, Russia
would have to invent it. In a sense it already has: first as a dream,
then as a nightmare. No other country looms so large in the Russian
psyche. To Kremlin ideologists, the very concept of Russia's sovereignty
depends on being free of America's influence. Anti-Americanism has long
been a staple of Vladimir Putin, but it has undergone an important
shift. Gone are the days when the Kremlin craved recognition and lashed
out at the West for not recognizing Russia as one of its own. Now it
neither pretends nor aspires to be like the West. Instead, it wants to
exorcise all traces of American influence."2 **[It is not difficult to
find this Freudian popcorn political psychology today when it comes to
'analyzing' Russian positions.]{.underline}** [It portrays the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the **victim of a global
oedipal complex** when it comes to Russia: first Putin desperately
craves daddy's attention only to then defiantly and recklessly reject
him, petulantly trying to run away from home.]{.underline} It is
important to remark how [most countries around the world would actually
find it dangerously myopic and unhealthy to base its own foreign policy
on earning the 'approval' of another country.]{.underline} With ease the
far more standard approach to foreign policy formulation is to determine
a country's own national interests within its local security dilemma and
craft an independent and fierce strategy that can best achieve its
optimal goals. That [normal process]{.underline}, ironically, [is often
described in America as a 'shift' away from craving attention to
exorcising American demons.]{.underline} In reality there is no shift:
Russia has always been about Russia, as it expects America to be about
America, France to be about France, Nigeria to be about Nigeria, so
forth and so on. [What Russia usually finds so irksome is that when it
does what everyone else does in terms of exercising global power, it is
judged as psychologically unstable or deficient.]{.underline} What [the
American media outlets and think tank personalities fail to
recognize]{.underline} is [how]{.underline} much of [this judgment is
coming not from explicitly observable behavior or direct quotes from
Russian actors but is placed upon Russia by the so called experts
themselves as they push a decidedly one-sided
interpretation.]{.underline} Russia is not supposed to aspire to be a
copy of the West nor should it be allowing particular American influence
over its policies. This is not said as anti-Americanism but rather as
simple logic: America would never strive to copy another country and it
most certainly would not allow another country to force-influence its
foreign policy. So why should Russia? It is this very simple and
straightforward question that seems to never be asked by what are
otherwise august media institutions and impressive political think tanks
in the West. Sometimes this tendency can reach near farcical levels.
When Alexei Pushkov, chairman of the Russian parliament's
foreign-relations committee, received so much media attention here when
he spoke about ridding Russia of dependence on America and even fining
cinemas that showed too many foreign films, Western experts needed to
recognize the absurd for absurdity. But they did not. Failure to do so
is perplexing given [Western analysis always laments the strengthening
of Putin's own presidential power system and decries how little power
sits within the legislative or judiciary branches of Russian
government.]{.underline} Thus, it is nonsensical to highlight
parliamentarians as having real impact. But this happens often in
America with no sense of diplomatic irony. [There also tends to be a
failure to focus Russian analysis through the looking glass of
reciprocity.]{.underline} What this means is that [current American
thinking emphasizes how untrustworthy Moscow decision-makers are while
completely ignoring the same Russian criticism lobbed back at
Washington.]{.underline} President [Putin]{.underline} openly and
publicly [discusses his lack of trust in American power and in the
specific policy decisions emanating from the White House. It is this
skepticism that supposedly forces his own lack of desire to engage
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [There are
simply too few voices at present in the West trying to analyze this
mindset as a legitimate position.]{.underline} As far as can be
determined, [the only reason this is not analyzed more seriously is
because the competing alternative -- that Putin is untrustworthy and
Moscow is the cause of all communication breakdown -- is simply accepted
as a de facto axiom.]{.underline} In short, [if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [does not trust Russia, it is because of how Russia
behaves on the global stage and its untrustworthy history. If Russia
does not trust the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [that is
simply Russian posturing and a case of political transference, wanting
to blame its own selfmade problems on someone else so that it can avoid
any accountability. The problem is how readily this is unquestioningly
accepted and how few so-called Russian experts are willing to step
forward and shine a light on such intellectual
superficiality.]{.underline}

been politicized]{.underline}**. The 2017 FBI memo on Russian election
interference focused heavily on Russian media influence, such as RT and
Sputnik, while failing to add any evidence connecting the DNC hacks by
Guccifer 2.0 to Russian intelligence agents. Yet, [still Russian
interference is a media parade and a Democratic strategy]{.underline} to
retake the White House in 2020. Mueller's recent report may not even
have put an end to this. As Russia and the U.S. engage in atavistic
great power politics, China is, more quietly, expanding its global reach
through the 5G network and the Belt Road Initiative. Whether Chinese
infrastructural loans will place host nations in a virtual debt prison
remains to be seen. Yet one has to wonder whether this debtor prison
will be any worse than IMF loan obligations, often tied to subverting
nations' economic policies to the IMF's demands. The U.S. attempts to
oppose Chinese soft power efforts, such as through having Canada arrest
Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. Yet it's an exercise in futility as the U.S.
and Russia, for that matter, have nothing better to offer. Therefore,
Italy, despite its membership in the EU and NATO, recently signed on to
China's Belt and Road initiative. [So, what of Russia? **Russia is no
demon**]{.underline}. **[It is far from the world's most oppressive
nations, such as el-Sisi's Egypt, Duterte's Philippines, occupied
Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar and others]{.underline}**. But Russia
is also far from a human rights-protecting nation; it supports national
sovereignty largely as a Machiavellian means-to-end to keep American
power at bay. **[As all nations, Russia acts according to its own
perceived interests, which are neither black nor white]{.underline}**.
**[It sometimes protects the sovereignty of nations, but primarily when
they are not within its historic sphere of influence and]{.underline}**,
**[especially, when they U.S. has a mind to invade them]{.underline}**.

### Technological Innovation Link

#### The discourse surrounding capitalist innovation and its capacity to "save the world" is rooted in an [ahistorical]{.underline} and [Orientalist]{.underline} view of the world that ignores the US's complicity in [depriving]{.underline} many countries of resources and then [invading]{.underline} them to "save" them with the "Western experience" that justifies further violence [out of fear]{.underline} of these nations gaining technological superiority

[When colonized countries shrugged off the yoke of colonialism after
World War II, they found themselves ensnared in neocolonial arrangements
that perpetuated their impoverishment and underdevelopment]{.underline}.
The Cold War realignment of the world system dominated by the United
States and its First World allies on the one hand, and the former Soviet
Union and its allies on the other, produced the Third World, that is,
countries caught in the crosshairs of the battle between the two camps.
[Concomitantly, colonial narratives of the inferiority of colonized
people, their cultures, and their knowledge systems (i.e., science)
evolved into Cold War narratives of modernization and development that
presumed the racial and / or cultural deficiency of the Third
World]{.underline}. These **[narratives promoted the ideology that the
plight of the Third World was the product of internal deficiencies
rather than ongoing colonial exploitation]{.underline}**. **[The
solution laid out in these narratives was for Third World scientists to
follow a Western path reliant on advanced industrial technologies to
prosper]{.underline}** (Philip 2015; Bhuiyan 2008; Escobar 1995). Even
though the article invoked the notion of "western experience" as the
path to Third World advancement, careful attention to what the article
denoted by "western experience" in the sentence that followed---Taha
knew where the West housed its anthrax---reveals that "western
experience" is quite overstated. Such a gloss reflects a deeply
entrenched subtext---the assumption of Western superiority. It is a
notion so taken for granted that the article need not even explicitly
reference it---a vague gesture to "western experience" suffices. The
quote also intimates that Iraqi acquisition of "western experience"
poses a threat---it is linked to Iraqi superweapons. [The end of the
Cold War and the advent of U.S.-led global capitalism had produced a
severe power asymmetry wherein the United States turned to subduing what
were significantly smaller threats globally. Yet, U.S. national circles
became concerned with these smaller threats in the backdrop of the vast
interconnectedness and mobility wrought by global capitalism, which had
made both weaponry and advanced technologies much more accessible to
even the most disempowered nations and groups]{.underline} (Cecire
2009). Iraqi scientists like Taha embodied this threat to U.S.
hegemony---she had accessed Western technology and could now use it
against the United States. One Department of Defense--affiliated study
on Taha from 1999 (Taha had been the subject of UK and U.S. surveillance
since the mid1990s) quoted Andrew Koch, an analyst at the Center for
Defense Information in Washington: "It is the scientists who are the key
to this \[weapons capacity\].... As long as Iraq maintains the
brainpower to do this ... over the long term you can't stop them" (Brian
Anderson 1999, 21; emphasis added). [As with the news quote above,
connections with the West were depicted as a source of intellectual (and
technological) power, leading to the image of Western-educated Iraqis
who were both advanced and potentially dangerous. In suggesting that
"western experience" and technologies can be dangerous in the hands of
the non-Western Other, these quotes intimate an ambivalence toward
educating and equipping Iraqis]{.underline}. **[This logic reflected the
underlying reality of U.S. empire]{.underline}**---**[that the United
States had less of a problem with Iraqi possession of weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}** (as the United States had after all helped
develop and furnish these weapons to Iraq while it was an ally),27 and
**[more of a problem with Iraqi ability to use them without direction
from the United States or, worse, against the United
States]{.underline}**.

### Technological Transfer/Framework Link

#### Their tech is imperialist -- the whole framework of transfer is [bankrupt]{.underline} and designed to [facilitate]{.underline} extraction

Just recently a new force in world politics, **[the multinational
corporation]{.underline}**, has become the focus of widespread interest
and concern. **[Many students of]{.underline}** the development and
spread of **[these firms emphasize their actual and potential
contribution toward global economic integration]{.underline}**.
Contingent upon this process, [several observers have optimistically
forecast the fundamental breakdown of the nation-state system and its
replacement by some form of more stable and peaceful world
polity]{.underline}. **[The]{.underline}** Canadian **[case however,
does not sustain this optimism.]{.underline}**

Among all the nations Canada has been the most consistently liberal host
of these firms, providing particular attraction for expan-sionist
American corporations. As a consequence, the country has experienced a
new and profound dependence upon the American economy. Directly
resultant upon this experience has been the forfeiture of broad areas of
Canadian state sovereignty and national independence. But **[unlike the
prophecy, this sacrifice has not been part of a more universal transfer
of nation-state prerogatives to the claims of supranational authority.
Instead, the forfeiture has been unilateral and horizontal: from
the]{.underline}** Canadian **[state to]{.underline}** the
**[America]{.underline}**n state.

**[Clearly, American multinational corporations have been successful
promoters of continental economic integration]{.underline}**. No other
nation in the developed world shares with Canada the same unique degree
of economic subordination. **[On the other hand, American multinational
corporations are demonstrably inadequate institutions for furthering the
general erosion of the nation-state system]{.underline}**. **[They are
themselves subordinate to and dependent upon the U.S.
state]{.underline}**. **[This relationship is made most explicit through
American laws of extraterritoriality whereby the U.S. government has
reserved the right to dictate]{.underline}** **[trade]{.underline}**,
anti-trust, **[and balance of payments policies]{.underline}** **[to the
foreign subsidiaries of American firms]{.underline}**. The Canadian
government has become acutely aware of this relation-ship on several
occasions, most notably over the 'Time and Reader's Digest Affair' and
the 'American Guidelines Issue'. **[Of even graver import, these
occasions demonstrated the ease with which American economic con-trols
in one area could be converted into substantial political leverage in
entirely unrelated areas of]{.underline}** Canadian **[policy
formation]{.underline}**.

**[In each instance where the U.S. government has employed its authority
over American multinational corporations to sway]{.underline}** Canadian
**[government policy, the]{.underline}** Canadian **[government has
eventually acquiesced]{.underline}**. Ironically, Canadian **[government
elites have proven themselves unwilling to respond to this challenge at
its source. Instead of attempting to regulate or discourage American
multinational corporations]{.underline}** in Canada, **[they have
co-operated actively in their promotion]{.underline}**.

#### The state and corporation are symbiotic agents colluding to erode and capture the entire globe for wealth extraction

Donald Maclean **Wells '71**, B.A. from University of Western Ontario,
Master Thesis for Masters of Art in PoliSci, "American Multinational
Corporations In Canada: Unchallenged Agents of Empire", The University

But there is a second more critical perspective which is often
overlooked or underemphasized by theorists of the great transformation.
This outlook centres upon the fact that some **[nations use
multinational corporations as instruments of national policy to extend
their powers and jurisdiction over other nations]{.underline}**. In this
sense **[multinational cor-porations have become a readily "convertible
entree"]{.underline}**(13) **[to promote the political, military and
economic goals of one state in another state]{.underline}**. [Instead of
being protagonists in a battle with nation states, multi-national
corporations are, according to this view, media for this intrusion of
one state upon the jurisdiction and sovereignty of another
state]{.underline}. **[Multinational corporations are seen as agents of
empire in pursuit of colonies]{.underline}**. For this purpose [the
multinational corporation has provided a somewhat more subtle set of
techniques, the consequences of which are, however, comparable to those
achieved by earlier cruder instruments of empire]{.underline}.

It is this latter perspective which portrays most accurately the
relationship of American multinational corporations to the Canadian
state: the American multinational corporation has in the past and does
presently act as an economic front line for the intrusion of American
political power in Canada. The resultant abridgement of Canadian
independence is due less to any autonomous role of the multinational
corporation than it is a function of the subordinate position of the
American multinational corporation vis a vis the dictates of the
American state. Of course this does not mean that the multinational
corporation is the only agency of the American empire in Canada, merely
that it is a most important agency whose vitality, as will be shown
presently, has not diminished through lack of use.

For a variety of reasons, **[the American state]{.underline}**, unlike
the Canadian government, **[has retained ultimate legal authority and
actual control over the domestic operations and policies of corporations
within its territorial jurisdiction]{.underline}**. [**In addition, as
will be seen, the American state has sought and exacted an increasing
range of discretion over the activities of subsidiaries and affiliates
of American-owned corporations outside these boundaries**. This capacity
may, it is true, be contingent upon factors which are not necessarily
permanent, whose salience may diminish over time]{.underline}.
**[Included are the great dependence of most U.S. multinational
corporations upon the U.S. domestic market rather than upon the markets
of other nations]{.underline}**,(14) the high proportion of American
nationals in the managerial ranks of American multinational
corporations,(15) continuing reliance, critical in some sectors, of the
multinational corporation upon U.S. government controls, research and
development grants, and other dependencies which signify and favour the
American 'character' and 'orientation' of U.S. multinational
corporations. These dependencies may be attenuated in the future as the
American multi-national corporation increase the weight of its foreign
operations. But this expectation may be naïve. There appear to be other,
more permanent and critical features of the U.S. state-U.S.
multinational corporation relationship which impel the continuing
subordination of corporation to state. These have been aptly summarized
by Henry Fowler, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury.

"It is impossible to overestimate the extent to which the efforts and
opportunities of American firms abroad depend upon the vast presence and
influence and prestige that America hold in the world ... if we were to
contemplate abandoning those frontiers and withholding our assistance
... I wonder not whether the opportunities for private American
enterprise would wither -- I wonder only how long it would take."(16)

[While the American multinational corporation derives considerable
benefit from its relationship with the U.S. state and finds the
relation-ship necessary to its existence, it should also be understood
that the benefits accrue in both directions]{.underline}. **[The United
States relies heavily upon the continuing presence and growth of
American multinational corporations to protect its interests and extend
its jurisdiction abroad]{.underline}**. **[The American multinational
corporation has a "highly significant role in the United States foreign
policy" for which reason "the United States government has consistently
sought]{.underline}** ... **[to expand and extend the role of the
multinational corporation]{.underline}**."(17)

**[So the connection between the U.S. state and the American
multi-national corporation is symbiotic]{.underline}**. The rationale is
circular: **[the corporation obeys the state because the state is
necessary to the cor-poration, the state requires obedience from the
corporation because the corporation is useful to the
state]{.underline}**. The powers and interest-fulfillment of the one are
highly dependent upon those of the other.

### Ukraine Link

#### We have entered the final war against humanity -- the 1AC is just fodder in the broader material and ideological skirmish for the boundaries of whiteness -- this war for whiteness is inescapable and unsustainable -- we must [destitute]{.underline} the institutions that come to represent the "west", whether a broader west that includes Russia or its protracted counterpart that continues inter-family war.

War, Agony, Suicide

[At the Eastern borders of Europe, two old white men play a game in
which neither of them can retreat.]{.underline}

[The old white American is on the heels of a humiliating and tragic
defeat. Worse than Saigon, Kabul is fresh in the global imaginary as a
sign of the cognitive breakdown of the long-dominant, imperialist
power.]{.underline}

[The old white Russian knows that the base of his power is a nationalist
promise]{.underline}: to avenge the honor of "Holy Mother Russia."

**[The one who retreats first will lose everything.]{.underline}**

[The fact that Putin is a Nazi was already clear at the conclusion of
the second war in Chechnya. But at the time, **he was still lauded by
the American president**]{.underline}, who looked him in the eyes and
praised his sincerity. The Russian also enjoyed the favor of British
banks, as they were filled to the brim with rubles robbed by Putin and
his friends through the dismantling of public infrastructures [after the
fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Geriatric [Russians and
Anglo-Americans were brothers in arms when it came to destroying the
social spheres produced by past labor and communist movements all over
the world.]{.underline}

[But friendship and camaraderie don't last among assassins.]{.underline}
In fact, [**what use would NATO be if peace was actually brokered?** And
how would a successful peace have affected the bottom lines of the
multinational companies **producing weapons of mass destruction and
death**---today making endless profits.]{.underline}

[The **expansion of NATO only serves to reignite a hostility that
capitalism could not let die, to keep the profitable conflict
alive**.]{.underline}

**[There is no rational explanation for the war in
Ukraine]{.underline}**, especially [because it is the climactic movement
in a **psychotic crisis of the white brain**.]{.underline} [What
rationality is there in the expansion of **NATO, which arms Polish,
Baltic, and, yes, Ukrainian Nazis against Russian Nazism**?]{.underline}
[In exchange, Biden gets the result most feared by American war
strategists: **forcing Russia and China into an embrace**]{.underline}
that fifty years ago Nixon had succeeded in weakening.

[Given that the **war is inexplicable in strategic terms**, to
understand the war **we don't need to think geopolitically**, but rather
psycho-pathologically.]{.underline} Perhaps [we need a geopolitics of
psychotic outbursts.]{.underline}

[At stake]{.underline} here [is the political, economic, demographic,
and finally psychic **defeat of white**, Western]{.underline},
(post)[colonial civilization]{.underline}, which cannot accept the
prospect of exhaustion, [which **prefers destruction or suicide to the
slow extinction of white dominance**.]{.underline}

West, Future, Decline

[With the war in Ukraine,]{.underline} a hysterical [**arms race**
begins, borders are consolidated (along racialized lines), and violence
increases exponentially---all demonstrations of the senile marasmus into
which the West has fallen.]{.underline}

On February 23, 2022, [when Russian troops were]{.underline} already [in
the Donbass, Trump praised Putin as a peacekeeping "genius," and
suggested that the US follow his lead]{.underline} on the Mexican
border.

Let's see if we can figure out what Trump's obscenities mean. Is there a
kernel of truth in his delusions? [**At issue is the very concept of the
West**.]{.underline}

But first, [what is the West?]{.underline}

[If by "West" we refer to a geographical definition, then Russia is of
course excluded. But if we think about the anthropological and
historical meanings of that word, then Russia is more Western than any
other West.]{.underline}

[In short, the West can be defined as the **land of decline** and of
**obsession with the future**.]{.underline} [Those two traits
are]{.underline} in fact [one, given that for organisms subject
to]{.underline} the second law of [thermodynamics]{.underline}---[as are
individual and social bodies]{.underline}---**[the future can only mean
eventual decline.]{.underline}**

[We---**both the "we" of the West and the Westerners of the boundless
Russian lands**---are therefore united in futurism and decline, that is,
in the **delirium of omnipotence** and in the desperation of
impotence.]{.underline}

Trump gets credit for telling it like it is, claiming that our enemies
are not Russians, but migrants from the Global South; China, which we
have humiliated; Africa, which we have plundered. Those are our enemies,
not the very white Russia, which is part of the "Great West."

This [Trumpist logic is based on a white supremacy that sees Russianness
as the most extreme form of acceptable whiteness.]{.underline}

[**Biden's logic is instead based on the defense of the "free world": a
world born from genocide, from the forced deportation of millions of
slaves, and organized around foundational systemic
racism**.]{.underline} [Biden chooses **to break the "Great West" apart
in favor of a smaller West without Russia**, which is]{.underline} in
any case [destined to tear itself apart and to **involve the whole
planet in its suicide**.]{.underline}

So, [let's define the West as a sphere of racist dominance obsessed with
the future. Time stretches out in]{.underline} an expansive pulse:
[economic growth, accumulation, capitalism.]{.underline} It is exactly
this obsession with the future that feeds the machine of dominance: a
concrete present (of pleasure, of muscular relaxation) is invested into
and exchanged for abstract future value.

Perhaps we could reformulate the classical Marxist analysis of value to
say that [exchange value is precisely this accumulation of the
present]{.underline} (the concrete) [in abstract forms (like money) that
can be exchanged for something else tomorrow.]{.underline}

[The fixation on and fetishization of the future are **by no means a
natural cognitive modality of the human**.]{.underline} [Most human
cultures have been organized around a **cyclical understanding of
time**, or on the insuperable dilation of the present.]{.underline}

Futurism is a transition to complete self-consciousness (also in
aesthetic terms) of cultures of expansion. But there are many futurisms.

The obsession with the future has different implications in the
theological-utopian sphere that is central to Russian culture and the
techno-economic sphere of Euro-American culture. Federov's cosmism and
Mayakovsky's futurisms both share an eschatological breath that is
lacked by the technocratic fanaticisms of Marinetti and Musk. Maybe
that's why it is Russia's destiny to end history---and here we are.

Nazism Is Everywhere

[The new horizon is **war that pits one Nazism against
another**.]{.underline} In his writings from the 1960s, Gunter Anders
predicted that the nihilistic charge of Nazism would not die with the
defeat of Hitler. He presaged that it would return onto the world stage
when technical power developed to such a degree that it provoked the
humiliation of the human.

[Nazism is reemerging as a **psycho-political form of the demented body
of the white race, which ragefully reacts to its own unstoppable
decline**.]{.underline} [Viral chaos has created the conditions for the
formation of a global, biopolitical infrastructure, but it has also
accentuated the]{.underline} widely experienced [perception of matter's
ungovernability as it loses order, disintegrates, and dies.]{.underline}

**[The West has forsaken death because that concept is not compatible
with its obsession with the future.]{.underline}** [It has rejected
senility because it is not compatible with expansion and
growth.]{.underline} [But now, the]{.underline} ([demographic, cultural,
and economic]{.underline}) [aging of the dominant cultures of the Global
North are]{.underline} presented as [**a specter that white culture
cannot even contemplate, let alone accept**.]{.underline}

[This is where the white brain]{.underline} (that **[of both Biden and
Putin]{.underline}**) [enters a furious crisis of senile
dementia.]{.underline} [Then the white brain most lost to
senility---that of Donald Trump---utters a truth that no one can stand
to hear:]{.underline} **[Putin is our best friend. Sure, he's a racist
murderer, but we are no less so.]{.underline}**

On the other hand, [Biden represents the]{.underline} impotent [anger
that old people express and feel when they notice the decline of their
strength, psychic energy, and cognitive efficiency.]{.underline} [**Now
that exhaustion is in its advanced stage, extinction is the only
reassuring prospect**.]{.underline}

[Can humanity save itself from the murderous violence of the demented
and agonized Western, Russian, and European brains?]{.underline}

[**The invasion of Ukraine will continue**, whether it becomes a stable
occupation (unlikely) or concludes with the withdrawal of Russian troops
after the destruction of the military apparatus donated to Kyiv by the
West (more likely).]{.underline} [Regardless, **the conflict will not be
resolved by the defeat of either of two patriarchs**.]{.underline}
[Neither one can accept retreat.]{.underline} Therefore, [this invasion
signals the beginning of a phase of **continuous war** that will be
global]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} that **[may express itself in
nuclear terms]{.underline}**). [The **final war against humanity** has
begun.]{.underline}

[In the suicidal war that one West wages against the Other West, **the
first victims** are those who have suffered from]{.underline} the
deliriums of [both spheres of influence and power---**those who want no
war but are made miserable by its effects**.]{.underline}

[The only thing we can do is to **desert**, to **abandon**, to
**collectively transform fear into thought**, to **resign ourselves to
the inevitable**. Only in this way can we **produce the unpredictable:
peace, pleasure, life**.]{.underline}

#### The shuffling of official commitments within the colonial infrastructure of NATO is American empire's anxious response to the rising instability of its global order. Uncertainty over Ukraine's position within inter-capitalist relations is driving a wedge in the structure of global imperialist accumulation, the impulse to resolve this tension is empire recuperating itself in the face of impending collapse.

[Our post-Cold War era is defined by **intra-imperialist** and
**inter-imperial contradictions**]{.underline}. The former concerns
[core--core relations]{.underline} ([North America, Western
Europe]{.underline}, Japan, Australia) [developed during the Cold War
under the hub-and-spoke system of **American primacy**]{.underline} (see
below). The [latter concerns geo-economic and **geopolitical
concentrations of capital**]{.underline}, especially [in]{.underline}
South and South-east Asia (e.g. China) and [**East-central Eurasia**
(e.g. Russia), whose market operations, accumulation strategies and
security are not controlled by the American state but by
**geopolitically rival imperial states and** capitalisms, such
as]{.underline} China and [Russia]{.underline}. The inter-imperialist
contradictions of Lenin's era have shifted to a different level. Yet,
[as the global financial crisis and the Eurozone crisis have clearly
shown, regional **intra-imperialist caucuses can unravel**.]{.underline}
This book argues [that neoliberal/ordoliberal Europe is held together by
what we call here as new **(neoliberal) authoritarianism**]{.underline}.
T[he more the crisis of the neoliberal/]{.underline}ordoliberal [model
deepens, the more the authoritarian
neoliberalism]{.underline}/ordoliberalism, [as crisis management policy,
becomes]{.underline}. We have a top-down approach to the phenomenon of
authoritarianism. We see it as a direct consequence of the breakdown of
the global economic order and the turn of ruling elites in many
countries to either authoritarian crisis management techniques or
unconstrained economic and political nationalism cum imperialism---even
formal imperialism. We see it also as a means aiming at [containing the
unravelling of intra-imperialist contradictions caused by **uneven
development** and the **global fault-lines of capital accumulation** on
a world scale.]{.underline} In the final analysis, this is the result of
what Martin Wolf called "the long and painful journey to world disorder"
(Wolf 2017). In this context, [we are not only examining the **relative
weakness of the USA** and its Western allies, but also taking into
consideration]{.underline} China's global expansion and its geo-economic
imperatives[,]{.underline} and [increased confidence of **Russia
imposing its authority in Eurasia** with strength as well as the great
impact that these have been making on the global distribution of
power]{.underline}. Our assessment is that [they are **driving a wedge
among the intra-imperialist assemblages,** further **undermining the
hub-and-spoke system of US neo-imperialism**]{.underline}. China's
interaction with US-led globalisation, whether deliberate or not, sets
sight on [**snatching the leadership of globalisation** away from the
USA]{.underline} and not to succumb to the US-led globalisation, which
is clearly in retreat. China, as an imperialist power, is building its
global hegemony on the same geography, the very territory and terrain of
intra-imperialist contradictions and by way of carefully penetrating
them. We show, in this respect, that the Eurozone crisis and the
stylised and separable---but not separate---public policies of
Anglo-American [neoliberalism]{.underline} and German- led
ordoliberalism, themselves imperialist and deeply authoritarian public
policies[, are contributing as much to the coherence of transatlantic
relations as to their **decomposition**.]{.underline} A definition of GF
is provided in our previous work (Fouskas and Gökay 2012) in which we
also subscribe to some tenets of world systems theory. Suffice to say
here in brief that GF conceive of and [visualise the social whole as
"**tectonic plates**"]{.underline}, each occupying relatively separate
domains: geopolitical-geographical, political, economic, ideological and
cultural-civilisational. We do not accept the primacy of economics, or
of any domain in particular determining "in the last analysis" all other
domains. In other words, we tangle up Marx's "base/superstructure"
metaphor, preferring in its stead another analytical guidance of his to
help us untangle the domains of GF, one that goes as follows: "the
concrete is concrete because it is the concentration of many
determinations, hence unity of the diverse" (Marx 1857/1973: 101). [A
truly global imperial power, an **empire**, must be in a position to
**master primacy in every single domain**, that is to say, to make all
"tectonic plates" converge somewhat harmonically under the single
**imperial-hegemonic design** of a specific state]{.underline}. Some
neoliberals reduce this to the economic level alone, arguing that "the
world is flat" under the dominance of free market economics centred upon
the USA, meaning that global capitalist integration of the entire world
has been achieved. Theoretically, this is thinkable, hence (empirically)
possible. Historically, and for good reasons, it has never been
experienced. For instance, the USA tried first to establish itself in
Central and Latin America---the so-called Western Hemisphere of the
Monroe Doctrine---and then followed an Open Door imperialist policy in
Eurasia and other parts of the globe towards the end of the nineteenth
century. However, for nearly 200 years now, the USA has failed to build
an informal empire even in its own backyard, Latin America, let alone
the globe: many times during the course of the twentieth century, Latin
American countries and peoples have not only dropped off the US
bandwagon but have even risen to popular revolutions, the best example
being socialist Cuba and, later, the Bolivarian strand of socialism
which renewed its influence with the powerful anti-neoliberalisation
movement of Caracazo in Venezuela in February 1989, followed by the rise
of Hugo Chavez in power... We endorse the empirical-descriptive
distinction put forth by world systems theorists, namely the distinction
between [core, semi-periphery and periphery]{.underline}. [The
**imperial order** itself is **premised upon this division**, and no
modern imperial order can exist without establishing itself firmly
across the **uneven chain** of this uneven division]{.underline}. This
division is not a static or geographical distinction but a
descriptive-dynamic categorisation subject to qualitative and
quantitative findings resulting from concrete analyses of concrete
historical situations and processes. For example, [many capitalist
countries were deemed as semi-peripheral]{.underline} in the 1960s and
1970s enjoying middle income levels [while economically and
**politically dependent on the USA and NATO**]{.underline} (e.g.
Argentina, Greece, Portugal); today, [they may have been either
downgraded to a peripheral status or being **entirely dependent on high
debt levels and borrowing**]{.underline}---a key feature of
financialisation---in order to maintain that status. However, as many
con- temporary researchers have noted, income inequalities in the
post-1970s era of neoliberal financialisation and austerity have
substantially increased in both core and peripheral zones and states
(Milanovic 2016; Piketty 2014). Many heterodox economists, such as
Costas Lapavitsas and Heiner Flassbeck, wrongly in our view, believe
that the core-periphery cleavage within the EU/Eurozone is the result of
the introduction of the Euro in 1999, underpinning the Eurozone crisis
that ensued (Lapavitsas et al. 2010; Lapavitsas 2013; Flassbeck and
Lapavitsas 2015). Others are very sceptical in accepting that such a
cleavage exists at all at the systemic level (Milios and Sotiropoulos
2009a, b); or that it has any meaning at all to dwell on forms of
"dependency" of the periphery upon the core, although they accept
dependencies and inter-dependencies among members of the core (Panitch
and Gindin 2012; Kiely 2010; Milios and Sotiropoulos 2009a, b). GF
suggest that [a key feature of imperialism is an **appropriation of
international value**]{.underline}, and as such, it is [premised upon a
systemic and elastic **core-periphery--semi-periphery divide**, whose
key operational function is the **transfer of profits** and rent from
the periphery to metropolitan centres, or from one metropolitan centre
to another]{.underline}. In the context of the EU, core-periphery
structures have long predated the introduction of the Euro and go as far
back as the nineteenth century. Core-periphery cleavages are not
conditioned by monetary undertakings but by the level of economic,
social and technological development. Relations of dependency[,
**tensions** and **contradictory/negotiating processes** between **core
and periphery/semi-periphery states** and elites, as well as intra-core
dependencies/inter-dependencies, are characteristic of a **politically
divided global capitalist system** that needs to be reproduced as such
in order to **maintain and augment the rate of profit** and the
**appropriation** of it by the key economic-imperial configurations of
that system]{.underline}, such as MNCs and financial/banking interests.
[Capitalism rests on a heavily **hierarchical**]{.underline}---both in
terms of class and in terms of administrative/institutional
divisions---[structure]{.underline}. [There can be no capitalism without
these hierarchies (states, **aggregation of geopolitical blocs**, class
divisions, separation of state and civil society), which are,
essentially, typical hierarchical-theological divisions between rich,
poor and those that somewhat stand in the middle]{.underline}, with the
important qualification that class divisions cut [across states and
geopolitical blocs]{.underline}. Core, periphery and semi-periphery are
descriptive and flexible divides/categorisations that have to be
grounded on qualitative and quantitative findings resulting from
concrete analyses of concrete historical situations. In addition to the
above, [these are not cleavages that apply to the level of the global
system alone]{.underline}. Importantly, [they apply within regional
caucuses and nation states]{.underline}. There is a lot of wealth in
London/South-east England, but also a lot of poverty in London itself,
and a lot of poverty in the de-industrialised periphery (Wales/East
Midland, Cornwall and the de-industrialised North) of the UK. Most
mega-cities, London, New York, Shanghai, Berlin, are socially and
ethnically segregated. Discourses and educational strategies of
"inclusion" and "integration" aiming at "embracing diversity" fail
repeatedly to accomplish their mission, not least because neoliberal
eco- nomics lacks such integrative capacity. Indeed, [a pronounced
fault-line of the capitalist system today is]{.underline}, on the one
hand, [its **liberal and goodwill declarations** about "inclusivity",
"human rights", "gender and race equality" and, on the
other]{.underline}, imposition of harsh austerity measures and welfare
state retrenchment. [The **illusion** is that free markets can
accomplish those noble aims]{.underline}... [Hub-and-spoke arrangements
privilege not just the friend--enemy binary terrain of international and
domestic politics, aggregating friends, on the one hand, and **defining
enemies**,]{.underline} whether [Communists]{.underline} or Muslim
terrorists (after 9/11), on the other. Importantly, [America's hub-and-
spoke **neo-imperialism** celebrated the centrality and utility of US
economic and political-military power for each subaltern member of the
core, a central relationship that it is of **far greater importance**
than any possible **relation** or]{.underline}, even worse,
[**alliance** built between those subaltern members]{.underline}. Thus,
[the intention of hub-and-spoke new American imperialism is to **prevent
its rims from becoming separate**, politically organised,
forces]{.underline}. Alexander J. Motyl captures that very well, when he
notes that hub-and-spoke imperial arrangements are successful only if
they operate in the absence of a rim. One could reasonably argue that
[the USA has managed to deliver on that strategic intent during the
so-called **Golden Age of capitalism**]{.underline} (1950--1970),
although this remark is applied to intra- core/intra-imperialist
relationships and on the proviso that the erosion of US economic power
by Japanese and West German competition is taken into account. As
regards Western Eurasia, [NATO institutionalised the dependency of
Europe upon the USA,]{.underline} whereas American multinationals came
to dominate European markets especially from the 1960s onwards. In the
Far East, bilateral Treaties with Japan secured American primacy in the
Pacific theatre (Fouskas 2003; Fouskas and Gökay 2005). However, The New
American Imperialism failed to embed in the periphery, witness the
successes of Arab nationalism, the Cuban revolution, the dominance of
Communist forces in all anti-colonial movements---the sole exception,
perhaps, being Cyprus---and, last but not least, the disastrous American
war in Vietnam. Contrary to what Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin argue, the
US-led making of global capitalism in the periphery during the Golden
Age was an utter failure. More to the point, as Robert Brenner has,
among many others, argued, the Golden Age nourished West German and
Japanese political economies to such a degree as to undermine America's
economic primacy from within. Open Door intra-imperialism began
unravelling. This is paramount: whereas [the **power-shift** of the
previous imperial order took place by way of competition between
externally related geopolitical and currency blocs fighting for
supremacy]{.underline}, what Lenin and Bukharin called inter-imperialist
contradictions, [concession of economic power to the two ends of Eurasia
whose post-war reconstruction owed so much to the USA occurred within
the US-dominated core proper]{.underline}. [This was the result of
intrinsic relations of intra-dependency, cooperation, rivalry and
combined development built in the very structure of hub-and-spoke
international politics and economics under the primacy of the USA: it
was an intra-imperialist **conflictual power-shift**. It does not
indicate economic integration and quasi-American primacy, but it does
indicate integration cum power-shift.]{.underline}

### Vaccine Link

#### Vaccine development isn't neutral and the aff can't just wave their hands and pretend it is -- its reliant on [extractive neocolonialism]{.underline} whereby the Global North [steal]{.underline} the [virus resources]{.underline} of the Global South only then to hoard the eventual vaccine which [skyrockets]{.underline} deaths

As global security scholar Shawn Smallman (2013) notes, [the
international health system of virus sharing embodies a neocolonial
relationship: it perpetuates the dependency of poorer countries impacted
by disease on wealthy ones, which secure the needs of their own peoples
while "keeping the governments of poorer states as
supplicants"]{.underline} (22).33 **[In practice, the virus-sharing
system makes affected nations give up their strains so that they can
serve as the substrate for developing treatments primarily accessible to
wealthy nations]{.underline}**. [This system unconscionably leaves
nations without the means to purchase them at the mercy of drug
donations gifted by wealthy nations and pharmaceutical
manufacturers]{.underline}. **[While pandemic flu preparedness did not
birth this skewed system, it exacerbated its inequities]{.underline}**.
In 2003, the GISN turned its attention to variants that might signal the
start of a pandemic, and this move stimulated the demand for samples of
potentially pandemic strains as well as the production of vaccines and
antivirals against them. [As demand intensified, the flu strains of
afflicted nations became an increasingly precious commodity sought by
nations in the Global North and their pharmaceutical
partners]{.underline}. [In the United States]{.underline}, where H5N1
did not appear (in birds) until much later in 2014, [federal flu plans
had nevertheless devoted significant attention to vaccine production as
the magic bullet in flu response, and enlisted the vast pharmaceutical
infrastructure by offering increased funding and other
incentives]{.underline}.34 **[This infrastructure in turn depended on
the acquisition of samples from afflicted
nations]{.underline}**---[China, as already mentioned, and also
Indonesia]{.underline}. The H5N1 strains that hit Indonesia were some of
the deadliest, with the nation experiencing 58 of the 158 total deaths
worldwide, and 75 of the 263 total cases, by the end of 2006 (WHO 2015).
[Indonesia became a major focus of the international health system and a
key site where its inequities materialized. Moreover, like China,
Indonesia resisted the inequitable international system.]{.underline}
[Indonesia had been providing samples to the GISN since finding its
first human case in July 2005. But in December 2006, Indonesia
stopped]{.underline}. Indonesian health minister Siti Fadilah Supari
explained these actions, in her public statements and publications,35 as
[a refusal to engage in a skewed international system of "virus
sharing." This included issues of credittaking similar to what had
befallen China]{.underline}: [in April 2006, results of laboratory
analyses involving viruses from Indonesia were presented at various
international meetings without permission or with last-minute
notification, and papers were written that added researchers from
Indonesia as co-authors only at the later stages of writing]{.underline}
(Sedyaningsih et al. 2008). Supari also highlighted how the
international system negatively affected Indonesia's health, when the
Indonesian government could not obtain antiviral oseltamivir (Tamiflu)
in late 2005 to treat initial cases of H5N1 because wealthy
countries---which had yet to have any cases---had bought up the supply
for their preparedness stockpiles (Supari 2008). Indonesia's inability
to access necessary treatment came to a head at the end of 2006, when
the Indonesian Ministry of Health discovered an Australian company's
plans to develop a vaccine against H5N1---using a strain Indonesia had
provided the WHO system, and without Indonesia's permission (Fidler
2008; Sedyaningsih et al. 2008). This violated WHO guidelines requiring
the donating countries' permission to develop vaccines.36 The Australian
drug company, CSL, later admitted to using Indonesian avian flu strains
to develop a trial vaccine, while also insisting that it had no
obligation to compensate Indonesia or guarantee the nation access to the
vaccine (Lakoff 2010). In an article published in 2008, the Indonesian
Ministry indicted the virus-sharing system, stating: "[Disease affected
countries, which are usually developing countries, provide information
and share biological specimens / virus with the WHO system; then
pharmaceutical industries of developed countries obtain free access to
this information and specimens, produce and patent the products
(diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics or other technologies), and sell
them back to the developing countries at unaffordable
prices]{.underline}" (Sedyaningsih et al. 2008, 486). [The ministry
showed that the system's inequity lies beyond the fact that Indonesia
lacked the manufacturing capacity and purchasing power of the rich
countries to acquire these high-demand treatments]{.underline}. **[The
problem also lies in the way the system demanded viral resources without
compensation for afflicted nations]{.underline}**. **[The wealthy
countries of the Global North could access viral resources from the
Global South for free, produce treatments derived from these resources,
and then hoard them]{.underline}**. Scholars and activists have used the
term "biocolonialism"37 or "**[extractive
biocolonialism]{.underline}**"38 (Whitt 2009) **[to describe how the
Global North appropriates biological riches]{.underline}** (plants,
animals, bodies, tissues, genes, etc.) **[from indigenous peoples, the
poor, the marginal, the weak, the subjugated, and the genetically
distinct]{.underline}**. [Well-known examples include U.S. researchers
and corporations patenting medicinal plants from abroad, such as neem
and ayahuasca, and the Human Genome Diversity Project's commodifying the
cell lines of indigenous peoples]{.underline}. **[This biocolonial
system is, moreover, the enduring legacy of colonial extraction of land,
labor, knowledge, and bodies, which has been updated in the contemporary
context of a knowledge-based economy, privatization, and the patent
system]{.underline}** (Hawthorne 2007; Thacker 2006). [An interconnected
cast of powerful characters]{.underline}---[Global North governments and
transnational corporations]{.underline}---[are the beneficiaries of
biocolonialism; they acquire an array of benefits, from health and
scientific advancement to reputation enhancement and profit. Diseases
may not seem like they fall under the rubric of "biological riches,"
since they are destructive entities that humans generally seek to stamp
out]{.underline}.39 [Yet, like plants and genetics,
disease]{.underline}---[the viral samples and other materials from which
disease data can be gleaned]{.underline}---[do constitute a resource,
one procured from the Global South for the advancement of the Global
North]{.underline}. Thus, the barriers Indonesia faced to obtaining the
medications it urgently needed, despite the fact that these medications
originated from its viral resources, were a product of the
biocoloniality of the virus-sharing system. [In addition to creating
tangible vulnerabilities for Global South locales such as China and
Indonesia, biocolonial extraction of samples and data imposed the
systems and frames of the Global North]{.underline}. [North-centric
regimes of property and ownership forced afflicted nations to "share"
viral data even while they enabled corporations to monopolize vaccines
and their distribution]{.underline}. [The ability to patent, and thus
hold exclusive rights over viruses and the products derived from them,
turned pathogenic flu samples into a form of biocapital that
pharmaceutical industries based in the Global North sought to acquire to
develop lucrative products for sale]{.underline}. A report on patenting
trends shows that in 2005 patent applications skyrocketed for H5N1
genetic sequences, vaccines, treatments, and diagnostics---from single
digits in prior years to over forty by 2007. The countries in the Global
North comprised the vast majority of patent holders. Over half (53
percent) of the patents filed in 2007 originated in the United States
(pharmaceutical companies, state-funded labs, government agencies such
as the CDC); 27 percent were from Europe; and 4 percent were from
Australia (Hammond 2009). Thus, patent holders largely based in the
Global North determined who to sell the treatments to. [Unbound by the
health demands of afflicted nations, government agencies in the Global
North could focus on preventative measures for diseases they were not
even afflicted by, and private corporations could make decisions based
on profitability]{.underline}.

### Arms Control Link

#### Calls for arms control and fear of dual-use is just imperialist propaganda to continue the unending war against the Other that has characterized US foreign policy since the beginning of the Cold War

studies at Skidmore College, "Bio-imperialism : disease, terror, and the
construction of national fragility", Rutgers University Press, 2021,

[The U.S. push for international biological disarmament in the late
1960s had been the product of both concern about the morality of
biological weapons and strategic disinterest given the rise of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} (the latter's proven power versus the former's
questionable efficacy). [Both considerations hinged on the notion that
some nations and peoples are unfit to possess weapons]{.underline}. In
February 1967, leading scientists penned a letter to the White House
opposing the use of biological weapons by invoking the notion of good /
bad national governments: "CB \[Chemical17 and biological\] weapons have
the potential of inflicting, especially on civilians, enormous
devastation and death which may be unpredictable in scope and intensity;
they could become far cheaper and easier to produce than nuclear
weapons, thereby placing great mass destructive power within reach of
nations not now possessing it; they could lend themselves to use by
leadership that may be desperate, irresponsible or unscrupulous" (quoted
in Robin Clarke's 1968 The Silent Weapons; emphasis added). [The notion
that some national governments were unfit to responsibly manage
dangerous weapons had been, since the post--World War II period of
rising U.S. power, a continuous thread in narratives of U.S.
exceptionalism]{.underline}---**[namely, of the United States as global
steward acting with just, altruistic motives]{.underline}**. [The trope
of the ill-intentioned, unfit Other was its
counterpoint]{.underline}---**[a trope the United States has used to
demonize entities that threaten U.S. power]{.underline}**: during the
Cold War, [it was applied to the Soviet Union and communism, shifting at
the end of the Cold War to "terrorists" and "rogue states"]{.underline}
(a history I described in the introduction). In the context of
biological weapons, the trope of the unfit Other proved useful not only
in the U.S. push for the ban on offensive weapons in the late 1960s, but
also in subsequent periods of renewed U.S. interest in biological arms
as "defense." In this vein, the post-9 / 11 national security state
mobilized the era's most well-worn trope of the Other---the Arab /
Muslim terrorist---to enhance U.S. biodefense. Section 1013 of the USA
PATRIOT Act, which focused specifically on biological warfare, outlined
an expanded role for public health (the subject of the next chapter) and
the bioscientific research enterprise in bioterrorism preparedness and
response, authorizing funding allocations accordingly. 18 The act cited
as rationale Osama bin Laden's statements of his intent to acquire WMDs:
"public pronouncements by Osama bin Laden that it is his religious duty
to acquire weapons of mass destruction, including chemical and
biological weapons." The section went on to describe a "callous
disregard for innocent human life as demonstrated by the terrorists'
attacks of September 11, 2001," and "the resources and motivation of
known terrorists and their sponsors and supporters to use biological
warfare." The characterization of bin Laden and the September 11
attackers invoked the figure of Arab / Muslim Other I described in the
previous chapter---defined by cultural and moral backwardness, and thus
uniquely motivated to harm innocents. The law's invocation of this
pervasive characterization thus helped concretize a bio-attack as
imminent and made it a basis for U.S. state action (i.e., to build up
its biodefense industry). On April 28, 2004, President George Bush
issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 10, "Biodefense
for the 21st Century," calling for renewed attention to biodefense. The
nine-page document began by quoting Bush's earlier (February 11) remarks
on the importance of countering international weapons proliferation:
"Armed with a single vial of a biological agent, small groups of
fanatics, or failing states, could gain the power to threaten great
nations, threaten the world peace. America, and the entire civilized
world, will face this threat for decades to come. We must confront the
danger with open eyes, and unbending purpose" (Bush 2004b; emphasis
added). The passage constructed a divide: malevolent groups in
possession of biological agents and ready to wield them, against "great
nations" such as the United States who are "civilized" and peaceful. Not
only does the latter group's possession of biological agents go
unmentioned, but by implication, their possession is presumed to be for
defensive purposes only. [The U.S. national security apparatus further
couched its biodefense industry in exceptionalist terms by recuperating
the notion of "dual use."]{.underline} [Dual use originated as a Cold
War term pertaining to a nuclear-focused quandary: that scientific
research could be applied toward either civilian or military
purposes]{.underline} (Atlas and Dando 2006; Chyba 2002). In [post-9 /
11 rhetoric, however, the term's usage shifted from a distinction of
domains to that of intent: "dual use" came to mark certain research
materials]{.underline}---those involving biological agents, for
instance---[as having the potential for both good and evil
purposes]{.underline}. In 2004, HHS set up the National Science Advisory
Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) to create rules for "dual use" research;
the official press release announcing the formation of the board stated:
"HHS Secretary Tommy G. Thompson today announced that HHS will lead a
government-wide effort to put in place improved biosecurity measures for
classes of legitimate biological research that could be misused to
threaten public health or national security---so-called 'dual use'
research" ("HHS Will Lead" 2004; emphasis added). [The distinction being
made here was between "legitimate research"]{.underline} (for either
health or military / security purposes) [by scientists in the United
States, and its misuse]{.underline}---[by implication the bioterrorist
Other]{.underline}. [This distinction thus legitimated research
according to who was conducting it, the assumption being that U.S.
science fields were motivated by good intent]{.underline}.

#### Blockchain just expands capitalism's environmental destruction to the digital realm

journalist and educator and member of the coordinating committee of
System Change Not Climate Change., \*\*is FracTracker Alliance's Eastern

disruptor", Monthly Review, 10/14/21,
https://mronline.org/2021/10/14/cryptocurrency-a-new-and-dangerous-climate-disruptor/

[How It Works]{.underline}: Like Playing Cards Stacked on Wishes

**[The first thing to understand is that cryptocurrency, like paper
money, has no intrinsic value]{.underline}**. [There's no gold or even a
precious substance that we'd need for life on Earth like, say, a gallon
of water, backing it, no government guaranteeing it.]{.underline}

**[Just as countries abandoned the gold standard decades ago and
replaced it with a system called "fiat money"]{.underline}** (such as
the U.S. dollar), **[it simply represents faith that individuals have
when they give and receive that currency]{.underline}**. **[Its
decentralized process, with millions of hosts, was ostensibly created in
part to cut down on illegal transactions.]{.underline}** **[Furthermore,
each different cryptocurrency--Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.--has its own
approach, adding to the complexity]{.underline}**.

One important term (among many arcane ones) in understanding
cryptocurrency is [blockchain, aka distributed ledger technology, DLT.
This is a way of keeping track of transactions that's transparent to
anyone who wishes to see them, and allows transactions to occur without
the use of a middle-entity such as a bank or credit card
company]{.underline}.

[The blockchain is essentially a database owned by the network, which
itself consists of millions of computers around the world, each with its
own key. Whenever a transaction occurs, the details (except for the two
parties' identities) are shared as a cryptographic puzzle with everyone
on the network. The computer on the vast network that first guesses the
details is the winner]{.underline}. This winner of the verification or
validation process collects several newly "minted" bitcoins--each now
worth \$50,000 or so--as a reward.

**[That's a big payout and tempting even for minor investors, but in
truth they can't compete: Those with the most and the fastest computers
reap the most money]{.underline}**.

[Digiconomist reports that the carbon footprint of a single Bitcoin
block in 2021 is roughly equal to the carbon footprint generated by
1,890,394 Visa transactions]{.underline}. **[A single mined Bitcoin has
a carbon footprint of 259 tons]{.underline}** (235 tonnes),**[in
comparison to that of a Bitcoin's worth of gold, at 24.25
tons]{.underline}** (22 tonnes).

Another term that is perhaps less known, but crucial in discussing the
impacts of cryptocurrency on the environment, is "proof-of-work," a
process used by both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This form of cryptocurrency
validation uses a method to achieve consensus on the blockchain. Simply
put, **[proof-of-work cryptocurrency is created as many machines all
work to solve the same complex mathematical equation, or puzzle. The
first machine to solve the problem wins]{.underline}**.

**[Thus, the more machines you have working on the same puzzle, the
greater your chances of profiting]{.underline}**. **[As the complexity
of the computations increases, it becomes harder for the average person
to profit, since one must have thousands of machines to remain
competitive]{.underline}**.

**[And so the system begins to resemble a traditional centralized
capitalist system that remains profitable--to the very
wealthy]{.underline}**.

**[Unregulated, Climate-Crazy Profiteering]{.underline}**

This facet of current cryptocurrency mining has drawn criticism from
previous enthusiasts, including Jackson Palmer, who cocreated Dogecoin.
He now calls it "an inherently right-wing, capitalistic technology built
primarily to amplify the wealth of its proponents through a combination
of tax avoidance, diminished regulatory oversight, and artificially
enforced scarcity."

And, he adds, "**[Cryptocurrency is like taking the worst parts of
today's capitalist system (e.g., corruption, fraud, inequity) and using
software do technically limit the use of interventions (e.g., audits,
regulation, taxation) which serve as protections or safety nets for the
average person. Financial exploitation undoubtedly existed before
cryptocurrency, but cryptocurrency is almost purpose built to make the
funnel of profiteering more efficient for those at the top and less
safeguarded for the vulnerable]{.underline}**."

**[And it's catastrophically energy-intensive]{.underline}**.

While there are other models for cryptocurrency mining, the
proof-of-work model is of particular concern to environmentalists
worldwide because of its energy-intensive nature. Proof-of-work mining
can use the same amount of energy as an entire country such as Argentina
(population 45.2 million).

A 2018 study published in Nature estimated conservatively, based on 2017
transactions, that the number of computers used to mine Bitcoin alone
could produce enough greenhouse gases to raise global temperatures above
the 2-degree Celsius tipping point before 2048. It's important to note
that cryptocurrency mining energy use has risen 320% in the past five
years.

Megatons of Electronic Waste and Attendant Toxins

**[Emissions from the electrical use are not the only ecological
disaster]{.underline}**. **[The machines generate a lot of heat, so they
need to kept cool, requiring more energy. Being used for ever
increasingly sophisticated computations, they need to be the speediest
and most powerful models available. Computer companies build in fast
obsolescence]{.underline}**--underscored in summer 2021 by Apple's
response to the revelation by the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab of
"ForcedEntry," as they call the Pegasus spyware that made 1.65 billion
Apple iPhones and other devices vulnerable to a complete, almost
undetectable takeover by the private Israeli surveillance firm NSO.

**[To counter the problem Apple issued a patch, but only for newer
devices, thus forcing those with devices six or more years old to remain
vulnerable or purchase new ones]{.underline}**.

**[These electronics contain toxic chemicals and heavy metals, which
leach into soil, water, and air--and the bodies of humans and other
species]{.underline}**.

In September 2021 a Dutch team economics team published a study,
"**[Bitcoin's growing e-waste problem]{.underline}**," in the journal
Resources, Conservation and Recycling. **[The researchers found that as
of May 2021, Bitcoin's annual e-waste generation had added up to 6.6
million pounds]{.underline}** (30.7 metric kilotons), **[with an average
per-transaction e-waste of 9.6 ounces]{.underline}** (272 grams).

#### Expansion of blockchain and mining operations destroys the environment

Robin **Scher '22**, is a writer based in South Africa. He is a graduate
of the Cultural Reporting and Criticism program at New York University,
"Crypto's Heavy Carbon Footprint", Counterpunch, 1/13/22,
https://www.counterpunch.org/2022/01/13/cryptos-heavy-carbon-footprint/

For advocates of cryptocurrency, **[the promise of an economic future
that is managed by a blockchain]{.underline}** (a decentralized database
that is shared among the nodes of a computer network, as opposed to
being held in a single location, such as a central bank) **[is
compelling]{.underline}**. For anyone paying attention, the rapid
expansion of cryptocurrency has been stunning. In 2019, the global
cryptocurrency market was approximately \$793 million. It's now expected
to reach nearly \$5.2 billion by 2026, according to a report by the
market research organization Facts and Factors. In just one
year---between July 2020 and June 2021---the global adoption of
cryptocurrency surged by more than 880 percent.

**[But the increasing popularity of cryptocurrency has environmentalists
on edge, as the digital "mining" of it creates a massive carbon
footprint due to the staggering amount of energy it
requires]{.underline}**. **[Based on data from the Bitcoin Energy
Consumption Indexfrom Digiconomist, an online tool created by data
scientist Alex de Vries, the carbon footprint of Bitcoin, the world's
largest cryptocurrency, is equivalent to that of New Zealand, with both
emitting nearly 37 megatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every
year,]{.underline}** according to a February 2021 CNBC article.

To understand why this is a problem, it's important to explain what goes
into creating a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Unlike fiat money, which is
regulated through central banks, transactions in Bitcoin are tracked
through a public ledger consisting of a network of computers around the
world: the blockchain. "**[Mining]{.underline}**"---a process in which
computational puzzles are solved in order to verify transactions between
users, which are then added to the blockchain---**[allows this
validation to take place, which is an energy-intensive
process]{.underline}**.

It's been a bit of a wild ride for Bitcoin. The market price of a single
bitcoin plunged below \$30,000 in June 2021 for the first time since
January 2021---falling by more than half from its April peak of around
\$65,000. Nevertheless, some analysts and billionaire investors are
still feeling bullish about the crypto coin, as several leading
businesses continue to adopt the currency.

**[Goldman Sachs started trading Bitcoin futures]{.underline}**
(agreeing to transact the coin at a predetermined future date and
price). Tesla invested \$1.5 billion in Bitcoin. **[PayPal announced in
March 2021 that it would allow its U.S. customers to use cryptocurrency
to pay its millions of online merchants. In September, El Salvador
became the first country to make bitcoin legal tender. This, coupled
with the fact that big-name brands like AT&T, Home Depot, Microsoft,
Starbucks and Whole Foods now accept bitcoin payments, could pave the
way for mainstream use]{.underline}**. **[But if the bulls are right and
the price of a single Bitcoin eventually hits \$500,000, it would pump
more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than what is released by
countries like Brazil or Mexico]{.underline}**.

[Another sector shaken up by digital assets is the art world, as digital
artworks have been making headlines for the huge amounts they've been
selling for on the market through the use of nonfungible tokens, more
commonly known as NFTs, a type of guarantee backed by the Ethereum
blockchain]{.underline}. In simpler terms, the works are created, or
"minted," through a process called proof-of-work (PoW), which
establishes its unique identity, as explained in an article on
Hyperallergic.

This is arguably an improvement over the traditional art market when it
comes to storing the value of the original work but is terrible for
carbon emissions. **[The carbon footprint of a single Ethereum
transaction as of December 2021 was 102.38 kilograms of CO2, which is
"Equivalent to the carbon footprint of 226,910 VISA transactions or
17,063 hours of watching YouTube,]{.underline}**" according to
Digiconomist. **[Meanwhile, the electrical energy footprint of a single
Ethereum transaction is about the same amount as the power that an
average U.S. household uses in 8.09 days]{.underline}**, the website
further states.

In March 2021, Austrian architect Chris Precht announced that he was
"\[abandoning\] plans to sell digital artworks backed by NFTs due to the
environmental impact of mining the digital tokens," according to Dezeen
magazine. He said that he had created three digital artworks and wanted
to sell them using blockchain technology. "**[I wanted to create 300
tokens because I had three art pieces and I wanted to make each one in
an edition of 100]{.underline}**. ... **[I would have used the amount of
electricity I usually use in two decades]{.underline}**," Precht
explained.

"\[**[W\]e're largely powering 21st-century technology with 19th-century
energy sources]{.underline}**," Andrew Hatton, head of information
technology at Greenpeace United Kingdom, told CNBC. He attributes this
energy usage to the "huge amount of data-crunching needed to create and
maintain this cyber-currency," a process that demands a lot of
electricity. The problem, according to Hatton, is that "only about a
fifth of the electricity used in the world's data centers comes from
renewable sources."

**[Another crucial aspect of cryptocurrency is that there is only a
limited supply available. So, over time, as more bitcoin is mined, the
complex math problems needed for transactions get harder to solve,
demanding more energy in turn]{.underline}**. The system is designed
this way so that each digital token that gets issued contains its own
unique cryptographic reference to the blockchain, ensuring its security.
**[The issue of energy usage over time is further exacerbated by
incentives attached to mining. In terms of Bitcoin, each time a miner
solves the complex hashing algorithm required to produce
bitcoin]{.underline}** (the "PoW"), **[they receive a small amount of
the cryptocurrency itself]{.underline}**.

The inherent problem with this, as Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of
Ethereum, toldCNBC, is that "**[the more successful bitcoin gets, the
higher the price goes; the higher the price goes, the more competition
for bitcoin; and thus the more energy is expended to mine
\[it\]]{.underline}**." As the price continues to rise, so will the
incentive to mine the cryptocurrency, creating a feedback loop that
spells trouble for the climate.

According to December 2021 figures from the Cambridge Bitcoin
Electricity Consumption Index, [Bitcoin makes up around 0.52 percent of
the total global electricity consumption. That might not sound like
much, but Digiconomist calculates Bitcoin's total annual power
consumption to be around 204.50 terawatt-hours, equivalent to the power
consumption of Thailand]{.underline}.

#### Decentralization serves capitalist influence by preventing an effective communist bulwark -- history proves

[Decentralization vs. Survival]{.underline}

**[For a peoples revolution to survive, it must seize state power and
use it to (a) break the stranglehold exercised by the owning class over
the society\'s institutions and resources, and (b) withstand the
reactionary counterattack that is sure to come]{.underline}**. **[The
internal and external dangers a revolution faces necessitate a
centralized state power that is not particularly to anyone\'s liking,
not in Soviet Russia in 1917, nor in Sandinista Nicaragua in
1980]{.underline}**.

[Engels offers an apposite account of an uprising in Spain in 1872- 73
in which anarchists seized power in municipalities across the country.
At first, the situation looked promising]{.underline}. [The king had
abdicated and the bourgeois government could muster but a few thousand
ill-trained troops]{.underline}. [Yet this ragtag force prevailed
because it faced a thoroughly parochialized rebellion]{.underline}.
\"Each town proclaimed itself as a sovereign canton and set up a
revolutionary committee (junta),\" Engels writes. **[\"\[E\]ach town
acted on its own, declaring that the important thing was not cooperation
with other towns but separation from them, thus precluding any
possibility of a combined attack \[against bourgeois forces\] \" It was
\"the fragmentation and isolation of the revolutionary forces which
enabled the government troops to smash one revolt after the
other]{.underline}**.\"7

**[Decentralized parochial autonomy is the graveyard of
insurgency]{.underline}**---**[which may be one reason why there has
never been a successful anarcho-syndicalist revolution]{.underline}**.
**[Ideally, it would be a fine thing to have only local, self-directed,
worker participation, with minimal bureaucracy, police, and
military]{.underline}**. **[This probably would be the development of
socialism, were socialism ever allowed to develop unhindered by
counterrevolutionary subversion and attack]{.underline}**.

[One might recall how, in 1918-20, fourteen capitalist nations,
including the United States, invaded Soviet Russia in a bloody but
unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the revolutionary Bolshevik
government]{.underline}. **[The years of foreign invasion and civil war
did much to intensify the Bolsheviks\' siege psychology with its
commitment to lockstep party unity and a repressive security
apparatus]{.underline}**. [Thus, in May 1921, the same Lenin who had
encouraged the practice of internal party democracy and struggled
against Trotsky in order to give the trade unions a greater measure of
autonomy, now called for an end to the Workers\' Opposition and other
factional groups within the party]{.underline}.8 \"The time has come,\"
he told an enthusiastically concurring Tenth Party Congress, \"to put an
end to opposition, to put a lid on it: we have had enough opposition.\"
Open disputes and conflicting tendencies within and without the party,
the communists concluded, created an appearance of division and weakness
that invited attack by formidable foes.

Only a month earlier, in April 1921, Lenin had called for more worker
representation on the party\'s Central Committee. In short, he had
become not anti-worker but anti-opposition. Here was a social revolution
--- like every other---that was not allowed to develop its political and
material life in an unhindered way.9

**[By the late 1920s, the Soviets faced the choice of (a) moving in a
still more centralized direction with a command economy and forced
agrarian collectivization and full-speed industrialization under a
commandist, autocratic party leadership, the road taken by Stalin, or
(b) moving in a liberalized direction, allowing more political
diversity, more autonomy for labor unions and other organizations, more
open debate and criticism, greater autonomy among the various Soviet
republics, a sector of privately owned small businesses, independent
agricultural development by the peasantry, greater emphasis on consumer
goods, and less effort given to the kind of capital accumulation needed
to build a strong militaryindustrial base]{.underline}**.

The latter course, I believe, would have produced a more comfortable,
more humane and serviceable society. **[Siege socialism would have given
way to worker-consumer socialism. The only problem is that the country
would have risked being incapable of withstanding the Nazi
onslaught]{.underline}**. **[Instead, the Soviet Union embarked upon a
rigorous, forced industrialization. This policy has often been mentioned
as one of the wrongs perpetrated by Stalin upon his
people]{.underline}**.10 It consisted mostly of building, within a
decade, an entirely new, huge industrial base east of the Urals in the
middle of the barren steppes, the biggest steel complex in Europe, in
anticipation of an invasion from the West. \"Money was spent like water,
men froze, hungered and suffered but the construction went on with a
disregard for individuals and a mass heroism seldom paralleled in
history.\"11

**[Stalins prophecy that the Soviet Union had only ten years to do what
the British had done in a century proved correct. When the Nazis invaded
in 1941, that same industrial base, safely ensconced thousands of miles
from the front, produced the weapons of war that eventually turned the
tide. The cost of this survival included 22 million Soviet citizens who
perished in the war and immeasurable devastation and suffering, the
effects of which would distort Soviet society for decades
afterward]{.underline}**.

**[All this is not to say that everything Stalin did was of historical
necessity]{.underline}**. **[The exigencies of revolutionary survival
did not \"make inevitable\" the heartless execution of hundreds of Old
Bolshevik leaders, the personality cult of a supreme leader who claimed
every revolutionary gain as his own achievement, the suppression of
party political life through terror, the eventual silencing of debate
regarding the pace of industrialization and collectivization, the
ideological regulation of all intellectual and cultural life, and the
mass deportations of \"suspect\" nationalities]{.underline}**.

**[The transforming effects of counterrevolutionary attack have been
felt in other countries. A Sandinista military officer I met in Vienna
in 1986 noted that Nicaraguans were \"not a warrior people\" but they
had to learn to fight because they faced a destructive, U.S.- sponsored
mercenary war]{.underline}**. **[She bemoaned the fact that war and
embargo forced her country to postpone much of its socio-economic
agenda]{.underline}**. **[As with Nicaragua, so with Mozambique, Angola
and numerous other countries in which U.S.-financed mercenary forces
destroyed farmlands, villages, health centers, and power stations, while
killing or starving hundreds of thousands]{.underline}**---**[the
revolutionary baby was strangled in its crib or mercilessly bled beyond
recognition]{.underline}**. **[This reality ought to earn at least as
much recognition as the suppression of dissidents in this or that
revolutionary society]{.underline}**.

[The overthrow of Eastern European and Soviet communist governments was
cheered by many left intellectuals. Now democracy would have its
day]{.underline}. The people would be free from the yoke of communism
and the U.S. Left would be free from the albatross of existing
communism, or as left theorist Richard Lichtman put it, \"liberated from
the incubus of the Soviet Union and the succubus of Communist China.\"

**[In fact, the capitalist restoration in Eastern Europe seriously
weakened the numerous Third World liberation struggles that had received
aid from the Soviet Union and brought a whole new crop of right-wing
governments into existence, ones that now worked hand-in-glove with U.S.
global counterrevolutionaries around the globe]{.underline}**.

In addition, **[the overthrow of communism gave the green light to the
unbridled exploitative impulses of Western corporate
interests]{.underline}**. **[No longer needing to convince workers that
they live better than their counterparts in Russia, and no longer
restrained by a competing system, the corporate class is rolling back
the many gains that working people in the West have won over the years.
Now that the free market, in its meanest form, is emerging triumphant in
the East, so will it prevail in the West.]{.underline}** **[\"Capitalism
with a human face\" is being replaced by \"capitalism in your
face.\"]{.underline}** As Richard Levins put it, \"So in the new
exuberant aggressiveness of world capitalism we see what communists and
their allies had held at bay\" (Monthly Review\> 9/96).

**[Having never understood the role that existing communist powers
played in tempering the worst impulses of Western capitalism and
imperialism, and having perceived communism as nothing but an
unmitigated evil, the left anticommunists did not anticipate the losses
that were to come]{.underline}**. **[Some of them still don\'t get
it]{.underline}**.

### China Coop Link

#### US interest in China is rooted in an imperial-capitalist desire to use informal-networks of nations to [displace]{.underline} the violent failings of capital onto other while [preserving]{.underline} and [hoarding]{.underline} the wealth of the system for the Global North

Atul **Kohli '20**, is the David K.E. Bruce Professor of International
Affairs at Princeton University. His principal research interests are in

the Developing World", Oxford University Press, 2020, accessed via pdf

It may be useful at the outset to preview the general argument that is
developed below with reference to historical analysis. [The question,
first, is what motives drove the United States to expand overseas at the
end of the nineteenth century?]{.underline} [The pressures to expand
overseas had been building in the decades following the Civil
War]{.underline}. **[During this period, the United States developed a
powerful industrial economy]{.underline}**. **[The example of Britain
was very much on the minds of influential Americans, and arguments
emerged that great powers must seek commercial opportunities beyond
their borders]{.underline}**, and that they needed to build military
power to support those ambitions. Along with an industrial economy,
then, the United States developed a powerful navy. **[The boom-and-bust
character of a buoyant capitalist economy added to the argument that
ready access to overseas markets could smooth market fluctuations and
facilitate steady economic growth and national power]{.underline}**.
**[With much of the global periphery already colonized, however, the
United States sought access to the few remaining open economic
spaces]{.underline}**. **[The largest of these was China, and the lure
of the Chinese market loomed large in America's early overseas
imagination]{.underline}**. **[The Philippines was initially deemed a
desirable acquisition as a stepping-stone to China; it would be
America's Hong Kong]{.underline}**. Closer to home, Britain was still a
major presence in the large economies of Argentina, Brazil, and even
Mexico. However, the American economy was becoming more competitive and
American naval power was growing. New opportunities were opening up,
especially in the Caribbean and Central America. Britain was still a
formidable presence, but weaker European powers such as Spain were ready
to be expelled from their few remaining colonial outposts. Nationalist
revolts against Spanish colonialism in Cuba and the Philippines provided
the United States with opportunities to intervene, avowedly in support
of those country's indigenous nationalists. However, quick naval
victories over Spain did not lead to independence for Cuba or the
Philippines, but to suppression of the indigenous nationalists and the
creation of new American colonies. [With naval bases in the Philippines,
the United States became a Pacific power]{.underline}. **[This enabled
it to claim a right]{.underline}**---**[in a condominium with other
major imperial powers]{.underline}**---**[to full and open access to the
Chinese market, the big prize all along]{.underline}**. Stronger
presence in the Caribbean led the United States to appropriate Panama
from Colombia and to build the Panama Canal. The canal, in turn, was of
great value, not only to the US Navy but also to manufacturing interests
on the American East Coast; the canal made access to the Pacific much
easier and trade routes more profitable. The rulers of weaker southern
neighbors were tamed, to favor either American investors or to ensure
payment of debt owed to Americans, or even to Europeans. [McKinley,
Roosevelt, and Taft encouraged these developments, not only because of
their close ties to America's economic elite, but also because they
viewed overseas expansion as essential for America's prosperity and
global might]{.underline}. **[Next, what were the main mechanisms used
by the United States to establish imperial influence
overseas?]{.underline}** **[Unlike Britain, the United States was never
comfortable acquiring full-fledged colonies]{.underline}**. **[The
country's anticolonial history played a role, as did important facts on
the ground: at the end of the nineteenth century much of the world was
already occupied by Europeans, and by then the United States had already
acquired an enormous amount of continental territory of its
own]{.underline}**. **[What the United States now wanted instead was
access to overseas markets and, on occasion, control over strategically
significant pieces of land]{.underline}**. **[After some trial and
error]{.underline}**---a process that included the full colonization of
the Philippines and nearly full colonization of Cuba for more than half
a century---**[the United States settled on a strategy of building an
informal empire]{.underline}**. Of course, the United States hardly
invented this form of imperialism; as we have seen, informal imperialism
was part of Britain's extensive imperial repertoire. And as with
Britain, **[the essential mechanism that the United States used for
building an informal empire was to create stable-but-subservient regimes
on the periphery: stability was necessary for protecting property and
profits, and subservient regimes were needed to do America's bidding,
including maintaining favorable economic policies]{.underline}**.
**[Establishing stable-but-subservient regimes in other countries is
never easy]{.underline}**. A variety of obstacles that Britain faced in
the nineteenth century in Argentina, Egypt, and China have been
discussed (chapter 2). [By the time the United States arrived on the
global scene as a late imperialist, emerging mass politics and
nationalism in peripheral countries had added new and additional
challenges]{.underline}. **[These had to be confronted]{.underline}**.
**[Even at this early stage, the United States used a range of
strategies that eventually came to define America's way to empire: hard
militarism, in the Philippines]{.underline}** (and to an extent in
Cuba); **[multilateral domination, in China]{.underline}**; **[and
forced regime change in neighboring countries, such as
Nicaragua]{.underline}**. **[We will see that these early strategies
represented long-term patterns in the making]{.underline}**. **[The
imperial strategy of hard militarism used to establish a
stable-but-subservient regime in the Philippines would be employed by
the United States again in Vietnam and Iraq]{.underline}**.
**[Similarly, the multilateral domination of China via the Open Door
policy cast the die for future American efforts to establish an open
global economy regime in the post--World War II period
and]{.underline}**, more recently and more relevant to the themes of
this volume, **[to impose the Washington Consensus on developing
countries]{.underline}**. [And last, overt or covert regime
change]{.underline}---anywhere from Iran to Chile---[has become a
permanent part of the repertoire that the United States uses to
establish its informal empire.]{.underline} As to the question of why
the United States is inclined toward one strategy of domination in one
place and another in a different place, early historical evidence points
in a number of directions. [Regime change may seem the best option when
narrow economic interests are at stake]{.underline} ([especially those
of American-based overseas corporations]{.underline}) [or when the
United States enjoys overwhelming power superiority over a potential
client state]{.underline}. For example, US efforts to change rulers in
the mini-states south of the border were often aimed at ensuring the
profitability of such American companies as the United Fruit Company.
**[But when the stakes are higher and the tasks more complex, as they
were in the case of maintaining open access to the Chinese economy, the
implementation of an imperial agenda requires moving beyond bilateral
interventions to create a system of domination]{.underline}**.
**[Smaller players who get in the way of the pursuit of high-stakes
goals are likely to be thrashed]{.underline}**. **[This was the fate of
the Filipino nationalists at the turn of the century]{.underline}**.
**[The Open Door notes, in turn, were aimed at creating a coalition of
imperialists to prevent the further carving up of China, maintain the
subservient regime in power, and keep the Chinese economy open for all
to exploit]{.underline}**; **[the fact that the American economy could
increasingly outcompete the economies of other imperial powers only
helped to cement American preference for this pathway to informal
empire]{.underline}**. Last, it is important to take stock of the impact
of the costs to and benefits for both the United States and its client
states. [Unlike Britain, the United States was a giant continental-size
economy; it depended less than Britain did on overseas economic
interactions for its buoyancy]{.underline}. **[It would be hard to make
the case]{.underline}**---and I will not make it---**[that the United
States needed colonies and client states to sustain its economic
dynamism]{.underline}**. **[Need and want are related but point to
different degrees of desirability]{.underline}**. A formal and informal
empire was probably essential for Britain to sustain its industrial
revolution in the nineteenth century; in this sense, Britain needed an
empire. **[By contrast]{.underline}**---**[there being no limit to human
or national wants]{.underline}**---**[the United States wanted overseas
acquisitions to augment its growing wealth and power]{.underline}**. As
will become clear, **[this distinction between need and want has
implications for understanding some important contrasts between the
British and US modes of building a global empire: building an empire for
the United States]{.underline}**---**[even an informal
empire]{.underline}**---**[has always been more a matter of choice than
of necessity]{.underline}**. **[The element of choice, in turn, has
added tentativeness to America's imperial quests and nearly always has
provoked disagreements at home.]{.underline}** Although the economic
benefits of imperialism for the United States may not appear to have
been large, their value has to be assessed in relation to the cost of
acquiring and maintaining them. [In light of the huge power resources
that the United States had begun to build by the end of the nineteenth
century, the cost of most of its forays into peripheral states were
marginal]{.underline}. **[When costs were significant, as, for example,
during the first two years in the Philippines, they were borne by US
taxpayers and soldiers; the eventual gains were mainly
private]{.underline}**. **[From this standpoint, overseas acquisitions
led to significant gains, at least for select Americans]{.underline}**.
**[I document below that the growing empire provided markets for
American manufacturers, cheap raw materials for an industrializing
economy, and opportunities for investment in mines and
commodities]{.underline}**. At times, the benefits of empire transcended
private gains, especially when such gains were political; foreign naval
bases and fueling stations thus added to the American capacity to
project power and so to its status as a new global power. The following
assessment of the American impact on its client states discusses both
economic and political developments. [Forced integration with the
American economy often provided client states with opportunities for
economic growth, mainly via growth in commodity exports]{.underline}.
[But such a pattern of growth also created important economic and
political distortions]{.underline}. [South of the border, for example,
American corporations came to own large slices of commodityexporting
economies, and the US government often supported friendly dictators to
keep protests in those countries at bay]{.underline}. The results
included poorly governed societies with sharp inequalities, sustained
low levels of living, and long-term political instability, including
revolutions, as in Cuba. **[The case of the Philippines under American
tutelage offers further parallels. The Philippines, too, experienced
commodity-led growth in the early twentieth century, but longer-term
developments were far from benign: there were limits to commodity-led
growth; the dependent pattern of growth gave rise to enormous
inequalities; political power came to be concentrated in the hands of
large landlords and middle-class politicians willing to do America's
bidding; and a nationalist coalition to lead industrialization failed to
emerge, pushing the Philippines down a pathway that resembled the
political economies of Latin America more than those of its Asian
neighborhood. The impact of US intervention on China was far more
diffuse, though again, hardly benign]{.underline}**. [China was a giant
political economy in which the state was already teetering on the brink
of collapse at the turn of the century]{.underline}. As discussed in
chapter 2, Britain and Japan were the major imperial powers in China;
the importance of the United States was secondary. **[But once the
United States became a Pacific power, it sided with other imperial
powers to keep the Chinese economy open and to preserve the power of an
ineffective monarchy]{.underline}**. [A variety of modernizing forces
were beginning to emerge in China during this period, some aimed at
expelling foreigners, others at reforming or abolishing the monarchy,
and some at both. More often than not, the United States opposed these
forces]{.underline}. For example, the United States joined other
imperial powers in defeating the Boxer rebellion, and then supported but
undermined the power of the Ch'ing monarchy by imposing huge
indemnity---thus contributing to the monarchy's
disintegration---**[paving the way to a half-century of political
instability that only ended with the victory of
communists]{.underline}**.

#### US policy towards China has [always]{.underline} been geared towards forcing their markets open for trade, [not]{.underline} outright colonization -- the aff's "concession" is no more than a smokescreen to diminish the role of economic warfare

[If the motives]{.underline} ([mainly economic]{.underline}) [and
mechanisms]{.underline} (mainly collaboration with other imperial powers
and a weak Chinese monarchy) [of American informal empire in China are
relatively clear, a few comments on the impact will help bring this
discussion to a conclusion]{.underline}. Any discussion of impact,
however, must begin with a reiteration of some obvious historical facts;
they will help keep the analysis in perspective. **[Both the United
States and China were giant economies during the time period under
consideration; for example, their GDPs around 1900 constituted some 15
percent and 10 percent of the world GDP, respectively]{.underline}**.
The United States exported only 7 percent to 8 percent of its total
production, and of that, the share of American exports to China was only
1 percent to 2 percent of total American exports. **[China, too, was
coming apart because of its inability to respond effectively to Western
and Japanese incursions]{.underline}**. Britain was the main imperial
power in China in the nineteenth century, and Japan's role grew steadily
during the first half of the twentieth century. The US role grew in the
aftermath of the Spanish-American War, but the United States remained a
distant third. In light of such obvious facts, it [would be absurd to
claim that the United States had gained handsomely from its incursions
into China or that China had been hurt precipitously by American
interventions]{.underline}. I make no such claims. **[What needs to be
briefly discussed instead is the direction of change as American
influence in China grew]{.underline}**. **[We have seen that American
policy in China was aimed mainly at trade expansion]{.underline}**. As
it turned out, [trade indeed did expand following the adoption of Open
Door policies. If in 1900 American businessmen had exported \$15 million
worth of products, by 1905 exports had jumped sharply, to \$53
million]{.underline} (Table 4.1). Most of these exports were sold in
northern China, especially Manchuria. Nearly half of all American
exports to China in 1905 were textiles; more telling is that the Chinese
share of total US textile exports had increased from some 12 percent in
1895 to 55 percent in 1905.147 [While the share of all US exports that
went to China remained miniscule, it did double between 1902 and 1906;
for some industries, such as textiles, the gains were
decisive]{.underline}. Textile exports declined sharply after Japan
gained control of Manchuria. Kerosene and cigarette exports grew instead
in the subsequent periods, and they remained America's main exports well
into the 1920s. As noted, the United States' investments and loans in
China were not of great significance; for example, on the eve of World
War I, the share of American foreign investment in China was only 3
percent of the total foreign investment in China, while that of Japan
was nearly 35 percent. **[The Open Door policy was aimed at expanding
trade, not investments, and trade did expand]{.underline}**. Though the
overall gains were not dramatic, the gains of some specific industries
were substantial. [Lobbyists from such industries as textiles, kerosene,
and cigarette, in turn, continued to press US policymakers to maintain
access to the China market]{.underline}. **[The real impact of the
growing American influence in China was political and, judged from the
standpoint of a sovereign and effective state within China, the impact
was largely negative]{.underline}**. Like the British in the nineteenth
century, **[American policymakers desired stability and economic
openness in China; they decided that these goals would be best met by
supporting a pliable monarchy]{.underline}**. [A rule of sorts seems to
be in operation here: whenever imperial powers chose not to colonize a
peripheral country, a stable-but-subservient government in that country
often emerged as a preferred pathway to establishing
influence]{.underline}. Be that as it may, the United States' decision
to join other imperial powers in China to prop up the disintegrating
rule of the Ch'ing was a mistake, even from the standpoint of America's
own longer-term goal of political stability in China. **[The United
States was an anticolonial and antimonarchical power. American
decision-makers should have known better]{.underline}**. **[Instead,
they were in a hurry to join the club of big imperialist
powers]{.underline}**. **[They therefore ignored the powerful emerging
forces within China that were demanding modernization]{.underline}**.
**[The Taiping and Boxer Rebellions were early manifestations of this
churning; a variety of nationalists and communists would soon join the
clamor]{.underline}**. The Empress Dowager's decision to throw the
weight of the Chinese state with the anti-foreigner Boxers, further
delegitimized the monarchy. When it was overthrown, there was no ready
force in China to establish central authority. **[It would take few
decades of internal Chinese initiatives to re-establish such authority
and to expunge imperial powers from China]{.underline}**. Conclusion In
a comparative study of British and American imperialism published in
1981, Tony Smith argued that prior to World War II the United States
was, on balance, a friend of nationalism in the underdeveloped regions
of the world. He went on to suggest that the United States only became
an "anti-nationalist" or a "counterrevolutionary" power in the
post--World War II period, when Third World nationalism joined forces
with communism, as exemplified, say, in the Chinese Communist Revolution
and the related war in Korea.148 I am afraid that the historical
evidence examined above does not support this conclusion. **[The
evidence suggests instead that well before the advent of communism, the
United States consistently fought nationalist forces to establish
influence over peripheral political economies]{.underline}**. This is
evident in the cases we have examined thus far. [In Cuba, Americans were
wary of the supporters of José Martí and suppressed the nationalists to
establish control; in Nicaragua, the United States orchestrated the
overthrow of the nationalist ruler Zelaya in favor of pro-American
governments; in the Philippines, the United States ruthlessly defeated
the forces of the nationalist Aguinaldo and then systematically
discouraged the emergence of any nationalist challenge to American
colonial rule; and in the case of China, the United States sided with
other imperial powers against the proto-nationalist Boxers and even took
a position against the Ch'ing monarch when she decided to ally with
antiforeigner forces within China]{.underline}. **[These American
interventions followed a logic]{.underline}**. **[The American economy
had industrialized rapidly toward the end of the nineteenth century.
Many in the United States were arguing for economic expansion abroad,
especially into regions that could absorb US manufactured
products]{.underline}**. It built a powerful navy, in part to support
these ambitions. [Since much of the underdeveloped world was already
colonized, American expansionist efforts focused either on regions that
were close to home or on distant islands in the Pacific that would
ensure that the United States reached the great China
market]{.underline}. **[As the United States sought to expand, it often
ran into resistance from nationalist forces whose goals were at odds
with those of the Americans. The United States systematically eliminated
this nationalist resistance]{.underline}**. Rightly or wrongly,
policymakers in the United States concluded that American interests in
the Caribbean, Central America, and the Far East---mostly economic, but
on occasion, strategic---would instead be best served by pliable
governments that could ensure order and openness. **[As in the case of
Britain's informal empire, then, the creation of stable-but-subservient
regimes in the peripheral countries emerged as the means to expand
commerce and establish American influence overseas]{.underline}**. The
historical evidence we have examined suggests that the United States
pursued a variety of approaches to establishing stable-but-subservient
regimes abroad. **[Three of these approaches are worth underlining in
this conclusion because they proved to be of long-run significance. The
first was hard militarism, most clearly evident in how the United States
established control over the Philippines]{.underline}**. Thousands of
American soldiers were employed in a three-year war that led to the
death of some 200,000 Filipino civilians. Thus was the American peace
established! It will become clear in subsequent chapters that this early
instance of hard militarism in the Philippines has more than a passing
resemblance to strategy the United States used in subsequent periods as
well, in, say, Vietnam and Iraq. [Overt or covert regime change was the
second strategy that the United States used during this early phase to
establish pro-American rulers. This was clearest in the case of Zelaya
in Nicaragua. Beyond Nicaragua, the practice of periodic military
interventions aimed at either taming governmental behavior or changing
rulers outright was also evident in the cases of Cuba and
Honduras]{.underline}. Over time, we will notice---especially in cases
of Mossadegh in Iran and Allende in Chile---that forced regime change
also become a key strategy in the American repertoire for establishing
pro-American governments abroad. The third approach, most clearly
evident in the case of China, was the collaboration with other imperial
powers to ensure a stable-but-open government. **[Multilateral
collaboration is, then, a strategy that the United States has continued
to pursue in recent times, the clearest example being the use of
structural adjustment programs via the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to ensure that developing countries paid their debts
to first world bankers]{.underline}**. **[Why did the United States
pursue different strategies to establish influence in different parts of
the developing world?]{.underline}** A full answer will emerge only in
due course, after I have reviewed additional historical evidence. For
now, the limited evidence points to some tentative generalizations.
**[The Philippines was acquired mainly as a stepping-stone to reach a
critical goal, namely, access to the China market. American aims in the
Philippines itself were thus vague, but resistance to American
domination was rather strong. This combination of vague goals on the way
to something great, but also strong resistance, then, seems to attract
hard militarism as an imperial strategy]{.underline}**. We will have an
opportunity to examine this proposition further in the case of American
interventions in Vietnam and Iraq. **[By contrast, when American goals
are specific]{.underline}**---**[say, creating economic opportunities
for corporations]{.underline}**---**[and the relative power advantage of
the United States is considerable, then regime change seems to emerge as
the appropriate strategy to create pliable rulers]{.underline}**. This
logic was clearly at work in the case of Nicaragua, and we will examine
it further in the cases of Iran and Chile. **[Finally, the case of
American expansion into China suggests that multilateral collaboration
is needed to establish dominance when the power resources of the United
States are not sufficient to accomplish the task at hand]{.underline}**.
Again, there will be an opportunity to examine this proposition further
against more contemporary evidence, especially the effort to impose the
Washington Consensus on development on Latin America. Whether one judges
American economic gains from its expansionist efforts as modest or
significant depends on the standards one brings to bear on the subject.
[The American economy was already a giant economy and depended mostly on
internal resources and markets]{.underline}. The United States exported
less than 10 percent of its products overseas, and most of these went to
Europe or Canada. [Prior to the Spanish-American War, US direct
investments overseas were also trivial]{.underline}. **[From this
standpoint, one could legitimately conclude that the United States
hardly needed to expand into underdeveloped regions to maintain its
prosperity or build its national strength]{.underline}**. That is why I
began this chapter by making a distinction between need and
want---whereas Britain needed an empire, the United States merely wanted
one. **[Many in the United States, though not everyone, thought that
economic expansion abroad would both help smooth out the boom-and-bust
quality of rapid capitalist expansion and also provide long-term outlets
to solve the problem of glut in the American economy]{.underline}**. The
results of the American efforts suggest that such thinking was not
wrong, that American gains from its expansionist efforts were far from
insignificant. It is clear in Table 4.1 that US trade expanded rapidly
in the countries in which it established political sway following the
Spanish-American War. The gains in Cuba and the Philippines, especially,
were steady and even dramatic. Trade also jumped sharply in China
following the Open Door policy, but then declined rapidly when Japan
closed off Manchuria to the United States and as a result of the growing
political turmoil in China. Over time, however, the United States
recovered from these setbacks and re-established a strong trading
position. American direct investments overseas also grew sharply after
the that war: if before the war total US foreign investments were under
USD 1 billion, by 1914 they had grown to USD 5 billion, and then to
nearly \$8 to \$10 billion in the 1920s.149 More telling, nearly half of
this investment in 1929 was in Latin America, mostly in the Caribbean;
little Cuba alone took \$1.4 billion of American foreign investment that
year. The evidence, then, supports the contention that perceived
economic needs within the United States led to imperial expansion, and
both trade and investment followed the flag. **[The impact of American
expansion on its protectorates was pernicious]{.underline}**. There is
no need to deny that commodity exports in places like Cuba and the
Philippines helped generate some economic growth, but mainly over the
short run. [Over the longer term, however, American protectorates became
classic colonies that produced commodities and took manufactured
goods]{.underline}. **[Commodity producers, in turn, became both wealthy
and powerful. While such groups]{.underline}**---**[and their political
representatives]{.underline}**---**[were happy to cooperate with the
United States, they seldom had enough legitimacy to establish orderly
polities]{.underline}**. **[Economic inequalities and illegitimate
rulers gave rise to poorly governed societies]{.underline}**. Creating
sovereign and legitimate states might have put these countries on a
progressive path. **[Unfortunately, the weight of American influence was
often in the opposite direction; US influence tended to undermine
nationalist leaders who may have commanded the majority support needed
to create effective, developmental states]{.underline}**.

#### The desire to cooperate with China is the same imperialist fantasy that we've had since the 1890s when we tried to "crack open" the Chinese economy

As noted, during the 1890s, **[the idea that the United States needed to
expand overseas to maintain its national prosperity gained currency
among influential Americans]{.underline}**. [In addition to its own
neighborhood of the Americas just discussed]{.underline}--- [regions
that were traditionally delineated as being within the American sphere
of influence by the Monroe Doctrine]{.underline}---[the China market
offered great possibilities in the Far East]{.underline}. Even if
self-serving returning missionaries had originally propagated this idea,
**[many businessmen came to share the view that the giant economy of
China]{.underline}**---**[one of the largest preindustrial countries
that was still not colonized]{.underline}**---**[might offer an outlet
for America's rapidly growing industrial production and investment
needs]{.underline}**.104 **[American businessmen, however, could not go
it alone in China]{.underline}**. Other country governments were already
providing systematic support to their own businessmen, including the
governments of Great Britain, Japan, Germany, and Russia. **[Many
policymakers in the United States were then persuaded not only of the
importance of the China market, but also of the need of governmental
involvement]{.underline}**. **[Once the lure of the China market became
great, the US made a "conscious, purposeful and integrated effort to
open door to China"; from then on, the United States used traditional
realpolitik to seek open economic spaces in distant
China]{.underline}**.105 [Gaining open economic access to China was not
going to be easy, however]{.underline}. Not only was China becoming
turbulent at the end of the century, but other major powers also were
already on the ground there. [Access to China would thus require
governmental support, and in practical terms, that meant the support of
a growing navy]{.underline}. [The navy, in turn, would require bases and
coaling stations on the way to China]{.underline}. Influential thinkers
such as Alfred Mahan and Brooke Adams understood these requirements;
they argued not only for building a stronger navy to support America's
overseas commercial ambitions, but also for acquiring colonies---or near
colonies---as way stations to China. [The economic depression in the
United States in 1893 intensified these demands for access to the China
market]{.underline}. [The Japanese victory over China in 1895 reinforced
the concern that China might be partitioned among rival imperial powers.
This, it was argued, would be a huge loss for American
interests.]{.underline}106 **[The need of the China market and the fear
that the United States might lose out contributed to the decision to
acquire islands on the way to China.]{.underline}** **[Viewed from this
standpoint, the acquisitions of Hawaii, Wake, Guam, and the Philippines
in the Far East were neither accidental nor a product of a policy of
large imperialism]{.underline}**; **[that is, they were not acquired
because of their own economic worth]{.underline}**. **[They were
acquired in an "eclectic effort to construct a system of coaling, cable,
and naval stations for integrated trade route which could help realize
America's overriding ambition in the Pacific]{.underline}**---**[the
penetration and ultimate domination of the fabled China
market]{.underline}**."107 The Philippines turned out to be America's
most important colonial acquisition after the Spanish-American War. A
country of several thousand islands, the Philippines in 1900 was
inhabited by some eight million people, a population larger than that of
Persia and two-thirds that of Korea at the time. The plan to acquire the
Philippines had begun several months before the start of the war.
Senator Orville Platt (of Platt Amendment fame), suggested to President
McKinley that "Manila had become one of the most important ports of the
Orient and that the importance of that station demanded most careful
attention." Shortly thereafter, the assistant secretary of the Navy,
Theodore Roosevelt, wrote a Navy Department memorandum, which President
McKinley had examined, arguing that in case of a war with Spain, the
Asiatic Squadron "should blockade, and if possible take Manila."108 As
noted, Roosevelt subsequently, in 1897 (well before the war) ensured
that a sympathetic naval officer---Dewey---took command of the Asian
fleet and instructed him that when "needed," he should undertake
"offensive" actions against the Philippines.109 And then, even before
the news of Dewey's rapid victory over Spain in the Manila Bay had
reached Washington, the McKinley Administration had decided to send "an
army of occupation" to the Philippines.110 In light of such historical
evidence it is hard to understand the claims of some contemporary
scholars that the Philippines was "an accidental conquest."111 [While
the premeditated approach to acquire the Philippines was meant to
provide access to the China market, developments within China
intensified the pressures to move in that direction]{.underline}. [After
their military victory over China, the Japanese in the post-1895 period
had started consolidating their gains. This threatened British policy in
China to prop up the Ch'ing monarchs]{.underline}. As discussed in
chapter 2, the British could have been satisfied either by joining the
land grab or creating an open door, enabling all the imperial powers to
compete within China; eventually they settled for protecting their own
share of the China trade. **[Before that, however, Britain invited the
United States, in early 1898, to join in an "open door condominium" to
ensure that China was not partitioned]{.underline}**.112 **[The United
States did not respond, in part because it was preoccupied with the
coming of the Spanish-American War, but also because it had no real
power in the Pacific at that point]{.underline}**. **[To join Britain in
its major policy proposal over the future of China would have made it a
junior partner to that agreement; however, the United States was
increasingly unwilling to accept such a secondary status.]{.underline}**
**[This claim is supported by the fact that, after acquiring the
Philippines, the United States pursued an identical open door policy in
China, but now it was in the lead]{.underline}**. **[What is important
to note is that the growing informal partition of China by Japan,
Britain and others underscored a further need for the United States to
become a Pacific power that, in turn, would be facilitated by the United
States acquiring its own Hong Kong in the Pacific]{.underline}**.

### \-- AT: "China is Imperialist Too!"

#### The idea that China is "just as imperialist or worse" than the US is [wrong]{.underline}, [misunderstands]{.underline} the mechanisms of imperialism, and [should]{.underline} be rejected

Atul **Kohli '20**, is the David K.E. Bruce Professor of International

[China is now an emerging global power with a buoyant
economy]{.underline}. **[How well do China's expansionist tendencies fit
my arguments about the nature of greatpower imperialism? The short
answer is, it's too early to tell]{.underline}**. China's expansionism
has developed only over the past two decades. The trends I have analyzed
in this study unfolded over a much longer time period. **[Nevertheless,
some patterns are already discernable]{.underline}**. [China's economic
expansion overseas reflects its internal economic needs]{.underline}.
This much we should expect based on the British and American
experiences. [China, too, is pursuing its national economic interest
overseas, such as seeking access to raw materials, outlets for capital
surplus, and opportunities to export higher value added
products]{.underline}. **[So far, it has resisted the use of military
power to take economic advantage abroad]{.underline}**. This may well
change in the near future, especially in the countries in China's own
backyard, but so far, the global military presence of the United States
continues to be a major deterrent. This trend has historical parallels
in the nineteenth century, when the United States, wary of British
power, shied away from the use of military force in Latin America,
proclaimed the Monroe Doctrine, and focused instead on economic
expansion. **[In the language of this study, then, China's economic
expansion in the early twenty-first century is exacerbating the economic
dependency of numerous developing countries on the emerging
manufacturing giant, but there is little evidence---at least so
far---that China is building an informal empire]{.underline}**. [China's
economic interactions with the developing world are increasingly a focus
of scholarly inquiries]{.underline}.22 For my purpose, the details can
be set aside. To conclude the book, I draw on this literature only to
comment, very briefly, on the motives, mechanisms, and impact of China's
expansionism. [After four decades of rapid economic growth, China now
produces nearly 25 percent of the world's manufactured output and holds
the world's largest foreign exchange reserves. Moreover, it is committed
to maintaining a high rate of economic growth in the near
future]{.underline}. As with Britain and the United States in the past,
China's commitment to national prosperity has led it to seek markets and
profitable outlets for its financial reserves in other developing
countries. Considering China's rapid economic growth, the trends are
dramatic. On the trade front, for example, rapid economic growth in
manufacturing has led China to ensure a steady supply of raw material
imports. By 2015, China was importing more than half of the world's
total imports of iron ore, aluminum, and soya beans.23 China's exports,
by contrast, are mainly manufactured goods. These trends are especially
notable in China's trade with other developing countries. They are also
reminiscent of colonial and neocolonial patterns of exchange of raw
materials for manufactured goods. China's foreign direct investment in
other developing countries has also grown rapidly. Much of this growth
is spearheaded by Chinese state-owned firms, especially oil and mining
companies searching for natural resources abroad. The driving motive
includes the need to promote "China's national economic development."24
Last, China's giant foreign exchange reserves allow it to lend money to
developing countries, again mainly to promote its own exports. Chinese
sovereign funds and portfolio investments have mostly moved to advanced
economies; however, its bank loans and trade credits to the developing
world are tied to securing market access. The construction of
infrastructure abroad is a focus of Chinese efforts, too, especially via
the creation of such policy banks as the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank and the New Development Bank (better known as the BRICS bank).
China's most recent initiative, One Belt, One Road, is also focused on
loans to promote construction projects in neighboring Asia and Europe.25
In addition to projecting economic power, the hope is, again, to promote
the exports of heavy industries that are likely to be underutilized as
China shifts to a focus on domestic consumption and as domestic
infrastructure needs are saturated. **[Much of Chinese global economic
expansion is steered by the Chinese state. In this important sense, the
driving force behind China's economic expansion is clearly the country's
national economic needs, as interpreted by its state
elite.]{.underline}** Although the state may have competing interests
within (as it surely does), there is no denying that state-owned
entities are dominant in the buying and selling of goods overseas,
managing projects, and in providing loans for specific purposes in the
developing world. [Political and economic motives are thus closely
intertwined in China's overseas expansion.]{.underline} **[The Chinese
pattern of overseas expansion by state-owned firms is in contrast to the
private actors that drove economic expansion in Britain and the United
States]{.underline}**. **[This fact created a problem for interpreting
the overseas actions of the British and American states, because it
gives rise to the question, were forceful interventions moved by the
narrow interests of the economic elite or by some broader understanding
of the national economic interest entertained by the political
elite?]{.underline}** Although historical evidence can be marshaled to
support either proposition, I argue that on balance, one need not treat
these as rival propositions. **[The pursuit of national economic
prosperity by hegemonic powers is the taproot of imperialism. This focus
on national economic prosperity as the driver of overseas economic
expansion then finds strong support in the case of China]{.underline}**.
**[Private firms still play a secondary role in the Chinese
economy]{.underline}**. Much of the expansion by state-owned firms
reflects the Chinese need to support its own economic growth. More
sharply than in the cases of Britain and the United States, the Chinese
case underscores the value of the proposition that the search for
national economic prosperity generates a tendency toward overseas
economic expansion. **[If the motives driving China's overseas economic
expansion are similar to that of Britain and the United States in the
past, the mechanisms are not]{.underline}**. **[China has rarely needed
to use force to access the economies of other developing
countries]{.underline}**. The open world economy created by the United
States has served China's economic interests well. Moreover, the timing
of China's economic expansion has been propitious. [Just as the
Washington Consensus on development was losing steam in the new
millennium, China's rapid economic growth provided seemingly attractive
economic opportunities for the developing world]{.underline}. [Commodity
producers in Africa and Latin America eagerly sought Chinese markets to
boost economic growth at home, and they imported cheap Chinese
manufactured goods]{.underline}. Chinese finance and expertise helped
infrastructure projects in a variety of developing countries, especially
in Africa. **[When Chinese efforts to seek access to commodities have
run into nationalist opposition, bribes, rather than military
interventions, have so far sufficed to nip the resistance in
bud]{.underline}**.26 **[The closest China has come thus far to using
force to seek economic advantage overseas is the acquisition of a port
from an indebted Sri Lanka]{.underline}**.27 Such use of economic
coercion by China to acquire economic assets abroad resembles past
patterns of informal empire analyzed in this study. If China continues
to use economic or military coercion along these lines to seek economic
advantage in, say, other highly indebted countries, such as Pakistan,
then China, too, will join the ranks of modern imperial nations. But
**[until now, China's use of force for profits in the world is a
phenomenon of marginal significance]{.underline}**. (More significant is
China's use of force to seek strategic goals, especially in its own
neighborhood; that, however, is not the focus of the present study.)
**[To the extent that I have emphasized that the use of coercion is
central to any understanding of informal imperialism, China does not fit
the pattern, at least not yet]{.underline}**.

#### China isn't imperialist -- stop it

Minqi **Li '21**, is a professor of economics at the University of Utah,
"China: Imperialism or Semi-Periphery?", Monthly Review, 7/1/21,
https://monthlyreview.org/2021/07/01/china-imperialism-or-semi-periphery/

[Whether China has become an imperialist country is a question of
crucial importance for the global class struggle]{.underline}. I argue
that although China has developed an exploitative relationship with
South Asia, Africa, and other raw material exporters, **[on the whole,
China continues to transfer a greater amount of surplus value to the
core countries in the capitalist world system than it receives from the
periphery]{.underline}**. **[China is thus best described as a
semi-peripheral country in the capitalist world system]{.underline}**.

**[The real question is not whether China has become imperialistic, but
whether China will advance into the core of the capitalist world system
in the foreseeable future]{.underline}**. **[Because of the structural
barriers of the capitalist world system, it is unlikely that China will
become a member of the core]{.underline}**. **[However, if China does
manage to become a core country, the extraction of labor and energy
resources required will impose an unbearable burden on the rest of the
world]{.underline}**. **[It is doubtful that such a development can be
made compatible with either the stability of the existing world system
or the stability of the global ecological system]{.underline}**.

Is China a New Imperialist Country?

As China becomes the world's largest economy (measured by purchasing
power parity) and the largest industrial producer, China's demand for
various energy and raw material commodities has surged. In 2016--17,
China consumed 59 percent of the world total supply of cement, 47
percent of aluminum, 56 percent of nickel, 50 percent of coal, 50
percent of copper, 50 percent of steel, 27 percent of gold, 14 percent
of oil, 31 percent of rice, 47 percent of pork, 23 percent of corn, and
33 percent of cotton.1

[A large portion of China's demand for commodities is supplied by
developing countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. In this
context, Western mainstream media has described China as a new
imperialist country exploiting developing countries]{.underline}. In
June 2013, the New Yorker carried an article criticizing Chinese
capitalists in Zambia for exploiting local copper resources and
violating labor rights.2

In March 2018, the Week published an opinion article arguing that as
China's overseas investment skyrocketed, Africa had become a key
destination of Chinese investment resulting in vicious exploitation of
local resources and ecological disasters. The author further argued
that, because of the authoritarian nature of the Chinese political
system, Chinese imperialism would prove to be considerably worse than
Western imperialism.3

The New York Times asked whether China had become a new colonial power.
The writer indicated that China had used its One Belt, One Road
Initiative to support corrupt dictators, induce recipients of Chinese
investment into debt traps, and promote cultural invasions.4

A Financial Times commentator contended that as China pursued the Belt
and Road Initiative and promoted various economic projects, the
investment logic would inevitably turn some developing countries (such
as Pakistan) into China's client states. China is therefore "at risk
of...embarking on its own colonial adventure."5

One of the recent articles in the National Interest argues that "China
is the imperialist power" in much of Africa today. It contends that what
China wants in Africa is not some form of socialism, but control over
Africa's resources, people, and development potential.6

[For Marxist scholars and political groups, debates on imperialism have
been either directly based on or inspired by V. I. Lenin's concept of
imperialism originally proposed in the early twentieth
century]{.underline}. **[According to Lenin, by the late nineteenth
century, the basic relations of production in the developed capitalist
world had evolved from free competitive capitalism to monopoly
capitalism]{.underline}**. The massive accumulation of capital by
monopoly capitalists in combination with a saturation of domestic
markets led to surplus capital that could only be profitably invested in
colonies and underdeveloped countries by taking advantage of their cheap
land, labor, and raw materials. **[The competition for capital export
destinations in turn led to territorial partitions of the world by the
major imperialist powers]{.underline}**.7

In chapter 7 of Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin
defined the five "basic features" of imperialism:

\(1\) the concentration of production and capital developed to such a
high stage that it created monopolies which play a decisive role in
economic life; (2) the merging of banking capital with industrial
capital, and the creation, on the basis of this "finance capital," of a
financial oligarchy; (3) the export of capital as distinguished from the
export of commodities acquires exceptional importance; (4) the formation
of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the
world among themselves, and (5) the territorial division of the whole
world among the biggest capitalist powers is completed.8

[World political and economic conditions have changed dramatically since
the publication of Lenin's Imperialism. While some of the "basic
features" of imperialism proposed by Lenin remain relevant, the
"territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist
powers" can no longer be understood in its original sense due to the
victory of national liberation movements and decolonization of Asia and
Africa in the mid--twentieth century]{.underline}. Marxist theories of
imperialism (or concepts of imperialism inspired by the Marxist
tradition) that evolved after the mid--twentieth century typically
defined imperialism as a relationship of economic exploitation leading
to unequal distribution of wealth and power on a global scale.9

**[In the contemporary debate on "Chinese imperialism," Marxist
theorists who contend that China has become a "capitalist imperialist
country" usually argue that China has become imperialist in the Leninist
sense]{.underline}**---**[that is, internally, China has become a
monopoly capitalist country; externally, the monopoly Chinese capital
has manifested itself through massive exports of capital]{.underline}**.
For example, N. B. Turner has argued that both state and private
monopoly capital had been established in China and the four largest
state-owned banks controlled the "commanding heights" of the Chinese
economy, demonstrating the dominance of finance capital. Turner further
noted that China had accumulated enormous overseas assets and become one
of the largest capital exporters in the world, exploiting workers and
raiding resources in various parts of the world.10

David Harvey, one of the world's best-known Marxist intellectuals, has
recently contended that China's holding of large chunks of U.S.
government debt and the Chinese capitalist land grabs in Africa and
Latin America have made the issue of whether "China is the new
imperialist power" worthy of serious consideration.11

There have also been lively debates on whether China has become
imperialist among Chinese leftist activists within China. Interestingly,
a leading advocate of the proposition that China has become imperialist
is Fred Engst (Yang Heping), the son of Erwin Engst and Joan Hinton, two
U.S. revolutionaries who participated in China's Maoist socialist
revolution. In "Imperialism, Ultra-Imperialism, and the Rise of China,"
Yang Heping (using the pen name Hua Shi) argued that the Chinese
state-owned capital group had become the world's single largest
combination of industrial and financial capital and the world's most
powerful monopoly capitalist group. According to Yang, China's demand
for resources has already led to intensified imperial rivalry with the
United States in Africa and Southeast Asia.12

Imperialism and Superprofits

[Lenin considered imperialism to be a stage of capitalist development
based on monopoly capital.]{.underline} **[For Lenin, monopoly capital
did not simply mean the formation of large capitalist groups but large
capitalist enterprises that had sufficient monopoly power to make
superprofits]{.underline}**---**[profits far above the "normal" rates of
return under free competitive conditions]{.underline}**.

Using available business information at the time, Lenin cited several
examples of superprofits of monopolist capitalist businesses. The
Standard Oil Company paid dividends between 36 and 48 percent on its
capital between 1900 and 1907. The American Sugar Trust paid a 70
percent dividend on its original investment. French banks were able to
sell bonds at 150 percent of their face value. The average annual
profits on German industrial stocks were between 36 to 68 percent
between 1895 and 1900.13

After elaborating the five basic features of imperialism, Lenin
immediately said that "we shall see later that imperialism can and must
be defined differently if consideration is to be given, not only to the
basic, purely economic concepts...but also the historical phase of this
stage of capitalism in relation to capitalism in general." In chapter 8
of Imperialism, Lenin further argued that export of capital was "one of
the most essential bases of imperialism" because it allowed the
imperialist countries to "live by exploiting the labour of several
overseas countries and colonies." The superprofits exploited from the
colonies in turn could be used to buy off the "upper stratum" of the
working class who would become the social base of opportunism in the
working-class movement: "Imperialism means the partition of the world,
and the exploitation of other countries besides China, which means high
monopoly profits for a handful of very rich countries, creating the
economic possibility of corrupting the upper strata of the
proletariat."14

In the preface to the French and German editions, Lenin further
elaborated:

\[It\] is precisely the parasitism and decay of capitalism, which are
the characteristic features of its highest historical stage of
development, i.e., imperialism.... Capitalism has now singled out a
handful (less than one-tenth of the inhabitants of the globe; less than
one-fifth at a most "generous" and liberal calculation) of exceptionally
rich and powerful states which plunder the whole world simply by
"clipping coupons."... Obviously, out of such superprofits (since they
are obtained over and above the profits which capitalists squeeze out of
the workers of their "own" country) it is possible to bribe the labour
leaders and the upper stratum of the labour aristocracy.15

Lenin considered this to be a "world-historical phenomenon."

Thus, for Lenin, capitalist imperialism is not simply associated with
the formation of large capitals and export of capital. It inevitably
leads to and has to be characterized by "high monopoly profits" or
"superprofits" through the plunder of the whole world. It is also
interesting to note that, for Lenin, imperialism as a "world-historical
phenomenon" has to be based on the exploitation of the great majority of
the world population by a "handful of exceptionally rich and powerful
states," which Lenin estimated to include a population between one-tenth
and one-fifth of the world total. Thus, imperialism must be a system
where a small minority of the world population exploits the great
majority. It cannot possibly be a system in which the majority exploits
the minority.

**[If we apply Lenin's concept of imperialist superprofits to the
Chinese context, what do we find? Has China already become an
imperialist country that is plundering the whole world simply by
"clipping coupons"?]{.underline}**

[Using conventional international balance of payment accounting, China
has indeed become a large capital exporter and accumulated enormous
overseas assets. But these "assets" need to be analyzed]{.underline}.

From 2004 to 2018, China's total foreign assets increased from \$929
billion to \$7.32 trillion. During the same period, China's total
foreign liabilities (that is, total foreign investment in China)
increased from \$693 billion to \$5.19 trillion.16 This means China had
a net investment position of \$2.13 trillion at the end of 2018. That
is, China has not only accumulated trillions of dollars of overseas
assets but also become a large net creditor in the global capital
market. This seems to support the argument that China is now exporting
massive amounts of capital and therefore qualifies as an imperialist
country.

However, **[the structure of China's overseas assets is very different
from the structure of foreign assets in China]{.underline}**. [Out of
China's total overseas assets in 2018, 43 percent consists of reserve
assets, 26 percent is direct investment abroad, 7 percent is portfolio
investment abroad, and 24 percent is other investment]{.underline}
(currency and deposits, loans, trade credits, and so on[). By
comparison, out of total foreign investment in China in 2018, 53 percent
is foreign direct investment, 21 percent is foreign portfolio
investment, and 26 percent is other investment]{.underline}.

**[Thus, while foreign investment in China is dominated by direct
investment, an investment form consistent with the foreign capitalist
attempt to exploit China's cheap labor and natural resources, reserve
assets account for the largest component of China's overseas
assets]{.underline}**.

**[China's reserve assets reflect largely the accumulation of China's
historical trade surpluses and are mostly invested on low-return but
"liquid" instruments such as U.S. government bonds. These assets
theoretically represent China's claims on future supplies of goods and
services from the United States and other developed capitalist
countries]{.underline}**. **[But these claims may never be realized
because the United States and other developed capitalist countries
simply do not have the production capacity to produce within a
reasonable period of time the extra goods and services that may
correspond to the more than three trillion dollars of foreign exchange
reserves held by China]{.underline}**. If China uses a large portion of
its reserves to buy raw material commodities or exchange the reserves
into other assets, it would dramatically drive up the prices of these
commodities or other assets and China would suffer a massive capital
loss (a large reduction of the purchasing power of China's reserves). In
addition, China needs to hold several trillion dollars as reserves to
insure against possible capital flight or financial crisis.

From the U.S. point of view, China's accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves (mostly in dollar-denominated assets) has essentially allowed
it to "purchase" trillions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods largely by
printing money without providing any material goods in return.
**[China's reserve assets, rather than being a part of China's
imperialist wealth, essentially constitute China's informal tribute to
U.S. imperialism by paying for the latter's "seigniorage
privilege."]{.underline}**

While China's total overseas assets are greater than its liabilities by
\$2.13 trillion, China's investment income received in 2018 was actually
smaller than the investment income paid by \$61 billion.17 Chart 1
compares the rates of return on China's total investment overseas with
those on foreign investment in China from 2010 to 2018.

Sources: Rates of return are calculated as ratios of investment income
to the stock of total investment. China's overseas investment, foreign
investment in China, investment income received and paid are from "The
Time-Series Data of International Investment Position of China," State
Administration of Foreign Exchange, People's Republic of China, March
26, 2021; "The Time-Series Data of Balance of Payments of China," State
Administration of Foreign Exchange, People's Republic of China, March
26, 2021.

[From 2010 to 2018, the rates of return on China's overseas assets
averaged about 3 percent and the rates of return on total foreign
investment in China varied mostly in the range of 5 to 6
percent]{.underline}. **[An average rate of return of about 3 percent on
China's overseas investment obviously does not constitute
"superprofits."]{.underline}** Moreover, **[foreign capitalists in China
are able to make about twice as much profit as Chinese capital can make
in the rest of the world on a given amount of investment]{.underline}**.

On the eve of the First World War, net property income from abroad
accounted for 8.6 percent of the British gross national product and
total property income accounted for 9.6 percent. It was by observing
such massive superprofits that Lenin considered exports of capital to be
of "exceptional importance" in the era of imperialism. By comparison,
China's total investment income received in 2018 was \$215 billion or
1.6 percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP) and China's net
investment income from abroad is negative.18

[The general pattern of China's investment abroad can be further
revealed by examining where the Chinese investment takes place. China's
total stock of direct investment abroad in 2017 was \$1.81 trillion,
including \$1.14 trillion invested in Asia]{.underline} (**[63
percent]{.underline}**), [\$43 billion invested in Africa]{.underline}
(**[2.4 percent]{.underline}**), [\$111 billion invested in
Europe]{.underline} (**[6.1 percent]{.underline}**), [\$387 billion
invested in Latin America and the Caribbean]{.underline} (**[21
percent]{.underline}**), \$87 billion invested in North America (4.8
percent), and \$42 billion invested in Australia and New Zealand (2.3
percent).

Within Asia, about \$1.04 trillion was invested in Hong Kong, Macao, and
Singapore. Hong Kong and Macao are China's special administrative
regions and Singapore is an ethnic-Chinese city-state. About \$9 billion
was invested in Japan and South Korea. Within Latin America and the
Caribbean, \$372 billion was invested in the Cayman Islands and British
Virgin Islands.19

**[China's massive investments in Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, Cayman
Islands, and British Virgin Islands]{.underline}** (altogether \$1.41
trillion **[or 78 percent of China's direct investment
abroad]{.underline}**) **[are obviously not intended to exploit abundant
natural resources or labor in these cities or islands]{.underline}**.
Some of China's investment in Hong Kong is the so-called "round trip
investment" to be recycled back to China in order to be registered as
"foreign investment" and receive preferential treatments.20 Much of the
Chinese investment in these places may simply have to do with money
laundering and capital flight. In 2012, Bloomberg reported that Xi
Jinping's family had several real estate properties in Hong Kong with a
combined value of £35 million. In 2014, a report by the International
Consortium of Investigative Journalists further revealed that Xi's
brother-in-law once owned two shell companies based in the British
Virgin Islands. China's investment in these tax havens has more
similarities with wealth transfers by corrupt governments in the third
world than projects of imperialist plunder. **[Much of China's
investment in Europe, North America, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and
New Zealand is likely to be of a similar character. Rather than
"exploiting" the developed capitalist countries, such capital flight in
fact transfers resources from China to the core of the capitalist world
system]{.underline}**.21

**[This leaves about]{.underline}** \$158 billion (**[8.7 percent of
China's total stock of direct investment abroad or 2.2 percent of
China's total overseas assets]{.underline}**) **[invested in Africa,
Latin America, and the rest of Asia. This part of Chinese investment no
doubt exploits the peoples in Asia, Africa, and Latin America of their
labor and natural resources. But it is a small fraction of China's total
overseas investment and an almost negligible part of the enormous total
wealth that Chinese capitalists have accumulated]{.underline}** (China's
domestic capital stock is about five times as large as China's overseas
assets). **[Some Chinese capitalists may be blamed for their
imperialist-like behaviors in developing countries, but, on the whole,
Chinese capitalism remains nonimperialist]{.underline}**.

#### Don't buy their calls about how COVID proves how vulnerable we are to disease -- it's the same propaganda the DOD uses to justify [mass militarization]{.underline} of the entire health system

The backstory of the NSVP's formation reveals a history of tension over
smallpox since the end of the Cold War. [Public health typically
prioritizes the management of existing disease, and therefore the field
viewed smallpox as a lesser priority once it was
eradicated]{.underline}. [The national security field, on the other
hand, viewed smallpox as a military threat whose successful eradication
only increased the vulnerability of the national
population]{.underline}---[lack of exposure to smallpox meant that the
nation's immunity to the disease had declined]{.underline} (although the
degree of loss was unclear, [since the data on smallpox was outdated and
biomedical circles could not reach consensus on the length of immunity
the vaccine conferred]{.underline}). [Concerns about susceptibility to
smallpox had escalated under Clintonera civilian biodefense, culminating
in the highly influential Dark Winter exercise in the summer of
2001,]{.underline} which comprised one of several mock terrorist
scenarios policy makers conducted at the turn of the twenty-first
century. 5 [Dark Winter simulated a smallpox attack, based on relatively
high transmission rates and susceptibility of the population to
smallpox]{.underline}---the scenario used an immunity value of no more
than five years, at which point immunity waned significantly. 6 [The
scenario presented a stark picture of devastation: within ten weeks of
exposure to smallpox, three million would be infected and about one
million dead]{.underline} (O'Toole, Michael, and Inglesby 2002).7 [Many
health researchers contested this "worst-case scenario" and discouraged
basing policy on these numbers]{.underline}.8 [Nevertheless, it greatly
influenced ideas of smallpox preparedness, particularly in national
security circles, and created momentum for vaccine production and
vaccination in anticipation of an outbreak]{.underline}. [The post-9 /
11 push for precautionary smallpox vaccination]{.underline}---embodied
by the NSVP---[was the culmination of this militarized approach to
smallpox]{.underline}. [The NSVP's target vaccination numbers reflected
the influence of the alarmist worst-case scenarios pushed by defense
pundits]{.underline} (namely, Vice President Dick Cheney and several
Department of Defense officials); [these numbers were much higher than
those proposed by the]{.underline} Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention ([CDC]{.underline}), despite the fact that the latter was in
charge of carrying out the actual vaccinations (CDC 2002; Cohen and
Enserink 2002). T**[he military had not only triumphed over the smallpox
agenda but enlisted public health to implement its
vision.]{.underline}** [When Bush announced the program]{.underline} on
December 13, 2002, [he emphasized its health dimension as much as its
security one: "We will continue taking every essential step to guard
against the threats to our nation and I deeply appreciate the good
efforts of state and local health officials who are facing difficult
challenges with great skill. The actions we are taking together will
help safeguard the health of our people in a measured and responsible
way"]{.underline} (Bush 2002b; emphasis added). [In articulating this
effort as having a positive outcome for the health
field]{.underline}---that is, the promotion of the "health of our
people," [Bush turned the national security apparatus's mobilization of
the health field into a dual benefit]{.underline}---for [the nation's
health as well as security]{.underline}. Legal scholars David P. Fidler
and Lawrence O. Gostin (2007) call **[this placement of disease
alongside national security]{.underline}** the "synergy thesis";9 it
**[yielded new surveillance initiatives oriented toward improving early
detection of both bioterrorist attacks and infectious disease
outbreaks]{.underline}** (for example, the National Biosurveillance
Initiative of 2004). [This synergy orientation would eventually
integrate health and security among a variety of diverse
hazards]{.underline} ---[an "all-hazards" approach]{.underline}. The
Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 exemplified this
dramatic convergence of domains. Its stated purpose was "to improve the
Nation's public health and medical preparedness and response
capabilities for emergencies, whether deliberate, accidental, or
natural"---with "deliberate" signifying bioterrorism, "accidental"
referring to lab mistakes, and "natural" meaning naturally arising
outbreaks. The NSVP represented an important early site where the Bush
administration attempted to merge these disparate domains.10 A week into
the NSVP's start date, [Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, articulated the thesis
that public health and biodefense could join forces in his 2003
testimony]{.underline} during the Smallpox Vaccination Plan: Challenges
and Next Steps hearing: "At the end of the day we believe this
\[research on biological agents such as smallpox to produce vaccines and
other countermeasures\] will have two major accomplishments. One will be
that it would effectively defend us against the microbes of bioterror.
But also, since bioterror agents are really emerging and reemerging
diseases that resemble very much the naturally occurring diseases, so
that what we learn for biodefense will have important implications for
decades and decades to come in our approach toward emerging and
reemerging diseases." [Fauci's statement, echoing the Bush
administration's rhetoric of converging biodefense and disease
management interests, belied the reality]{.underline} ---[the de facto
subsumption of public health by the national security
apparatus]{.underline}.

More than Britain in the nineteenth century, [the United States in the
midtwentieth century conceived of its global interests as deeply
interconnected.]{.underline} As I analyze American interventions in the
developing world, it is important to keep in mind this interconnected
nature of America's understanding of its own interests. **[With global
ambitions, American leaders believed that challenges to its domination
over any one part of the world could be contagious, leading to losses
elsewhere; credibility was the currency with which the United States
hoped to maintain its informal empire]{.underline}**. **[Although the
American approach to establishing influence was more coercive in some
parts of the world than in others, what also connected these efforts was
the belief that the hegemonic project was indivisible]{.underline}**. In
the early postwar years, America's top priorities were mainly in Europe.
The economic recovery of declining powers like Britain and France was
not only deemed to be central for continuing American prosperity, but
also necessary to forestall the emergence of nationalist and
redistributive politics in Western Europe; latter trends were deemed to
favor the Soviet Union. To help avoid the mistakes made at Versailles,
Americans also decided to reindustrialize West Germany and Japan while
ensuring that they will never again pose a military threat. [Americans
then used a proverbial stick and carrot]{.underline}---[anything from
the well-known Marshall Plan to lesser-known efforts to help these
declining European powers maintain their colonial economic
links]{.underline}---[to incorporate Western Europe (and Japan) within
the American orbit]{.underline}.2 **[When Stalin refused to accept a
subordinate position in the American-led order, the Cold War
erupted]{.underline}**.3 A brutal dictator in a war-devastated country,
Stalin had a very Russian understanding of what was good for the
motherland: control over neighboring territories so to avoid future
wars. **[When Western powers refused to let Stalin have regional
influence, Stalin imposed harsh control over Eastern Europe, lowering
what Winston Churchill famously described as the Iron
Curtain]{.underline}**. **[These closed economies of Europe posed a
serious challenge to the American postwar hopes for an open global
economy]{.underline}**. **[From then on the United States fought the
Cold War from a position of considerable strength, aiming first to
contain communism and then to roll it back]{.underline}**. **[Because
communism offered an alternative to capitalism, the Cold War also went
well beyond a classic realpolitik struggle; it became a struggle over
how best to organize national states and markets]{.underline}**, on the
one hand, **[and]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[it took on the
proportion of a crusade in which might was needed to protect what was
right]{.underline}**. **[Mao Zedong's victory in China, war in Korea,
and growing nationalist demands in European colonies quickly exacerbated
American anxieties, giving the struggle against communism a global
dimension]{.underline}**. **[Communism then had to be fought everywhere,
because it threatened what Americans perceived as their core interests
and values]{.underline}**. During the Cold War era, [the United States
intervened in numerous developing countries, especially ones in East
Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America]{.underline}.4 [American
efforts to revive war-devastated capitalist powers and to confront
communist ones provided the context for these developing-country
interventions]{.underline}. An **[incomplete list of major American
interventions]{.underline}**---either to support or to oppose emerging
political trends---**[might include the following: China, Philippines,
Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia in East Asia;
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Egypt in the Middle East; Congo in
Africa; Guatemala, Cuba, Nicaragua and other small countries in Central
America; and Brazil and Chile in Latin America]{.underline}**. The
United States sought indirect influence over yet other developing
countries via regional treaties or through such grand schemes as the
Alliance for Progress. I have chosen three cases of direct American
interventions in the developing world for detailed analysis: Iran,
Vietnam, and Chile. These three cases capture a range of America's
regional and global interests and the covert and overt methods that
American leaders used to achieve their goals. American efforts were also
more or less successful across these cases. Although the discussion that
follows is surely less than comprehensive, it does shed light on the
issue at hand, namely, America's efforts to build an informal empire in
the developing world.5 In Iran, Americans helped Britain to covertly
overthrow the elected Iranian nationalist leader, Muhammad Mossadegh, in
1953.6 Mossadegh had earlier nationalized the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company.
When the negotiations over the compensation for nationalization bogged
down, the CIA helped to orchestrate a coup that led to Mossadegh's
overthrow. In the aftermath, the power of a proWestern and pliable Shah
was restored and the rights to Iranian oil came to be shared equally
between British and American corporations. [Beyond the historical
details]{.underline} (some well-known, others less so), [the discussion
of the Iranian case will help highlight several relevant themes: the
importance of oil]{.underline} (and thus, of the Middle East in the
American postwar global calculations); **[the growing significance of
multinational corporations in global affairs]{.underline}**; the
[willingness of the United States to support declining colonial
powers]{.underline} (but at a price); [how a shortterm American victory
turned pyrrhic over a longer time frame; and, of course, America's early
inclination to thwart developing-country nationalists who sought to use
state power to benefit their own country]{.underline}. A similar but
much more violent and prolonged confrontation between imperial ambitions
and nationalism unfolded in Vietnam, the second case I discuss. The
details of the American War in Vietnam---what the Vietnamese call the
Vietnam War---are relatively well known, although new research keeps
deepening our understanding of the conflict. When the Vietnamese sought
to get rid of the French, in the early postwar period the United States
helped France to restore colonial rule. Following the French military
defeat in 1954, the United States took on the imperial mantle to limit
the gains of revolutionary nationalists like Ho Chi Minh, both because
of America's global campaign to contain communism but also because open
economic access to Southeast Asia---a central part of the old
co-prosperity sphere---was deemed important for Japanese economic
recovery. Over time, the reasons for the United States to be in Vietnam
became more and more muddled; even American leaders admitted that they
could not win the war, but that they also could not withdraw.
**[Maintaining American credibility became a reason to stay in the war
because credibility was deemed to be central to the exercise of
influence elsewhere in the world. In the name of credibility, the United
States dropped more bombs on a sliver of a country than were dropped
during all of World War II]{.underline}**. [To resist, hardline
communists in Vietnam won out; they were willing to make enormous
sacrifices of their own people in the name of the nation]{.underline},
such as during the Tet Offensive in 1968. [The United States eventually
lost the battle of wills]{.underline}. Some three million Vietnamese
died during the conflict, that is, half the number of Jews killed during
the Holocaust. Nearly 58,000 Americans also died. **[The tragic costs of
American imperial ambitions in Vietnam were enormous]{.underline}**.
While the United States was losing the war in Vietnam, it also, in 1973,
undertook a much more successful intervention in Chile to overthrow a
democratically elected president; it was as if a victory was needed in
the backyard to compensate for the defeat in distant jungles. The
overthrow and murder of Salvador Allende is the third case of US
intervention I discuss here. Allende was a leader of the left who sought
wealth redistribution and the nationalization of the American
corporations that dominated Chile's commodity-dependent economy.
American antipathy to nationalist and socialist leaders south of the
border was hardly new; Jacobo Arbenz, Fidel Castro, and others had
already experienced American wrath. American intervention in Chile fits
the recurring pattern of American efforts to undermine nationalists and
socialists who seek to limit external dependency. But the Chilean case
is also distinctive because it is in a region that has long been
dominated by the United States. Compared to the other cases discussed
here, US economic influence in Chile was more significant, as were
American contacts with Chilean military leaders. Richard Nixon and Henry
Kissinger could realistically ask the CIA to make the "Chilean economy
scream" and undercover operatives to encourage Chilean military leaders
to depose a democratically elected president. The results included
prolonged repressive and authoritarian rule, on the one hand, and a
failure to diversify a commodity-dependent economy, on the other hand.
Here, as in the other chapters of the volume, **[historical materials
help to build an analytical argument about the motives, mechanisms, and
consequences of imperialism]{.underline}**. A brief preview of these
themes at the outset may be helpful to the reader. [It would be easy to
conclude from these three cases that US interventions were aimed mainly
at fighting communism; after all, this was the era of the Cold
War]{.underline}. **[While not wrong, such a conclusion would be both
superficial, and ultimately, misleading]{.underline}**. The **[evidence
below will make clear that fighting communism was but an excuse for
American interventions in Iran and Chile]{.underline}**. **[By contrast,
the United States indeed confronted a revolutionary communist force in
Vietnam but what the United States was fighting was national, and not
global, communism]{.underline}**. More important, as we notice in
chapter 4, US interventions in the developing world began well before
the emergence of the Cold War and as will become clear in the next
chapter, have continued well after the end of the Cold War. Clearly, a
fight against communism cannot be held as the main factor that drove
interventions during the Cold War era. In such cases as the US
involvement in the Korean War and then in South Korea, as well as in
protecting Taiwan, Cold War politics was clearly of primary
significance. In most other cases of US intervention during this period,
however, a fight against communism was one factor, but not the dominant
consideration. So, either we believe that American interventions in
different eras (or places) had different motives---an epistemological
position I do not share---or we search for deeper patterns that help
make sense of a variety of American interventions in poor countries of
the world. **[One such deeper pattern is revealed if we focus on the
American effort to establish a global hegemony]{.underline}**---**[more
accurately, an informal empire]{.underline}**---**[during this period,
with an open global economy as a centerpiece]{.underline}**. **[This
urge to open the economies of other nations, by force if necessary, runs
through the long American twentieth century]{.underline}**. Of course,
American economic needs evolved over this time. [While early efforts
were aimed at free trade, as the century wore on, securing overseas
corporate investments and ensuring that foreign debt was paid back also
became important]{.underline}. **[America's century-long efforts are
thus bookended by demanding an open door in turn-of-the-century China
and by implementing the Washington Consensus on development toward the
end of the centur]{.underline}**y. This is not to deny that some
American interventions did not fit this pattern. Since history is seldom
neat, the evidence reveals that ideology and security concerns
complicated the pursuit of national economic interests overseas; the
case of Vietnam is especially salient from this standpoint.
**[Nevertheless, seeking open doors was a central motive in many of the
more important cases of US interventions in the developing
world]{.underline}**. **[During the Cold War period, then, American
efforts to establish a global hegemony led it to confront communists and
nationalists alike, because both sought to create closed or semiclosed
economies.]{.underline}** What we notice in all three cases is a pattern
of confrontation between the imperial ambitions of the United States, on
the one hand, and, on the other hand, Third World nationalists, who
sought to chart independent paths for their respective countries. It is
not the case that American leaders were not sympathetic to nationalism
in the developing world. Over and over again, the historical record
reveals that policymakers in the Truman and Eisenhower administrations
noticed the emerging trends and sought to accommodate them. **[American
leaders thus rightly concluded that the era of colonialism was over;
they also did not shy away from conveying this message to their British
and French counterparts]{.underline}**. **[However, American leaders
also wanted to limit the autonomy of the emerging developing countries,
especially if their leaders were perceived to be opposed to American
designs]{.underline}**. **[Such limits were essential if the United
States hoped to establish a global order in its own
image.]{.underline}** The puzzle for American foreign policymakers was
how to do this without asserting formal control over the emerging
sovereign countries. **[The Americans believed that they were perfecting
a model of informal control in the Philippines, Cuba and elsewhere, that
combined nominal independence and substantial control over key
policies]{.underline}**. **[The hope was that this model of informal
empire would enable American leaders to incorporate other developing
countries within the orbit of the free world]{.underline}**. **[The key
mechanism of extending American influence was thus to encourage and
support pro-American governments within the developing world. Covert or
overt interventions were often aimed at putting friendly regimes in
power]{.underline}**. **[A variety of carrots]{.underline}**, for
example, **[foreign aid, and sticks]{.underline}**, for example,
**[military bases, were then used to keep these regimes
pliable]{.underline}**. Since the overt use of force to bend the will of
nationalist rulers was both costly and too Old World for the new era, it
was also important that the American word---of support or threat---was
taken seriously. **[That is why credibility of American commitments took
on such enormous significance within the scope of the American
order]{.underline}**. In [the best of worlds, America's informal empire
was to operate via friendly regimes that complied with American desires
because they took American wishes seriously, backed as they were by
enormous economic and military resources]{.underline}.

After World War II, the United States emerged as the world's most
powerful state. **[The United States then used its power superiority to
mold a world order that fit its values and interests]{.underline}**.
**[The centerpiece of this world order was to be an open global
economy]{.underline}**. **[While capitalist Europe and Japan joined this
global order, many others did not. In addition to the Soviet Union and
the states within its land empire, a variety of communist and
nationalist regimes in the poor countries]{.underline}**---in the
so-called Third World---**[also sought to pursue state-led development,
with closed or semiclosed economies]{.underline}**. The United States
tolerated some of these, either because they did not challenge
significant American interests (e.g., some postcolonial countries in
Africa) or because, as, for example, in the case of India---the costs of
imposing a Pax Americana on them would have been very high, especially
in relation to the perceived potential gains. **[In much of the
developing world, however, the United States did confront communists and
nationalists who stood in the way of America's desire to establish an
open global economic order]{.underline}**. [To repeat, a list of clear
US interventions in the developing world during the Cold War era, in
support or in opposition to emerging trends, might include China,
Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia in
East Asia; Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Egypt in the Middle East;
Congo in Africa; Guatemala, Cuba, Nicaragua and other small countries in
Central America; and Brazil and Chile in Latin America]{.underline}. Of
these, I have in this chapter analyzed three specific
interventions---Iran, Vietnam, and Chile---with the aim of understanding
the causes and consequences of America's imperial actions. The motives
behind, mechanisms, and impact of American interventions during the Cold
War have been traced throughout this chapter via historical materials.
My understanding of these key themes was also summarized above in the
introduction to this chapter. Only a brief restatement is thus necessary
at this point. **[What really moved the Americans to intervene in the
developing world was not so much the threat of communism but the danger
assertive nationalists posed to America's hegemonic
ambitions]{.underline}**: [Iran's Mossadegh not only threatened key
economic interests of an already weakened ally, Britain, but also posed
a broader danger of creating an unacceptable norm for who controls the
production, supply, and profits of an important commodity, oil; the
revolutionary nationalism of Ho Chi Minh similarly threatened important
interests of another weakened ally, France, but then the more the United
States got involved, the more America's global credibility became an
issue, prolonging a costly and tragic war; and Chile's Allende posed a
direct threat to American corporations, as well as the broader danger of
encouraging a nationalist and a democratic socialist pathway to
development in America's backyard]{.underline}. **[Since overt
colonialism was not on the United States' Cold War agenda, the main
mechanism of control was the creation of stable but subservient
governments in power]{.underline}**. **[The covert support for coups
against Mossadegh and Allende had led to the installation of the Shah
and Pinochet, respectively, who both did America's
bidding]{.underline}**. [Similar cases that are not discussed in this
chapter might include the US-supported overthrow of Arbenz in Guatemala
and the assassination of Patrice Lumumba in the Congo]{.underline}.
**[The case of Vietnam was more overt but the American hope there, too,
was to create a stable-but-subservient regime in South Vietnam; the
covert overthrow and death of Diem also followed a pattern similar to
those in Iran and Chile]{.underline}**. **[Once client regimes were
installed, the United States sought to maintain them using a variety of
carrots and sticks]{.underline}**. The most common tools were foreign
aid (especially military aid) but also establishing American military
bases, which limited national autonomy. **[The hope was that given
America's enormous power and economic resources, most client states
would simply take America's preferences seriously; after all, it is an
old axiom of politics that the truly powerful need not use their power
to secure preferred outcomes]{.underline}**. **[That is why maintaining
credibility became so important for the United States]{.underline}**.
The failure in Vietnam was thus a turning point in American efforts to
create and sustain an informal empire.

### Demilitarization Link

#### The aff's stance is a [recovering]{.underline} of imperial power that ignores "withdrawal of pre-emption" only smooths the relations between imperial nations while leaving decolonized nations at the risk of violence -- zero chance of a link turn

So [we see that, when implementing the same independent,
internationalist working class line, in different situations one will
reach very different conclusions due to objective factors and class
interests]{.underline}. Or in other words, **[the same, consistent
strategy of permanent revolution leads, for different types of wars, to
different tactics]{.underline}**. **[Only a mechanistic bonehead should
be surprised by this]{.underline}**. **[Where the working class and the
oppressed are not engaged in a direct struggle for power, i.e., outside
of a revolutionary situation, the task of overthrowing a given regime is
subordinate to the task of the defending a semi-colonial
country]{.underline}** (or a degenerated workers state) **[against an
imperialist attack]{.underline}**. **[On the other hand, when we have
the mobilization of the working class and the oppressed in a direct
struggle for power, as is the case in a revolutionary situation, a civil
war, etc., Bolshevik-Communists fight for the victorious outcome of this
class struggle]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[we combine this
support with uncompromising opposition to any imperialist attacks
against the regime to be toppled]{.underline}**. [The Second World War
is a model for such a contradictory situation which illustrates well the
application of a combined, dialectical approach to military tactics.
During this war, the revolutionary Marxists of the Fourth International
defended the Soviet Union against German imperialism]{.underline} --
[despite the former's alliance with Western imperialism]{.underline}. At
the same time, they sided with the colonial peoples against their
imperialist occupiers -- despite the Stalinists' support for the British
and French occupiers, and despite the Allied imperialists' support for
the Chinese resistance against Japanese imperialism. The Fourth
International also sided with the national liberations partisan armies
against German imperialism in Europe and took a defeatist position
against both imperialist camps in their conflict with each other. So we
see that, **[in such contradictory situations, in which several wars are
actually taking place in the context of supposedly single war, it would
be both wrong and disastrous to pursue the same tactic for all the
various wars or "sub-wars."]{.underline}** Quite the contrary -- in such
cases, **[Marxists must call for diverse military
tactics]{.underline}**. **[Only when imperialist forces threaten to
conquer a given semi-colonial country]{.underline}** (or a degenerated
workers state) **[and when, at the same time, the working class is not
strong enough to take power, only then does it becomes necessary to
subordinate the struggle against the regime in defense of the
semi-colonial country]{.underline}** (or a degenerated workers state)
**[in question]{.underline}**. [This is why we supported the national
liberation struggle of the Bosnian people against the Serbian
restorationist bureaucracy in 1992-95 while opposing any NATO
attacks]{.underline}. This is why we supported the uprising of the
Kosova-Albanians in 1997-99 while at the same time opposing NATO's war
against Serbia. **[This is why during the Gulf wars of both in 1991 and
2003 we said "Defend Iraq! Defeat Imperialism!"]{.underline}** When the
imperialist assault against Afghanistan started on 7th of October 2001
we called for the military victory of the Afghan resistance despite the
Taliban leadership. And we called for the Hezbollah-led resistance in
Lebanon 2006 and the Hamas-led resistance in Gaza 2008/09, both against
the Israeli Apartheid state. **[Such complications, amalgamations of
different and contradictory interests in a given military conflict are
likely to increase in the future]{.underline}**. Why? **[Because of the
increasing rivalry between imperialist powers]{.underline}**. Due to
this rivalry, **[all imperialist powers are more and more motivated to
interfere in local conflicts and civil wars and to exploit them so as to
advance their influence and increase their profits]{.underline}**.
Unfortunately, **[this trend is completely ignored by many sectarians
who fail to recognize that in addition to the old imperialist
powers]{.underline}** -- **[in North America, Western Europe, and
Japan]{.underline}** -- **[there are also new, emerging imperialist
powers, in particular Russia and China]{.underline}**. \[6\] In our
study of Chinese imperialism, we explained various possible consequences
of this increasing rivalry between imperialist powers like the US and
China using the example of possible future wars in the South China (or
East) Sea region. "**[Which position should the working class take in a
military conflict between China (or the USA) with one of the smaller
East Asian countries?]{.underline}** **[Here we have to take into
account the fact that countries like Vietnam, the Philippines, and
Taiwan etc. are not imperialist powers]{.underline}**. **[They are
rather semi-colonial capitalist countries]{.underline}**. (...) As we
said in our program it is the Marxist principle to defend such
semi-colonial countries against imperialist powers. **[However it is not
sufficient to state the Marxist principles on wars]{.underline}**. **[In
real life all forms of combinations, alliances, amalgamations of
different interests etc. are possible and indeed are an important aspect
of the class struggle]{.underline}**. In formulating the correct
revolutionary tactic Marxists have to combine the application of the
Marxist principles of the class approach to wars with a concrete
analysis of every war in its peculiarity and totality. **[Concerning the
South China (or East) Sea this means the following: Countries like the
Philippines or Taiwan have had close alliances with US imperialism for
many decades]{.underline}** -- or more concretely they are semi-colonies
of the USA. Given these facts it is quite possible that there can be a
war for example between the Philippines and China as it nearly happened
in the summer of 2012. [Concretely in this case the Philippine military
forces acted in closest accordance with the US armed
forces]{.underline}. **[In such a war we would have formally an
imperialist power (China) on one side and a semi-colonial country
(Philippine) on the other side]{.underline}**. **[However in fact it
would be a proxy war in the case of the Philippines, i.e. they would act
as an extension of US imperialism]{.underline}**. **[Thus the working
class should not rally to defend the Philippines but should take a
position of revolutionary defeatism as they would do in an
inner-imperialist war]{.underline}**. **[However not all wars in the
region are necessarily proxy-war]{.underline}**. **[Vietnam for
example]{.underline}** -- **[whose people heroically defeated first
Japanese, then French and finally US imperialism]{.underline}** in its
liberation wars in the 20th century -- **[has a history of being bullied
by China]{.underline}**. One just needs to remember the reactionary
assault of the Chinese Stalinist bureaucracy on Vietnam in co-ordination
with US imperialism in 1979. In principle Vietnam has a right to use the
East Sea for fishing no less than China. **[Its resistance against being
expelled from the Sea so that imperialist China can exploit it alone is
justified]{.underline}**. **[Hence Bolshevik-Communists could take in
such a war a revolutionary defensist position on the side of Vietnam and
a defeatist position concerning China]{.underline}**." \[7\] The Marxist
classics on contradictory factors in wars [It is true that imperialist
powers have historically tried to utilize democratic struggles for their
own ends and interfere in them]{.underline}. Such interference must be
opposed by Marxist forces. But as Lenin said, in the epoch of
imperialism the big powers will always try to interfere and utilize
national and democratic conflicts. **[However, this fact should not lead
Marxists to automatically adopt a defeatist instead of a
revolutionary-defensist position in such conflicts]{.underline}**.
Rather, **[the position taken by Marxists should depends on which factor
becomes dominant -- the national, democratic liberation struggle or the
imperialist war of conquest.]{.underline}** „Britain and France fought
the Seven Years' War for the possession of colonies. In other words,
they waged an imperialist war (which is possible on the basis of slavery
and primitive capitalism as well as on the basis of modern highly
developed capitalism). France suffered defeat and lost some of her
colonies. Several years later there began the national liberation war of
the North American States against Britain alone. France and Spain, then
in possession of some parts of the present United States, concluded a
friendship treaty with the States in rebellion against Britain. This
they did out of hostility to Britain, i.e., in their own imperialist
interests. French troops fought the British on the side of the American
forces. What we have here is a national liberation war in which
imperialist rivalry is an auxiliary element, one that has no serious
importance. This is the very opposite to what we see in the war of
1914-16 (the national element in the Austro-Serbian War is of no serious
importance compared with the all-determining element of imperialist
rivalry). It would be absurd, therefore, to apply the concept
imperialism indiscriminately and conclude that national wars are
"impossible". A national liberation war, waged, for example, by an
alliance of Persia, India and China against one or more of the
imperialist powers, is both possible and probable, for it would follow
from the national liberation movements in these countries. The
transformation of such a war into an imperialist war between the
present-day imperialist powers would depend upon very many concrete
factors, the emergence of which it would be ridiculous to guarantee."
\[8\] In another article, Lenin compared imperialist interference in
national liberation struggles for their own ends with the interference
of sections of monopoly capital in democratic struggles within
imperialist countries. In both cases, Lenin argued, it would be wrong to
refuse support for theses struggles because of this interference: „On
the other hand, the socialists of the oppressed nations must, in
particular, defend and implement the full and unconditional unity,
including organisational unity, of the workers of the oppressed nation
and those of the oppressor nation. Without this it is impossible to
defend the independent policy of the proletariat and their class
solidarity with the proletariat of other countries in face of all manner
of intrigues, treachery and trickery on the part of the bourgeoisie. The
bourgeoisie of the oppressed nations persistently utilise the slogans of
national liberation to deceive the workers; in their internal policy
they use these slogans for reactionary agreements with the bourgeoisie
of the dominant nation (for example, the Poles in Austria and Russia who
come to terms with reactionaries for the oppression of the Jews and
Ukrainians); in their foreign policy they strive to come to terms with
one of the rival imperialist powers for the sake of implementing their
predatory plans (the policy of the small Balkan states, etc.). The fact
that the struggle for national liberation against one imperialist power
may, under certain conditions, be utilised by another "great" power for
its own, equally imperialist, aims, is just as unlikely to make the
Social-Democrats refuse to recognise the right of nations to
self-determination as the numerous cases of bourgeois utilisation of
republican slogans for the purpose of political deception and financial
plunder (as in the Romance countries, for example) are unlikely to make
the Social-Democrats reject their republicanism." \[9\] This
methodological approach was later defended and developed by the
Trotskyists. In our journal Revolutionary Communism we have re-published
an excellent article from Rudolf Klement, a secretary of Trotsky and a
leading member of the Fourth International, on "Principles and Tactics
in War". In this article Klement elaborated the position of the
Trotskyists and defended it against their sectarian critics: "**[Class
struggle and war are international phenomena, which are decided
internationally. But since every struggle permits of but two camps (bloc
against bloc) and since imperialistic fights intertwine with the class
war (world imperialism---world proletariat), there arise manifold and
complex cases]{.underline}**. **[The bourgeoisie of the semi-colonial
countries or the liberal bourgeoisie menaced by its "own" fascism,
appeal for aid to the "friendly" imperialisms]{.underline}**; **[the
Soviet Union attempts]{.underline}**, for example, **[to utilise the
antagonisms between the imperialisms by concluding alliances with one
group against another, etc]{.underline}**. **[The proletariat of all
countries, the only internationally solidarity]{.underline}**---and not
least of all because of that, the only progressive---class, **[thereby
finds itself in the complicated situation in wartime]{.underline}**,
especially in the new world war, **[of combining revolutionary defeatism
towards]{.underline}** his **[own bourgeoisie with support of
progressive wars]{.underline}**." Klement defends a dialectical
approach, arguing that "[the proletariat, especially in the imperialist
countries, requires, in this seemingly contradictory situation, a
particularly clear understanding of these combined tasks and of the
methods for fulfilling them]{.underline}." Later, at the end of his
article, he goes on to emphasize: "Thus we see how different war
situations require from the revolutionary proletariat of the various
imperialist countries, if it wishes to remain true to itself and to its
goal, different fighting forms, which may appear to schematic spirits to
be "deviations" from the basic principle of revolutionary defeatism, but
which result in reality only from the combination of revolutionary
defeatism with the defence of certain progressive camps." \[10\] **[It
is this concrete, dialectical method which the Marxist classics
developed and which we apply today to the different types of wars which
occur in a world situation characterized by increasing contradictions
and rivalry]{.underline}**.

### "Dirty" Bomb Link

#### The idea of a "dirty bomb" or "attack" is [rooted]{.underline} is racist and imperial imagery to [mock]{.underline} the Middle East

[The cartoon depicted the actual act of bioterrorism in exceedingly
simple terms]{.underline}---the dropping of a licked, sealed envelope in
the mail. [This impression of an easy delivery mechanism was further
conveyed by the cave-like dwelling]{.underline}---[a small, dingy
apartment with sheets for curtains connoted simplicity as well as
primitivity]{.underline}. [The omission of both scientific expertise and
a scientific setting from the picture belied the processing and
cultivation entailed in weaponizing
germs]{.underline}---[which]{.underline} [typically require
highsecurity, well-equipped labs, and in the specific case of the
anthrax mailings was in fact traced to a U.S. laboratory]{.underline}.
As mentioned, [the West has mobilized Orientalist logics since the
colonial period to mark itself as possessing rationality, scientific
thinking, and advanced technology, and as superior because of these
attributes.]{.underline} [In turn, the West marks the East as irrational
and backward, and as constitutionally unable to produce the tools and
products of an advanced civilization]{.underline}---that is, science /
technology ([as well as other features of Western cultures such as
industrialization and capitalist development]{.underline}). [The West
has used this narrative to couch colonial exploitation as a charitable
attempt to help inferior cultures develop and progress toward
civilizational advancement]{.underline} (Adas 1989, 205, 220; Macleod
1993, 123). As Stuart Hall (1992) describes: "The West was the model,
the prototype and the measure of social progress.... And yet, all this
depended on the discursive figures of the 'noble vs ignoble savage,' and
of 'rude and refined nations' which had been formulated in the discourse
of 'the West and the Rest.' ... Without the Rest (or its own internal
'others'), the West would not have been able to recognize and represent
itself as the summit of human history" (221). [Thus, Western historians
of science have constructed a genealogy of science in a linear fashion
from within Europe that excludes not only traditions emanating from
other locales, but also the incorporation of nonEuropean sources into
modern science in Europe]{.underline}. [Specifically, the West has
ignored and dismissed rich histories of science originating from Arab
and Islamic thinkers]{.underline}. Mamdani (2004b) has described how
Western historians have dismissed Arabic-writing scientists during the
classical age of Islam (from the eighth to the thirteenth century) and
constructed them as merely preserving classical Greek science and
passing it on---without any significant contribution---to Renaissance
Europe (from the fourteenth to the seventeenth century). [The Ramirez
cartoon reflected this Orientalist view: its picture of mundane
primitivity]{.underline} (**[in the terrorist's ease of waging
biological warfare]{.underline}**) [combines features of Western
narratives of science and progress with the savagery attributed to the
Arab / Muslim male that I have already outlined]{.underline}. Thus,
Ramirez's caricatured Arab /Muslim man lacks scientific expertise and
its associated trappings---reason, rationality, and objectivity. [Such a
figure feeds into anti-Arab / anti-Muslim discourse, insinuating that
Arabs and Muslims are of lesser intellect and scientific capacity,
producing yet another terrain of their dehumanization]{.underline}. The
Unstoppable Germ [A second type of figuring of the bioterrorist emerged
in U.S. national security debates on bioterrorism response
scenarios]{.underline}. [Pundits from national security and public
health officials to bioethicists and journalists contemplated a new,
entirely imagined, threat: the "suicide infector."]{.underline} Also
called "suicide disease carrier," "suicide disease bomber," and
"smallpox martyr," among other names, [the figure denotes someone who
infects themselves with disease, sneaks into the country (the United
States) before showing symptoms of the disease, and consequently starts
an epidemic]{.underline}.19 [The self-infected terrorist became a
subject of U.S. security discussions on possible Iraqi biological
weapons]{.underline}---namely, smallpox---possession from late 2001 to
early 2003. In these discussions, the suicide infector signified the
degree of potential Iraqi threat, [helping bolster the U.S. rationale
for preemptive action]{.underline}---both the invasion of Iraq and the
vaccination of members of the military and public health sector against
smallpox.20 [The hypothetical nature of the figure made it possible for
pundits to experiment with ideas about bioterrorism and
bioterrorists]{.underline}. A RAND Corporation report described a study
conducted by its Center for Domestic and International Health Security
that focused on "suicide attackers who ride mass transit spreading the
virus" as one of several "feasible smallpox attack scenarios" (2003). A
New York Times journalist described the possibility that "a smallpox
epidemic could begin with a single infected person---a 'smallpox
martyr,' in the terminology of bioterrorism experts---simply walking
through a crowd" (Stolberg 2001). Such scenarios made a suicide infector
attack appear probable and, moreover, as something that could occur in
the most mundane of public settings. The suicide infector derives its
genealogy from the suicide bomber, 21 drawing on the latter's potency in
demarcating the Orientalist binary. Sociologist of race and terror Gargi
[Bhattacharyya]{.underline} (2008) [describes suicide bombing as
representing, in Western discourse, "an indication of the absolute
difference between 'us' and 'them,' and the instance of the boundary is
seen to stem from the dysfunctional subject formation of socalled
enemies of the West]{.underline}" (54). The [suicide bomber is seen as
Other because of a willingness to not only create mass, indiscriminate
destruction, but also perform a monstrous act of human
sacrifice]{.underline}. The suicide bomber's mode of warfare is, thus,
designated illegitimate and uncivilized---it is not the willingness to
give one's body over to a military cause, but the nature of the
sacrifice that marks the terrorist as Other (as opposed to, say, the
exaltation that meets the patriotic soldier). [In this way, Western
discourses on suicide bombing have racialized Arab and Muslim cultures
as engaging in warfare that lacks a proper sense of morality and outlook
on death]{.underline} (Amireh 2011; Asad 2007; Brunner 2007; C. Lee
2009). [The suicide infector figure builds on this notion of Arab and
Muslim cultures as backward, violent, and morally
questionable]{.underline}. To weaponize one's body with germs---thereby
weathering grave illness---epitomizes the type of monstrous
self-sacrifice that marks Arab and Muslim cultures as depraved in
Orientalist discourse. [The germ dimension, moreover, imbues the suicide
infector with an element of metaphor: the suicide infector mirrors the
ability of germs to contaminate everyday spaces]{.underline}. The figure
made its way through the mass media, often through vivid description. It
even appeared in relatively obscure newspapers such as the Naperville
Sun; 22 in late November 2001, the paper published an article covering
bioterrorism response plans being explored in local health departments
and other agencies, opening with a worrying scenario: "Bioterrorists in
New York City, Washington, D.C, and Chicago have deliberately infected
themselves with smallpox virus and are contaminating public, highly
visible places, like subways, government buildings and shopping malls"
(Pazola 2001; emphasis added). As in the previous examples, the theme of
contamination invited a slippage between germ carrier and germ, but
further invited the reader to dwell upon a variety of horror scenes. The
characterization of the suicide infector as contaminant built on wider
post-9 / 11 discourse likening terrorism to a vicious disease, and
terrorists to despicable vermin (C. Lee 2009; Sarasin 2006). An August
2004 article in the Wall Street Journal described terrorism as spreading
"like a virus." Historian Philipp Sarasin (2006) notes the many explicit
references to the September 11 World Trade Center attackers as
uncivilized vermin by a diverse array of sources from journalists to
survivors. This rhetoric echoes long-standing narratives of the Other
that analogize them as germs, vermin, and parasites infecting the
national body (Steuter and Wills 2009). Decolonial theorist Linda
Tuhiwai Smith, in discussing the subjugation of indigenous peoples,
highlights how such rhetoric serves to dehumanize---and this
dehumanization has been pivotal to subjugation attempts: "To consider
indigenous peoples as not fully human, or not human at all, enabled
distance to be maintained and justified various policies of either
extermination or domestication. Some indigenous peoples ('not human'),
were hunted and killed like vermin, others ('partially human'), were
rounded up and put in reserves like creatures to be broken in, branded
and put to work" (Smith 2002, 26). The germ contaminant dimension of the
suicide infector trades on this discourse of "humanity," suggesting an
enemy so vile and wholly destructive that only the most extreme measures
will be able to stamp it out. But [the suicide infector scenario
mobilizes the germ analogy to further dire effect: it turns the metaphor
of terrorism as contagious disease into a material reality]{.underline}.
The suicide infector is not like a contaminant, he23 is the contaminant.
[Like the suicide bomber, the suicide infector connotes an enemy who can
sneak into highly public spaces without detection to perpetrate deadly
acts. But the actual body of the suicide infector symbolizes more than
just a dangerous, insidious presence]{.underline}---he is literally a
bundle of living, regenerating germs that can proliferate indefinitely.
The infectivity of the suicide infector, I suggest, hooks onto the
notion of infiltration in post-9 / 11 discourses of Arab Americans and
Muslim Americans as the enemy within (i.e., as loyal to their
fundamentally suspect, culturally different countries of origin). [The
Arab / Muslim Other as germ body, in this view, represents both a
cultural and a biological threat]{.underline}.

### East Asia Link

#### The desire to harmonize alliances in Eastern Asia is the US's mechanism for establishing economic control

Toward the end of World War II, [US foreign policymakers were clearly
aware of the political difficulties that lay ahead in facilitating
neocolonial links in Asia, or, for that matter, elsewhere in the
periphery]{.underline}. According to the US Department of the State,
Asian and Pacific countries contained "a substantial part of the world's
supply of many critically important primary commodities."54 [The access
to these resources in the last couple of centuries had been controlled,
first by Western powers, and more recently by Japan. But toward the end
of the war, "rising nationalism in Asia has led to a demand for freedom
from this political and economic subjection."]{.underline} **[The
challenge faced by US policymakers at the end of the war was to
"harmonize" the goal of bringing an "increased measure of
selfgovernment" to colonized people, but without alienating key
industrial allies]{.underline}**. **[How might this be
done?]{.underline}** **[US officials thought that American control over
the Philippines]{.underline}** and Cuba **[offered a model for how to
reconcile nominal sovereignty with substantial control in
Asia.]{.underline}** They hoped to persuade their European allies to
follow in the American footsteps of forsaking formal colonial control,
but **[settling for something more suited to the new era, informal
control]{.underline}**. What would this informal control look like in
practice? Again, with reference to the Philippines, a few years later,
[US foreign policymakers clarified the stakes and how the United States
was putting the model of informal control into practice]{.underline}.
Dean [Rusk, the future secretary of state, argued, "\[I\]t is vital we
hold the Philippines whatever the cost]{.underline}---[unless we are
prepared to write off Asia]{.underline}."55 **[Since the Philippines was
now an independent country, how did the United States plan to hold on to
it? The thinking of American foreign policy officials is worth
quoting]{.underline}** in full: [It is recognized that the United States
must continue for an indefinite period to assume responsibility for the
external defense of the islands, to provide military and economic
assistance, to take appropriate measures to assure the institution of
necessary political, financial, economic and agricultural reforms, and
in general to participate in the defense and administration of the
country]{.underline}. Such continued participation in the affairs of an
independent country has its undesirable aspects but **[in the context of
the present world situation there is no acceptable
alternative]{.underline}**.56 **[Maintaining substantial control over
key policy areas in formally sovereign countries was the key to
maintaining influence in the new postcolonial era]{.underline}**. There
was nothing new in such imperial strategies; as I discuss in earlier
chapters, Britain during the nineteenth century had built a far-flung
informal empire, such as in Argentina and Egypt, where it achieved
substantial policy influence without full colonization. With rising
nationalism in the post-World War II period, **[the United States now
offered its Philippine model of decolonization to its European allies,
especially to the French in Indochina, as a way of maintaining the vital
links between the industrial core and the agrarian
periphery]{.underline}**. **[As the United States would soon learn, the
Philippine model of establishing informal control worked mainly when the
ruling elite of a client state]{.underline}**---often dependent on
commodity exports---**[could be readily coopted]{.underline}**. **[This,
in turn, was more likely in situations where the elite-mass gap in the
targeted country was substantial and the ruling elite could control the
masses via some combination of clientelism and
repression]{.underline}**. **[Both Latin America and the Middle East
were populated by such political economies. It is not surprising that
American efforts at establishing stable-but-subservient regimes in the
post--World War II period were concentrated in these
regions]{.underline}**. The American interventions in Iran and Chile
also exemplify this trend. **[By contrast, the nationalist elite in many
Asian countries mobilized their respective masses against both
colonialism and other forms of external interventions]{.underline}**.
**[Mass nationalism would prove much more difficult for the United
States to accommodate within its global hegemonic
project]{.underline}**. The British learned this lesson in India and
bowed out. Americans, too, decided not to confront Mao---certainly not
with a sustained military effort. However, the Dutch in Indonesia and
the French in Indochina learned this lesson the hard way. The French
actually faced military defeat at the hands of the Vietnamese in 1954;
the United States then entered this fray at considerable expense and
eventual failure.

### Emerging Diseases Link

#### Calls for cooperation to respond to "emerging diseases" is a colonialist gesture used by the United States to justify further expansion of bioimperialist surveillance architectures -- past initiatives with China prove

By the 1990s, [the "emerging diseases worldview" came to dominate
infectious disease control approaches in the United States, as well as
at the World Health Organization]{.underline}---[elevating the urgency
of global health, that is, health problems that transcend national
boundaries and necessitate global cooperation.]{.underline}12 In the
decade that followed, "global health security" framed the cross-border
spread of infectious diseases as a type of security threat, and further
prioritized global health over national interests and sovereign
authority (Brown, Cueto, and Fee 2006; Weir 2014). [Global health
security and its predecessor, the emerging diseases worldview, both
mobilized a fundamentally Eurocentric framework that assumed that the
Global South was to blame for the rise of new and resurgent infectious
diseases]{.underline}.13 [This premise was the legacy of colonial health
paradigms originating in western Europe in the late nineteenth
century]{.underline} (e.g., tropical medicine) [that primarily focused
on the colonies as the cauldron of exotic diseases threatening the
colonial enterprise]{.underline} (the health of the colonizers and the
colonized labor force) (N. King 2002, 772-- 773; Levich 2015, 714--715).
**[Accordingly, the global health security regime focused on the
diseases and health concerns of interest to the West and other Global
North nations.]{.underline}** [When SARS emerged in late 2002, an
"Asian" pathogen, it provided the perfect opportunity for the global
health security regime to test one of its key mechanisms: an enhanced
international system of disease surveillance and response]{.underline}.
This system, spearheaded by the WHO, monitored the disease's spread
within and beyond nations, analyzing data gathered from health
information systems and laboratory testing. The global research network
took approximately three months to contain the disease.14 Its [swift
suppression seemed to represent the unmitigated success of global
cooperation. Amid the lauding of global cooperation and scientific
advancement, U.S. public health seized the opportunity to applaud and
exaggerate its contributions to SARS containment, while only briefly
acknowledging the efforts of its allies]{.underline}. The U.S. CDC took
credit for the discovery of the coronavirus, announcing in a March 24
article that "CDC Lab analysis suggests new coronavirus may cause SARS"
(CDC 2003a). In reality, the discovery had been the result of the WHO's
collaborative Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which
linked together individual disease surveillance and response systems.15
Moreover, the discovery of the SARS agent (SARS-CoV) had been made in
several laboratories in the network simultaneously (Brookes and Khan
2005; Fidler 2005).16 The CDC article gave the role of the WHO
collaborative network only brief mention: "Collaboration among
scientists led by the World Health Organization (WHO) is unprecedented."
Unnamed were the other major contributing laboratories in Europe, Hong
Kong, and mainland China. [The United States repeated its
self-congratulatory narrative with respect to the subsequent effort to
sequence the virus and learn its genetic characteristics]{.underline}.
Canada first sequenced SARS-CoV on April 13, 2003, with the United
States following shortly after on the next day. Jerome Hauer, acting
assistant secretary for the Office of Public Health Emergency
Preparedness, portrayed the United States as leading the sequencing
effort in his 2003 testimony during the SARS: Assessment, Outlook, and
Lessons Learned hearing: "CDC identified the coronavirus within a few
short weeks of receiving the first specimens from Asia," followed a few
sentences later by "It \[SARS-CoV\] was successfully sequenced by an
international team of laboratories including CDC and Health Canada." The
Canadian role was rendered equivalent to the U.S. role. [Further, the
United States constructed its leadership role by framing other key
players as passive recipients of aid: "We have deployed teams of experts
and support staff to each of the impacted countries, including Canada,
mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam."]{.underline} In fact, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other
locations had also completed sequencing and discovered important
regional variations (Brookes and Khan 2005). [The paternalistic
statements of the United States illustrate its attempts to overshadow a
sequencing effort that was in fact collaborative and to erase the
scientific and medical contributions of other countries]{.underline}.
**[Thus, the United States ultimately exploited global cooperation to
amplify exceptionalist narratives and boost its international
clout]{.underline}**. [Such conceptual practices reflect and uphold U.S.
global dominance in an uneven international health system, and bolster
U.S. ability to determine health outcomes worldwide]{.underline}. Before
elaborating this claim, I outline the history of this uneven system. The
WHO, Neocolonialism, and the Pandemic Turn Humanitarian medical
practitioner-scholar Philippe Calain (2007a, 2007b) and global health
politics scholar Sara Davies (2008) have both highlighted the way that
[the United States and other dominant nations have built global networks
that facilitate an unequal system that benefits their parochial
interests]{.underline}.17 T[hrough the WHO, the United States and other
wealthy neocolonial powers of the Global North have dominated global
health governance, despite the international body's composition of
member nations that fall on different ends of the global
divide.]{.underline} U.S. public health has played a particularly
prominent role in the WHO, where many key U.S. figures hold leadership
roles. D. A. Henderson, a U.S. epidemiologist, directed the WHO's
smallpox eradication program in the 1960s and 1970s. David Heymann,
another U.S. epidemiologist, worked on both the WHO's smallpox
eradication program and the U.S. CDC's outbreak containment program in
Africa in the 1970s (Lakoff 2015). [Since the end of the Cold War, the
CDC has wielded even greater influence over WHO priorities]{.underline}.
[**U.S. public health leaders pushed the WHO to prioritize "emerging
infectious diseases," focused on deterring spread from the Global South
to the Global North**. U.S. health leaders also helped establish the
WHO's global network of surveillance centers and reference
laboratories]{.underline} (typically private commercial laboratories for
pathogen testing and identification) [to provide early warning of
outbreaks; this data garnered the CDC and other large health
institutions information about disease outbreaks abroad before they
spread globally and affected, for instance, the United
States]{.underline}. [The war on terror afforded the United States and
other global powers further opportunity to push the WHO to adopt
additional North-centric priorities, namely, WMD event
monitoring]{.underline}. [This was a notable shift in the international
body's purview, and to an issue of much lesser concern for the Global
South]{.underline}.18 **[The turn to pandemic flu followed soon after,
which diverted much-needed resources from the pressing health issues
facing most nations in the Global South]{.underline}**---**[that is,
diseases linked to poverty and gaps in local health
infrastructure]{.underline}** (e.g., HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria)
(Abraham 2011; Calain 2007a, 2007b). [As mentioned earlier in the
chapter, the focus on pandemics revolved around H5N1, which symbolized
for the United States the unpredictable threat of influenza strains as
well as the specter of "emerging disease" from Asia]{.underline}. The
United States responded to H5N1 by creating new global networks to
bolster its international pandemic response capacity. In September 2005
at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Bush announced the
International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza (IPAPI),
designed to create "a global network of surveillance and preparedness
that will help us to detect and respond quickly to any outbreaks of
disease" (Bush 2005). About eighty countries signed on to this
international body, which convened a series of meetings beginning
January 2006. In the name of "transparency," all who signed on were
required to immediately share information and provide flu samples to the
WHO should they face an outbreak. [The United States further supported
global pandemic preparedness by offering both financial and technical
assistance for countries to develop capacities for rapid response, lab
diagnosis, and surveillance, pledging \$434 million to the
effort]{.underline} (Bureau of Public Affairs 2007; Crook 2006). [In
this way, U.S. approaches to disease control shifted toward global
efforts that served U.S. interests by generating
information]{.underline}--- [and thus early
warning]{.underline}---[about diseases before they reached U.S.
shores]{.underline}. **[The United States also supported the greater
authority of the WHO to intervene in the infectious disease response of
nations and compel their compliance.]{.underline}** This greater
authority was encoded in the second of two documents the WHO issued on
pandemic preparedness, namely, the revised 2005 International Health
Regulations.19 The culmination of decade-long work to prioritize
emerging diseases containment, the regulations built on WHO success in
spearheading the global efforts against SARS. Member nations were
required to develop the capacity to monitor infectious diseases. In
addition, the WHO now possessed greater and broader authority to require
member nations to provide "information" about "events that may
constitute a public health emergency of international concern" (WHO
2005c). The rubric "events" indicated disease threats and outbreaks that
have the potential for serious public health impact and international
spread (i.e., pandemics). "Information" included outbreak distribution
and trends, morbidity / mortality numbers, but also, potentially, viral
samples and genetic sequences---the substrates for making vaccines and
other medical treatments.20 This effectively gave the WHO wider
authority to force countries to furnish the international body with data
and resources for flu response. As with SARS, the international
surveillance system and its research networks made possible global
collaboration, and many nations primarily affected by H5N1 (like China)
were contributors and beneficiaries of these efforts. At the same time,
the dominance of the United States and other Global North nations
positioned them to capitalize on the enhanced control of the WHO over
disease resources globally, perpetuating, as I show in the next section,
tangible disparities in the international system. Uneven Surveillance:
Discourse and Compliance China, as one of the main countries H5N1
affected, by the end of 2006 had 14 of the 158 total deaths worldwide,
and 22 of the 263 total cases--- making it the fourth hardest country
hit (WHO 2015). Accordingly, China had great stake in developing
adequate flu response and participating in the research networks of the
international health system. As poultry outbreaks spread in early 2004,
China sent reports to the WHO as part of H5N1 monitoring. China also
sent samples collected from infected poultry. In mid-2005, a senior
official in China's Ministry of Agriculture, Jia Youling, stopped
sending samples from new H5N1 outbreaks in birds to the WHO and the UN
Food and Agriculture Organization. He had discovered that a U.S. team
had used samples China shared with the WHO to develop results published
in a February 2005 article in the Journal of Virology without giving
credit to China's Ministry of Agriculture, which had identified the
virus. China's grievance was met with a half-hearted apology from the
U.S. team---they described it as a mix-up, the lead author calling it an
"honest mistake," while also accusing China of hoarding its samples as a
rule. The WHO representative to China, Dr. Henk Bekedam, issued a less
conditional apology, confirming that the U.S. research team, in failing
to acknowledge that China's Ministry of Agriculture had identified the
virus they used for their research, was in breach of scientific protocol
(Beck 2006; Johnson 2006; Zamiska 2006). Despite this issue of
credit-taking, many U.S. media sources, along with other
Western-dominated media sources and the international health community,
echoed the U.S. research team's accusation that China in general hoarded
information. In reference to China's dispute with the WHO, a July 2005
Washington Post article described China as refusing to hand over any
information other than the most basic outbreak data (other information
includes, for example, specifics about the extent of infection or
genetic analyses of the strain). The article characterized China as
withholding: "The \[Chinese\] government has yet to respond to a ...
request by international health experts," and "Chinese officials did not
respond to written requests for comment by the Washington Post." The
article gave no context for China's actions other than cageyness: "U.N.
officials and independent scientists said they were reluctant to
publicly discuss their frustrations with China for fear the government
would shut them out of the country. But officials and researchers said
they were dismayed with the government's secrecy, especially after China
ran afoul of international agencies for its response to the SARS
epidemic that began in 2002" (Sipress 2005). In invoking a secretive,
obfuscating Chinese central government, the article implied that the
Chinese government could not be trusted in health endeavors. The
characterization of China's H5N1 response in the static terms of a
caricatured SARS response---namely, a cover-up21---is problematic in
that China responded vigorously to the H5N1 outbreak, swiftly sealing
off, vaccinating, and later culling infected birds to mitigate the
pathogen's ability to infect humans, as well as ramping up medical
supplies, training, and funds once it had. In fact, China had boosted
spending on health after SARS, including on infectious disease and
especially on HIV / AIDS. China has continued to address important
health issues, implementing in 2008 the first of several policies for
universal medical insurance, as well as pensions, medical leave, and
other health systems reforms. Even so, Western scholars often disparage
China's increased attention to disease response as a desire to boost its
international image---a "saving face" trope, rather than a desire to
improve the country's health (Wishnick 2010). [This image of China is
rooted in longstanding Western portrayals of China as backward and
diseased]{.underline},22 [as well as more recent portrayals of China's
government as secretive, stemming from the Cold War, when China aligned
with the Soviet Union]{.underline} (Kim 2010). The [resurgence of
denigrating tropes of China at the turn of the twenty-first century
occurred in the context of China's rising military and economic
influence in the world, and U.S. desire to limit that
influence]{.underline}. Although China's power was nowhere near on par
with that of the United States---especially its military power--- **[the
United States has maintained]{.underline}** what historian Vijay Prashad
calls "**[Western fantasies of Chinese domination]{.underline}**"
(Prashad 2017, 2541).23 [It was in this geopolitical milieu that SARS
emerged, and the Chinese government's handling of SARS met with enormous
U.S. scrutiny. U.S. public health and news media portrayed Chinese
public health practice as in shambles and Chinese culture as possessing,
in the words of one journalist, a "casual attitude toward health" where
"men and women enthusiastically spit in public"]{.underline} (Lynch
2003). They attributed the emergence of SARS in China to exotic and
savage food preparation and consumption practices (D'Arcangelis
2008)---a place where humans live "cheek-by-jowl" with a variety of
animals that "walk in and out of their houses" (Pearson et al. 2003).
Few stories remarked on China's relatively low reported mortality rate
from SARS---at approximately 6.5 percent---much lower than that reported
worldwide (9.6 percent) and significantly lower than, for example, U.S.
neighbor Canada (17 percent) (WHO 2003c).24 Nor did U.S. coverage of
China mention the extreme range of scholarly viewpoints on how China
dealt with SARS and on the state of Chinese public health at the time:
while some criticized China for withholding information about the
outbreak for too long and putting economic considerations ahead of
public health, others praised Chinese public health response as
relatively quick in the face of a new disease.25 In effect, SARS
afforded the United States the opportunity to reinvigorate the specter
of a diseased Orient26---a story that only intensified with the advent
of H5N1.27 CDC director Julie Gerberding described Asia as "the perfect
incubator" for pandemic flu (Manning 2005). Similarly, Senate staff
director David Dorman opened the China's Response to Avian Flu hearing
by referring to China as "one of the prime incubators for a potential
human influenza pandemic." The reduction of China to solely a disease
generator went hand in hand with U.S. reliance on national barriers as a
means of disease control, despite their inefficacy. 28 Representative
Tom Lantos reflected this approach in his 2005 testimony during the
National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan hearing:
"This pandemic, if it comes, is most likely to come from Asia, it is
most likely to come via San Francisco, Los Angeles or other ports of
entry." Such a focus failed to promote a much more efficacious approach,
namely, cooperation with Asia's disease control efforts---overlooking
the region's demonstrated capability at collaborative health
management.29 A New York Times article titled "Scientists Hope Vigilance
Stymies Avian Flu Mutations," which described U.S. scientific and health
efforts in flu response, contrasted the United States and China in a
pair of photos (McNeil 2007). The top photo in figure 7 depicts two U.S.
professionals---CDC Director Gerberding along with another doctor; the
bottom photo in figure 7 depicts a Chinese man surrounded by a flock of
poultry in a dark, dank-looking room. The choice of juxtaposing a
Chinese farmer with U.S. doctors reproduced a view of China as a
generator of disease. In contrast, the United States was portrayed as
the epitome of science and health---we see only experts, far removed
from the source of disease. These depictions, of China as disease
producer and the United States as model of flu readiness, were the
denouement of the Orientalist imaginary that had gained traction since
SARS. Chandra Mohanty (1984) describes how [knowledge production can
function as "discursive colonization," a "mode of appropriation and
codification of 'scholarship' and 'knowledge' about \[a non-Western
subject\] by particular analytic categories employed in specific
writings on the subject," serving to enact "a relation of structural
domination, and a suppression]{.underline}---[often
violent]{.underline}---of [the heterogeneity of the subject(s) in
question]{.underline}" (333). [Because U.S. discourse about China during
the H5N1 response flattened China into an impediment to global health,
it ignored a much more complex picture]{.underline}. [China was
submerged into the category of "non-West" and by association reduced to
the downtrodden and technologically backward]{.underline}. The
recognition that many non-Western nations have been colonized and
exploited by the West (which has contributed in large part to their
ailing public health infrastructures) should not preclude a more nuanced
discussion of each nation's actual public health capacity. [These
flattened portrayals, moreover, diminished China's governance capacity.
To return to the controversy over China's sample sharing stoppage in
response to U.S. credit stealing, the ensuing negative press effectively
acted as compliance enforcement.]{.underline} Press coverage produces
strong incentive for countries to comply with the international system;
as Briggs and Nichter (2009) state: "[If countries are likely to be
'outed' by such \[international surveillance\] networks, it behooves
them to report incidents in a timely manner and to be seen as good
global citizens instead of selfish agents trying to protect their
self-interests in trade, tourism, institutional politics, political
alliances, and national images"; consequently, "\[some\] countries are
rewarded in the press for being 'good global health citizens,' " while
others are "blamed as bastions of unhygienic subjects"]{.underline}
(197). Discursive mechanisms can, in fact, force compliance as strongly,
if not more so, than formal compliance mechanisms (especially since the
revised 2005 International Health Regulations guidelines lacked any
formal compliance mechanism to require member nations to provide
information and samples).30 **[Moreover, in a neocolonial international
system, global pressure is not evenly applied]{.underline}**. [While the
international press and health communities met China with charges of
obfuscation and narratives of unhygiene, they largely left the United
States alone]{.underline}. **[In fact, the WHO repeatedly accused China
of delaying reports of H5N1 outbreaks, even though China reported
regularly to the WHO during and after avian flu outbreaks]{.underline}**
(Davies 2012, 603).31 **[Thus, the international system and its Global
North leaders can browbeat less powerful, Global South nations to comply
with the North-centered international system, regardless of how this
might diminish their ability to implement disease control in ways that
best protect their populations]{.underline}**. Indeed, this pressure
seems to have worked in China's case---China's Ministry of Agriculture
resumed sending samples a year later.

#### The idea that "there is no alternative to hegemony" or that "transition wars" would prevent the revolution are [self-serving]{.underline} and [self-defeating]{.underline} readings of history designed to serve the imperial narrative

Affairs at Princeton University. His principal research interests are in

the Developing World", Oxford University Press, 2020, accessed via pdf

[Imperialism is an age-old phenomenon.]{.underline} **[In one form or
another, it is likely to continue]{.underline}**. There is insight in
Thucydides's suggestion that the "weak" will always be "subject to the
strong," and that the powerful seldom turn down "the opportunities of
aggrandizement offered by superior strength."**[20 But one problem with
such venerable claims is that they tend to absolve the strong for
exploiting the weak]{.underline}**. **[Another problem is the danger of
near banality passing for ancient wisdom: if there will always be rich
and poor, then should we not worry about inequality? If some citizens
will always commit crimes, then should we not try to find ways to
mitigate the harm of such behavior?]{.underline}** **[A commitment to a
better world suggests that we seek to right the wrongs of the
past]{.underline}**. **[In a world of states, then, it is important to
strengthen arrangements that discourage powerful states from imposing
their will on weaker ones]{.underline}**. **[It may well be the case
that institutions cannot readily restrain the powerful in an "anarchic
world."]{.underline}**21 **[If so, it is at least important to dissect
the self-serving claims of the powerful; at minimum, the mighty should
not to be allowed to define what is right]{.underline}**. Throughout
this volume I have interrogated several interrelated claims made by
hegemonic states of the modern era: we really do not run an empire; if
we do, it is only because it was offered to us; even when it was not
offered to us, we had to take it, not for greed, but for the sake of our
own security; and, in any case, the impact of our empire was, on
balance, benign. My analysis has underscored the ways in which each of
these claims is deeply misleading. With this core analysis in mind, I
have a few final, speculative thoughts on the future of imperialism.
Extrapolating from the recent past, two sets of comments are especially
pertinent. First, what is the likely trajectory of American
interventions in the developing world in the near future? Second, will
emerging powers like China follow the expansionist patterns analyzed in
this book? Is China also moving toward building an informal empire? As I
turn to discuss these questions, an obvious but important caveat ought
to be borne in mind: peering into the future is hazardous. Nevertheless,
if the analysis of the past is correct, it ought to have some bearing on
future projections. **[The United States has never really needed an
empire]{.underline}**. The analysis in this volume has suggested instead
that unlike Britain, which really needed an empire to sustain prosperity
in the nineteenth century, [the United States in the twentieth century
had merely wanted one]{.underline}. **[The tentativeness in the American
imperial project is a function of this difference between need and want.
American gains from imperial interventions in the global periphery have
also been uneven]{.underline}**. A case can be made that during the
post--World War II period, the United States has been more successful in
achieving its goals---at least short- to medium-term goals---via covert
(or indirect) rather than overt, military interventions. For example,
the former suggestion is supported by American interventions in Iran and
Chile and by the most recent imposition of the Washington Consensus on
Latin American countries. By contrast, US intervention in Vietnam was a
heroic failure. [The most recent military intervention in Iraq is still
unfolding. But it is unlikely that the partial success in Iraq in
deposing a despot and opening the oil wells of that country to foreign
capital will ever be judged worth the cost in treasure, loss of life,
and the unstable polity that the United States has left
behind.]{.underline} **[The relative failures of US military
interventions in the developing world are also
comprehensible]{.underline}**. **[Of course, the United States is a
military giant and, if it so chose, it could readily defeat and occupy
any (or most) developing countries]{.underline}**. **[But that is not
the American goal]{.underline}**. **[The United States does not want
colonies. What it wants instead are stable-but-subservient regimes in
the global periphery]{.underline}**. **[And these are increasingly hard
to construct via military interventions]{.underline}**. As I argue
throughout this book, **[the building blocks of old-fashioned nineteenth
century imperialism]{.underline}**---**[ready collaborators in the
periphery who benefited from maintaining commodity-exporting economies
and clientelistic polities]{.underline}**---**[have dissolved in the
global periphery]{.underline}**. **[Mass politics has replaced
clientelism nearly everywhere. Plebiscitarian politics, in turn,
encourages a variety of nationalists to the fore.]{.underline}**
**[Imperial efforts to overtly shape and control the politics of a
developing country then readily run up against developing-country
nationalism]{.underline}**. Diem and others in South Vietnam, for
example, could thus never be considered legitimate rulers of a sovereign
South Vietnam; they were in fact puppets and were seen as such by the
Vietnamese, no match for a Ho Chi Minh. The same is true elsewhere, such
as in contemporary Iraq. **[This does not mean that modern-day
imperialists cannot find ready collaborators in the developing world, or
that commodity-producing elites and their political representatives do
not have much to gain from quiet collaboration with industrialized
countries, especially the United States]{.underline}**. But as democracy
spreads in peripheral countries, subservient rulers face power
challenges from a variety of nationalists. **[The American preference
for democracy, on the one hand, but for promotion of
stable-but-subservient regimes in the developing world, on the other,
are thus inherently in tension]{.underline}**. When economic stakes are
high, as in the case of oil-rich Saudi Arabia, the United States quietly
sets aside the goal of democracy in favor of supporting the power of a
stable-but-subservient regime. **[What is the likely shape of US
interventions in the developing world in the near future?]{.underline}**
**[Enormous power disparities and the prospect of economic gain will
tempt the United States to intervene in one developing country or
another]{.underline}**. Global norms of noninterference in the affairs
of sovereign nations may put some brakes on imperial ambitions. American
citizens' awareness that US interventions in the developing world often
bring misery to the lives of those who are already destitute may also
retard the imperial urge. **[However, neither global norms nor public
opinion is likely to make imperialism a relic of the
past]{.underline}**. [The post--World War II record examined here
sharply supports this projection.]{.underline} **[The more pertinent
issue is what form American imperialism will take in the near
future]{.underline}**. **[Again, the record examined here suggests that
the United States does economic imperialism better than military
imperialism]{.underline}**. **[To the extent that imperialism is
rational, one should expect the United States to eschew military
interventions but continue to seek economic advantage in the global
periphery via the use of covert and indirect
interventions]{.underline}**. As this book goes to press, Iran and
Venezuela, which both possess enormous oil resources, are the focus of
American angst. [Will the United States intervene militarily in these
countries? A cost-benefit analysis of the past suggests that the United
States ought not to pursue a military option in these
countries]{.underline}. **[But what complicates this rational suggestion
is the enormous power surplus that the United States enjoys in the
world]{.underline}**. **[This power surplus, in turn, enables American
leaders to periodically ignore the costs of interventions, which, in any
case, are borne largely by American taxpayers and soldiers, and to
indulge their whims and hubris]{.underline}**.

#### The move to make "better" hegemonic intervention [IS]{.underline} the move to economic intervention

Atul **Kohli '20**, is the David K.E. Bruce Professor of International

[The debt crisis in Latin America threatened the solvency of major
American banks]{.underline}. [The United States intervened, both
directly and via multilateral organizations in which the United States
was a dominant force, to ensure that Latin American countries paid back
their debts to US banks]{.underline}. **[The crisis also provided an
occasion to further open up Latin American economies to US goods and
capital]{.underline}**. While the avowed goal of structural reform in
Latin America was to promote development, it is more likely that US
decision-makers understood, or at least had an inkling, that policies
associated with the Washington Consensus would hurt economic growth in
Latin America but still pushed them because they served American
economic interests. **[As we have seen, the US intervention in Latin
America during the 1980s was part of a long pattern of soft economic
imperialism]{.underline}** (discussed in earlier chapters under the
rubric of informal empire) **[to forcibly open doors the world over to
sustain and enhance American prosperity]{.underline}**. **[Economic
motives were also behind the US military intervention in Iraq, but in
less obvious ways than in Latin America]{.underline}**. [Among the
factors that make the Middle East of great strategic importance to the
United States is the concentration of world's oil resources in the
region]{.underline}. **[Whether friends or foes control the production,
distribution, and pricing of oil is, then, a matter of considerable US
concern]{.underline}**. As noted in chapter 5, the US was party to the
overthrow of Muhammed Mossadegh in the 1950s in order to deny Iran
national control over its own oil. The client status of the Saudi
monarchy serves American regional interests well. Ever since the
overthrow of the pro-American Shah, the US has sought to deny Iran a
significant regional role. It even supported Saddam Hussein against Iran
during the prolonged Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. No one doubts that the
US intervened to liberate Kuwait from Iraq in 1991 because Kuwait swims
in oil. The motives behind the Second Iraq War---the focus of the
present chapter---need to be understood within this historical and
regional context. [I argue that the United States went to war in Iraq
the second time as a first step in a grander design to further
incorporate the oil-rich Middle East within the American orbit. The fact
that it may not work out that way does not take anything away from the
original motives]{.underline}. **[Intervention in Iraq also fits a
century-long pattern of hard military imperialism: the pattern began
with the United States' smashing Filipino nationalists at the turn of
the twentieth century to control the Philippines as a stepping-stone to
the giant China market; it continued in Vietnam as a way to stop the
spread of communism and to maintain open economies in the region; and is
now playing itself out in the oil-rich Middle East that the United
States hopes to dominate]{.underline}**. **[Judged from the standpoint
of whether America's imperial interventions bring it benefits, the
evidence from the most recent period again suggests that the United
States does economic imperialism better than military
imperialism]{.underline}**. The US efforts to deal with the Latin
American debt crisis of the 1980s supports the first part of this
conclusion. As we have seen, the United States used economic coercion to
ensure cooperation by Latin American elites, who were willing to pass on
the costs of policy reform to both the lower strata and the future
generations of Latin America. **[The costs of American intervention to
Americans were minimal, except for the loss of some international
goodwill. In turn, the US government and US-dominated multilateral
institutions helped to maintain the profits and solvency of major
American banks. Latin American markets were opened up further to
American goods and capital. By contrast, US-military intervention in
Iraq has cost the Americans dearly and the rewards remain
uncertain]{.underline}**. **[Since the goals of US intervention were
murky to begin with, it is difficult to assess whether any of them have
been met or are likely to be met]{.underline}**. If the goals had been
minimal---namely, to get rid of a thuggish, possibly anti-American
dictator with access to oil wealth---that much the Iraq War certainly
achieved. However, much of this goal was already accomplished after the
first Gulf War, after which Saddam was still in power but well
contained, and even willing to allow foreign oil companies to invest in
Iraqi oil. The grander goal of remaking Iraq in America's image, and
then going beyond to impose an American peace on the entire region,
remains, at best, illusive, and more likely, with growing
anti-Americanism and the spread of militancy, even more distant than
before the second war. **[The impact of American interventions on
developing countries]{.underline}**---**[both economic and
military]{.underline}**---**[has been negative]{.underline}**. **[As to
economic imperialism, I document below that American efforts to ensure
that banks were repaid their debts contributed to a lost decade of
growth in Latin America]{.underline}**. **[Beyond the lost decade,
moreover, forced economic openness reinforced economic dependency of
Latin American countries on their northern giant. The consequences are
evident if one juxtaposes the experience of Asian countries during the
same period]{.underline}** (say, from 1980 to 2005), with that of Latin
America. Asian countries pursued a more autonomous development path in
which national states directed their respective economies. This pattern
of development---the Asian financial crisis notwithstanding---produced
high growth rates, modest inequalities, industrial development, and high
value-added exports. By contrast, economic growth in Latin American
countries remained sluggish, with sharp income inequalities. Most Latin
American countries also continued to export commodities in exchange for
manufactured goods. **[The negative impact of America's war in Iraq is
there for anyone to see]{.underline}**. What makes a moral judgment a
little complicated is the fact that Saddam Hussein was a despotic,
ruthless dictator who killed many of his own citizens, probably close to
a quarter million over a period of twenty-five years.2 **[By contrast,
as noted, nearly a half million Iraqis died under American occupation
between 2003 and 2011, the year most American troops left Iraq. Since
then, US troops have had to return to deal with militancy. The Iraqi
state remains weak and corruption and poverty remain endemic, even as
oil extraction continues to grow]{.underline}**.

### Liberalism Link

#### The \[aff/neg's\] form of liberalism is a [retreat to the citadel]{.underline} in the face of the [shatterzone of empires]{.underline} because it [theoretically]{.underline} cannot account for the unending violence

[More recently, intellectual historians have begun to identify the
reasons for this estrangement from witnessed history as a Cold War
pattern of thought, and while the reification of such notions as a Cold
War 'mentality'‚ or even 'liberalism'‚ can not always be avoided‚ some
have persuasively recovered the biographical and theoretical basis for
such forms of estrangement]{.underline}.11 What remains to be clarified,
however, is when historical disenchantment had first emerged as an
element of liberal political thought, and to what extent this
development was causally linked to the Cold War. There was a peculiar
pattern of speaking as well as being silent about some historical
conflicts, especially the presence of anti-semitism, which had a much
longer prehistory, reaching back as far as Jacob Burckhardt's work on
Europe, as Lionel Gossman has argued.12 **[Another, more recent history
of liberalism suggested dating this moment to the Second World War and
the Holocaust as the apotheosis of 'damaged ideals and broken
dreams']{.underline}**.13 **[In what follows, I want to propose dating
the beginning of the kind of historical alienation that is typically
associated with 'Cold War liberalism' to a moment]{.underline}** between
the nineteenth century and the 1950s, particularly‚ to the Peace of
Brest-Litovsk, a treaty that the aforementioned John Wheeler-Bennett had
**[appropriately called the 'forgotten peace']{.underline}**. As a
separate process of peace-making, the treaty excluded a number of key
belligerent powers, notably, Britain, France, and the United States. Its
principal object was to seal Russia's defeat, and to divide its lost
territories between Germany and the Ottoman Empire. As Richard Bourke
has identified, it was this quality of the treaty which gave rise to the
term 'Balkanization' as a derogatory concept in political thought and
public policy.14 (Fig. 8.1). [If we are to understand at which point
modern political liberalism retreated from its earlier confidence in
historical progress, the international reception of the Peace of
Brest-Litovsk]{.underline} (1917--1918) [between Russia and the Central
Powers is a good place]{.underline}. **[Its history draws attention to
the 'shatterzones of empires' and the point at which liberalism became
disorientated vis-à-vis its own past ideals and future
commitments]{.underline}**.15 Looking at the reactions of contemporaries
and witnesses to the Peace of Brest-Litovsk (1918), we can also develop
a better understanding of the fraught relationship between Enlightenment
ideals and twentieth-century political practice. [The form of the peace
had shaken up a number of received principles of European political
culture, which themselves dated back to Enlightenment ideals of the
political**. It was a treaty signed between states which soon after
ceased to exist in this form**]{.underline}---**[a particular problem
for those traditions of liberal political thought which concentrate on
the state as their main object]{.underline}**. As this chapter will make
apparent, a fresh.16 This chapter begins by identifying the metaphor of
the 'citadel' as a central concept through which Isaiah Berlin's
abstraction from historical experience can be explored [look at Isaiah
Berlin's ideas of history could return our awareness to this important
moment through biographical and situational contexts]{.underline} in
reading his discussion of 'negative' liberty, before discussing the
implications of the Peace of Brest-Litovsk for ideas of liberty in the
contexts of German liberal and historical thought of the same period.
'Negative' Liberty and the Retreat from Cosmopolitanism **[The negative
conception of liberty which]{.underline}** Isaiah **[Berlin developed in
his Two Concepts of Liberty, drawn from his inaugural lecture at Oxford
in 1958‚ provides the most influential account of the reasons why modern
liberalism had to abstract from particular historical
experience]{.underline}**. **[Criticizing positive conceptions of
liberty, which, in his view, risked becoming dogmatic and
totalitarian]{.underline}**, Berlin insisted that under his conception,
**[the subject had to maintain the capacity to 'retreat into the inner
citadel', a space which he associated with]{.underline}** the Stoic and
Epicurean **[roots of the Enlightenment idea of reason]{.underline}**.17
**[In speaking of a 'retreat', Berlin described it as a space where the
subject has freed himself]{.underline}**---**[and it is nearly always a
he]{.underline}**---**[not just from pain, but from the source of pain;
where power in the kingdom whose 'frontiers are long and insecure' is
ensured by eliminating the 'vulnerable area', a process he likened to a
wounded leg that is being amputated in order to save the living
core]{.underline}**. He called this metaphorical citadel 'my own sect,
my own planned economy'. In other writings, **[Berlin also argued that
people wanted to be free from 'dictation or coercion from teachers,
masters, bullies and persuaders and dominators of various
kinds'.]{.underline}** What was needed, in his view, were 'natural units
of human size', not cosmopolitanism or other dogmatic doctrines of
history.18 **[The purpose of his moderate vision of liberty was to
create a model which would safeguard individuals from manipulation by
political ideologies which claimed to emancipate them on their
behalf]{.underline}**. Berlin's anti-radical world picture also involved
a very conscious turning away from eighteenth-century languages of
cosmopolitanism, which Berlin associated with the figure of Immanuel
Kant as a moral dogmatist whose ideals, despite potentially good
intentions, could evidently lead to totalitarianism. In his place, he
favoured Kant's former disciple and outspoken critic, Johann Gottfried
Herder, whom Berlin construed as a theorist of cultural pluralism‚
having rescued him from a more völkisch reading by Nazi ideologues. A
further characteristic of Berlin's relationship to history was an
interest in figures from the history of ideas who could be clearly
mapped as either 'pro-' or 'anti-Enlightenment'. Berlin's interpreters
have discussed this passage to emphasize the importance of a positive
notion of freedom within Berlin's demand for its negative
conceptualization.19 In these interpretations, however, his choice of
metaphor---the citadel---remained out of focus. [It was a type of space
bridging military and civilian, exceptional and regular experiences of
citizenship]{.underline}. **[The citadel, which we might also translate
as fortress]{.underline}**, or krepost in Russian, acropolis in Greek,
zion in Hebrew or Kasbah in Arabic, **[is an element of defence
architecture within which a certain form of life continues in war as
well as in peacetime alike, with some, but ideally, only minimal
restrictions in wartime]{.underline}**. The Russian word for serf---
krepostnoi---is derived from this concept. Max **[Weber has emphasized
the hybrid nature of this structure, combining elements of a market with
elements of a city, but without quite being identical with
cities]{.underline}**.20 Although often discussed by the same authors of
classical antiquity who left us an account of **[cities as sites of
political representation, citadels are not conspicuous by this
function;]{.underline}** they **[serve the purpose of protection in a
state of emergency in which notions of internal political organization,
justice, and political representation are pushed to the
side]{.underline}**.21

#### Particularly, their conception of liberal realism is an [incredibly selective]{.underline} reading of history that [ahistoricizes]{.underline} vast portions of the past to justify its [myopic]{.underline} worldview and aid imperial expansion

[Berlin's separation between political philosophy and witnessed history
had a profound influence on liberal attitudes to the historical past‚
yet they were formed in response to historical circumstances which
preceded the Cold War]{.underline}. **[Though they are not typically
classed as 'Cold War liberals', John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas, for
instance, have also been visibly agnostic vis-à-vis the historical
experience of the twentieth century in terms of conceptualising norms of
justice and publicity]{.underline}**.50 The abstraction from history
acquired normative connotations in a way that was particularly salient
in the philosophy of John **[Rawls]{.underline}**, as he sought to
re-establish the foundations of ideal theory in a way which would be
unfettered by historical experience.51 His **[very influential
contractual model of justice probably gave the clearest justification
for a divorce of political thought from history. It required readers to
imagine a 'veil of ignorance' concerning their true historical and
economic position, which frees up participants in a social contract to
abstract from any particular passions or experiences and tunes them to
seek out universally valid terms of justice]{.underline}**. **[Realism
in international relations was also characterized by a highly selective
curation of historical evidence, as expressed in the doctrine of Hans
Morgenthau, who argued that '\[h\]istory shows no exact and necessary
correlation between the quality of motives and the quality of foreign
policy']{.underline}**.52 On this model, **[the idea of a national
interest, the modern variant of the imperial reason of state, was a
safer guide to political behaviour than the ideological or legal
framework within which these were legitimated]{.underline}**.53 In the
last section of the paper, I want to propose how a different, more
historically grounded engagement with past 'crooked paths' might
actually provide less conclusive insights about the relationship between
historical experience and future commitments. As will be seen, this
emerged from German engagements and responses to the Peace of
Brest-Litovsk, particularly, in the work of Max Weber, Hannah Arendt,
and later, Reinhart Koselleck.

### Military Nationalization Link

#### The aff's naïve hope in the idea that "nationalizing" the military will remove the "bad private actors" ignores the government's [active]{.underline} and [purposeful]{.underline} role in waging war -- "nationalization" only makes the state [more efficient]{.underline} in achieving violence because it doesn't have to negotiate with private interests

**[In Galbraith\'s second version of the military-industrial complex a
unique public private bureaucracy dominates]{.underline}**. [An
identical wage-receiving cadre of professionals]{.underline} (engineers,
scientists, cost analysts, intelligence experts, communications
specialists, economists, etc.) [dominates both the private military
contracting corporations]{.underline} (their boards of directors, their
shareholders and their top management) [and the public sector where the
Pentagon technicians and their defense intellectuals hold sway over the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the heads of the branches of the Services, the
U.S. House of Representatives, the Senate and the U.S.
President]{.underline}. **[This curious inversion]{.underline}** ?
**[particularly within the military itself where hierarchy is the sine
qua non of professional order]{.underline}** ? **[is not backed up with
any real empirical support]{.underline}**. The professional cadres, in
possession of knowledge, are assumed to be the motor force of the vast
corporate and public sector entities. A case could probably be made that
within these vast organizations those who possess knowledge of a
professional nature are crucial to the functioning of the organizations
and that they exercise some relative autonomy. But, they do so within
some very strict parameters.

Galbraith attempted to describe the micro aspects of a stable Keynesian
Social Structure of Accumulation that articulated the public and private
sectors in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. From 1975 through 2007, the
U.S. economy has metamorphosed under the twin forces of
\"globalization\" and \"financialization\" (Cypher 2003). [Since
Galbraith offered his interpretation, much has changed: first and
foremost, the trend of military expenditures has been strongly downward,
with dramatic ups and downs as a result of the United States\' defeat in
Vietnam, the Reagan arms buildup, the collapse of the USSR and the end
of the Cold War, and the onset of \"war on terrorism.\"]{.underline}
[Professionally trained \"technostructure\" cadres have been mustered
out by the hundreds of thousands in both the public and private
sector]{.underline}. **[In the corporate world, mergers and
acquisitions, downsizing and off shoring have scrambled careers and
demonstrated that the technostructure is hardly in control of the
dynamics of the giant corporations]{.underline}**. In the fourth edition
of the New Industrial State, Galbraith acknowledged that his formulation
of the \"planning system\" had not anticipated the rise of
globalization, the instability of the macroeconomy, the decline of
military expenditures and other mega-trends. Yet, [he tended to minimize
most of the processes and dynamics his model had not
anticipated]{.underline} (Galbraith \[1967\] 1985, xi-xxxv).
**[Galbraith claimed]{.underline}** (in 1971) \"**[that the principal
seat of government is the Commonwealth of Virginia, not Washington, D.C.
where both the Pentagon and CIA are located]{.underline}**\". **[While
he claimed that causality ran from the symbiotically aligned
private-public technostructure regarding the creation of weapons systems
or an \"initial decision in favor of invasion\" up through the Congress
and to the President, it is difficult to square this perception with a
careful reading of recent history regarding foreign affairs and military
policy]{.underline}** (Galbraith \[1971\] 1986, 223). **[The Star Wars
missile defense system was the result of a neoconservative shift in the
matter of military grand strategy]{.underline}** ? **[not a result of
some faceless, bland, \"planning\" technostructure]{.underline}**.
**[The top Pentagon brass did not initiate either Gulf
War]{.underline}** I (1991) or II (2003-2008?). **[Both were wars to
maintain/expand United States suzerainty in the Middle East, the first
driven by a \"realist\" version of grand strategy, the second by a
neoconservative vision]{.underline}**. **[In short, from the end of the
Vietnam War onwards, one could easily cite event after event relating to
military affairs wherein a pivotal role could be assigned to the
Congress, the executive office or to other forces and factors that
seemed to have nothing to do with a symbiotically aligned public-private
sector]{.underline}**. Finally, although Galbraith was quick to heap
ridicule on the idea that the private sector contracting firms had the
upper hand in the relationship between the buyer and the seller of
armaments, **[it is difficult to understand the actual workings of the
military-industrial complex without concluding that Galbraith was simply
wrong on this point]{.underline}**. Nowhere in his writings can an
empirical defense of his position be found.

[It is a relatively simple manner, however, to cite case after case
wherein the military has bought overpriced products at a quantity level
below that specified in their original contract and at a quality level
that is woefully below that promised by the contractor.]{.underline}
Consider what is but the latest case: [In 2002, the Coast Guard was
allocated \$17 billion for the Deepwater project which was to
revolutionize the Guard, rebuilding virtually all old ships and
helicopters, while providing (1) new state-of-the art ships; (2) patrol
aircraft with biological, nuclear and chemical capabilities; and (3) two
types of ultra high-tech unmanned aerial surveillance planes**. By 2005,
the cost overruns of the contracted items to be provided by the Northrup
Grumman and Lockheed corporations had soared by 41% (to \$24 billion),
while by 2006, none of the 459 aircraft and ship items had been
delivered as specified**]{.underline} ? **[the Coast Guard was less able
to fulfill its functions than it was in 2001]{.underline}** (Lipton
2006, Al, A12-13). **[To get the initial funding, the Coast Guard relied
upon the lobbying capacities, talent and experience of both Northrup and
Lockheed]{.underline}** ? **[a far cry from Galbraith\'s formulation
whereby the military bureaucracy adroitly maneuvers its way around the
Congress and the executive.]{.underline}** [In Galbraith\'s
interpretation, the private corporations provide the equipment, and the
highly skilled military technostructures work cooperatively with the
private sector to ensure that technologically advanced weapons systems
are delivered to the satisfaction of the military
bureaucracy]{.underline}. In the case of Deepwater, the Coast Guard
technostructure was not, apparently, to be found (Lipton2006,A12).

**[Nor was the Congress a passive recipient of the decision handed down,
as in Galbraith\'s interpretation, by the symbiotically aligned
Northrup/Lockheed-Coast Guard duality]{.underline}**. **[Three Congress
members]{.underline}** (**[all with strong vested interests in having
the project funded due to an inordinate amount of work that would be
profitably undertaken by corporations in their districts]{.underline}**)
**[were instrumental in steering the unprecedented contract to approval
in 2002]{.underline}**. Deepwater is not exceptional as The Wastrels of
Defense and Grand Theft Pentagon show (Wheeler 2004; St. Clair 2005).
[If both the public and the private sector were symbiotically aligned,
why would there be an incessant history of contractor abuse, wherein
enduring the bad end of the exchange is always the fate of the military
services unless the whole objective of the exercise is simply to \"make
money\"? **The answer, of course, is that Galbraith\'s interpretation
simply does not coincide with the empirical record regarding contracting
relationships**]{.underline}.

#### Plan fails to recognize the government's [monopoly on sanctioned violence]{.underline} -- a nationalized military is [just as likely]{.underline} to abuse its power

[In the context of foreign military interventions, this flaw implies
that, given the chance, self-interested capitalists will gladly engage
in a mutually beneficial exchange with the state-monopoly provider of
military services]{.underline}. Private companies offer campaign
contributions and political support, and politicians and state
bureaucrats offer rents in return. [Although both parties are privately
made better off, the significant negative externality of allowing this
exchange is that the permanent war economy diverts productive resources
away from other uses that would improve the general standard of
living]{.underline} (see Duncan and Coyne forthcoming).

**[How is this dilemma to be resolved?]{.underline}** **[One solution is
to adopt a completely planned economic system for military and defense
production that removes capitalists from the process
altogether]{.underline}**. **[The flaw in this alternative, however, is
that it assumes that government, absent crony capitalists, will have
less of an incentive to build and use weapons for imperialistic
purposes]{.underline}**. The field of public choice, which demands the
symmetry of assumptions between private and public actors, calls this
assumption into question. Further, **[historical evidence also provides
countless instances of government abuse of its monopoly on military
force]{.underline}**.

[Yet another alternative is to establish a constitutionally limited
system that constrains government while allowing productive capitalism
to flourish within a limited domain of action]{.underline}. In
principle, this solution would limit the type of cronyism that gave rise
to the permanent war economy. [The main problem with this alternative is
that binding constraints have historically been fleeting in the face of
constant pressures by politicians, bureaucrats, and capitalists pursuing
their own narrow, self-interested agendas]{.underline}. Further
intensifying these pressures are real and perceived crises that create
openings for expansions in government, resulting in increased rents
available to well-positioned special interests (see Higgs 1987, 2004,
2005b, 2006, 2012).

**[A third solution is to reconsider the state's role as a monopoly
provider of defense services]{.underline}**. **[Recognizing the monopoly
rents associated with the state as the sole provider of military
services, this alternative entails engaging in comparative institutional
analysis to explore the feasibility of different means of providing
protection and defense in the absence of a state monopoly]{.underline}**
(see, for example, D. Friedman 1989; Stringham 2007; Powell and
Stringham 2009). **[Although this alternative may at first appear
radical, it is no more so than the first two solutions, which ultimately
rely on centralizing control of the military with the hope that it will
not be abused by those in power]{.underline}**.
**[History]{.underline}**, however, **[shows that avoiding such abuse is
the exception rather than the norm]{.underline}**.

### MIC Link

#### The idea that there is a "separate" military power that exists outside of economic organization that could be solved by "removing corporate influences" is the [exact]{.underline} play the corporate elite makes during periods of economic crisis to [reconsolidate]{.underline} the means of destruction in their hands -- PMCs are [just]{.underline} scapegoats for violent US interventions 

Paul M. **Sweezy '56**, was a Marxist economist, political activist,
publisher, and founding editor of the long-running magazine Monthly
Review. He is best remembered for his contributions to economic theory
as one of the leading Marxian economists of the second half of the 20th
century, "Power Elite or Ruling Class?", Review of *The Power Elite* by
C. Wright Mills, Monthly Review, Vol. 8, No. 5: September 1956,

[Mills starts off with a concept of the power elite which is
dis-armingly simple]{.underline}. [Those who occupy the "command posts"
of our major economic, military, and political institutions constitute
the power elite]{.underline}---the big shareholders and executives of
the corporate system, the generals and admirals of the Pentagon, and the
elected and appointed officials who occupy political positions of
national sig- nificance. [But this of course tells us nothing about the
men who stand at these posts]{.underline}---[how they got there, their
attitudes and values, their relations with each other and with the rest
of society, and so on]{.underline}---[nor does it provide any but an
admittedly misleading clue to these questions: **Mills himself
repeatedly rejects the notion that the power elite in his sense
constitutes some sort of natural aristocracy of ability and
intelligence, in spite of the common connotation of the term
"elite."**]{.underline}

[Having in effect defined the power elite as composed of the big shots
of industry and government, Mills' next task is to devise a theoretical
scheme within which to locate them and to guide his empirical
investigations into their characteristics and habits]{.underline}. Two
general approaches readily suggest themselves, and Mills follows them
both without ever clearly distinguishing them, without asking how far
and in what respects they may be in conflict, and without any systematic
attempt to reconcile their divergent results. The first ap- proach is
via social class: the hypothesis can be put forward and tested that
those who occupy the command posts do so as repre- sentatives or agents
of a national ruling class which trains them, shapes their thought
patterns, and selects them for their positions of high responsibility.
**[The second approach is via what Mills vari- ously calls the "major
institutional orders"]{.underline}** (eg., on p. 269), the "major
hierarchies" (p. 287), the "big three domains" (p. 288), **[and other
more or less synonymous terms, This assumes that there are distinct
spheres of social life]{.underline}**---**[the economic, the military,
and the political]{.underline}**---**[each with its own institutional
structure, that each of these spheres throws up its own leading cadres,
and that the top men of all three come together to form the power
elite.]{.underline}**

**[Now there may be societies, past or present, in which this idea of
more or less autonomous orders, hierarchies, or domains has enough
relevance to make it a fruitful approach to problems of social struc-
ture and power]{.underline}**. **[But it seems perfectly clear to me
that the United States is not and never has been such a
society]{.underline}**. Moreover, [**the cumulative effect of the
empirical data presented by Mills is de- cisively against any such
interpretation of the American system**. He adduces a wealth of material
on our class system, showing how the local units of the upper class are
made up of propertied families and how these local units are welded
together into a wholly self-conscious national class]{.underline}. [He
shows how the "power elite" is overwhelmingly (and increasingly)
recruited from the upper levels of the class system, how the same
families contribute indifferently to the economic, mili- tary, and
political "elites," and how the same individuals move easily and almost
imperceptibly back and forth from one to another of these
"elites."]{.underline} When it comes to "The Political Directorate"
(Chap- ter 10), **[he demonstrates that the notion of a specifically
political elite is in reality a myth, that the crucial positions in
government and politics are increasingly held by what he calls
"political out- siders," and that these outsiders are in fact members or
errand boys of the corporate rich]{.underline}**.

**[This demonstration in effect reduces "the big three" to "the big
two"]{.underline}** ---**[the corporate and the military
domains]{.underline}**. There is no doubt at all about the decisive
importance of the former, and Mills makes some of his most useful and
interesting contributions in discussing the wealth, power, and other
characteristics of the corporate rich.\* But **[the evidence for an
autonomous, or even semi-autonomous, mili- tary domain of comparable
importance is so weak that it can be said to be almost
nonexistent]{.underline}**. **[Historically, to be sure, the military
has normally been somewhat separated from the main stream of American
life, and in this sense one could perhaps speak of a military
domain]{.underline}**. **[But it has been small and completely subject
to civilian control, quite impotent in terms of the national
decision-making which is the special function of Mills' power
elite]{.underline}**. **[In wartime, of course, the mili- tary has
swelled enormously in size and power, but it is precisely then that it
has ceased to be a separate domain]{.underline}**, The civilian higher
circles have moved into commanding military positions, and the top brass
has been accepted into the higher circles. What happens in such times is
that the "power elite" becomes militarized in the sense that it has to
concern itself with military problems, it requires military skills, and
it must inculcate in the underlying population greater re- spect for
military virtues and personnel.

**[All this has nothing in common with the rise to power of a military
order headed by an elite of "warlords," though it is in these terms that
Mills describes what has been happening in the United States since the
beginning of World War II, and indeed must describe it or else abandon
the whole theory of a composite power elite made up of separate
"domanial" elites;]{.underline}** **[for on his own showing the
"'political directorate" is merely an emanation of the corporate
rich]{.underline}**. **[To sup- port the theory of "The
Warlords']{.underline}** (Chapter 8) and "The Military Ascendancy"
(Chapter 9), **[Mills brings forth little evidence beyond the well-known
facts that the military trade has traditionally re- quired a specialized
training and code of conduct, and that the Pentagon is an important
center of power in American life]{.underline}**. **[But these facts
require no such fancy interpretation and are perfectly compatible with a
more prosaic theory of the locus of power in mid- twentieth-century
United States]{.underline}**.

But Mills really relies much less on facts than on a sort of un- stated
syllogism to back up his warlord-military ascendancy theory. [The
syllogism might be formulated as follows: the major outlines of American
policy, both foreign and domestic, are drawn in terms of a "military
definition of world reality" which has been accepted by the power elite
as a whole; this military definition of reality (also referred to as
"military metaphysics") must be the product of the professional military
mind ("the warlords") ; ergo the warlords now occupy a decisive position
within the power elite ("the military as- cendancy"). **This may look
impressive and convincing at a first glance, but a moment's reflection
will show that it explains nothing and constitutes no support whatever
for Mills' theory**]{.underline}. **[Professional military people
naturally think in military terms and have doubtless always tried to
persuade others to see things their way. Throughout most of United
States history, they have succeeded, if at all, only in
wartime]{.underline}**. The real problem is to understand why it is that
since World War II the whole "power elite" has come to think in-
creasingly in military terms and hence to accord a place of greater
honor and power to the military. Without an answer to this, all the
facts that seem to Mills to add up to the "military ascendancy" of the
"warlords" remain quite unexplained.

**[Now Mills himself never faces up to this question, and the only
relevant answer I can find is that the United States now, unlike in the
past, lives in a "military neighborhood"]{.underline}** (the phrase is
used on a number of occasions), **[which presumably means that the
country is under constant threat (or potential threat) of attack and
military defeat]{.underline}**. **[This is more sophisticated than
saying that we live in mortal danger of red aggression, but its
explanatory value is exactly the same: in either case the increasing
militarization of American life is the result of external
forces]{.underline}**. **[The rise of the warlords, then, is seen as the
outcome of a world historical process for which the United States has no
responsibility and over which it has no control, and not, as Mills
clearly wants to prove, as the outcome of internal forces operating in
the military domain]{.underline}**.

**[Thus, while Mills appears to have little in common with the cold-war
liberals, and in fact rather generally holds them in contempt, his
theory of the role of the military leads to very much the same
conclusions]{.underline}**. I believe that **[this is no
accident]{.underline}**. "**[Elitist" thinking inevitably diverts
attention from problems of social structure and process and leads to a
search for external causes of social phenomena]{.underline}**.
Simon-pure elitists like Pareto and his followers frankly adopt this
method and find what they are looking for in the alleged natural
qualities of their elites. Semi-elitists like Mills---people who think
they can adopt the terminology without any of the basic ideas of elitist
theory---tend to get bogged down in confusion from which the only escape
is to borrow the most banal ideas of their opponents.

**[It is too bad that Mills gets into this kind of a mess, because, as I
indicated above, his work is strongly influenced by a straight- forward
class theory which, if he had stuck to it and consistently explored its
implications, would have enabled him to avoid com- pletely the
superficialities and pitfalls of elitist thinking]{.underline}**. **[The
upper- most class in the United States is, and long has been, made up of
the corporate rich who directly pull the economic levers]{.underline}**.
**[Prior to the Clutch Plague and World War II, the corporate rich left
political and military matters largely]{.underline}** (**[though by no
means ex- clusively]{.underline}**) **[in the control of hired hands and
trusted agents]{.underline}**; **[but since the highly dangerous
economic breakdown of the 30s, the Big Boys have increasingly taken over
the key positions themselves]{.underline}**. **[Their unwillingness to
solve the economic problems of capitalism through a really massive
welfare state program meant that they welcomed the war as the salvation
of their system]{.underline}**. **[Since the end of World War II, they
have accepted, nay created and sold through all the media of mass
communications, a "military definition of reality" as the
ideological-political underpinning of the war-preparations economy,
which remains crucial to the whole profit-making mechanism on which
their wealth and power rests]{.underline}**. For this purpose**[, they
have lavishly subsidized and encouraged the military, which in turn has
not only grown vastly in size but also has been enormously flattered and
has become the most loyal defender and promoter of the "free enterprise"
system]{.underline}**. **[The picture of "warlords" exercising a
"military ascendancy" is fanciful: our warlords have no fundamental
values or purposes different from those of their corporate
colleagues]{.underline}**; **[many of them perform virtually
indistinguishable jobs; and the crowning achievement of a military
career today is the board chairmanship of a billion-dollar
corporation]{.underline}**.\* At the same time, **[we have nothing even
approaching a unified military order or caste seeking to impose its
"military metaphysics" on the nation]{.underline}**. The most famous of
our "warlords," President Eisenhower, is now the most peaceful of our
influential politicians; while our most strident "militarists" are
civilian Senators Symington and Jackson whose closest affiliations would
seem to be with the multi-billion-dollar aircraft industry.

**[No, the facts simply won\'t fit Mills' theory of three (or two)
sectional elites coming together to form an overall power
elite]{.underline}**. **[What we have in the United States is a ruling
class with its roots deeply sunk in the "apparatus of appropriation"
which is the corporate system]{.underline}**. **[To understand this
ruling class]{.underline}**---**[its metaphysics, its purposes, and its
morals]{.underline}**- -**[we need to study, not certain "domains" of
American life, however defined, but the whole system of monopoly
capitalism]{.underline}**.

#### The aff is [antithetical]{.underline} to a Marxist approach on militarism -- their theory relies on [anti-Marxist]{.underline} thought that blames military violence on general "bureaucracy" rather than seeing it as a stage of capitalist, imperialist development [necessary]{.underline} for the existence of the nationstate -- proves the K turns the entire aff, but not the other way around

Contemporary with the publication of The Power Elite was Dahrendorf\'s
Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society (1956). [Restating the
mana- gerial revolution concept he described the ruling group of the
post-industrial state as composed \"of the administra- tive staff of the
state, governmental elites at its head, and those interested parties
which are represented by the governmental elite\"]{.underline}
(1956:303). **[More recent variations on the same theme are found
in]{.underline}** Keller\'s Beyond the Ruling Class (1963),
**[Galbraith\'s The New Industrial State]{.underline}** (1967), and
Bell\'s The Coming of Post-Industrial Society (1973). **[In all of these
studies, despite varying political positions, there was a common
conceptual ancestry in the ideas of the neo-Machiavellians and
Weber]{.underline}**. **[Contrary to Marxist thought, these theorists
portrayed post-indus- trialized societies-whether capitalist or
socialist-as converging in their basic forms of
authority]{.underline}**; **[top leaders emerging out of large-scale
public and private enterprises comprised the new ruling groups; educated
state function- aries and technical specialists trans- cended the
property basis of power]{.underline}**; and **[even class conflict was
to be superseded by the bureaucratization of elite struc-
tures]{.underline}**.5

**[The point here is simply that the basic theoretical premises
underlying Mills\' The Power Elite were not in themselves departures
from prevailing sociological thought]{.underline}**. **[Quite the con-
trary, the central conceptual thrust of The Power Elite was essentially
in ac- cord with the basic formulations of earlier and contemporary non-
if not anti-Marxist social scientists]{.underline}**.6 In par- ticular,
**[the invocation of notions such as mass society and elite groups
served to undercut explanatory concepts based on economic relations of
classes to the means of production]{.underline}**. **[Moreover, this
aversion to use a class analysis has been the hallmark in the subsequent
develop- ment of the concept of the military- industrial
complex]{.underline}**.

MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL DETERMINANTS

[It is not surprising that interpreta- tions of the causal factors in
the op- eration and makeup of the military- industrial complex are
many]{.underline}. At first glance it would appear that the litera- ture
on the military-industrial complex is too variable to categorize easily.
[From among the diverse accounts, however, we can distinguish-with some
overlap to be sure-three recurring and analyt- ically exclusive themes
as to the root quality of the military-industrial com-
plex]{.underline}. For purposes of exposition, we can refer to these
three determinants as **[deriving from (1) the military hier- archy, or
(2) the administrative bu- reaucracy, or (3) corporate
wealth]{.underline}**. In terms of ideological referents, **[it ap-
pears that the different theoretical emphases given principal
determinants are correlated-albeit loosely-with rather distinct
positions on the political spectrum]{.underline}**. **[The dominant
thrust in the literature, which stresses the baleful role of the
military hierarchy, tends to find its proponents among liberal
spokesmen]{.underline}**; **[emphasis on the autonomy of administrative
bureaucrats seems to be chiefly a characteristic of those ad- hering to
a kind of New Left persua- sion]{.underline}**; **[while attributing
prime deter- minancy to corporate wealth finds its adherents
principally-although not ex- clusively-among Marxist
writers]{.underline}**. [The Military Hierarchy]{.underline}. [The truly
novel feature of The Power Elite was Mills\' introduction of the
military \"warlords\" as constituent members of the ruling elite of the
United States. Never before had uniformed officers been so characterized
in American so- ciety]{.underline}.7 It also appears more than coi
cidental that Mills resorted to a mili- tary metaphor to define the
power elite as those who \"occupy the strategic com- mand posts of the
social structure\" (1956:4). This portrayal of the mili- tary found an
echo in Cook\'s The Warfare State (1962), and Swomley\'s The Military
Establishment (1964) which squarely placed the blame for the
militarization of American society on the \"permanent officer group.\"
[But it was not until the contemporary pe- riod, when the war in
Indochina engen- dered an endemic anti-militarism within America\'s
intellectual and academic circles, that the nefarious role of the
uniformed military became a leitmotiv in much of the military-industrial
com- plex literature]{.underline}.

Barnet (1969:81) thus states: \"By the end of the Johnson
Administration, the uniformed military had acquired considerable
independent political power.\" Lens, whose The Military- Industrial
Complex (1970) includes a panoply of vested interests, neverthe- less,
points to the Pentagon as \"the fountainhead\" of American imperial-
ism. Heilbroner (1970:6) concludes: \". .. that the military
establishment constitutes itself as a self-contained en- tity, capable
of impressing its views and imposing its will not only on the civil
establishment to which it pays ritual obeisance, but over a section of
the economy in which the language of private enterprise is merely a
fiction to hide its absolute authority.\" Galbraith (1969:10) holds:
\"In my view the Services, not their industrial suppliers, are the prime
wielders of this power.\" Indeed, Galbraith explicitly reverses Marxist
causality and refers to military suppliers as \"captive contractors\"
(1969:33).

[Specifying the military as the main culprits in the military-industrial
com- plex is not by any means confined to academics]{.underline}.
**[Thus former Marine Com- mandant Shoup]{.underline}** (1969) **[argues
that inter-service rivalry plays a determining role in weapons
acquisitions and Amer- ican interventions abroad]{.underline}**.8
**[Senator Fullbright]{.underline}** (1970) **[castigates senior
officers and Defense Department offi- cials for brainwashing the
American public into acceptance of Cold War and militaristic
values]{.underline}**. **[Similarly focus- ing on the armed forces as
the major agents of the military-industrial com- plex are those accounts
dealing with the military\'s dominance in setting na- tional
priorities]{.underline}** (Rodberg and Shearer, 1970; Gottlieb, 1971),
**[and revelations of military waste and collusion between high-ranking
officers and armaments manufacturers]{.underline}** (Proxmire, 1970;
Tyrell, 1970; York, 1970; Kaufman, 1972).9

**[Running through the arguments of the military determinists is the
belief that the senior command structure of the armed forces has been
slipping out from under civilian control]{.underline}**. **[The em-
phasis from this perspective on the military-industrial complex is
definitely on the military]{.underline}**.10 **[Advocates of this
viewpoint usually reflect the sentiment that once the armed forces are
returned to their proper-and much reduced]{.underline}**\-- **[role the
American system will right itself]{.underline}**. In their own fashion,
then, **[the military determinists have turned Marxian analysis inside
out]{.underline}**\-\--**[control of the means of destruction has come
to determine the nature of the means of production in American
society]{.underline}**.

**[The Administrative Bureaucracy]{.underline}**.

Deriving almost directly from neo- Machiavellian and Weberian anteced-
ents via the \"garrison state,\" the \"man- agerial revolution,\" and
the \"power elite\" is that literature on the military- industrial
complex which sees the causal factor vested in an autonomous bureaucracy
of non-elected adminis- trators and advisors. As in all elitist
analysis, there is the crucial notion that real power resides in other
than the formal decision-making processes and is even independent of
property rela- tionships.

[One of the most closely detailed and persuasive articulations of this
view- point is found in Pentagon Capitalism by Melman]{.underline}
(1970). **[Briefly, Melman\'s thesis is that the military-industrial
complex of the Eisenhower era has been supplanted by a \"state-manage-
ment\" decision system introduced by Secretary of Defense McNamara in
the early 1960s]{.underline}**. **[He argues that the mili-
tary-industrial firm is no longer a pri- vate firm, in that corporate
decisions are now in the hands of government managers]{.underline}**.
\"**[The state management has also become the most powerful deci-
sion-making unit in the United States government. Thereby, the federal
gov- ernment does not \'serve\' business or \'regulate\' business. For
the new man- agement is the largest of them all. Government is business.
That is state capitalism]{.underline}**\" (Melman, 1970:22). Sig-
nificantly, defense strategy has become a means to an end, the end being
greater domestic power and influence. For Melman, then, the primary
goals of the Defense Department are the expansion of its own power
within American society.11

**[A common corollary of administra- tive bureaucratic determinism is to
por- tray governmental elites as propelled by an \"institutionalized
power lust\"]{.underline}** (Melman, 1970:4), **[or \"executive ego-
ism\"]{.underline}** (Horowitz, 1971:38), **[or \"bu- reaucratic
machismo\"]{.underline}** (Barnet, 1971: 55). The sense of this
interpretation is captured in the title of Chomsky\'s American Power and
the New Man- darins (1967). **[The absence of class analysis in this
train of thought is mani- fest when Horowitz]{.underline}** (1971:38)
**[reviews The Pentagon Papers, not in terms of a military-industrial
complex dominated by economic oligarchs, nor even in terms of a triadic
power elite, but by specifying a ruling group in American society as a
\"non-elected political elite.\"]{.underline}**12 Adopting virtually the
same non-class interpretation of how the United States entered the
Vietnam War is Halberstram\'s The Best and the Brightest (1972).
**[Carrying this mode of analysis one step further,
Tucker]{.underline}** (1971) **[describes the compulsion for imperialist
America as the quest for power itself and not because of any internal
capitalist dynamic]{.underline}**.

[Somewhat more involved is the pro- vocative thesis presented by Pilisuk
and Hayden]{.underline} (1971) that the value premises of American
elites are in fact not that much different from the mass of the
population. \"**[Our concept is not that American society contains a
ruling mili- tary-industrial complex. Our concept is more nearly that
American society is a military-industrial complex]{.underline}**\"
(Pilusuk and Hayden, 1971:99). [All strata of the population, that is,
share to some degree a common set of cold-war-coun- ter-revolutionary
\"core beliefs.\" For Pilisuk and Hayden, then, precisely be- cause of
the general acceptance of these core beliefs, it is not necessary to in-
voke either a class analysis or notions of domestic repression to
understand the dominance of the military-industrial
complex]{.underline}. Likewise, [Hoffman]{.underline} (1972),
[presenting an anarchist viewpoint, con- cludes that the prevalence of
militaris- tic values results not so much because of elite manipulation,
but more im- portantly, because of a genuine belief on the part of the
American public in the naturalness and necessity of a huge military
establishment]{.underline}.13 **[Or put in another way, the militaristic
administra- tive bureaucracy has come to be co- terminous with American
society]{.underline}**.

**[Corporate Wealth]{.underline}**. **[Contrasting with both those who
emphasize military dominance or administrative bureau- crats is the
Marxian perspective, which interprets American society in terms of class
structure and capital ownership]{.underline}**. **[In Marxian
analysis]{.underline}** (e.g., DuBoff, 1969; Balbus, 1971; Ross, 1971),
**[therefore, military determinism is only a misguided scapegoating of a
super- structural entity; while administrative determinism erroneously
reverses the independent-dependent nexus between government officials
and corporate wealth]{.underline}**. **[Indeed, the whole concept of a
military-industrial complex without fundamental revision is incompatible
with a Marxian framework]{.underline}**, as was also the earlier case
with Mills\' thesis of a power elite.14

**[Baran and Sweezy, in their influen- tial Monopoly
Capital]{.underline}** (1966), **[make the central point that the huge
Ameri- can military machine serves the capital- ist purposes of
maintaining prosperity at home while fighting socialism
abroad]{.underline}**.15 **[More directly, Horowitz]{.underline}**
(1970:11) **[eschews notions of adminis- trative or military
determinancies and states]{.underline}**: \"**[The locus of power and
interest \[of the ruling class\] is the giant cor- porations and
financial institutions which dominate the American econ- omy, and
moreover, the economy of the entire Western world]{.underline}**.\"
**[Kolko]{.underline}** (1969; 1970) **[likewise has presented an inter-
pretation of American domestic and foreign policies being clearly
dominated by a corporate economic elite]{.underline}**. In fact, Kolko
(1971:43) benignly describes the American military as \"docile\" and
\"unquestionably among the most re- strained of those in power.\"16

[One of the striking features of recent American historiography has been
the emergence of a \"revisionist\" interpre- tation of America\'s global
role since the Second World War.]{.underline} **[Generally operating
within a Marxian paradigm, revisionist writers have placed prime
culpability on the United States for the origins of the Cold War and,
later, counter-revolutionary interventionism with regard to Third World
countries]{.underline}** (Horowitz, 1965, LaFeber, 1967; Kolko, 1969;
Alperovitz, 1970; Wil- liams, 1970). Despite some differences between
the various revisionist ac- counts, **[they all seek to demonstrate how
the corporate economic elite con- trols those aspects of the
governmental and military machinery essential to capital
interests]{.underline}**. **[There is a consistent theme among the
revisionists which sees the military-industrial complex as
epiphenomenal; and which regards the bureaucracy of the armed forces and
government as playing a minor part in American Cold War and imperialist
decision making]{.underline}**. Thus, the dean of revisionist
historians, **[Williams]{.underline}** (1970), **[sees the Cold War
greatly antedating the military-industrial complex and traces its
origins to the nature of the integral expansion of capitalist society in
America]{.underline}**.\'7 Indeed, Williams (1971:3) has written in a
related con- text that \". . . **[the cold war actually be- gan with the
triumph of laissez-faire capitalism over the more organic po- litical
economy of mercantilism, and can be dated by the publication of Adam
Smith\'s Wealth of Nations in 1776]{.underline}**.\"\[!\]

However, emphasis on the determin- ing role of the corporate rich in
shaping basic cold-war-defense expenditures is not exclusively a Marxist
perog- ative.18 Adopting an essentially non- Marxist but critical
framework are several studies which also conclude that an aristocratic
economic elite sets the fundamental politics of America\'s defense
establishment. Thus, Domhoff (1967) surveys the American power structure
and shows how the upper class controls the executive branch of the
federal government.19 Lundberg (1968) holds that the military hier-
archy, governmental leaders, and cor- porate managers are little more
than handmaidens of the \"super-rich.\" In fact, Lundberg (1968:543-553,
950- 954) frontally attacks Mills\' concept of a power elite-and by
implication, the concept of a military-industrial com- plex-which is
scathingly dismissed as a restatement of the managerial revo- lution
thesis. For Lundberg the signifi- cant units of power in the United
States have always been-and still firmly re- main-wealthy families.20

CONCLUSION

[**The purpose of this article has not been to offer an evaluation of
the ex- planatory veracity or empirical mani- festations of the concept
of the mili- tary-industrial complex**. As reflected in the attendant
bibliography, this task has already engaged numerous
writers]{.underline}. **[Our task here has been a quite different
one-namely to demonstrate the com- monalities between the
military-indus- trial complex literature and the devel- opment of
Western bourgeois social science]{.underline}**.21

The relevant literature, moreover, could be readily appraised in terms
of categories derived from the prime de- terminants imputed to diverse
national decision-making sectors. Thus, **[those who stress the primacy
of the adminis- trative bureaucracy in its various forms continue a long
tradition of channeling causal analysis of society-wide power away from
class and stratification con- siderations]{.underline}**. **[In this
perspective, the con- cept of the military-industrial complex becomes in
effect another reformula- tion of the managerial revolution hy-
pothesis]{.underline}**. **[Coming at the issue from a different vantage
point, but with paral- lel consequences, are the arguments of those who
stress the paramountcy of the military hierarchy. Indeed, in their own
fashion, the military determinists have turned Marxian analysis inside
out; control of the means of destruction has come to determine the
nature of the means of production]{.underline}**. **[It follows there-
fore that those researchers who give prime determinancy to corporate
wealth in the national power structure have consistently found
themselves uneasy]{.underline}**\-- **[if not at
odds]{.underline}**-**[with the contemporary concept of the
military-industrial com- plex as well as its theoretical antece-
dents]{.underline}**.

[Anthropogenic climate change is altering and disrupting food production
systems globally]{.underline} (Arnell et al, 2019). With high
confidence, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
asserts: "Observed climate change is already affecting food security
through increasing temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and
greater frequency of some extreme events" (Mbow et al., 2019: 439).
**[Climate change presents numerous challenges to achieving equity
within food production systems]{.underline}**---[**smallholder farmers,
historically marginalized** **populations, and those regarded as
vulnerable by climate intelligentsia bear a disproportionate burden of
impacts**]{.underline} (Mbow et al., 2019: 439; IPCC, 2014).

Increasingly, **[climate crisis discourses are being framed through the
lens of securitization]{.underline}** (Grove, 2010, King and Goodman,
2011, Parenti, 2012), **[wherein the vulnerability of the vulnerable is
used to justify further surveillance and militaristic
interventions]{.underline}** (Thomas and Warner, 2019). **[Food
insecurity and disruptions in food production related to climate change
are also being framed through similar securitization
discourses]{.underline}** (Karlsson et al., 2018, McDonagh, 2014).
**[Climate-food discourses frequently fuse with neo-Malthusian
discourses that scapegoat the growing human population in the global
South as threatening future food supplies for a planetary population of
9 billion in 2050]{.underline}** (Fouilleux et al., 2017, Ojeda et al.,
2020, Shaw and Wilson, 2020). From this grounding, climate-related food
security discourses establish the imperative of increasing agricultural
productivity for securing human well-being (McDonagh, 2014, Fouilleux et
al., 2017, Nally, 2011).

**[Under the aegis of population vulnerability, securitization provides
a useful pretext for the vast dissemination of new capital-intensive
technologies that seek to 'modernize' agrarian production
systems]{.underline}** (Stock, 2020, Dryzek, 2013). Undoubtedly the
world's foremost authority on global ecological change, the IPCC has
become a vocal advocate for climate-responsive technological innovations
in agriculture: "Many \[agricultural\] practices can be optimised and
scaled up to advance adaptation throughout the food system (high
confidence)" (Mbow et al., 2019: 439). **[Ranging from biotechnology to
artificial intelligence, numerous innovations in agriculture are
currently being developed and implemented under the broad umbrella of
'climate-smart agriculture' that seek to facilitate a 'triple-win' of
establishing food security, mitigating greenhouse gases and enhancing
the adaptive capacity of farming communities]{.underline}** (Suckall et
al, 2014). **[However, many observers contend that 'smart' interventions
promoted by authoritative institutions]{.underline}** (e.g. UN Food and
Agriculture Organization, Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture)
**[are inadequate 'techno-managerial fixes' to the political causes of
food insecurity that may exacerbate social inequalities]{.underline}**
(Nightingale et al., 2019, Karlsson et al., 2018, Taylor, 2018, Cavanagh
et al., 2017).

1.1. **[Precision agriculture]{.underline}**

Improving agricultural yields as a response to the looming climate
crisis is a matter of global human welfare of great geopolitical
importance. People and their production systems have become central
objects for political management. For example, John Deere fits new
tractors with sensors that passively mine field-level data about soil
and crop conditions and then invites farmers (through subscription fees)
to benefit from decision support systems (DSS) that can help inform
their decisions about when to plant, spray and harvest (Bronson and
Knezevic 2019). **[Within these logics, paramount to the practice of
agricultural optimization for food security is collecting and processing
data from all aspects of the food production system to ensure precision
in the targeting of interventions, the application of inputs, tracking
the outputs, and recording patterns of human, plant, and animal
behavior. Such technologies, broadly referred to as precision
agriculture]{.underline}** (**[PA]{.underline}**), **[are data-driven
agricultural technologies that use localized farm data at the
appropriate time and location to make 'precise' farming management
decisions]{.underline}** (Rossel and Bouma, 2016, Driessen and Heutinck,
2015, Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer, 2004, Cox, 2002). PA or "farming
by the foot" is largely made possible through the processing of big data
or high-volume, high-velocity, multisource agriculture data (e.g. crop
yields, digital soil information, reflectance information, elevation
data) (Shannon et al., 2018, Clay et al., 2017, Vallentin et al.,
2019**[). Technologies associated with PA are quite diverse, including
but not limited to: yield monitors]{.underline}** (Fig. 1), **[soil and
water sensors, GPS units for self-driving tractors, robotic milking
machines, drones]{.underline}** (Fig. 2) **[and blockchain
technologies]{.underline}**. **[PA is also being integrated with
technologies of artificial intelligence under the auspices of 'smart'
agriculture]{.underline}**. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be defined
as present wherever machines can exhibit some level of intelligence
(Russell and Norvig 2016; Smith, 2020). [Through AI, PA is envisioned to
be "delivering real value" to farmers]{.underline} (Smith, 2020) [and
steering society toward the "fourth industrial revolution" or
agriculture 4.0]{.underline} (Lele and Goswami, 2017). With help from
satellites, drones, sensors and machine learning algorithms, PA
technologies are helping farmers make various decisions by integrating
information technology into farm machinery and management (Rossel and
Bouma, 2016, Driessen and Heutinck, 2015, Bongiovanni and
Lowenberg-Deboer, 2004, Cox, 2002). For example, the adoption of
Microsoft's Cortana Intelligence Suite is helping farmers find optimal
planting dates for crops in India and Colombia (López and Corrales
2018), drones are being used by farm managers to scout and remove weeds
from fields (Lottes et al., 2017, Fennimore, 2017), and automated
systems are milking cows in the dairy industry (Dreissen and Heutinck,
2015). Agritech firms increasingly position themselves as purveyors of
technologies that respond to the climate crisis, yet market their
products to farmers as solutions to challenges of falling profitability
and biosecurity (John Deere, 2020). PA systems may increase farm
profitability while ostensibly reducing negative impacts on the
environment (Rossel and Bouma, 2016, Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-Deboer,
2004, Banerjee et al., 2013; Smith, 2020). At the same time, **[the
mechanisms of PA]{.underline}** (e.g. data collection, infrastructures,
data sharing, algorithms) **[present social and ethical issues such as
potential privacy breaches or access and trust issues among farmers and
other actors in the food system]{.underline}** (Jakku et al. 2019).
[Recent social science research provides relief to uncertainties
surrounding the social dimensions of PA, and specifically to big data
applications for agriculture]{.underline} (Gardezi and Stock, 2021,
Klerkx et al., 2019, Rotz et al., 2019a, Bronson and Knezevic, 2019).
For example, Gardezi and Bronson (2019) explore the social determinants
of farmers adopting PA technologies and their perceptions of biophysical
risk associated with the new food production system. We build on this
extant literature by situating the power relations between food system
actors and institutions within a larger political economy of industrial
agriculture and ask the following research question: What are the
sociopolitical effects of big data gathered from 'smart' agriculture
interventions of farmers in South Dakota and Vermont? In the next
section, we provide texture to this question by examining the uses and
effects of PA, a new paradigm of capital-intensive industrial
agriculture that integrates digital technologies to improve crop yields
and manage populations.

1.2. **[Capital accumulation by data dispossession]{.underline}**

"...computing and the rise of big data are not only implicated in new
ways of living and being in the world, but also generate new
'industrial' landscapes of computing where flows of resources (energy
and water), the presence (or absence) of connective infrastructure, and
economic growth and livelihood provisioning are entangled in highly
uneven development processes that collapse urban/rural and
social/natural dichotomies" (Pickren, 2018: 238).

**[Producing a windfall of highly-valued big data, PA is an ecological
modernization and accumulation strategy par excellence]{.underline}**.
[Users of agricultural tech providers' technologies and software are
generating torrential volumes of data on the food production system and
their own consumer preferences and behaviors. Farmers sign user
agreements, consenting for their data to be utilized by agritech
firms]{.underline}. **[Tech providers harvest this data to "inform
innovations and direct strategic investment," accumulating capital and
information in the process]{.underline}** (Fraser, 2019: 895). **[The
data generated is privatized by the agricultural tech providers,
protected through intellectual property rights law and users do not own
nor are able to control this data]{.underline}** (Rotz et al., 2019a,
Carolan, 2017). Like architects of digital infrastructures in other
industries, such as social media and online retail, agritech's "formal
indifference and distance from 'users,' combined with its current
freedom from meaningful regulation, sanction, or law, buffer it and
other surveillance capitalists from the consequences of mistrust...the
coup des gens introduces substantial new asymmetries of knowledge and
power" (Zuboff, 2015: 83).

**[PA presents an unparalleled opportunity for agritech firms to engage
in what some observers have called data grabbing, the dispossession of
producers' quantified and monetized digital information generated in
stealth through their use of the technologies]{.underline}** (Fraser,
2019). **[Discursively framed as a 'smart' securitization of food
systems affected by anthropogenic climate change, data grabbing for PA
can be thought of as an iteration of green grabbing, dispossession in
the name of sustainable development]{.underline}** (Fairhead et al,
2012; Stock and Birkenholtz, 2019). **[Users of these agricultural
technologies lose control of their data by way of agreeing to Byzantine
user agreements that legally represent their abdication of
privacy]{.underline}** (Thatcher et al., 2016, Rotz et al., 2019a).
[Firms then construct digital profiles of each
user]{.underline}---subjected to algorithmic entanglement and analysis
by computational models---[and then aggregate user profiles as commodity
bundles for sale, grist for the advertising mill]{.underline} (Fraser,
2019). "**[In PA, acting, thinking, and doing are themselves subject to
commodification via datafication]{.underline}**" (Miles, 2019: 7).
Advertisements for new products, related digital content, or upgrades to
existing digital software produce yet more data from the original data
generated (Fraser, 2020), a lucrative simulacrum of agrarian 'reality'
(Beaudrillard, 1994).

**[New digital technologies are becoming ubiquitous interfaces of social
participation within food production systems]{.underline}** (Klerkx et
al, 2019). **[PA is an experiment in corporate social
engineering]{.underline}** (Bronson and Knezevic, 2019), insofar as the
preferences, habits and actions of users are digitally monitored and
utilized to influence their behaviors within a food production system
(Gardezi and Stock, 2021, Miles, 2019, Carolan, 2019). [The repeated use
of these technologies engenders a social dependency of users who "get
something in return" for their generation of data]{.underline} (Fraser,
2019). These users are influenced by the technologies through targeted
advertisements, services and prompts within the platform. [Users become
subjects of a powerful algorithmic rationality of
agriculture]{.underline} (Miles, 2019)---[part of an "emergence of
social identities that are shaped by the adoption of PA
itself]{.underline}" (Gardezi and Bronson, 2019: 16-17)---[many of whom
internalize the new logics of accumulation and modify their actions to
fulfill the policies and ambitions of the agricultural tech
providers]{.underline} (Gardezi and Stock, 2021, Fraser, 2019, Carolan,
2019; see Pickren, 2018), a process Foucault calls governmentality
(Foucault, 1991). Recent studies in political ecology and cognate
disciplines have extended the concept of governmentality to analyze
subjectivities within the politics of the environment (see Cavanagh,
2018, Moulton and Popke, 2017, Birkenholtz, 2009). This study reveals
that many PA users can exhibit a range of agri-algorithmic
subjectivities. [The subjectification of users to PA infrastructures
(devices and digitalia) is part of a longer genealogy of
capital-intensive technological interventions that transform the
political economy of food production systems and the livelihoods of
producers]{.underline}.

1.3. Back to the future of food: Precision agriculture in the longue
durée

"By the year 2050, U.S. growers will need to reach an impressive level
of food production to help feed a growing world population. Fewer in
number, they will operate multifaceted businesses with stunning new
technology to increase efficiency on farms" (Syngenta, 2017a).

[Agritech corporations temporally position their technologies as 'smart'
and 'innovative' solutions to future crises of food
security]{.underline} (Syngenta, 2017b). Discourses of ecological
modernization are reproduced by development agencies that regard PA as
"the future of food" (World Bank, 2019). **[Yet PA's future can be
situated within a genealogy of capital-intensive accumulation strategies
in agriculture]{.underline}**. Miles (2019: 6) provides this useful
historicization: "**[PA represents to the present what farm management,
mechanization, hybridization and artificial inputs represented to the
past: a movement to further transform objects (and now activities) into
discrete commodities, to extend the reach of capital, and to accumulate
entire new geographies of possibility to the market's
logic]{.underline}**." **[Industrial agriculture's 'digital turn' claims
to provide a nimble socioecological fix to internal contradictions
within capitalism that produce distinct crises of ecological degradation
through production processes]{.underline}** (e.g. climate change),
**[while availing new investment opportunities for overaccumulated
capital in the present and far into the future]{.underline}** (Ekers and
Prudham, 2015, Harvey, 1982). The data harvested now by PA will inform
agritech's research and development efforts for years and decades to
come, extending horizons of profitability by enclosing data, software
and hardware as intellectual property.

Yet situating PA within a punctuated historicization of agrarian crises
is disingenuous, insofar as these historically specific and contingent
crises are sustained and temporarily resolved by firms. **[Capitalism
adapts to long periods of crisis through restructuring the relations of
production]{.underline}** (Braudel, 1982). **[From this vantage point,
it becomes necessary to jettison the misleading 'agriculture 4.0′
moniker]{.underline}** (Lele and Goswami, 2017). **[Accumulation cycles
within capitalism's longue durée transform agrarian
spaces]{.underline}** (Arrighi, 1994), **[often through technological
innovation that seeks to 'modernize' production]{.underline}**. Hence,
agritech's assemblage of digital infrastructures must be situated within
the 'long' Green Revolution (Patel, 2013)---characterized by
agricultural innovations (e.g. mechanization, high-yield varieties,
chemical inputs, biotechnology, financialization). [Within the Green
Revolution's present accumulation cycle in the longue durée of
capitalism, PA effectively resuscitates the dominant Borlaugian telos of
securing production through securing profit]{.underline}. Further, PA
presents a novel problematique of the classic agrarian question,
concerned with capitalism's transformation of the countryside and the
role of agriculture in capitalism's development (Kautsky, 1988,
Akram-Lodhi and Kay, 2010a). **[Through PA, agritech can establish new
cyberspace frontiers to ensure the further penetration of capital into
rural spaces unfettered by temporal limitations, reconfiguring labor
arrangements in the process]{.underline}**. "**[Farm consolidation will
drive the need for more outside labor]{.underline}**. **[Expect
high-tech solutions like robotics to come to the rescue]{.underline}**"
(Syngenta, 2017a). The circuits of PA capital are rewiring farm work.
Although agritech's future ambitions of labor displacement have been
disclosed, the impacts upon and affectations of producers in the present
remain unclear. **[PA systems add urgency to examinations of the
agrarian question of labor, centering the survival strategies and
politics of producers in capitalism's sustained crises and agrarian
transformations]{.underline}** (Bernstein, 2004, Akram-Lodhi and Kay,
2010b, Levien et al., 2018, Stock and Birkenholtz, 2019). This study
will explore how the power of agritech capital is operationalized
through the surveillance of data grabbed from producers who are
threatened with proletarianization by PA.

1.4. **[Precision agriculture as biopolitics of surveillance
capitalism]{.underline}**

[PA can be situated within a new logic of accumulation based in the
commodification of personal data through digital interfaces]{.underline}
(Fraser, 2019). **[PA is able to penetrate deeper into the
personalization of agricultural management by accumulating, surveilling
and curating data harvested from farm and farmer at little cost ad
infinitum]{.underline}** (Fraser, 2020, Miles, 2019). As opposed to
earlier technological interventions within food production systems led
mainly by the public sector or philanthropic institutions (Hetherington,
2020, Nally, 2011, McMichael, 2009), **[PA is driven by agribusiness
corporations]{.underline}** (e.g. John Deere, Monsanto) **[assisted by
state actors and institutions]{.underline}** (e.g. USDA) **[that serve
as development brokers of agribusiness capital]{.underline}** (Fraser,
2019, Carolan, 2017; see Levien, 2018). **[Surveillance of data by
agritech enables the sustained regularization of agriculture to
corporate interests far into the future]{.underline}**. Zuboff (2015:
75) defines surveillance capitalism as a "new form of information
capitalism \[which\] aims to predict and modify human behavior as a
means to produce revenue and market control" (see also Zuboff, 2019).
**[By wielding the ability to commodify the personal
data-points]{.underline}** (isolated and aggregated) **[from farmers as
a means to accumulate capital and influence their behaviors, PA opens a
new agrarian frontier for surveillance capitalism]{.underline}**.

**[Profitable surveillance through PA en masse represents a seismic
shift in the power to manage life itself]{.underline}**. In the context
of global environmental change, **[neoliberal states can exercise
biopower on entire populations through agritech firms, "a power that
exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to administer,
optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and
comprehensive regulations]{.underline}**" (Foucault, 1978: 137). Prior
to liberal capitalism, a sovereign state wielded the ability to take
life and let live for the ostensible vitality of the polity
(Machiavelli, 2013). Alternatively, **[biopower marks liberal
capitalism's shift to a "make live and let die" calculation that asserts
itself to manage population wellbeing through various mechanisms, such
as]{.underline}** (inter alia) **[statistics, demography, public health
infrastructures and development schemes]{.underline}** (Foucault, 2003).
Against the backdrop of agrarian transformation in rural Indonesia,
Tania Li (2010: 67) argues: "Make live interventions become urgent when
people can no longer sustain their own lives through direct access to
the means of production, or access to a living wage."

**[PA, an assemblage discursively articulated as a clever gambit against
climate-induced future food insecurity, can be seen as a mechanism
through which the regulation of life and the management
of]{.underline}** (**[more-than-human]{.underline}**) **[populations is
exercised by agritech firms]{.underline}**. Specifically, **[the
neoliberal state erects the statutory architecture necessary for
agritech's capital accumulation by data dispossession]{.underline}**.
**[Regulatory frameworks are congealing but remain out of step with the
rapidly advancing PA technologies, much to the chagrin of
agritech]{.underline}**: "[Many new machines are currently equipped with
the electronics to control operations with very little human
interaction. However, the legal and regulatory issues surrounding robots
must be bridged first]{.underline}" (Syngenta, 2017a). **[PA is a form
of biopolitics through which the neoliberal state enables agritech firms
to scientifically manage populations in a food production
system]{.underline}**---**[including human producers, companion crops,
pests and weeds]{.underline}**---**[as objects to study, improve and
protect]{.underline}** (Carolan, 2017, Nally, 2011). For an example of
biopolitics in agriculture, Hetherington (2020) explores the
biopolitical techniques of managing plant health to expand monocrop
agriculture in the US and Europe and later exported to the global South
during the period of the second Green Revolution (see Jasanoff, 2019).

We assert that the generation and capture of agricultural big data
becomes a biopolitical calculation of "make bloom and let wither."
[More-than-human populations are entangled with capital-intensive
devices of digital agriculture, deployed to "make bloom" certain
monoculture crops and "let wither" other plant species]{.underline} (see
Bronson 2020**[). Further, the biopolitical management of agricultural
production systems is unevenly deployed throughout the planet's agrarian
spaces]{.underline}** (Hetherington, 2020, Fraser, 2019). **[Research
shows that the high cost of many AI-based PA technologies is a known
barrier to adoption among farmers]{.underline}** (Gardezi and Bronson,
2019, Reichardt and Jürgens, 2009), **[which disproportionately affects
smaller operations that are already more vulnerable to financial
risk]{.underline}**. Agricultural tech companies develop the software
and devices with data selection methods that establish algorithmic
biases for largeholding farmers with a 'productivist' strategy growing
cash crops across vast acreage, enabling novel opportunities for elite
capture (Bronson and Knezevic, 2019). [The reverse outcome of a
biopolitical mechanism designed to "make live by making bloom" unfolds
for users disadvantaged by algorithmic biases or intellectual property
rights]{.underline} (Carolan, 2017, Bronson and Knezevic, 2019**[).
Through blocked access or bias, a fate of "let die by letting wither"
may transpire because "their \[agrarian\] labour is surplus in relation
to its utility for capital"]{.underline}** (Li, 2010: 68).
**[Ironically, such widespread withering would exacerbate the world's
marginal producers' vulnerabilities to climate-related food
insecurities]{.underline}** (Turhan et al, 2015). Controlling our
interactions with nature through the uneven subjectification and
commodification of life through digital abstraction and valuation
becomes an existential imperative to secure the food supply against the
crisis of climate change; **[PA can maximize capital accumulation and
sustain geopolitical power relations in perpetuity through food
production systems. Hence, biopower for the biosphere]{.underline}**.

[The nature of world production has changed as a result of the
widespread adoption of global supply chain solutions]{.underline}. **[It
has helped corporations to position themselves as constructive citizens;
as CSR has increased their authority and legitimacy as governance
actors, companies have increasingly been embraced as the solution to
problems like modern slavery and ecosystem depletion, rather than the
cause of these problems]{.underline}**. **[Alongside the explosion of
supply chain solutions, multinational corporations have vastly increased
their size, market share, and control over the global
economy]{.underline}** (Khan, 2017; Petry et al., 2021). **[Corporations
are using this power to shape solutions in their own financial
interests]{.underline}** -- **[ultimately, becoming richer and even more
difficult to govern]{.underline}**.

At the same time, **[global supply chain solutions are distracting from
other key shifts; for instance, fair labour initiatives can distract
from changes in the union density of a workforce, commercial dynamics
that all but ensure suppliers cannot pay minimum wage, or from
outsourcing practices well-documented to introduce forced labour into
supply chains]{.underline}**. Thus, notwithstanding the gains that could
be made through individual supply chain solutions, t[here is cause for
concern that the ascendance of global supply chain solutions comes with
hidden costs relevant to a whole range of issues in IPE, from market
volatility and economic instability of financialization and changing
patterns of corporate ownership, investment and market
speculation]{.underline} (Clapp, 2018, 2019) [to the rise of artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (Dauvergne, 2020).

By demonstrating that global supply chain solutions come with hidden
costs that are often missed, [we aim in this special issue to contribute
to theoretical and empirical understandings of the limits of dominant
forms of supply chain governance]{.underline}. Specifically, **[the
issue sheds light into where and how the perverse outcome effects of
global supply chain solutions occur and why]{.underline}**. **[It
consolidates evidence that while supply chain solutions may make gains
in some issue areas, the net effectiveness of private governance as a
solution to resolving the environmental and social risks and problems
introduced by a self-regulatory, efficiency-driven model of global
production appears to be limited]{.underline}** (Dauvergne, 2020; Le
Billon & Spiegel 2021; Ponte, 2020).

**[We also highlight the broader changes being spurred in the global
production system and across various supply chains through the rise and
proliferation of global supply chain solutions]{.underline}**. As
mentioned, **[our literature review finds little cause for optimism that
the rise and proliferation of global supply chain solutions is making
meaningful progress towards solving problems like global biodiversity
loss and labour abuse]{.underline}** (Observation 1). **[Yet, we see
ample evidence that global supply chain solutions are not passively
ineffective. Rather]{.underline}**, as the articles by Ponte, Cutler &
Lark, Fridell, and Dauvergne all illustrate in different ways, **[global
production has entered a qualitatively different era as a result of the
widespread adoption of private governance. Corporations have gained
favour with governments and many NGOs as 'champion' citizens leading
innovative, voluntary problem-solving CSR projects and
initiatives]{.underline}**. **[Yet, they are ultimately using this new
reputational capital and authority to strategically shape rules and
solutions in their own favour to guard the business status quo and
expand their profitability and control]{.underline}**.

Several articles within this special issue underscore and analyse these
dynamics. [Le Billon & Spiegel provide a rich comparative case analysis
of the benefits and micro- and meso-level hidden costs of three types of
solutions to eliminate conflict minerals, showing that the benefits
legitimate corporate extractive communities while hiding the local costs
to poor and marginalised workers]{.underline}. Through an analysis of
corporate power and captured value in the global wine and coffee
sectors, [Ponte shows how the global supply chain 'solution' of
environmental upgrading results in beneficial profits to large
downstream lead firms while pushing the risk and compliance costs onto
small upstream producers causing hidden environmental
consequences]{.underline}. And [Cutler and Lark demonstrate the
privatised legal regime that has accompanied and facilitated the rise of
global supply chain solutions has given corporations a new arena to
exert power and evade public knowledge or scrutiny, through the rise of
private arbitration solutions]{.underline}. **[In all of these cases,
global supply chain solutions are clearly advantageous for
business]{.underline}** -- **[advancing corporate power and financial
goals]{.underline}**. **[Yet, their benefits to environment and labour
interests are uncertain and in many cases they are
compromising]{.underline}**.

**[The special issue highlights that the rise and proliferation of
supply chain solutions is playing an important, yet under-discussed,
role in stabilizing, legitimating, and reproducing contemporary
capitalism]{.underline}** (Dauvergne & LeBaron, 2014). In this sense,
**[it is unsurprising that the actors working to conceal their hidden
costs like corporations and consultants are doing so; indeed, many
actors doing the 'hiding' have vested normative interests in assuaging
societal and policymaker concerns while continuing to profit from
exploitative business models]{.underline}**. As mentioned, **[while many
global supply chain solutions have done little to nothing to transform
labour or environmental practices]{.underline}** (see Supplementary
Material), **[they allow consumers, activists, and policymakers to
believe they are doing good and that it is possible to live ethically
and resolve social and environmental problems through market behaviour
and consumerism]{.underline}**. **[While the proliferation of supply
chain solutions hasn't necessarily transformed the dynamics of
production premised upon patterns such as poverty wages, gender-based
violence, and environmental destruction, it has diverted energy and
desires for a better world that in earlier eras of capitalism were
targeted into contesting markets and capitalism, and incorporated these
into markets themselves]{.underline}**.

**[Such initiatives have also helped corporations to obtain social and
political license to grow and take on a key role as central organizers
of global economic activity.]{.underline}** As such, **[supply chain
solutions have contributed to pioneering new models of value and wealth
creation and distribution, which are concentrating wealth in the hands
of fewer and more powerful firms and individuals]{.underline}**. **[As
NGOs and civil society actors have endorsed and legitimized CSR, they
have increasingly sought to transform the world with and alongside
corporations, instead of by opposing corporations or calling for
restrictions on their activities]{.underline}**. The articles within
this SI document the role of CSR and supply chain solutions in
stabilizing and reproducing particular features of the contemporary
global capitalist order, and the complicated role of civil society and
NGOs within this.

For instance, **[Diprose et al. (2020) provide a strong in-depth
empirical account of how multi-stakeholder sustainable mineral solutions
in the tin sector play out on the ground in two major tin-producing
Indonesian islands]{.underline}**. The article highlights how local
conditions shape and explain the benefits and hidden costs of
transnational solutions, and the role of stakeholder groups in
delivering or undermining global supply chain solutions. In particular,
[the authors argue the importance of understanding resistance and the
hidden costs associated with failure to align solutions with local
political economies]{.underline}.

**[Dauvergne's article provides early warning of the hidden costs of a
major emerging technological force]{.underline}** -- **[artificial
intelligence (AI)]{.underline}** -- **[shaping supply chains and
sustainability solutions towards business interests within the global
political economy]{.underline}**. Drawing on the SI typologies, **[the
article highlights the importance of understanding the role and
interaction of corporate power and the state in the complex relationship
of micro firm-level benefits of AI solutions]{.underline}** (**[e.g.
clean energy and material efficiencies]{.underline}**) **[to larger
systemic macro-level hidden costs of AI to unsustainable
outcomes]{.underline}** (**[e.g. increased resource extraction and
consumption]{.underline}**).

[Finally, in addition to describing and analyzing the hidden costs of
global supply chain solutions, the contributions provide important
analysis about the inequalities hard-wired into supply chains
themselves, contributing to longstanding debates within
RIPE]{.underline} (cf. Anner, 2020; Selwyn et al., 2020). Fridell's
contribution to this volume documents the dynamics of wealth and value
creation associated with the banana supply chain and associated supply
chain solutions. [Through the compelling case of the astonishingly rapid
total collapse of the local banana economy in St. Vincent & the
Grenadines, he presents a critical challenge to dominant theoretical
lenses used to understand supply chains]{.underline} (Fridell, 2020).
**[He argues that these systematically overlook some of the same power
dynamics that global supply chain solutions and studies of them tend to
omit]{.underline}**. **[The theory]{.underline}**, he notes, **[is
overly static and]{.underline}** consequently, **[has an inherent bias
towards viewing economic integration as a beneficial
solution]{.underline}**. **[The reality]{.underline}**, he argues **[is
that there is a dynamic on-the-ground interplay of hidden costs over
time that includes exclusion and re-integration and that are borne by
local communities and governments not global companies]{.underline}**.

#### Supply chain "solutions" are false, rely on creating new forms of modern and child slavery, displace labor globally, and re-entrench legacies of colonialism and racism -- don't buy their "we solve those!" framing, it's the same logic (multinational corporations) MNC's use to gather profits while divesting the Global South in the name of "ethics"

In this article, and indeed, in the special issue of Review of
International Political Economy (RIPE) that we introduce within it,
**[we contend that the prevailing optimism surrounding global supply
chain solutions is demonstrably unwarranted]{.underline}**. First,
**[there is sparse and highly uneven evidence confirming the
effectiveness of such solutions in tackling social and environmental
problems]{.underline}**. **[But even more importantly, the dissection of
the governance of the global economy into disjointed, privately run,
largely unenforceable supply chain-based solutions in fact, generates
deeper costs: namely, the hidden cost that 'solutions' are entrenching
rather than transforming the underlying drivers of labour and
environmental problems and skewing perceptions of those problems and the
progress being made (or not) towards solving them]{.underline}**. **[The
consequence is assured governance failure as the very dynamics worsening
labour and environmental problems over the past several decades deepen,
not only unhindered by the explosion of supply chain solutions, but
actually enabled through them]{.underline}**.

**[The hidden costs of global supply chain solutions to workers,
communities and the planet]{.underline}** (and to achieving truly
effective governance mechanisms for their protection and welfare) **[are
a]{.underline}** ~~blind~~ **[spot \[of ignorance\] for large swathes of
scholarship on supply chain governance]{.underline}**. [Often, these lie
beyond the scope conditions of individual studies, or are obscured by
the metrics used to assess progress, which tend to mirror measures of
effectiveness defined within the solutions themselves]{.underline}.
While no doubt, not every study can be about everything at the same
time, [the consistent neglect of hidden costs within the literature
dedicated to global supply chain solutions is important for both
analytic and normative reasons]{.underline}. The contributions to this
RIPE special issue highlight the need to integrate investigations of
hidden costs and to widen the lens to so as to bring into view the dark
sides of the rise and reliance on supply chain solutions more broadly as
the key tool for governing the global production system.

We argue that **[the rise of global supply chain solutions has been
accompanied by three key types of hidden cost. First, individual supply
chain solutions come with hidden costs that play out from the
micro-level of individual companies and CSR initiatives. High-paid
consultants and NGOs develop solutions to address problems like child
labour or chemical waste in supply chains]{.underline}** -- usually of
one company, region or sector -- **[and then enforce them using private
tools like ethical audits]{.underline}** (Auld, 2014; Fransen, 2012;
Fransen & Burgoon, 2012). Social auditors and NGOs commissioned by
companies write reports extoling the progress and benefits of projects
and programs, citing improvement across key performance indicators and
metrics. **[But these activities can serve to distract from the root
cause drivers, such as the high volume-low-cost business model, and can
displace problems beyond the scope of individual
solutions]{.underline}**. **[For instance, ethical auditing can have the
unintended consequence of reinforcing status quo commercial dynamics,
while driving new problems, such as pushing child or forced labour
deeper into the subtiers of global supply chains or prompting suppliers
to lay off workers as they seek to recover the costs of expensive
environmental certification]{.underline}** (LeBaron et al., 2017;
LeBaron & Lister, 2015). Indeed, **[supply chain solutions can lead to
improvements across one set of indicators but spur new problems beyond
the bounds of that initiative or set of metrics; for instance, an
initiative to eliminate child labour from cocoa production can
inadvertently increase it in artisanal mining, and environmental
initiatives can carry adverse social consequences and vice
versa]{.underline}**.

Second, **[global supply chain solutions come with underlying hidden
costs at the institutional meso-level]{.underline}**. [As multi-national
corporations (MNCs)]{.underline} -- [and the NGOs, consultants,
development finance institutions, international organisation bodies, and
others paid to help them as implementation partners]{.underline} --
[come together to tackle challenges, these efforts may come with
unacknowledged costs and unintended consequences for certain
stakeholders, municipalities and states, and populations, reinforcing
problems and crowding out potentially stronger direct regulatory
enforcement]{.underline}. **[For instance, with the support of the World
Bank, a large corporation might divest itself of plantations where
labour abuse is a known problem, championing the creation of a new
sustainable 'worker-shareholder' model, as Tata Group did through the
International Finance Corporation's equity investment of \$7.8 million
in Assam's tea sector a decade ago. Yet, while the World Bank and tea
companies at the top of supply chains extoll the benefits,
opportunities, and better lives enjoyed by tea communities as a result
of this project, workers and unions contend this 'solution' has
inadvertently stabilised and enabled business models configured around
forced labour, coerced vulnerable and impoverished workers into buying
shares without proper information about the risks of investment, and
reinforced a highly unequal development model grounded in colonialism
and racism]{.underline}** (LeBaron, 2018, 2020; see also Ponte, 2008).
**[Other examples of meso-level hidden costs include that industry-wide
CSR programs may: facilitate the erosion of state-based labour or
environmental inspection or support for state action]{.underline}**
(Bartley, 2018; Amengual & Bartley, forthcoming); **[chip away at state
sovereignty]{.underline}** (Constance & Bonanno, 2000; Vandergeest &
Unno, 2012); **[diminish public pressure for regulating firm behaviour
abroad]{.underline}** (Kolcava et al., 2021); **[hollow out support for
public assistance and welfare provisioning]{.underline}** (Burgoon &
Fransen, 2017); **[and 'managerialize' law enforcement such that
ineffective symbolic structures become associated with legal
compliance]{.underline}** (Monciardini et al., 2021). **[This regulatory
'crowding out' is often fuelled by governments, who enable and at times
even directly fund supply chain solutions, as they've whittled away
their own environmental and social standards regulation and enforcement
capacities and channel resources into voluntary market-based forms of
regulation]{.underline}**.

Finally, and most importantly, **[global supply chain solutions generate
macrolevel hidden costs. Namely, that global supply chain solutions fuel
the systemic problems they purport to correct by stabilizing,
distracting from, and leaving unchallenged dynamics that are driving
environmental and social damage in the first place]{.underline}**. For
instance, **[they charge corporate power and growth, reinforce a
regulatory paradigm that privileges the interests of business and the
wealthy, and stabilize the offshoring and outsourcing business models of
contemporary capitalism]{.underline}** (Milberg & Winkler, 2013; Peck,
2017; Soederberg, 2010; Urry, 2014). [As corporations, NGOs and IOs
proliferate solutions at the micro and meso-levels that are carefully
designed not to disrupt the status quo of business models and supply
chains]{.underline} ([whose commercial dynamics are hard-wired to take
advantage of social and environmental 'externalities']{.underline}),
**[supply chain solutions are actually entrenching and enabling systemic
drivers]{.underline}**. For instance, eco- solutions enhance the rising
power of big business and its capacity to destroy the planet (Dauvergne,
2016, 2018) while MSIs to address food security fuel perceptions that
brand companies control conditions within agricultural supply chains,
while distracting from the power actually accruing to financial actors
to pry open new arenas for accumulation (Clapp & Isakson, 2018).
**[Although the proliferation of supply chain solutions gives consumers,
the public, and policymakers the impression that social and
environmental problems are being addressed, more often than not, supply
chain solutions reinforce and legitimise rather than challenge
corporations]{.underline}**. As such, **[they are empowering the very
actors perpetrating large swathes of social and environmental
damage]{.underline}**.

As we discuss further below **[in relation to our review of 290 studies
of the effectiveness of global supply chain solutions, these solutions
often fall short even on their own terms because they almost never press
upon the features of supply chains that are well-documented to trigger
adverse consequences for environments, workers, and local
communities]{.underline}**. For instance, they do little to challenge
low retail prices made possible by MNCs sourcing below the costs of
production, which make it impossible for suppliers to pay their workers
minimum wage (Anner, 2020; Vaughan-Whitehead & Caro, 2017). **[Nor, do
these 'solutions' address power imbalances between MNCs and their
suppliers, which leave producers little scope to negotiate the
commercial conditions they need to meet social and environmental
standards]{.underline}** (Bartley, 2018; Fridell, 2007; LeBaron, 2020).
**[They certainly do not disrupt the trend of corporate consolidation
and monopolisation that continually lowers the floor for labour and
environmental standards across entire sectors]{.underline}** (Clapp,
2019; Khan, 2017). **[And only rarely do they meaningfully challenge the
forms of gender oppression and gender-based violence that are used to
subsidize profits]{.underline}** (Barrientos, 2019; Dunaway, 2014) **[or
ongoing colonial-era power relations of extractivism that bolster bottom
lines across several industries]{.underline}** (Banerjee, 2008; Bhambra,
2021). Indeed, **[global supply chain solutions almost never tackle the
root causes of social and environmental problems, such as: the mass
production, consumption, and disposal of cheap and low-quality goods;
the shareholder primacy model]{.underline}** (which puts pressure on
businesses to produce short-term gains for shareholders); **[or even
basic commercial dynamics like discount pricing and
outsourcing]{.underline}** (Murcia et al., 2021).

**[Our argument is not that supply chain solutions are completely
ineffective]{.underline}**. Indeed, as our literature review below makes
clear, **[some supply chain solutions have yielded incremental successes
and positive improvements. Rather, our point is that these small
successes can conceal and distract from the much larger costs and
trade-offs taking place at different scales, which in turn become harder
to analyse and measure amidst the proliferation of
solutions]{.underline}**. For instance, [the ethical audit regime is
facilitating corporate obfuscation of bad practices]{.underline}
(LeBaron & Lister, 2015), [fair trade certification is misleading
consumers about the prevalence and nature of forced labour]{.underline}
(LeBaron, 2020), [and corporate worker feedback technologies are
facilitating corporate obfuscation of worker abuse and exploitation,
while creating the impression amongst policymakers and consumers that
illegal practices are being addressed]{.underline} (Rende Taylor & Shih,
2019). Indeed, **[while some supply chain solutions are yielding
incremental successes, these do not cancel out the costs; however, this
fragmented mode and flurry of governance efforts makes it challenging
for scholars, consumers, and policymakers to see the full
picture]{.underline}**.

[By discussing hidden costs, we do not mean to suggest that global
environmental impacts and labour abuses]{.underline} -- or the forms of
global production, corporate and market regulation, and inequality that
give rise to them -- [are completely invisible or unanticipated.
Critical and international political economy (IPE) scholarship has a
well-developed literature probing the harms and dangers of corporate-led
governance]{.underline} (Clapp, 1998; Cutler et al., 1999; Hatanaka &
Busch, 2008; Mayer et al., 2017; Soederberg, 2010), much of which has
been published in previous issues of RIPE. **[However, the insights of
this literature have been largely overlooked within the vast body of
scholarship focused on studying global value chains and the
effectiveness of global supply chain solutions; these literatures often
overlook costs and focus narrowly on technical questions, including
evaluations of effectiveness that measure against the stated aims and
objectives of supply chain solutions and take these at face
value]{.underline}**. Indeed, there is an entire interdisciplinary
literature (anchored in business and management studies and also
encompassing research within the disciplines of political science,
management and business studies, geography, sociology, anthropology,
development studies, amongst others) dedicated to understanding the
effectiveness of global supply chain solutions, which has been largely
siloed from scholarship in IPE. The literature on global value,
commodity, and supply chains (cf. Bair, 2008; Gereffi et al., 2005;
Selwyn, 2019) that sits loosely within IPE is often insular, focused on
dynamics within firms and intrinsic to supply chains and overlooking the
broader structural and big-picture political economy dynamics, including
IPE debates about capitalism, corporate power and the governance of
these, and the role of supply chain solutions within such dynamics.

In this article and special issue, we provide a bridge between supply
chain scholarship and broader IPE literatures, such as on: wealth
creation, corporate ownership, and power (Babic et al., 2017; Clapp,
2018, 2019; Heemskerk & Takes, 2016; Seabrooke & Wigan, 2017; Strange,
1996); financialization and the failure of corporate governance (Admati,
2017); NGOs and their role in either propping up or disrupting
neoliberal economic policies and capitalism (Dauvergne & LeBaron, 2014;
Kamat, 2004); legitimacy and authority in non-state governance
(Bernstein, 2011; Brassett & Tsingou, 2011; Cutler, 2003; Keohane, 2011;
Strange, 1996); and expertise, and its impact on processes of policy
change (Hay, 2008; Hearson, 2018). [Our intuition is that global supply
chain solutions are playing a far more significant and constitutive role
in shaping the corporate-led global economy than is typically realised,
and that it is therefore an area that could benefit from research by IPE
scholars who haven't researched CSR or supply chain solutions in the
past]{.underline}.

Drawing on the critical and international political economy insights, we
analyse scholarship on the effectiveness of global supply chain
solutions and explain how the contributions to this SI take both
forward. As we describe in greater detail below, to this end, **[we
conducted a literature review in which we analysed and coded 290
academic journal articles that provide evidence about the effectiveness
of supply chain solutions in relation to social and environmental
problems. We found that across this literature, scholarship tends to
approach supply chain solutions at face value, rarely analysing the
broader dynamics or consequences associated with their
rise]{.underline}**. **[Yet]{.underline}**, as this special issue and
introduction point out, **[when global supply chain solutions are
studied in technocratic ways with narrow measures of effectiveness, the
full costs of supply chain solutions]{.underline}** -- **[to the public
good, to workers and to the planet]{.underline}** -- **[tend to be
hidden and obscured]{.underline}**.

## Framework

### 2NC -- Framework

#### Capitalism's chief weapon is constraint on political imagination\-\--you should invert your standard for alternative solvency and prioritize anti-capitalist struggle even if it seems inconceivable. 

**McCarraher \'19** \[Eugene; 11/12/19; Associate Professor of
Humanities at Villanova University, PhD in US Cultural and Intellectual
History from Rutgers University; The Enchantments of Mammon: How
Capitalism Became the Religion of Modernity, p. 15-18\]

Words such as "paradise" or "love" or "communion" are certainly absent
from our political vernacular, excluded on account of their "utopian"
connotations or their lack of steely-eyed "realism." Although this is a
book about the past, I have always kept before me its larger
contemporary religious, philosophical, and political implications. The
book should make these clear enough; I will only say here that one of my
broader intentions is to challenge the canons of "realism," especially
as defined in the "science" of economics. [As the **master science** of
**desire** in advanced **capitalist nations**, **economics** and its
acolytes **define the parameters** of our moral and **political
imaginations**, patrolling the boundaries of **possibility** and
**censoring** any **more generous conception** of **human affairs**.
Under the regime of **neoliberalism**, it has been the **chief weapon**
in the arsenal of]{.underline} what David Graeber has characterized as
["a **war on the imagination**," a relentless assault on our capacity to
envision an end to the despotism of money]{.underline}.24
[Insistent,]{.underline} in Margaret Thatcher's ominous ukase, [that
"there is no alternative" to capitalism, our **corporate plutocracy**
has been busy imposing its own **beatific vision** on the world: the
**empire of capital**, with an imperial aristocracy enriched by the
**labor** of a **fearful**, **overburdened**, and cheerfully **servile**
population]{.underline} of human resources. [Every avenue of **escape**
from **accumulation** and **wage servitude** must be **closed**, or
better yet, **rendered inconceivable**; any map of the world that
includes utopia must be burned]{.underline} before it can be glanced at.
Better to follow Miller's wisdom: we already inhabit paradise, and we
can never make ourselves fit to live in it if we obey the avaricious and
punitive sophistry professed in the dismal pseudoscience.

The grotesque ontology of scarcity and money, the tawdry humanism of
acquisitiveness and conflict, the reduction of rationality to the
mercenary principles of pecuniary reason---[this ensemble of
**falsehoods** that comprise the foundation of economics must be
**resisted** and **supplanted**. Economics must be **challenged**, not
only as a sanction for injustice but also as a **specious portrayal** of
**human beings** and a **fictional account** of their **history**. As a
legion of anthropologists and historians have repeatedly demonstrated,
economics]{.underline}, in Graeber's forthright dismissal, [has "little
to do with anything we **observe** when we examine how **economic life**
is **actually conducted**." From its historically illiterate
"myth]{.underline} of barter" to its shabby and degrading claims about
human nature, [economics is not just a dismal but a fundamentally
**fraudulent science** as well, akin,]{.underline} as Ruskin wrote in
Unto This Last, [to "**alchemy**, **astrology**,
**witchcraft**]{.underline}, and other such popular creeds."25

Ruskin's courageous and bracing indictment of economics arose from his
Romantic imagination, and this book partakes unashamedly of his
sacramental Romanticism. "[Imagination" was]{.underline}, to the
Romantics, primarily a form of vision, [a mode of realism, an insight
into the nature of reality that was irreducible to]{.underline}, but not
contradictory of, [the knowledge provided by scientific investigation.
Romantic social criticism did not claim the imprimatur of science as did
Marxism and other modern social theories]{.underline}, yet the Romantic
lineage of opposition to "disenchantment" [and capitalism has proved to
be more resilient]{.underline} and humane [than Marxism,
"progressivism," or social democracy.]{.underline} Indeed, [it is more
**urgently relevant** to a world **hurtling** ever faster to
**barbarism** and **ecological calamity**]{.underline}. I wrote this
book in part out of a belief that [many on the "left" continue to share
far too much with their antagonists: an ideology of "progress" defined
as **unlimited economic growth** and **technological development**, as
well as an **acceptance** of the **myth of disenchantment** that
underwrites the pursuit of such expansion. The Romantic antipathy to
capitalism, mechanization, and disenchantment stemmed]{.underline} not
from a facile and nostalgic desire to return to the past, but [from a
view that much of what passed for "progress" was in fact **inimical to
human flourishing**: a specious productivity that **required** the
acceptance of **venality**, **injustice**, and **despoliation**; a
**technological** and **organizational efficiency** that entailed the
**industrialization of human beings**; and the primacy of the production
of goods]{.underline} over the cultivation and nurturance of men and
women. This train of iniquities followed inevitably from the chauvinism
of what William Blake called "single vision," a blindness to the
enormity of reality that led to a "Babylon builded in the waste."26

[Romantics redefined rather than rejected "realism" and "progress,"
drawing on]{.underline} the premodern customs and traditions of
peasants, artisans, and artists: [**craftsmanship**, **mutual aid**, and
a conception of property that harkened back to the medieval practices of
"**the commons**."]{.underline} Whether they believed in some
traditional form of religion or translated it into secular idioms of
enchantment, such as "art" or "beauty" or "organism," [Romantic
anticapitalists tended to favor direct **workers' control of
production**; the **restoration** of a **human scale** in **technics**
and **social relations**; a **sensitivity** to the **natural world**
that precluded its reduction to mere instrumental value]{.underline};
and an apotheosis of pleasure in making sometimes referred to as poesis,
a union of reason, imagination, and creativity, an ideal of labor as a
poetry of everyday life, and a form of human divinity. In work free of
alienation and toil, we receive "the reward of creation," as William
Morris described it through a character in News from Nowhere (1890),
"the wages that God gets, as people might have said time agone."27

[Rendered **gaudy** and **impoverished** by the **tyranny of economics**
and the **enchantment** of **neoliberal capitalism**, our
**sensibilities need replenishment** from the sacramental imagination.
As Americans begin to experience the initial stages of
imperial]{.underline} sclerosis and [**decline**, and as the advanced
capitalist world]{.underline} in general [discovers the reality of
**ecological limits**]{.underline}, we may find in what Marx called the
"prehistory" of our species a perennial and redemptive wisdom. [We will
not be saved by our money, our weapons, or our technological
virtuosity]{.underline}; we might be rescued by the joyful and
unprofitable pursuits of love, beauty, and contemplation. No doubt this
will all seem foolish to the shamans and magicians of pecuniary
enchantment. But there are more things in heaven and earth than are
dreamt of on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley.

### 2NC -- Ethics First

#### Their argument begins from an ideological bias that brackets out capitalism's exploitation of the periphery -- traditional impact calculus can't take this into account, ethics must come first

Slavoj **[Zizek and]{.underline}** Glyn **[Daly]{.underline}**, Senior
Lecturer in Politics in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at
University College, Northampton, 200**[4]{.underline}**, Conversations
With Zizek, p. 14-16

For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of
postmodern protocol and recognize that [**our ethico-political
responsibility is to confront the** constitutive **violence of today's
global capitalism and its** obscene **naturalization**/anonymization
**of the millions who are subjugated** by it throughout the
world]{.underline}. Against the standardized positions of postmodern
culture --- with all its pieties con¬cerning 'multiculturalist'
etiquette --- Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called
'radically incorrect' in the sense that it breaks with these types of
positions and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of
today's social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism.
This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been
bedevilled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards
political mor¬bidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more
recently Laclau and Mouffe, crucial theoretical advances have been made
that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new
context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself
is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, **[the
prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as
a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly
accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence]{.underline}**. In
an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, **[the fear of economism can end up
reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary
capitalism]{.underline}** (i.e. the initial prohibi¬tion conjures up the
very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde
return to economism. Zizek's point is rather that in rejecting economism
[**we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in
shaping** the **lives** and destinies of humanity **and our very sense
of the possible**]{.underline}. In particular we should not overlook
Marx's central insight that [in order to create a universal global
system **the forces of capitalism** seek to **conceal the**
politico-discursive **violence of its construction**]{.underline}
through a kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently
denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that
[the gentrification of global liberal **capitalism** is one whose
'universalism' fundamentally **reproduces and depends upon a disavowed
violence that excludes vast sectors of the world's
population.**]{.underline} In this way, [**neo-liberal ideology attempts
to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and
losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgement in
a neutral marketplace. Capitalism** does]{.underline} indeed **[create a
space for a certain diversity]{.underline}**, at least for the central
capitalist regions, [but it **is neither neutral nor ideal and its price
in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant.**]{.underline} That is to
say, [**the human cost in terms of** inherent global **poverty and
degraded 'life**-chances' **cannot be calculated within the existing
economic rationale and, in consequence, social exclusion remains
mystified** and nameless]{.underline} (viz, the patronizing reference to
the 'developing world'. And Zizek's point is that this mystification is
mag¬nified through capitalism's profound capacity to ingest its own
excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms
and to absorb them within a culture of differ¬ential affirmation.
Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political
boutiquism that is readily sus¬tained by postmodern forms of consumerism
and lifestyle. Against this [**Zizek argues for a new universalism whose
primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of**
social **existence are founded on exclusion on a global
scale**]{.underline}. While it is perfectly true that universalism can
never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-par¬ticular
embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek's
universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or to
reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a 'glitch' in an
otherwise sound matrix.

## Impacts

### 2NC -- Impact -- Extinction

#### Global capitalism is [unsustainable]{.underline}, militating towards [extinction]{.underline}.

[The **global climate**]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[unraveling]{.underline}** [at rates far beyond the]{.underline}
**[predictions]{.underline}** [of scientists. The studies are so
common]{.underline} by this date, [and the **scientific
evidence**]{.underline} [so pervasive going back at least half a
century, that there is no need to cite sources about this
**fact**]{.underline}. [The **oceans are dying**]{.underline}, [the
**fisheries** are becoming]{.underline} **[exhausted]{.underline}**.
[The **forests are dying**]{.underline}. [They are devastated through
**human overuse**]{.underline}, **[logging]{.underline}**,
**[wildfires]{.underline}**, **[acid rain]{.underline}**, [and **rapidly
changing climate**]{.underline} conditions.

[Agricultural lands are **drying up**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[**losing productivity**, the land, water, and air are polluted.
Artificial human-made]{.underline} **[chemical compounds]{.underline}**
[are found in the tissues of **every living creature**]{.underline} on
Earth, [with **unknown synergistic effects**]{.underline}. [The **oceans
are rising**, displacing millions of coastal dwellers and submerging
prime agricultural lands]{.underline}.

[The habitats for animals and life in general are disappearing, and
many]{.underline} **[species go extinct daily]{.underline}**. [The
**polar caps** are **melting**]{.underline}, irrevocably altering the
planet's climate. [Rainfall is **irregular**]{.underline}, [with
**periodic droughts** alternating with **devastating
floods**]{.underline}. ....

At the same time, [the global human **population unsustainability**
continues to increase]{.underline}. ... ...Noam Chomsky declares:
"Survival of Organized Human Life Is at Risk Due to Climate Change and
Nuclear Weapons."

UN CHARTER'S UNTOUCHABLE SACRED COW PREVENTS GLOBAL CITIZENSHIP

[Meanwhile, the nations of the world focus on "**sovereignty**,"
**militarism**, national **independence**, **trade wars**, and
unsustainable **capitalist development**. "Sovereign independence" is
written into the UN charter]{.underline} in multiple ways [and continues
to function as an untouchable **sacred cow**, preventing the development
of **global citizenship**]{.underline} [everywhere on Earth. Each nation
**inculcates loyalty** into its **citizens**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[criminalizes]{.underline}** [any non-government
sponsored relationships with **foreign officials**, which they label
"**disloyalty**" and "**treason**." Trillions of dollars are poured down
the **toilet of militarism**]{.underline} [that are needed to protect
and restore the planetary environment.]{.underline}

FEW PEOPLE SEEM TO CARE

Nuclear weapons are refined and made "combat ready," and countries like
North Korea correctly understand that without the nuclear deterrent,
they would suffer the same destruction as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and
Libya. [For the **imperial system**]{.underline} [led by the U.S. and
its **NATO** allies continues to work for a]{.underline} **[global
hegemony]{.underline}** [to counter the growing influence of **Russia**
and **China**, **politically**]{.underline} [and **economically**,
without concern for human rights, dignity, or the welfare and livelihood
of many millions who appear of **less worthiness to live**]{.underline}
[because they are "not us."]{.underline} Books such as Nuclear Madness
by Helen Caldicott or The Doomsday Machine by Daniel Ellsberg regularly
appear detailing the many times that the near use of these weapons has
brought humanity close to extinction, but few seem to care. Our
fragmentation, hate, fear, and need for "enemies" is so much greater
than our desire for a future for our children or the planet.

SHOCK ALERT: IT'S A WAR SYSTEM, STUPID!

[Our planetary system is **inherently a war system requiring
enemies**]{.underline} [and **producing vast profits**]{.underline} [for
the industries that supply and encourage this system]{.underline}. As
climate and military disasters around the world increase so do the
profits of the system of "disaster capitalism" described by Naomi Klein
in her 2007 book The Shock Doctrine the Rise of Disaster Capitalism.
Meanwhile [the **big banks**]{.underline} [and masters of
the]{.underline} **[global monetary systems]{.underline}** [continue to
dominate **unsustainable global economics**, running the world as
a]{.underline} **[debt system]{.underline}** [from which they derive not
only vast]{.underline} **[profits]{.underline}** [but vast]{.underline}
**[political power]{.underline}**, as Ellen Brown showed in detail in
her 2007 book The Web of Debt.

IS THE RULING CLASS "INSANE" OR SIMPLY CRIMINAL?

A Google search reveals a number of articles by different authors who
have declared that the ruling class is "insane." Indeed, if bringing the
entire planet to ruin in the service of ones personal greed for wealth
and power is insane, then this label is appropriate, although I prefer
the term "criminal," since [the majority of the **ruling
class**]{.underline} [of the world are simply]{.underline}
**[criminals]{.underline}** [who control the]{.underline} **[mass
media]{.underline}**, [the politicians, and the UN in the service of
their criminal enterprises that are]{.underline} **[bringing humankind
to extinction]{.underline}**.

In the US, [the majority of both **Democrats**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[Republicans]{.underline}** [in the
Washington,]{.underline} DC, government [are criminals]{.underline} in
this sense, [serving both themselves and the ruling class. Many
**so-called liberals**]{.underline} [in the US are working to remove
Trump]{.underline} as President, [and to "take back our country." But
the truth is they never had "their country." The ruling class has always
had it, and]{.underline} **[human extinction advanced]{.underline}**
perhaps [just as rapidly under]{.underline} Bill [Clinton]{.underline},
George W. [Bush, or]{.underline} Barack [Obama. The mass media, the war
system, and the "sovereign nation" propaganda keep the people of the US
asleep]{.underline} no matter who is president. [Whomever fills that
office can do little because the system itself **defeats rationality**,
recognition of our common]{.underline} [**planetary humanity**, and the
changes **necessary for survival**]{.underline}.

REFUSING TO BECOME WORLD CITIZENS IS A DEATH SENTENCE

[Trump is a symptom and not a cause. People refuse to
actualize]{.underline} what [Karl Marx]{.underline} called our
species-being. [They refuse to become]{.underline} **[world
citizens]{.underline}** [in any real sense of this word. They cling to
their]{.underline} **[sovereign borders]{.underline}** [and **delude
themselves**]{.underline} [that somehow **extinction can be
avoided**]{.underline} [if the peoples of some 193 different,
**militarized** sovereign nations all care about the **environment**,
**recycle**, and "**dispose**" of the trash properly]{.underline}.
Rather than living in what I call a "boundary-less world," [they insist
on their]{.underline} **[puerile boundaries]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**identities**, even as this exacerbates the rush
to]{.underline} **[total climate collapse]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[human extinction]{.underline}**. [To cling to a
tiny, **exclusive identity**]{.underline} [that **divides one from
others**]{.underline} [who are "not me" becomes more important than the
**survival of the human race**]{.underline}.

MASS MEDIA A MAIN SOURCE FOR IMMATURE IDEOLOGIES

It has often been pointed out that the mass media keep ordinary people
distracted, immature, and unable to think clearly. The mass media are
designed for this purpose. For more sophisticated ordinary people, there
are sources like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington
Post, which frame the immature ideologies in a more erudite manner to
satisfy the egoism of the "educated" middle classes. But the entire
world system is immature and structurally inculcates immaturity into the
peoples of Earth.

MISGUIDED LOYALTIES TO OUTDATED SYSTEMS

[The system of sovereign nation-states is nearly four centuries
old]{.underline}, often said to have begun formally at the Peace of
Westphalia in 1648, developed at a time when people were riding horses
and fighting with swords. [The system of capitalism is just as old,
developed at a time when the Earth seemed to have]{.underline}
**[inexhaustible resources]{.underline}**, [was able to
receive]{.underline} **[unlimited wastes]{.underline}** [from human
industries]{.underline}, and the population of the world was a fraction
of what it is today. [These systems **structurally condition
people**]{.underline} [into **loyalty**]{.underline} [to their puerile
**national identities**]{.underline} [and into a]{.underline}
**[capitalism]{.underline}** [that has no concern for the
**environment**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [**human dignity**, but
only for egoistically pursued]{.underline} [**private profit**.
"Freedom" becomes promoting egoistic self-interest regardless of the
social or **environmental consequences**]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Impact -- War (General)

#### Global reach of West has resulted in the appearance of interimperial and total warfare which defines the modern era

Dina **Gusejnova '18**, is Lecturer in Modern History at the University
of Sheffeld, "1 Introduction", Cosmopolitanism in Conflict, Palgrave
McMillian, 2018, accessed via PDF -- email caitlinp96@gmail.com for a
copy

The first type of context within which we place the rise of global
consciousness and a cosmopolitan agenda is that of war. The ideas of
Emer de Vattel and even of Carl von Clausewitz may not seem as far
removed from those of Immanuel Kant as the twenty-first century
theorists of cosmopolitanism would have it, especially considering, as
Reinhart Koselleck had once remarked, that Kant's Perpetual Peace was in
fact an echo of the Treaty of Basel (1795), one of several separate
peace treaties signed during the French Revolutionary Wars.24 [From the
War of the Spanish Succession, the Seven Years' War and the War of
American Independence in the eighteenth century, to the Napoleonic and
later the extraEuropean colonial wars in the nineteenth, followed by the
two World Wars and the Cold War in the twentieth century, each moment in
the intellectual development of cosmopolitan thought can be linked to a
series of increasingly global conflicts which also had profound
repercussions for the political imagination]{.underline}. **[The Seven
Years' War marks the conceptual start of the volume because this
conflict had made clear that European interimperial conflicts could no
longer be viewed from one or two sides, as confrontations between
national realms, but demanded a global perspective both from their
participants, and from subsequent interpreters]{.underline}**. What
initially was a conflict between Britain and France escalated into a war
of global proportions in which previous loyalties were caught in the
vortex of two international coalitions involving most of the great
powers, with Prussia on the British and Austria, Russia and Spain on the
French side, and reaching colonies and dominions from Bengal to Quebec.
**[The new realities of interimperial conflict were a product of global
colonial interests, along with a rise in regional aspirations to
sovereignty]{.underline}**. **[In the twentieth century, concepts of
warfare took the form of 'total war' in the age of
Goebbels]{.underline}**. **[While new forms of warfare made the
separation between military and civilian combatants and targets less
significant, the Cold War challenged the very distinction between
wartime and peacetime through a growing expansion of conflict into the
sphere of culture, or]{.underline}** what Joseph Nye has termed '**[soft
power]{.underline}**'.25 '[The connection between cosmopolitanism and
war, we may be tempted to think, is merely sequential,]{.underline}'
Stephen Conway (Chap. 1) points out in his contribution on transnational
aspects of eighteenthcentury European warfare. [But looking at the
practices of conducting war and peace]{.underline} in the War of the
Spanish (1702--1713), Polish (1733--1738), Austrian (1740--1748) and
Bavarian (1778--1779) succession, and the Napoleonic wars, [his chapter
shows how cosmopolitan ideas not only could, but did arise from within
these incidents in the form of social practices, changes in etiquette
and reflections on solidarity]{.underline}. The **[increasingly global
deployment of military officers and mercenaries, which became prominent
in eighteenth-century European wars, changed the relationship of people
to places, as well as stretching the boundaries between 'reason of
state' arguments and imperialist expansion.]{.underline}**26 **[At the
same time, growing commercial connections and information networks
increasingly invited societies to think of global aspirations as a
social reality rather than as a utopian aspiration, even though these
connections remained unevenly spread across the globe]{.underline}**.27
Four areas are examined: [first, the alliance systems that brought
different governments and armed forces into cooperation; second, the
supply and finance of armies and navies]{.underline}, which often relied
on complex transnational networks; [third, the composition of supposedly
national armies; and finally the legal framework that sought to define
the boundaries of acceptable behaviour in war and the values that
underpinned its conduct]{.underline}. In this new light, the
cosmopolitan dimensions of war can be uncovered, focusing on sympathy
for the sufferings of others---outside one's own local, national or
ethnic community---among those engaged in the fighting.

#### Capitalism is the [root cause of war]{.underline}.

**Hathaway \'15** \[William; 3/4/15; adjunct professor of American
studies at the University of Oldenburg in Germany; \"The root cause of
war is oligarchic capitalism,\"
https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/root-cause-war-oligarchic-capitalism/\]

[**Capitalism** is **always at war**. The **violence**, though, is often
**abstract**: forcing us either to accept low-paying, **exhausting
jobs** or **starve**; denying us adequate **healthcare**, **education**
and **economic security**; convincing us that human beings are basically
isolated, autonomous units seeking self gratification. But when this
**doesn\'t suffice** to keep their **profits** growing, the **violence
becomes physical**]{.underline}, the cannons roar, [and the elite
rallies us to war]{.underline} to defend \"our\" country and destroy the
fiendish enemy. [Motivating us to **kill** and **die** for them requires
a massive **propaganda campaign** - America is under
attack!]{.underline} - which we confront whenever we turn on their
media.

Why do they do this? Are they monsters?

No, they\'re not. They\'re just human beings serving an inhuman system.
[Capitalism is **inherently predatory**. It demands **aggressive
growth**. It either **dominates** or **goes under**. This drive for
domination is the **root cause of war**, and until we **eliminate it**,
we\'re going to **continue killing** one another. Eliminating it
requires a **global struggle** to **bring down oligarchic capitalism**
and replace it]{.underline} with democratic socialism. Political
democracy must be expanded and extended into the economic sphere. [We,
the people of the world, have to **take control** of the forces that
**shape our lives**. This is the **basis** for building a **society** in
which we can all **fully develop** as human beings. Once we achieve
this, we\'ll have a real chance at **lasting peace**]{.underline}.

#### Global conditions from [disintegrating capitalism]{.underline} make [global war]{.underline} inevitable.

**Ahmed \'19** \[Nafeez; 2/22/19; Executive Director of the Institute
for Policy Research and Development, MA in Contemporary War & Peace
Studies and PhD in International Relations from the School of Global
Studies at Sussex University; \"The "Disintegration" of Global
Capitalism Could Unleash World War 3, Warns Top EU Economist,\"
https://www.resilience.org/stories/2019-02-22/the-disintegration-of-global-capitalism-could-unleash-world-war-3-warns-top-eu-economist//\]

In his new paper, Hanappi concludes that [**global conditions** bear
unnerving **parallels** with **trends** before the outbreak
of]{.underline} the first and second **[world wars]{.underline}**.

[Key **red flags** that the world is on a **slippery slope** to a
**global war**]{.underline}, he finds, include:

the [inexorable **growth** of **military spending**]{.underline};

[democracies **transitioning** into increasingly **authoritarian police
states**]{.underline};

[heightening **geopolitical tensions** between **great
powers**]{.underline};

[the resurgence of **populism**]{.underline} across the left and right;

[the breakdown and **weakening** of established **global
institutions**]{.underline} that govern transnational capitalism;

[and the relentless **widening** of global
**inequalities**]{.underline}.

These trends, some of which were visible before the previous world wars,
are reappearing in new forms. Hanappi argues that [the defining feature
of the current period is a **transition** from an older form of
"integrating capitalism" to a **new form** of "**disintegrating
capitalism**]{.underline}", whose features most clearly emerged after
the 2008 financial crisis.

[For most of the twentieth century]{.underline}, he says, global
[capitalism was on an "integrating" pathway]{.underline} toward higher
concentrations of transnational wealth. [This was interrupted by the
outbreaks of **violent nationalism** involving the **two world
wars**]{.underline}. After that, a new form of "integrated capitalism"
emerged based on an institutional framework that has allowed
industrialised countries to avoid a world war for 70 years.

[This system is now entering a **period of
disintegration**]{.underline}. Previously, fractures within the system
between rich and poor were overcome "by distributing a bit of the gains
of the tremendous increase of the fruits of the global division of
labour to the richer working classes in these nations." Similarly,
international tensions were diffused through transnational governance
frameworks and agreements for the regulation of capitalism.

But [since]{.underline} the [2008]{.underline} financial crisis, [wealth
distribution has worsened]{.underline}, with purchasing power for the
middle and working classes declining as wealth becomes even more greatly
concentrated.

[Growth in the Western centres of transnational capital has **slowed**,
while formerly sacrosanct international **trade agreements** are being
**torn to shreds**. This has fuelled a **reversion to
nationalism**]{.underline} in which global and transnational structures
have been rejected, and 'foreigners' have been demonised. As global
capital thus continues to disintegrate, these pressures escalate,
particularly as its internal justification depends increasingly on
intensifying competition with external rivals.

While integrated capitalism depended on a transnational institutional
framework that permitted "stable exploitation on a national level",
Hanappi argues that "disintegrating capitalism" sees this framework
become disaggregated between the USA, Europe, Russia and China, each of
which pursues new forms of hierarchical subordination of workers.

[Disintegrating capitalism]{.underline}, he explains, [will resort
increasingly to "direct **coercive powers**]{.underline} supplemented by
new information technologies" [to **suppress internal tensions**, as
well as a **greater propensity** for **international
hostilities**]{.underline}: "The new authoritarian empires need
confrontation with each other to justify their own internal, inflexible
command structure."

Great power conflict

Hanappi explores three potential scenarios for how a new global conflict
could unfold. In his first scenario, he explores the prospect of a war
between the three most prominent military powers: [the **US**,
**Russia** and **China**]{.underline}.

All three [have experienced large increases in **military
spending**]{.underline} since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Despite
a dip for the US since 2011, President Trump has ushered in a new spike,
while Russian spending has plateaued and Chinese expenditures are
rapidly increasing. All three countries have also experienced an
authoritarian turn.

[Drawing on **game theory**]{.underline}, Hanappi argues that [the
**calculus** that none of these countries would be capable of 'winning'
a world war may be changing]{.underline} in the perceptions of the
leaderships of these countries. By one estimate, China has the highest
probability of survival at 52 per cent, followed by the US at 30 per
cent, and Russia at 18 per cent. This calculus suggests that of all the
three powers, China might be the most inclined to escalate direct
hostile military activities that challenge its rivals if it perceives a
direct threat to what it sees as its legitimate interests.

The US and Russia in contrast might transfer the focus of their military
activities on more covert, indirect and proxy mechanisms. In the US
case, Hanappi points out:

"... the military strategy of Trump seems to include the possibility to
delegate part of local operational responsibility to close vassals,
which receive massive weapon support from the US, e.g. Saudi Arabia and
Israel in the Middle East. Turkey, one of the strongest NATO branches in
the area is a special case. It seems to have been allowed to destroy an
emergent state of the Kurdish population, which would have been closer
to the European style of governance."

There are growing signs of heightened great power tensions which could
erupt entirely by accident or unanticipated provocation into a global
conflict that nobody wants.

[The US-China **trade war** is **escalating**, while both powers tussle
over **technology secrets** and argue over]{.underline} China's [growing
**military footprint**]{.underline} in the South China Sea. Meanwhile
Trump's massive expansion of the US Navy and Air Force point to
preparations for a major potential conflict with either China or
Russsia.

Both the US and Russia have jettisoned a critical nuclear treaty
established since the Cold War opening the way to a nuclear arms race.
North Korea remains unrepentant about its ongoing nuclear weapons
programme while Trump's tearing up of the nuclear agreement with Iran
disincentivises that country from complying with disarmament and
reporting terms.

Early last year, a statistical study of the frequency of major wars in
human history found that the so-called 70 years of 'long peace' is
simply not an unusual phenomenon indicating an unprecedented period of
peace. The study concluded that there was no reason to believe that the
70 year period so far would not give way to another major war.

Small wars, global contagion

Hanappi's second scenario explores the prospect of [a series of "small
**civil wars**]{.underline} in many countries". The ingredients for such
a scenario [are rooted in the **resurgence** of both right-wing and
left-wing **populism**]{.underline}. "Both variants --- sometimes
implicitly, sometimes explicitly --- refer to a past historical national
state form that they propose to return to," explains Hanappi.

While right-wing populism harks back to the authoritarian, racist
regimes established in Germany and Italy in the 1930s, [left-wing
populism yearns to return to the model of "integrated
capitalism"]{.underline} that was in place during the first three
decades after the Second World War, [and which reacted to the
unequalising effects of capitalism through the '**social net**' of the
so-called '**welfare state**' as well as **various forms** of **state
intervention**]{.underline} in the economy alongside private industry.

[But the challenge is that "integrated capitalism" is already
**engulfed** with its own **internal contradictions**]{.underline},
[propelling the shift toward **disintegration**]{.underline}.

[This puts left-wing populism in a **systematically weaker
position**]{.underline}, as right-wing populism can point to the
multiple failures of "integrated capitalism": the failure to "overcome
class antagonisms", and the failure to "fulfil the promise of a
substantially better life for the majority of people." According to
Hanappi:

"The representatives of Integrated Capitalism are discredited and cannot
act as leaders, the movement therefore is forced to experiment with new
forms of national organization. More participatory forms of democratic
organization take more time, and with multiple social groups involved
this weakens this movements strength vis-à-vis right-wing populism.
Furthermore, its vision of an improved national Integrated Capitalism is
handicapped by the fact that many people still remember its failures,
while the song of national glory that right-wing populism sings refers
to an imagined far-away past that no one ever had seen."

In this context, he argues, [the potential exists for outbreaks of
**national civil war** between emerging **paramilitary branches** of
right-wing and left-wing populist movements]{.underline}, in the context
of either movement adopting state power and coming into conflict with
the opposition.

Hanappi warns of the possibility of a regional or global "contagion"
effect, if these breakdowns occur within a similar time-scale. In that
scenario:

"The fluid mobility of national ideological political entrepreneurs, the
creators of populist movements, meets the rigidity of dire global
economic constraints. This is the crash that provokes local wars."

[This **scenario** is also **backed** by **statistical
data**]{.underline}. In 2016, a study by Lloyds Insurers found that
since 1960 [there has been an increasing frequency in "pandemics" of
"political violence contagion"]{.underline} involving regional and
transnational outbreaks of civil unrest [within and among
states]{.underline}.

The report said that social protest and dissent against government
policies of militarism abroad and neoliberal austerity at home could act
as potential precursors to "contagions" of violence, along with other
risk factors, including "an increase in the share of internet users",
greater urban concentration, increases in infant mortality, and a
growing young population.

[Global **insurgency** of the **poor**]{.underline}

Hanappi's third scenario [parallels]{.underline} the [Lloyds study's
finding that]{.underline} in coming years, [the world is likely to face
a series of]{.underline} "super strain pandemics" in the form of
["anti-imperialist" and "independence movements", "**mass pro-reform
protests** against national government", and "**armed
insurrection**]{.underline}" or "insurgency" [associated
with]{.underline} two particular ideologies, "[**Marxism**" and
"**Islamism**]{.underline}."

According to Hanappi, the [plausibility of this scenario can be found in
the "profoundly **divergent trajectories** of **welfare** of poor parts
and rich parts of the world economy]{.underline}."

While GDP has continued to grow overall, [in the last three decades
income and wealth inequalities within almost every country have widened,
and look set to sharpen further. If this cycle continues, a
**coalescence of grievances** among the **poorest three billion**,
spurred on by the **interconnectivity** of
**communications**]{.underline} in the smartphone era, [is
plausible]{.underline}.

Hanappi argues that [in reality, **global conditions** make a
**combination**]{.underline} of these three scenarios [more likely than
just one]{.underline} of them.

#### Capitalism is literally the root cause of all warfare -- multiple empirical developments prove -- only embracing the alt is able to create a party strong enough to push out capitalist organizing

Network. He retired in 2001 from UNESCO where he was the Director of the
Unit for the International Year for the Culture of Peace, proclaimed for
the Year 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly (Dr. David, "THE
AMERICAN PEACE MOVEMENTS CHAPTER 8: THE ROOT CAUSES OF WAR", pgs 23-25,
http://www.culture-of-peace.info/apm/chapter8-23.html)

[American intervention in World War I again rescued the economy from a
depression]{.underline}. [In 1914 and 1915]{.underline}, as war between
the European imperialist powers broke out, [American unemployment was
rising towards ten percent and industrial goods were piling up without a
market]{.underline}. **[One industrial market was
expanding]{.underline}**, however, **[the market for weapons in
Europe]{.underline}**. The historian Charles **[Tansill concludes that
\"it was the rapid growth of the munitions trade which rescued America
from this serious economic situation.\"]{.underline}** [And since the
sales went to Britain and France, it committed the U.S. to their side in
the war]{.underline}. **[Finance capital was equally involved: \"the
large banking interests were deeply interested in the World War because
of wide opportunities for large profits.\"]{.underline}** When bank
loans to Britain and France of half a billion dollars went through in
1915, \"the business depression, that had so worried the Administration
in the spring of 1915, suddenly vanished, and \'boom times\'
prevailed.\" [Of course, German imperialism did not stand idly by while
the U.S. profited from arms shipments and loans to their enemies in the
war. German submarine warfare against these shipments finally provoked
American involvement in the War. The rise of fascism in Europe was the
direct result of still another cyclical depression, the Great Depression
that gripped the entire capitalist world in the Thirties]{.underline}.
In his recent book on the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise
of fascism, David **[Abraham has documented how major capitalists turned
to Hitler to fill the vacuum of political leadership when the economy
collapsed]{.underline}**. [In part, the absence of political leadership
\"with the collapse of the export economy]{.underline} at the end of
1931\...[drove German industry to foster or accept a Bonapartist
solution to the political crisis and an imperialist solution to the
economic crisis]{.underline}. [The \"Bonapartist
solution\",]{.underline} as Abraham calls it, [was found in Hitler\'s
Nazi Party]{.underline}. As he says, \"By mid-1932, the vast majority of
industrialists wanted to see Nazi participation in the government.\"
[**For these industrialists, \"an anti-Marxist, imperialist program was
the least common denominator on which they could all agree, and the
Nazis seemed capable of providing the mass base for such a program.\"**
The appeasement of Hitler\'s promise to smash the communists and
socialists at home and to destroy the Soviet Union abroad expressed a
new cause of capitalist war]{.underline}. [Up until that time,
inter-imperialist wars were simply the response to economic
contradictions at home and capitalist competition abroad]{.underline}.
In part, World War II was yet another inter-imperialist war. But now a
new cause of war was emerging alongside of the old. [The rise of
socialism was a direct threat to the entire capitalist
world]{.underline}. **[In addition to glutted domestic markets and
competition for foreign markets, the capitalists now had to face the
additional problem that the overall foreign market itself was
shrinking]{.underline}**. Thus, [they tended to support each other in
the face of a common enemy]{.underline}. [After World War II, there was
a particularly sharp shrinkage in the \"free world\" for capitalist
exploitation as socialism and national liberation triumphed through much
of the world]{.underline}. **[The U.S. and its allies responded by
demanding that the socialist countries open their doors to investment by
capitalism]{.underline}**. According to historian William Appleman
Williams, \"It **[was the decision of the United States to employ its
new and awesome power in keeping with the traditional Open Door Policy
which crystallized the cold war]{.underline}**.\" As Williams explains,
\"[the policy of the open door, like all imperial policies, created and
spurred onward a dynamic opposition]{.underline}.\" D**[iplomatic and
military confrontation between the U.S. and USSR were used to justify
the Cold War and establishment of NATO, but the underlying issues were
economic]{.underline}**. As pointed out by historians Joyce and Gabriel
Kolko, \"[**The question of foreign economic policy was not the
containment of Communism, but rather more directly the extension and
expansion of American capitalism according to its new economic power and
needs.\"** In addition to]{.underline} the new problem of [shrinking
world markets, there remained the problem of cyclical
depressions]{.underline}. Although unemployment was not bad in 1946
because industry was producing to meet the accumulated needs of the
war-deprived American people, the specter of another depression was very
much a factor in the Cold War. As the Kolkos point out, \"The deeply
etched memory of the decade-long depression of 1929 hung over all
American plans for the postwar era[\....In extending its power
throughout the globe the United States hoped to save itself as well from
a return of the misery of prewar experience]{.underline}.\" **[The
Vietnam War was a continuation of the Cold War, as the United States
tried to prevent further shrinkage of the world capitalist economic
system]{.underline}**. **[The U.S. had already fought a similar war in
Korea]{.underline}**. In his chapter, \"The U.S. in Vietnam, 1944-66:
Origins and Objectives,\" Gabriel Kolko calls the intervention of the
United States in Vietnam, \"the most important single embodiment of the
power and purposes of American foreign policy since the Second World
War.\" Elsewhere in his book, [Kolko goes into detail about the economic
basis of American imperialism: access to raw materials, access to
markets for American products, and investment opportunities for American
capital. The Vietnam War]{.underline}, he explains, [was not a
conspiracy or simply a military decision. **It was the natural result of
\"American power and interest in the modern world.\"**]{.underline}
Finally we come to the question of what has caused [the massive
escalation of the arms buildup under Presidents Carter and
Reagan]{.underline} (and more recently under Bush, father and son). To
some extent, it [is a response to the old problem of cyclical
depressions]{.underline}. [Since World War II, each recession has been
deeper than the last]{.underline}, until by 1981 unemployment reached
double digits for the first time since the Thirties. [Government
spending was needed to put people back to work. **Would the government
spend the money for military weapons or for civilian
needs?**]{.underline} [A long line of Presidential
candidates]{.underline}, standing for the military solution, [have been
supported in their campaigns by the military-industrial complex against
other candidates who were unable to wage a serious campaign for civilian
spending instead of military spending]{.underline}. **[The growing power
of the military-industrial complex is a new and especially dangerous
addition to the economic causes of war]{.underline}**. It reflects an
economic crisis that goes even deeper than those of the past. **[In
addition to the cyclical depressions and the shrinkage of foreign
markets, there is a new imbalance in the entire structure of capitalism.
There is an enormous increase in financial speculation and short-term
profit schemes]{.underline}**. [The military-industrial complex has
risen to become the dominant sector of the American economy because
through the aid of state subsidies it generates the greatest short-term
profits]{.underline}. Never mind if the U.S. government goes into debt
to banks and other financial institutions in order to pay for military
spending. [The world of financial speculation does not worry about
tomorrow]{.underline}. [Not only does this \"military spending
solution\" endanger the security of the planet, but it also increases
the risk of a major financial collapse and subsequent
depression]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Impact -- Environment

#### State-sanctioned [environmental destruction]{.underline} is intrinsic to capitalism\-\--culminates in [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Plested \'20** \[James; 2/17/20; editor of Red Flag; \"Capitalist
roots of the environment crisis,\"
https://climateandcapitalism.com/2020/02/18/capitalist-roots-environment-crisis/\]

[**Climate change** is only **one aspect** of the problem. Everywhere we
look, the **natural systems** that maintain our planet in its
**habitable state** are rapidly **deteriorating**. Can we survive the
**destruction** of the tropical **rain forests** of the **Amazon** --
the **lungs of Earth**? Can we survive the **spread** of **dead
zones**]{.underline} -- areas too low in oxygen to sustain life --
[across our **oceans**? Can we make do without the **bees** and other
**insects** we]{.underline} currently [depend on to **pollinate** our
**crops**?]{.underline}

[Perhaps the **scariest thing**]{.underline} about the situation [isn't
the **vast scale** of breakdown in natural systems but the fact that
those entrusted with the **leadership** of our society appear determined
to **hasten us to our doom**]{.underline}. Instead of listening to the
advice of the scientists, firefighters, land managers and others who've
been sounding the alarm about climate change for decades, Scott Morrison
and Co. parrot propaganda points from the Murdoch press. Instead of
agreeing, finally, to contribute more to global efforts to reduce carbon
emissions, they double down on the expansion of Australia's booming coal
and gas industries, attempting all the while to distract the public with
fairy tales about greenies preventing back-burning and the fires just
being part of Australia's natural cycle.

Elsewhere in the world, the picture is the same. [Decades of global
**climate negotiations** have gone **nowhere**. Despite the increasingly
urgent warnings of scientists, **emissions continue to
rise**]{.underline}. And with the likes of Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin
and Jair Bolsonaro in charge of some of the world's biggest economies,
the prospects for a major shift occurring soon appear terrifyingly dim.

Where did it all go wrong? The answer is suggested by the increasingly
popular slogan System change, not climate change. Morrison, Trump and
their fellow [fossil fuel enthusiasts act not simply in accordance with
their personal whims]{.underline} and desires [but as the **conscious
servants** of a system: **capitalism**. Proponents of capitalism talk as
if it's the **natural form** of human society]{.underline} -- something
that has existed since the dawn of time. [The reality,]{.underline}
however, [is that the age of capitalism spans only the past two to three
centuries.]{.underline} For the vast majority of our 200-300,000 year
history, humans lived in societies, like those of the Indigenous
inhabitants of Australia prior to invasion, characterized by collective
decision making and sharing of resources, not the system of private
property and the endless competitive scramble for individual gain that
define the world today.

If the capitalist system was most befitting of our human nature, you
would expect its emergence to have been embraced by all whose lives were
transformed by it. But [the birth of capitalism]{.underline} in the 17th
and 18th centuries [was an extremely **violent process** that was
**strongly resisted** from the start.]{.underline} As Karl Marx put it
in Capital: "The discovery of gold and silver in America, the
extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal
population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East
Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting
of black-skins, signaled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
production." Capital came into the world, he wrote, "dripping from head
to foot, from every pore, with blood and dirt."

[Since the earliest days of human existence, we have had a significant
impact on the environment]{.underline}. Scientists believe, for
instance, that hunting, along with the use of fire and other land
management techniques employed by Australia's Indigenous population,
contributed to the extinction of the continent's megafauna.
Deforestation was a major problem in ancient Greece and the Roman
Empire. Air pollution from the burning of wood and coal was an issue in
London as early as the 12th and 13th centuries. [All this, however, was
on a **minuscule scale** compared to the **devastation** of the past
**200 years**, and particularly]{.underline} in the period [after World
War Two -- the era in which **capitalism came to dominate** every
corner]{.underline} of the globe.

In 1950, global carbon emissions totaled 5.28 billion tonnes. By 2017,
they were 36.15 billion tonnes. According to the World Wildlife Fund's
Living Planet Report 2018, [the **total population** of **mammals**,
**birds**, **fish** and **reptiles** has **declined by 60 percent**
since 1970. Every year, the rate of **extinctions** rises,]{.underline}
and scientists estimate that [a million animal and plant species may go
extinct over the coming decades]{.underline}. According to a 2016 report
by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the production of plastic has risen
20-fold since 1964 and is expected to double again in the next 20 years
and quadruple by 2050. Only around 5 percent of plastic ends up being
recycled. If current trends continue, the report predicts, [by 2050
there will, by weight, be **more plastic** in the world's oceans **than
fish**]{.underline}.

No one of these gloomy metrics, considered alone, can capture the depths
of the crisis we face. [In only 200 years]{.underline} of existence,
[capitalism has brought us to the brink of such a **calamitous
breakdown** in the world's natural systems that **our entire
civilization is now under threat**]{.underline}.

[Among Marx's most evocative metaphors for]{.underline} the operation of
[capital is his description of it as "dead labor, that, vampire-like,
only lives by sucking living labor,]{.underline} and lives the more, the
more labor it sucks". It's not only "living labor," however, that
sustains the vampire of capital, [but also the **natural inputs** of the
**productive process** -- the **raw materials** that labor works up into
the products that capitalists sell on]{.underline} the market for their
coveted profits.

[What makes capitalism **uniquely destructive** in
comparison]{.underline} to previous systems [is the **rupture** of the
**connection** between the main drivers of **economic life** and the
**natural world** that sustains us]{.underline}. A capitalist may own a
significant amount of land. But unlike the feudal lords of the Middle
Ages, their wealth isn't tied to the piece of land that they own. [If a
capitalist **destroys** their land]{.underline} -- say by digging up all
the coal or oil it contains, poisoning it with chemicals or exhausting
the fertility of the soil through over-farming -- [they can simply take
the **profits** they've generated from it and **buy more** land
elsewhere]{.underline}.

The vampire metaphor is powerful precisely because it speaks to this
fundamental rift between the lifeblood of capitalism -- profit -- and
society's underlying life systems, including labor and the natural
environment, that are the ultimate source of all wealth. Rolling Stone
contributor Matt Taibbi's description of investment bank Goldman Sachs
as "a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity,
relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like
money", can be extended to the whole capitalist class. [The
environmental (or other) **consequences** of their activities don't give
them much **pause** for concern as long as they're **making
money**]{.underline}.

[The wealth of the capitalist ruling class]{.underline} of today [is so
immense that even the **existential threat** posed by **climate change**
won't shake them into action]{.underline}. According to Oxfam, the
combined wealth of the world's 2,153 billionaires exceeds that of the
poorest 4.6 billion people, who make up 60 percent of the global
population. [Catastrophic events]{.underline} like the Australian bush
fires [are unlikely to faze them]{.underline} -- in contrast to the mass
of ordinary people impacted by the fires, they can easily buy their way
to safety.

[The ruling class's **lack of concern** for the **environment** is
reinforced by the **competitive nature** of the system. Each individual
capitalist must keep their **costs low** and their **profits high** to
stay ahead of their rivals. The main way]{.underline} they do this [is
by keeping workers' **wages down**. But if they can save money by not
dealing with the **environmental costs** of their operations, they'll do
that too]{.underline}.

[The capitalist class gains immense savings from treating
**environmental destruction** as an "externality" that they can pass on
to society]{.underline}. The International Monetary Fund calculated that
global subsidies to fossil fuel companies amount to US\$5.2 trillion a
year, approximately 6.4 percent of world GDP. Most subsidies relate to
the cost of dealing with the destructive consequences of all the carbon
emissions produced by burning fossil fuels. This includes the impacts of
climate change, along with the costs of health care associated with air
pollution and so on.

[You might wonder why governments are willing to let]{.underline} fossil
fuel companies and other [**destructive industries** get away with this.
The answer lies in the **role** of the **capitalist state**. We're
taught that it is a neutral body]{.underline} that mediates between the
conflicting interests of different social layers and guides society in
the collective interest. [The state, however, has **never been
neutral**. Modern **capitalist states** emerged in **conjunction** with
the rise of the **capitalist class** as the dominant economic power in
society, and they've always]{.underline}, as Marx put it, [been "a
**committee** for managing the **common affairs** of the **whole
bourgeoisie**]{.underline}."

[The role of the capitalist state]{.underline}, in other words, [is to
**protect** and **advance** the interests of **big business** and the
**rich**, rather than the mass of the population who **suffer the
consequences** of their **environmentally destructive**
practices]{.underline}. And again, this dynamic is reinforced by
competition on an international scale. Each national state defends the
interests of its capitalist class against those of their foreign rivals.
This involves both maintaining good business conditions (e.g. low wages
and a lack of environmental and other regulations) at home and
projecting power externally, through diplomatic and military means, to
ensure access to resources and markets around the world.

[The **destructive consequences** of these dynamics can be seen in
capitalism's almost uninterrupted **history of war**]{.underline}. And
they also help explain the continuing failure of global efforts to
secure agreement on any serious action to reduce carbon emissions or
address other major environmental issues. [Sacrificing **short term
profits** in the name of **long term sustainability** goes against the
DNA of the capitalist nation state]{.underline}. This is particularly
clear in the case of Australia, one of the world's most fossil
fuel-dependent nations. Neither the Liberals nor Labor are prepared to
forgo the tens of billions in profits that flow from coal and gas
exports. The strength of the fossil fuel industry is just too important
to Australia's status as a major regional power.

We're in a battle for our lives. [The **entire future** of the **human
experiment**]{.underline} -- so utterly miraculous and so terrifyingly
fragile -- [depends on what we do in the **coming years**]{.underline}
and decades. As Russian Marxist Nikolai Bukharin, writing a few years
after the revolution of 1917, put it: "[No system, including that of
human society, can exist in empty space; it is surrounded by an
'environment,' on which all its conditions ultimately depend. If **human
society** is not **adapted** to its environment, it is not meant for
this world; all its culture will **inevitably pass away**; society
itself will be **reduced to dust**]{.underline}."

[U.S. intensification of its bio-imperial capacity harms not only its
intended targets]{.underline}. [All bioscientific research entails risks
such as laboratory accidents, unintentional leakages, and transport
mistakes]{.underline}. [Research on dangerous pathogens, also subject to
these mishaps, thus yields significant biohazards to laboratory workers
and those in the geographic vicinity of the labs]{.underline}. In 2004,
three laboratory workers in a Boston University biosafety level 2 lab,
working with what they mistakenly thought was a benign strain of
tularemia, became ill with a virulent and potentially fatal strain. That
same year, seven researchers at a biosafety level 2 lab in Oakland
Children's Hospital were exposed to live---instead of dead---anthrax,
sent by mistake by a vendor in Fort Detrick, Maryland (Hecht and
MacKenzie 2005). Other notable accidental releases and exposures that
took place in the early twenty-first century have been catalogued by the
Sunshine Project. In 2006, the organization updated the map (figure 3)
to not only include the new labs built in the meantime, but also show
the releases that had occurred from 2001 to 2005.20 **[These lab
accidents and leakages are not historically anomalous]{.underline}**.
[During the height of the active U.S. program in the 1950s and 1960s, at
Camp Detrick, the former hub of military research on biological weapons,
there were 3,330 accidents between 1954 and 1962]{.underline}; [half
involved lab personnel, of whom 77 percent were infected]{.underline}
(Hersh 1968).21 The dire consequences of these accidents have best been
demonstrated by the Sverdlosk disaster in 1979, when weaponized anthrax
leaked from the Soviet bioweapons laboratory, killing an estimated one
hundred people (Guillemin 1999; Inglesby et al. 2002). [The revamped
post-9 / 11 biodefense industry continued this trend]{.underline}. [The
CDC has recorded about twenty accident reports of infectious pathogens a
year since 2004]{.underline}---[a number researchers think is probably
underreported, and which increased to thirty-two in 2007]{.underline}
(Kaiser 2007). T[he growing research on putative biological agents
likely increased the potential for these mishaps]{.underline}---[the
number of people gaining clearance to work reached about 20,000 at 400
sites around the United States by 2007, ten times more than before 9 /
11]{.underline} (MacKenzie 2007). I have discussed how [the specter of
the mal-intentioned Other has enabled the U.S. state to justify domestic
buildup]{.underline}. [Here I also argue that it helped the state to
mask the risky research and laboratory hazards the biodefense industry
generates]{.underline}. **[Focus on the bioterrorist figure pushes aside
the ongoing need to assess the prudence of conducting such
research]{.underline}**. [This discursive move has been well described
in other arenas of U.S. national security, suggesting a broader
pattern.]{.underline} Anthropologist Joseph Masco (1999) has highlighted
how, [in U.S. nuclear research culture, the post--World War II national
security state turned its focus to "national security" threats in ways
that both produced and concealed "national sacrifices"]{.underline}
(204). Masco describes the building of Los Alamos National Laboratory (a
U.S. nuclear weapons complex in Los Alamos, New Mexico) as exploiting
Native American lands, producing nuclear waste and environmental
contamination, and exacerbating the exploitation of Nuevomexicano labor.
[**The U.S. national security apparatus frames the harms it produces as
the justifiable cost of achieving national defense.** Post-9 / 11
institutionalization of "biosecurity" further enshrouded the
"sacrifices" of biodefense research]{.underline}. [The biosecurity
regime focused on guarding and restricting access to research on
dangerous pathogens]{.underline}.22 This meant tightened security at
facilities, increased screening of lab workers, and restrictions on
publication of research findings and collaboration. [**Operationalizing
biosecurity focused attention on outsiders obtaining the dangerous
research materials, rather than on concerns about internally generated
lab hazards.** The new access restrictions, moreover, aimed at specific
categories of people]{.underline}. The USA PATRIOT Act had extended
post--Cold War era discourse on terrorism to mark both communist
countries and countries in the Middle East---whether individuals,
groups, or nation-states---as severe threats to U.S. national security.
[The act also contained a section regulating bioscience, aiming to more
tightly restrict access to and transfer of biological materials deemed
hazardous (so-called select agents) from categories of "restricted
persons."]{.underline}23 To section 817, "Expansion of the Biological
Weapons Statute," it added subsection 175b, "Possession by Restricted
Persons." [This subsection restricted access to select agents by anyone
who was an "alien illegally or unlawfully in the United States" or "an
alien (other than an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence)
who is a national of a country as to which the Secretary of
State]{.underline} ... [has made a determination]{.underline} (that
remains in effect) [that such country has repeatedly provided support
for acts of international terrorism]{.underline}." The latter category
denoted foreign nationals from countries designated by the State
Department as "state sponsors of terrorism," which at the time included
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.24 **[The
restriction's basis in national origin]{.underline}**---**[specifically,
to countries identified as hostile to the United
States]{.underline}**---**[racialized them via the discourse of
terrorism]{.underline}**.25 [In addition to these racialized
restrictions based on citizenship status and national origin, the act
marked other categories of persons as national security threats: anyone
who has been convicted of a crime for a term exceeding one year,
fugitives from justice, users of controlled substances, anyone who has
been discharged dishonorably from the U.S. Armed Services, and anyone
deemed a "mental defective."]{.underline} [The delineation of this wider
array of Others deemed unfit to access biological agents demonstrates
the logics of state targeting]{.underline}. [The state marginalizes
various abject groups, at different times and places, and to different
degrees depending on the dictates of biopower]{.underline}. 26 **[The
discursive gesturing to those the state abandons]{.underline}**
---**[the Arab / Muslim Other, the convict, the drug user, the defector,
and the disabled]{.underline}**---**[in the name of protecting "life"
served to bolster the logics of the biosecurity regime and its aim to
keep pathogen research only in the hands of the state and its
proxies]{.underline}**---**[in this case high-level biodefense
insiders]{.underline}**. The U.S. state did not limit itself to these
categories. Steve Kurtz was not part of any of the listed
exclusions---he was a white male and had no connections to
incarceration, drug use, wartime defection, or disability. He was,
however, a lab outsider---a bio-art activist doing critical work about
the politics of science27---who got caught up in the post-9 / 11
counterterror regime through an unfortunate series of events surrounding
a heartbreaking personal tragedy.

### 2NC -- Turns Case (Disease)

#### The aff's logic is rooted in a white scientific masculinity that presumes it is [above]{.underline} the consequences of its actions and [actively prevents]{.underline} the eradication of disease out of fear of "future attacks" -- turns the entirety of case

[Post-9 / 11 acceleration of such risky research reveals the logic of
state protectionism in U.S. biological warfare research. Like other
militarized sciences, the industry embodies a protectionism infused with
white masculinity and technoscientific authority]{.underline}. 33 [I
have in my previous work on U.S. biodefense argued that it is a form of
institutionalized "white scientific masculinity": institutions of
science and security associated with white males]{.underline} (e.g.,
defense sciences) [get construed as infallible founts of knowledge and
expertise]{.underline}.34 The post-9 / 11 regime of biosecurity thus
garnered the U.S. biodefense industry, a trusted institution of "white
scientific masculinity," an even greater ability to conduct risky
research without significant scrutiny. But [no case better illustrates
U.S. impudence in pursuing new avenues of risky research than that
conducted with smallpox]{.underline}. [Smallpox is known for its
historical devastation]{.underline}---it has an approximately one-third
mortality rate and was responsible for almost half a billion deaths
worldwide in the twentieth century. It wreaked havoc in Native America
centuries ago when European settler-colonists---in an early example of
biological warfare--- intentionally infected native populations who,
without prior exposure, were decimated by the disease (Christopher et
al. 1997; Duffy 2002; USAMRIID 2004). In 1979, smallpox became the first
disease to be successfully eradicated from the world.35 [Neither the
warfare genealogy of smallpox]{.underline}---as a deplorable tool
Europeans had used to commit Native American genocide---[nor its status
as an internationally eradicated disease and thus a minimal
threat]{.underline}---[seemed to influence the resurgence of attention
the United States gave smallpox at the end of the Cold War]{.underline}.
**[In the context of the breakup of the Soviet Union, U.S. national
security circles feared its deployment by so-called terrorist networks
and rogue states]{.underline}**. [The triumph of eradication, moreover,
had birthed a new dilemma: whether stocks of variola]{.underline} (the
virus that causes smallpox disease) [existed outside of]{.underline}
World Health Organization ([WHO]{.underline}) [knowledge, and thus
whether it should retain a few guarded stocks for prophylactic, research
purposes]{.underline}.36 The WHO would allow the United States and the
former Soviet Union to hold onto stocks of variola---for research
purposes---in their high-containment labs (the CDC and the Russian
Research Institute for Viral Preparations, respectively).37 **[Thus, the
public health triumph of smallpox eradication contorted, within the U.S.
national security community, into a problem of U.S.
vulnerability]{.underline}**---a population with little immunity to
smallpox and thus highly susceptible to a smallpox bioweapons attack.
[The post-9 / 11 era drastically escalated this post-eradication
specter, painting Iraq in particular as a looming threat.]{.underline}38
[This was extraordinarily ironic since the only military deployment of
smallpox has been by Europeans against Native Americans]{.underline}
([not to mention the false victimhood the United States adopted to
justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq]{.underline}). [This incongruity
notwithstanding, the United States embarked on hazardous research on the
variola virus]{.underline}---[namely, genetic engineering of novel
strains]{.underline}. **[These are strains to which]{.underline}**---by
virtue of their novelty---**[humans would have little or no
immunity]{.underline}**. As with other instances of pathogen
proliferation in the name of biodefense, the strategy was to prepare for
and pre-empt others who may be doing the same thing. In 2004, the United
States put forward a request to the WHO, in charge of overseeing
smallpox studies, for approval to conduct genetic engineering
experiments with variola, including creating cross-species hybrids by
splicing variola genes into the genomes of other orthopoxviruses; if
approved, it would change the 1994 WHO guideline banning such work (WHO
2004). This request was considered at the World Health Assembly meeting
in May 2005. [It met with substantial opposition from many countries
expressing concern about this escalation of research and potential
accidental escapes]{.underline}. [Nevertheless, the WHO approved all but
the most extreme genetic engineering activities]{.underline} (i.e., the
splicing of variola genes into other orthopoxviruses) (Enserink 2005).
[In 2007, the WHO finally banned all research involving genetic
engineering of the variola virus, after pushback by many member
countries and NGOs, particularly from the Global South,]{.underline}
including the Sunshine Project and the Third World Network, a
transnational development and environmental policy NGO based in Malaysia
(Third World Network 2007b). **[The U.S. push for genetic engineering
highlighted once again a faith in technoscience]{.underline}**---**[as
long as it remained under the purview of U.S. state
biosecurity]{.underline}**. [The United States, moreover, relaxed its
overall restraints on smallpox research in the post-9 / 11
climate]{.underline}---[by continuing to postpone destroying variola
stocks]{.underline}. Soon after the WHO agreed to allow the United
States and the former USSR to hold onto stocks of the variola virus for
research purposes in 1984, it had recommended their destruction once
sufficient information had been garnered. [In 1990, the WHO assessed
that enough research had been conducted (e.g., genome sequencing and
clone fragment libraries]{.underline}39[) and set a date for the
destruction of the remaining stocks]{.underline}---1993. [Yet, when that
time came, the WHO postponed destruction to 1995 due primarily to
pressure from the United States and Russia, both of which argued that
they still needed the stocks for further research and to develop new
countermeasures]{.underline}. Proponents of postponement even cited the
achievement of full genome sequencing---intended to obviate the need for
preserving viral samples---as presenting a new danger: scientists could
use this to re-create the variola virus (Mahy et al. 1993; Hammond
2007). **[Technoscientific advancement had generated more risk, yet
remained the mainstay of U.S. decision making in its pursuit to control
variola]{.underline}**. Over the years many nations and independent
organizations internationally as well as within the United States have
argued for the destruction of these remaining stocks to stem potential
proliferation of variola. But in the post-9 / 11 climate, the U.S.
biodefense community has only further entrenched its position to retain
the stocks in the name of national security. In 2002, after two
subsequent postponements, destruction of the stocks was postponed
indefinitely (Third World Network 2007b; WHO 1999). [The biosecurity
regime has been successful in shifting attention away from the dangers
that the research industry internally generates]{.underline}---[in the
form of lab accidents, leaks, and other mistakes, as well as
mal-intended deployment by industry insiders like Bruce Ivins, the white
male biodefense scientist who was the FBI's final suspect in the anthrax
mailings of 2001]{.underline}. **[It is precisely the buildup of
domestic U.S. biological warfare capacity that poses a tangible, grave
danger, domestically and internationally, to those intentionally
targeted by the U.S. national security regime]{.underline}**---Arabs,
Muslims, and other negatively racialized groups and nations---**[as well
as those affected by the biohazards of the research process
itself]{.underline}**---lab workers and others in physical proximity of
dangerous biological agents. [That the buildup continues despite these
severe costs attests to the power exerted by U.S. bio-imperialism and
the national security state and industry interests that drive
it]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- Jevon's Paradox

#### Tech can't solve environmental problems \-- Jevons paradox

**Alexander, 15**- lecturer at the Office for Environmental Programs at
the University of Melbourne who wrote his PhD thesis on degrowth (Samuel
Alexander, 2015, "Prosperous Descent: Crisis as Opportunity in an Age of
Limits," published by The Simplicity Institute, pg. 68-69)

This mainstream vision of how to achieve a sustainable world is coherent
in theory, at best, but demonstrably it does not reflect empirical
reality (see Alexander, 2014). [Although]{.underline} many [economies
around the world are]{.underline} indeed [getting better at producing
commodities more cleanly and efficiently]{.underline} (a process known
as 'relative decoupling'), [overall ecological impact is]{.underline}
nevertheless still [increasing, because]{.underline} every year
[increasing numbers of commodities are being produced, exchanged, and
consumed as a result of growing economies]{.underline} (Jackson, 2009,
Ch. 5). [We might have more fuel-efficient cars,]{.underline} for
example, [but]{.underline} the rebound effect is that [we are also
driving more and buying more cars. This is]{.underline} but [one example
of the **'Jevons paradox'**]{.underline} that **[permeates market
societies]{.underline}** and beyond (Polimeni et al., 2009) -- a
paradox, so-called, because **[a per unit reduction]{.underline}** in
the throughput of commodities **[does not]{.underline}** always **[lead
to reduced ecological impact, since]{.underline}** those **[efficiency
improvements are]{.underline}** often **[outweighed by]{.underline}**
the **[increasing amounts of commodities]{.underline}** that are
**[consumed]{.underline}** (Holm and Englund, 2009). [The implication of
this is that **technology and efficiency improvements are not going to
solve the ecological crisis**]{.underline}, as their most optimistic
advocates and popular consciousness seem to assume they can (Lovins,
1998) -- at least, not [unless]{.underline} the [highly developed
nations also transition away from growth economics.]{.underline}
Efficiency without sufficiency is lost.

### 2NC -- Ontology

#### Neoliberalism ontologically encloses us into capital worship -- be suspect of all of their defenses

**Joronen '13** -- University of Tampere, School of Management, Post-Doc
(Mikko, "Conceptualising New Modes of State Governmentality: Power,
Violence and the Ontological Mono-politics of Neoliberalism", 3/21/13,
Special Issue: Geopolitics of Changing State Spaces, Geopolitics, Volume
18, Issue 2, 2013, DOI:10.1080/14650045.2012.723289)

[The latter mechanism of ontological violence]{.underline}, in turn,
[refers to the inner logic of neoliberal enframing]{.underline}.
**[Neoliberalisation operates]{.underline}**, first, by **[reducing
political capabilities of individuals to the internalised rule of the
maximum economy, but also by moulding all things into reserves of
profits]{.underline}**. **[First of all, neoliberalisation violently
enframes human existence into bare reserves of human capital, which are
increasingly used by states in their tactics to succeed in global
competition]{.underline}**. [The neoliberal state,]{.underline}
governing its population by the means of encouraging economically
calculating subjectivity, is [not established out of the violent act of
territorial inclusion and order, but above all, out of the violent fact
of reducing human existence into usable capital.]{.underline}
[Second]{.underline}, as a drive to reveal things as profitable
reserves, [neoliberalisation violently divests natural entities from
their abrupt happening and phenomenological richness of
revealing]{.underline}. Altogether, [such reductions constitute the
post-political situation of neoliberal governmentality: they create a
world of technical solutions and politics-free zones abrogating the
politics of ontological revealing]{.underline}. The depoliticising
conduct of the neoliberal state is an ultimate political act, which
paradoxically establishes an anti-political abrogation of all political
acts through the concealment of the politics of ontological possibility.
[Such 'ontological mono-politics' thus intertwines with the first
mechanism of ontological violence: by fabricating the real, including
human existence, for the use of economic calculations and profits,
neoliberal governmentality monopolises a particular mode of revealing,
and thus, fades the ontological openness of being and its finite
Event]{.underline} (Ereignis) [to the background]{.underline}.

[What remains excluded in the process of neoliberal enframing, what
remains "outside" of its framework, is evidently no-thing ontic, but the
ontological openness of being]{.underline}. As the critical explorations
of neoliberalism in recent geographical literature have emphasised,
mainly by leaning on Marx, Harvey and a set of interpretations of
Foucault, **[neoliberalism should be conceptualised as an open and
unpredictable process of 'enclosure', as "a complex set of logics of
inclusion and exclusion operating through a variety of spatial
territories and networks]{.underline}**". 54 Instead of a fixed set of
doctrines and practices, [neoliberalisation is conceptualised as a
contingent process that works by enclosing a variety of subjects,
practices, technologies and materialities through different, even
conflicting, rationalities and spatialities]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
even as delegate contributions as these seem to fall short on
scrutinising the ontological characteristics involved in the process of
neoliberalisation, not to mention the evident absence of Heidegger\'s
work, which also Foucault, though with cryptic and non-explicated
manner, admitted as being a central influence on his own thinking. 55
[Although neoliberalism is conceptualised as a flexible and contingent
process emerging through the unlimited number of unpredictable
enclosure]{.underline}s, from the Heideggerian perspective,
[neoliberalism is not so much a dialectical process of inclusion and
exclusion,]{.underline} 56 [but a process of ontological mono-politics
enframing the real as such in terms of available, usable, orderable, and
makeable reserve]{.underline}. Instead of exclusion, [neoliberal
enframing works through total inclusion, where every-thing is revealed
as having the potential to become utilised. Things escaping the measures
of neoliberal enframing are revealed, not as excluded, but as
not-yet-enframed-and-utilised reserve]{.underline}s. **[Neoliberal
enframing is hence a process of ontological inclusion -- an ontological
drive towards the complete economic usability of things, where this
drive in itself is never under suspect.]{.underline}**2

#### The aff destroys the radical potentiality of the alternative by foreclosing life outside the political 

**Joronen '13** -- University of Tampere, School of Management, Post-Doc
(Mikko, "Conceptualising New Modes of State Governmentality: Power,
Violence and the Ontological Mono-politics of Neoliberalism", 3/21/13,
Special Issue: Geopolitics of Changing State Spaces, Geopolitics, Volume
18, Issue 2, 2013, DOI:10.1080/14650045.2012.723289)

Accordingly, [the process of neoliberalisation has not lead to the
degradation of state power, but has taken place particularly through the
reforms of state government]{.underline}. Although in a world of global
flows the state has become inextricably tied to the changes that cannot
be replied through the traditional forms of state sovereignty, [it is
precisely the state that has become a locus between the neoliberal
subjectification and the networks created by the global movements of
capital]{.underline}. As Foucault claims, 40 inasmuch as the neoliberal
homo economicus refers to a mode of government that needs to be
maintained through the institutions, **[administrative practices and the
internalisation of market rationalities, also the (global) space of
neoliberal markets, free of monopolies and interventions of the state,
can only exist through the active government and legal support of the
state]{.underline}**. [Neither globalisation of neoliberal markets nor
the government of the everyday life of individuals erodes the state or
turns it into what Thrift calls the 'phantom state']{.underline} -- a
state based on communicative power of electronic networks and few
selected glocalities, such as the world cities, driven by the money
power. 41 **[Neoliberalisation is rather in need of the state, not so
much of the sovereign power of the state, but of the state institutions
and practices de-politicising the population through the survival
strategies, which encourage conducts where people are treated as
'reserves of human capital' essential for the survival of the state in
the turmoil of global competition.]{.underline}**

[The rationality of neoliberal governmentality consists of a new human
anthropology and the support of the space of the
competition]{.underline}, [which both need to be maintained and kept
viable at all levels of society through different techniques, practices,
identities, and forms of visibilit]{.underline}y. The [neoliberalisation
of the state thus consists of a change in the way states increasingly
justify their existence: through the protection of the space of the
markets, by valuing the non-human entities as reserves of
profits]{.underline} (either as a natural resource or by framing the
'ecological' through 'economical'), and [through the process of
subjectification grounded on the human anthropology of homo
economicu]{.underline}s. **[Neoliberalisation of the
state]{.underline}**, then, **[denotes an increasing use of the
strategies of government constituted through the particular mode of
power: the strategic programming of individual conducts on a basis of
economic rationality]{.underline}**. This however, as Foucault warns us
in Security, Territory, Population, 42 does not mean that the sovereign
and disciplinary modes of power are now somehow eliminated from the
world. We should not think that the disciplinary society has replaced
the society of sovereignty, or that the disciplinary society is now
being entirely eliminated by the rise of the society of governmental
management, but instead to explore the complex ways of their "demonic
combination". 43

[The violence intrinsic to the neoliberal state]{.underline}, to its
ways of economising nature and the everyday life of individuals, is
[fundamentally based on the ontological enframing of human and non-human
life through the actualisation of different]{.underline} (demonic)
[combinations of practices, materialities, rationalities, power
relations, and spatial formations]{.underline}. As Giorgio Agamben has
argued, by being self-consciously Heideggerian, Foucault\'s
understanding of the historical regimes of power is grounded on a more
original relation between the constituted (or actualised) forms of power
and the constituting power of potentiality. **[While the constituting
power works as a condition of possibility for the constituted modes of
power to emerge, all historical actualisations of power intrinsically
depend on the suspension of the potentialities of constituting power, on
their concealment.]{.underline}** 44 In this sense, constituting power
has a similar ontological structure with Aristotle\'s notion of
potentiality: it maintains itself without ever fully passing into
actuality, without being exhausted into actualisations. 45

It is not my intention here to go into details of Agamben\'s complex and
nuanced argument in Homo Sacer, but instead to emphasise, as Agamben\'s
re-reading of the distinction between potentiality and actuality
indicates, how [the coalescence of state power with neoliberal
governmentality constitutes politics at the domain of ontology. The
constituting power does not merely refer to the ontological possibility
for the constituted modes of constituted power, but also to the
fundamental possibility for the political action as such]{.underline}.
Accordingly, also the question of resistance needs to be explored and
confronted at this proper level of ontology: as a question of
existential resistance.

In order to scrutinise the ontological implications Agamben\'s
distinction has for the question of existential resistance, [it is
essential to pay attention to what Agamben calls in Homo Sacer the 'life
of possibility'. **It is life that opposes the operations of constituted
power: it constitutes an inexhaustible possibility, which can be never
entirely corralled into constituted forms of political
power**]{.underline}**.** **[The power of potentiality in
life]{.underline}**, thus, denotes **[a power to constitute, a
possibility to ground new modes of life, to be otherwise]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Red Innovation

#### Communism spurs [more]{.underline} and [better]{.underline} innovation than capitalism -- all "innovation" under capital has been due to [restricting]{.underline} corporate decision-making, not the free market

Tony **Smith '15**, is a professor of philosophy at Iowa State
University and the author of Technology and Capital in the Age of Lean
Production., "Red Innovation", Jacobin, 3/31/15,
https://jacobinmag.com/2015/03/socialism-innovation-capitalism-smith

[The technological dynamism of capitalism has always been a powerful
argument in its defense]{.underline}. **[But one of its secrets is that
at the heart of this change we find neither bold entrepreneurs, venture
capitalists, nor established firms.]{.underline}**

**[Investments pushing the frontiers of scientific knowledge are just
too risky]{.underline}**. The advances sought may not be forthcoming.
Those that do occur may not ever be commercially viable. **[Any
potentially profitable results that do arise may take decades to make
any money. And when they finally do, there are no guarantees initial
investors will appropriate most of the resulting
windfall]{.underline}**.

**[There is]{.underline}**, accordingly, **[a powerful tendency for
private capital to systematically underinvest in long-term research and
development]{.underline}**. **[Despite popular perceptions that private
entrepreneurs drive technological innovation, the leading regions of the
global economy do not leave the most important stages of technological
change to private investors]{.underline}**. [These costs are
socialized]{.underline}.

In the quarter-century after World War II, the high profits garnered by
American corporations due to their exceptional place in the world market
allowed corporate labs to engage in "blue-skies research" projects. But
even then**[, public funding accounted for roughly two-thirds of all
research and development expenditures in the United States, creating the
foundations for the high-tech sectors of today.]{.underline}**

With the rise of competition from Japanese and European capital in the
1970s, private-sector funding of research and development increased.
However, long-term projects were almost entirely abandoned in favor of
product development and applied-research projects promising commercial
advantages in the short-to-medium term.

[**Basic research continued to be funded by the government, like the
work in molecular biology that supported the move of agribusiness
companies into biotechnology.** The same was true for projects of
special interest to the Pentagon]{.underline} --- [the developments
associated with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, for
instance, which paved the way for modern global positioning
systems]{.underline} --- [and other government agencies]{.underline}.

**[But medium-to-long-term R&D in general was in great danger of falling
into a "valley of death" between basic research and immediate
development, with neither the government nor private capital providing
significant funding for it]{.underline}**.

[For all their rhetoric touting the "magic of the marketplace," those in
the Reagan administration recognized market failure when they saw it.
They began to offer federal and publicly funded university laboratories
various carrots and sticks to undertake long-term R&D for US
capital]{.underline}.

New programs were created to provide start-ups with resources to develop
innovations prior to the "proof of concept" required by venture
capitalists. Under Reagan, the Small Business Innovation Development Act
even mandated that federal agencies set aside a percentage of their R&D
budget to fund research by small firms. These and other forms of
public-private partnership have granted US capital enormous competitive
advantages in the world market.

It's no surprise that Apple's tremendously successful line of products
--- iPads, iPhones, and iPods --- incorporate twelve key innovations.
All twelve (central processing units, dynamic random-access memory,
hard-drive disks, liquid-crystal displays, batteries, digital single
processing, the Internet, the HTTP and HTML languages, cellular
networks, GPS system, and voice-user AI programs) were developed by
publicly funded research and development projects.

**[It hasn't been the dynamics of the market so much as active state
intervention that has fueled technological change.]{.underline}**

The Promised Golden Age

**[Technology is more than just a weapon for inter-capitalist
competition; it is a weapon in struggles between capital and
labor]{.underline}**. **[Technological changes that create unemployment,
de-skill the workforce, and enable one sector of the workforce to be
played against another shift the balance of power in capital's
favor]{.underline}**. Given this asymmetry, **[advances in productivity
that could reduce work time while expanding real wages lead instead to
forced layoffs, increasing stress for those still employed and eroding
real wages]{.underline}**.

[Two ongoing technological developments further strengthen the power of
capital. Advances in transportation and communication now enable
production and distribution chains to be extended across the globe,
allowing capital to implement "divide and conquer" strategies against
labor to an unprecedented extent]{.underline}.

Astounding new labor-saving machines are also becoming more and more
inexpensive. A recent exhaustive study of over seven hundred occupations
concluded that no less than 47 percent of employment in the United
States is at high risk of being automated within two decades. Anything
approaching this level of labor displacement will yield more misery, not
progress, for ordinary workers.

[But the lower cost and higher capacities of machines have also led to
change of a better sort]{.underline}. [As the prices of computer
hardware, software, and Internet connections have declined, many people
can now create new "knowledge products" without working for big
capitalists]{.underline}.

**[Multitudes across the globe now freely choose to contribute to
collective innovation projects of interest to them, outside the
relationship of capital and wage labor]{.underline}**. The resulting
products can now be distributed as unlimited free goods to anyone who
wishes to use them, rather than being scarce commodities sold for
profit.

**[It is beyond dispute that this new form of social labor has generated
innovations superior in quality and scale to the output of capitalist
firms]{.underline}**. These innovations also tend to be qualitatively
different.

**[While technological developments in capitalism primarily address the
wants and needs of those with disposable income, open-source projects
can mobilize creative energies to address areas capital systematically
neglects, such as developing seeds for poor farmers or medicines for
those without the money to buy existing medications]{.underline}**.
**[The potential of this new form of collective social labor to address
pressing social needs across the globe is historically
unprecedented.]{.underline}**

In order to flourish, however, open-source innovation requires free
access to existing knowledge goods[. Leading capital firms, hoping to
extend their ability to privately profit from publicly supported
research, have used their immense political power to extend the
intellectual property rights regime in scope and enforcement, severely
restricting the access open-source projects require]{.underline}.
Copyright, after all, was extended for twenty years at the turn of the
century, just as Internet access was starting to balloon.

**[Despite these barriers, the success of open-source projects shows
that intellectual-property rights are not required for
innovation]{.underline}**. Further evidence is provided by the fact that
most scientific and technological workers engaged in innovation are
forced to sign away intellectual property rights as a condition of
employment. **[These rights actually hamper advancement by raising the
cost of engaging in the production of new knowledge, and by diverting
funds to unproductive legal costs]{.underline}**.

The World is Flat?

**[Capitalism also hampers the ability of much of the world to
contribute to technological advancement]{.underline}**. **[Whole regions
of the global economy lack the wealth to support meaningful
innovation]{.underline}**. Today, **[only four countries spend over 3
percent of their GDP on research and development]{.underline}**; a mere
six others devote 2 percent or more.

[Capital in these advantaged regions has the opportunity to establish a
virtuous circle, free-riding on the extensive public investment
discussed above]{.underline}. [Privileged access to advanced R&D enables
capitalists to appropriate high returns on successful innovations; these
returns allow those companies to make effective use of technological
advances in the next cycle, setting the stage for future
profits]{.underline}.

**[At the same time, enterprises in poorer regions, lacking access to
high-level R&D, find themselves trapped in a vicious
cycle]{.underline}**. Their present inability to make significant
innovations that would enable them to compete successfully in world
markets undercuts their future prospects. Only a handful of countries
--- such as South Korea and Taiwan --- have ever been able to move
forward from this starting disadvantage.

[Global disparities in technological change alone do not explain why 1
percent of people in the world now own 48 percent of global wealth. But
they are a major part of the story; technological change is a weapon
that enables the privileged to maintain and extend their global
advantages over time]{.underline}.

Creative Non-Destruction

**[The destructive effects examined above are not necessary features of
technological change; they are necessary features of technological
change in capitalism. Overcoming them requires overcoming
capitalism]{.underline}**, even if we only have a provisional sense of
what that might mean.

[The pernicious tendencies associated with technological change in
capitalist workplaces are rooted in a structure where managers are
agents of the owners of the firm's assets, with a fiduciary duty to
further their private interests]{.underline}.

But a society's means of production are not goods for personal
consumption, like a toothbrush. The material reproduction of society is
an inherently public matter, as the technological development of
capitalism itself, resting on public funds, confirms. **[Capital
markets, where private claims to productive resources are bought and
sold, treat public power as if it were just another item for personal
use. They can, and should, be totally done away with]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Sustainability

#### Capitalism is [terminally]{.underline} unsustainable and [guarantees]{.underline} global extinction from climate change -- its try or die to develop a new socioeconomic system

Asher **Moses '20**, is the editor Voice of Action, the newspaper for
the working classes., "'Collapse of Civilisation is the Most Likely
Outcome': Top Climate Scientists", Resilience, 6/8/20,
https://www.resilience.org/stories/2020-06-08/collapse-of-civilisation-is-the-most-likely-outcome-top-climate-scientists/

**[Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]{.underline}**, director emeritus
and founder of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research,
**[believes if we go much above 2°C we will quickly get to 4°C anyway
because of the tipping points and feedbacks, which would spell the end
of human civilisation]{.underline}**.

"**[There is a very big risk that we will just end our
civilisation]{.underline}**": Professor Schellnhuber

Johan [Rockström]{.underline}, the head of one of Europe's leading
research institutes, [warned in 2019 that in a 4°C-warmer world it would
be "difficult to see how we could accommodate a billion people or even
half of that]{.underline} ... [There will be a rich minority of people
who survive with modern lifestyles, no doubt, but it will be a
turbulent, conflict-ridden world".]{.underline}

Schellnhuber, one of the world's leading authorities on climate change,
said that if we continue down the present path "there is a very big risk
that we will just end our civilisation. The human species will survive
somehow but we will destroy almost everything we have built up over the
last two thousand years."

**[Schellnhuber said in a recent interview that the IPCC report stating
we could stay below 1.5°C of warming was "slightly dishonest" because it
relies on immense negative emissions]{.underline}** (**[pulling CO2 out
of the air]{.underline}**) **[which was not viable at global
scale]{.underline}**. He said 1.5°C was no longer achievable but it was
still possible to stay under 2°C with massive changes to society.

[If we don't bend the emissions curve down substantially before 2030
then keeping temperatures under 2°C becomes unavoidable]{.underline}.
The "carbon law" published in the journal Science in 2017 found that, to
hold warming below 2°C, emissions would need to be cut in half between
2020 and 2030.

Steffen told Voice of Action that **[the three main challenges to
humanity]{.underline}** -- **[climate change, the degradation of the
biosphere and the growing inequalities between and among
countries]{.underline}** -- **[were "just different facets of the same
fundamental problem".]{.underline}**

**[This problem was the "neoliberal economic system" that spread across
the world through globalisation, underpinning "high production high
consumption lifestyles" and a "religion built not around eternal life
but around eternal growth".]{.underline}**

"**[It is becoming abundantly clear that (i) this system is incompatible
with a well-functioning Earth System at the planetary level; (ii) this
system is eroding human- and societal-well being, even in the wealthiest
countries, and (iii) collapse is the most likely outcome of the present
trajectory of the current system]{.underline}**, as prophetically
modelled in 1972 in the Limits to Growth work," Steffen told Voice of
Action.

**[Eternal growth is not possible]{.underline}**

The Limits to Growth model released by the Club of Rome in 1972 looked
at the interplay between food production, industry, population,
non-renewable resources and pollution.

The basic findings were that you can't grow the system indefinitely as
you will cause environmental and resource issues that will ultimately
cause the whole global system to collapse (ABC's This Day Tonight
program covered it here). At the time of the model's release it
accurately reproduced the historical data from 1900 to 1970.

A 2008 study by Graham Turner, then a senior CSIRO research scientist,
used three decades of real-world historical data to conclude that the
Limits to Growth model's predictions were coming to pass: "30 years of
historical data compare favourably with key features of a
business-as-usual \[BAU\] scenario called the 'standard run' scenario,
which results in collapse of the global system midway through the 21st
century."

Former CSIRO scientist Graham Turner has been warning about collapse for
decades

Turner ran updated figures through the model again in 2012 for another
peer-reviewed paper, and again in 2014 when he had joined the University
of Melbourne's Sustainable Society Institute.

"Data from the forty years or so since the LTG study was completed
indicates that the world is closely tracking the BAU scenario," Turner
concluded in the 2014 paper.

"It is notable that there does not appear to be other
economy-environment models that have demonstrated such comprehensive and
long-term data agreement."

Turner semi-retired in 2015 but runs a small organic market garden on a
rural property in the NSW south coast's Bega Valley.

He and his wife grow most of their own food and live off grid powered by
a solar energy system. Turner said this saved him during last summer's
catastrophic bushfires as his power stayed online but most people in the
area lost power for weeks.

Turner has continued tracking the data as best as possible since his
last official report in 2014, and last year he helped a Harvard masters
student update the data for their thesis.

Turner told Voice of Action that **[under his modelling the business as
usual scenario "ends up resulting in a global collapse from about now
through the next decade or so".]{.underline}**

[It was difficult to predict a timeline but Turner said he believed
"there's an extremely strong case that we may be in the early stages of
a collapse right at the moment]{.underline}".

"Vested interests and corrupt politicians combined with a population
happy to deny problems overwhelm those that are trying to promulgate
truth and facts," said Turner.

Fossil fuel emissions continue to rise

'**[By 2030 we'll know what path we've taken]{.underline}**'

Steffen told Voice of Action that it's "highly likely that by 2030 we'll
know what pathway we've taken", "the pathway towards sustainability or
the current pathway towards likely collapse".

"**[I think the 'fork in the road' will come in this decade, probably
not a single point in time but as a series of events]{.underline}**,"
said Steffen.

Steffen told Voice of Action he believes **[collapse "will likely not
come as a dramatic global collapse, but rather as overall deterioration
in many features of life, with regional collapses occurring here and
there".]{.underline}**

"For example, **[it appears that the USA is entering a long period of
decline in many aspect of its society, with a potential for a more rapid
collapse in the coming decade]{.underline}**," said Steffen.

Samuel Alexander, a lecturer with the University of Melbourne and
research fellow at the Melbourne Sustainable Society Institute, told
Voice of Action that the coming collapse would not be a single black or
white event.

"[With respect to civilisations, what is more likely is that we have
entered a stage of what JM Greer calls 'catabolic collapse' -- where we
face decades of ongoing crises, as the existing mode of civilisation
deteriorates, but then recovers as governments and civil society tries
to respond, and fix things, and keep things going for a bit
longer]{.underline}," said Alexander.

"**[Capitalism is quite good at dodging bullets and escaping temporary
challenges to its legitimacy and viability. But its condition, I feel is
terminal]{.underline}**."

Alexander, who studies the economic, political and cultural challenges
of living on a full planet in an age of limits, believes [the future
will be "post-growth / post capitalist / post-industrial in some
form".]{.underline}

"**[The future will like arrive in part by design and in part by
disaster. Our challenge is to try to constitute the future through
planning and community action, not have the future constitute
us]{.underline}**," said Alexander.

Alexander said that it would never be "too late" to act sensibly as
whether we're trying to avoid or manage collapse there is lots of work
to be done ("a 3 degree future is better than a 4 degree future").

Steffen believes **[the current US mass uprisings are not a sign of
collapse but one of "growing instability]{.underline}**".

Alexander said **[it was a sign of "steam building up within a closed
system". Without bold grassroots and political action we were "likely to
see explosions of civil unrest increasingly as things continue to
deteriorate"]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- AT: Green Growth/Decoupling 

**Absolute decoupling is necessary but impossible\-\--efficiency
limitations, input substitution, and financialization export
environmental impacts.**

**Ward \'16** \[James; //; Associate Professor at the School of Natural
and Built Environments at University of South Australia, Ph.D. in
environmental science from the Flinders University, et al.; \"Is
Decoupling GDP Growth from Environmental Impact Possible?\"
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164733/\]

The perpetually growing economy is generally regarded as a viable and
desirable societal objective \[1--4\]. [Whilst '**infinite growth'** may
not be the words used]{.underline} to characterize and exhort a
perpetually growing economy, [they are nonetheless]{.underline} an
[accurate]{.underline} characterization of the objective. The [words in
current fashion for defending the viability of a perpetually growing
economy are phrases such as '**green growth**]{.underline}'[,
'**dematerialization**]{.underline}'[, and '**decoupling**]{.underline}'
\[5--9\]. The decades old question 'Is economic growth environmentally
sustainable?' remains contested despite its apparent simplicity. The
Limits to Growth \[10\] was a seminal work that warned of the
consequences of exponential growth with finite resources. The World3
models underpinning the Limits to Growth analysis were validated using
actual data after twenty and thirty years \[11,12\]. A further
independent evaluation of the projections of the World3 models showed
that our actual trajectory since 1972 has closely matched the 'Business
as Usual' scenario \[13\]. Increasing recognition of the causes and
consequences of climate change have generated a great deal of doubt
regarding the feasibility of simultaneously pursing economic growth and
preventing and/or mitigating climate change \[14--18\]. [Contemporary
work in this broad area of assessing **anthropogenic
impact**]{.underline} [on the planet suggests that several 'Planetary
Boundaries' have been crossed]{.underline} \[19\].

The question as to whether human society can decouple economic
growth--defined as growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP)--from
environmental impacts has not been settled. The decoupling debate itself
is polarized with a preponderance of neo-classical economists on one
side (decoupling is viable) and ecological economists on the other
(decoupling is not viable) \[20\]. The divide over the compatibility of
economic growth and environms sental limits extends into the general
public \[2\] with substantial polarization in ideas of decoupling,
dematerialization, and limits to growth.

Settling the debate has far reaching policy implications. [Decoupling is
increasingly being described in popular press as a viable policy
objective]{.underline} \[21,22\]. [Decoupling has been incorporated into
international indicators of sustainable development]{.underline} \[23\]
[and policy objectives]{.underline} such as the United Nations'
'Sustainable Development Goals' \[24\]. If decoupling is possible, then
these policies are valid sustainable goals; however, [if decoupling is
shown to be **nonviable** then society will need to shift away from the
current 'infinite growth' model]{.underline}.

[Decoupling is defined as either 'relative']{.underline} (aka 'weak')
[or 'absolute']{.underline} (aka 'strong'). [Relative decoupling refers
to higher rates of economic growth than rates of growth in material and
energy consumption and environmental impact]{.underline}. As a result,
relative decoupling implies a gain in efficiency rather than removal of
the link between impact and GDP. Recent trends (1990 to 2012) for GDP
\[25\], material use \[26\] and energy use \[27\] in different countries
and regions exhibit different behavior (Fig 1). In China, relative
decoupling has occurred as GDP (market prices, in current US\$)
increased by a factor of more than 20 over the 22-year period, while
energy use rose by a factor of slightly more than four and material use
by almost five. Germany, meanwhile, exhibited slower GDP growth than
China, but at the same time reduced energy use by 10% and total material
use by 40%. The OECD follows a similar story to Germany, albeit with
flat rather than falling energy and material consumption. Although
Germany and the OECD give hope that absolute decoupling may be
achievable, at the global level we see only relative decoupling with
energy and material use increasing by 54% and 66% over the 22 years,
respectively.

Similar evidence to that in Fig 1, showing apparent decoupling of GDP
from specific resources, has been shown throughout much of the OECD
\[28\]. However, [there are several limitations to the inference of
decoupling from national or regional data]{.underline}. [There are three
distinct mechanisms by which the illusion of decoupling may be presented
as a reality when in fact it is not actually taking place at
all]{.underline}: [1)]{.underline} **[substitution of one resource for
another]{.underline}**; [2)]{.underline} [the **financialization** of
one or more components]{.underline} of GDP that involves increasing
monetary flows without a concomitant rise in material and/or energy
throughput, [and 3)]{.underline} [the **exporting of environmental
impact** to another nation or region of the world]{.underline} (i.e. the
separation of production and consumption). These illusory forms of
decoupling are described with respect to energy by our colleague \[29\].

An additional mechanism of decoupling is associated with growing
inequality of income and wealth, which can allow GDP to grow overall
while the majority of workers do not see a real gain in income \[30\].
This growth in inequality can manifest as higher GDP without a
proportional increase in material and energy flow (i.e. relative
decoupling) when a wealthy minority of the population derives the
largest fraction of GDP growth but does not necessarily increase their
level of consumption with as much demand for energy and materials
\[31\]. In such cases, at the aggregate level decoupling would be
observed, but it is doubtful that such unequal sharing of growth in GDP
represents an improvement in wellbeing.

At [the World]{.underline} aggregate level, Fig 1 [shows relative
decoupling]{.underline} with a growing gap between GDP and resource
consumption. [In the context of]{.underline} reaching **[planetary
boundaries]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[global environmental
limits]{.underline}**, however, [relative decoupling will be
**insufficient to maintain a GDP growth-oriented human civilization**.
The only way to achieve truly sustainable growth would be]{.underline}
via permanent [absolute decoupling]{.underline}. Absolute decoupling
theoretically occurs when environmental impacts are reduced while
economic growth continues. While relative decoupling has been observed
in multiple countries, **[absolute decoupling remains
elusive]{.underline}** \[32--34\]. According to one study \[35\] [no
country has achieved absolute decoupling during the past 50
years]{.underline}. Another study \[36\] reports that population growth
and increases in affluence are overwhelming efficiency improvements at
the global scale. They find no evidence for absolute reductions in
environmental impacts, and little evidence to date even for significant
relative decoupling.

It should be noted that [technological advances can lead to absolute
decoupling for specific types of impact]{.underline} \[37\]. It is
possible, for instance, to substitute a polluting activity with a
non-polluting activity, and notable examples have included the removal
of tetraethyl lead from automotive fuel and CFCs from refrigerants and
propellants. [It is also possible to envisage a scenario in which GDP
growth is decoupled from the use of fossil fuels]{.underline} and
related CO2 emissions [by switching to 100% renewable energy, but this
is not the same as decoupling GDP growth from energy use]{.underline}.
In the context of this study, we are primarily interested in fundamental
resources (matter and energy) as the foundations of economic activity.

In the current paper, we show that decoupling scenarios can be
interpreted using an easily understood model of economic growth and
environmental impact. The simple model was calibrated against published
data derived from sophisticated predictive studies of decoupling, and
used to develop a long-term prognosis of environmental impact under
continued GDP growth. The results are then used to draw conclusions
about the long-term viability of GDP growth as a societal goal.

Model Derivation

We use a simple mathematical model to develop insights into decoupling
behavior. We start with the IPAT equation \[38--40\], which is a basic
formulation of environmental impact I as a function of economic
activity:

\(1\)

where P is population, A is affluence (GDP per capita in \$/person/year)
and T, as originally formulated, represents "technology". More
precisely, however, T should be viewed as the economic intensity of a
particular resource or pollutant, and therefore both T and I will have
different units depending on which resource or pollutant is considered.
For energy, appropriate units for T may be joules per \$ of GDP; for
material use T may be kilograms per \$ of GDP. The terms T and I
can--and should--thus be evaluated separately, with appropriate units,
for individual resources such as farming land, fresh water and energy
resources, and/or pollutant emissions such as sulphur dioxide, lead, or
carbon dioxide.

To test the hypothesis that continual GDP growth can be sustained, we
only require a scenario in which GDP increases exponentially. The
economy (as GDP) can thus be simplified to G = PA, leading to Ij = GTj
where Ij and Tj are the impact and economic intensity, respectively, of
resource or pollutant j. A simple case is one in which both population
(P) and affluence (A) are increasing exponentially, but other
combinations (e.g. stationary population with rising affluence) could
achieve the same result of rising GDP. There are, of course, scenarios
that could lead to falling GDP (e.g. declining population with constant
affluence, or both falling) but our investigation is directed explicitly
at testing the sustainability of continual economic growth as a societal
goal. As such, we assume G at time t is given by:

\(2\)

where G0 is the initial GDP at time t = 0, and k is the growth rate per
year. Hence, impact (for resource or pollutant j) over time is given as:

\(3\)

If there is no technological change to reduce a particular impact (i.e.
Tj = constant; no decoupling), the use of resources or pollutant
emissions will rise exponentially, in keeping with GDP growth. For
absolute decoupling from resource or pollutant j, Tj must decrease
exponentially at the same rate as GDP growth such that Ij remains
constant in time, i.e.:

\(4\)

where Tj,0 is the initial level of economic intensity of resource or
pollutant j.

Put simply, absolute decoupling from resource or pollutant j requires Tj
to decrease by at least the same annual percentage as the economy is
growing. For example, if k = 0.03 (steady 3% p.a. economic growth), Tj
must reduce 20-fold over 100 years, 100-fold over 150 years, and
500-fold over 200 years, and continue this trend of exponential
reduction as long as the economy is growing. If Tj were to decrease at a
faster rate than GDP growth, the impact Ij would decline.

For non-substitutable resources such as land, water, raw materials and
energy, we argue that whilst efficiency gains may be possible, there are
minimum requirements for these resources that are ultimately governed by
physical realities: for instance the photosynthetic limit to plant
productivity and maximum trophic conversion efficiencies for animal
production govern the minimum land required for agricultural output;
physiological limits to crop water use efficiency govern minimum
agricultural water use, and the upper limits to energy and material
efficiencies govern minimum resource throughput required for economic
production. Therefore a more appropriate formulation of Eq (4) is to
allow Tj to decrease to an ultimate value, Tult ≥ 0, as follows:

\(5\)

where Tj,ult is the ultimate resource use intensity, and rj is the rate
of exponential decline, for resource or pollutant j. In cases where
decoupling is occurring, Tj,ult \< Tj,0. However, cases where resource
use intensity is increasing towards an upper limit can be accommodated
with Tj,ult \> Tj,0.

The nature of decoupling behavior for different types of resource can be
readily predicted from the relationships between rj, k, Tj,ult and Tj,0
as summarized in Table 1. It is only those resources or pollutants for
which rj \> k and Tj,ult \< Tj,0 (i.e. efficiency gains are possible and
can be achieved faster than the economy is growing) that a period of
decoupling can be expected.

Model Application

A recent predictive study \[41\] concluded that Australia could--through
adoption of specific policies--"achieve strong economic growth to 2050
... in scenarios where environmental pressures fall or are stable" (this
study is referred to as "H-D" hereafter). That paper summarized the
results of a significant project, the 2015 Australian National Outlook
\[42\] published by the Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO), and represents a high-profile, contemporary study
in decoupling. In all of their modelled scenarios, both population and
gross national income per capita increased. In their strong abatement
scenario (called "Stretch"), various forms of decoupling behavior were
predicted. We will use the Stretch scenario from H-D as a case study in
decoupling, and will use Eq (5) to further explore the behavior of
energy and material use and implications for longer-term impact. The
data used in H-D's historical and projected scenarios are all available
in their Supplementary Information files that accompanied their original
publication. Likewise, the data and model results for the following
analysis can all be found in the S1 File accompanying this paper.

We begin by calibrating the decline rate rj from Eq (5) against H-D's
historical energy use (j = 1) and material extraction (j = 2). The term
Tj for each resource is found by dividing GDP (G) by resource use (Ij)
on a yearly timestep. For energy, units are MJ per thousand \$AUD
(2010). T1,0 = 3.783, equal to the value of T1 in the year 1980. The
ultimate resource use intensity T1,ult is unknown, and depends on future
technological advances. To account for this uncertainty, three scenarios
are adopted: high decoupling (T1,ult = 0.25 T1(2010) = 0.704), medium
decoupling (Tult = 0.5T1(2010) = 1.408) and low decoupling (Tult = 0.75
T1(2010) = 2.113). Under each of the three T1,ult scenarios, Eq (5) is
used to predict T1, and is calibrated by varying the single unknown
parameter (the decline rate, r1) to give the best fit between our T1
(predicted) and T1 (historical) derived from H-D's data. The calibration
was performed using the free statistical package "R"
(https://www.r-project.org) with the in-built Non-Linear Least Squares
function.

All three scenarios reproduce the observed downward trend in T1.
Calibrated declines rates with standard error (in brackets) were 1.24%
(± 0.05%), 1.70% (± 0.07%) and 2.66% (± 0.13%) for high, medium and low
respectively. The result is a simple calibrated model that can be used
to project forward based on recent trends, for the purpose of comparing
against the more complex modelling scenarios from H-D. The results are
shown in Fig 2(A), with the modelled T1 values projected to 2050. The
decoupling predicted by H-D is also shown (taking T1 as their predicted
impact divided by their predicted GDP). Clearly H-D predict stronger
decoupling than our strongest case. In terms of the simplified IPAT
model, even for our most optimistic T1,ult scenario, this implies a
change to a greater decline rate than can be obtained merely by
calibrating against historical trends.

In the case of material extraction, T2 has been increasing over recent
years; in other words, according to H-D's historical data, material use
has not been on a decoupling trajectory in Australia. This is not
unexpected, reflecting Australia's strong dependence on its extractive
industries. However, it means that in order to obtain a good fit to
historical data, T2,ult must be greater than T2,0. The units of T2 are
tonnes of material extracted per thousand \$AUD (2010), and T2,0 = 1.091
in the year 1980. Three scenarios are adopted as an upper bound to
future material intensity: low (T2,ult = 1.25T2(2010) = 1.513), medium
(T2,ult = 1.50T2(2010) = 1.815) and high (T2,ult = 2.00T2(2010) =
2.420). As before, the model is calibrated by finding the decline rate
r2 for each T2,ult scenario. The scenarios calibrate well in all three
scenarios with r2 = 2.75% (± 0.47%), 1.36% (± 0.22%) and 0.68% (± 0.11%)
for low, medium and high T2,ult scenarios respectively. Fig 2(B) shows
the historical and modelled T2 values, plus H-D's projection to 2050.
The profound deviation from long-term trends reflects the assumptions
embedded within H-D's Stretch scenario, which anticipates major policy
changes and a shift toward very different forms of production.

The results of calibrating Eq (5) to historical data are inconclusive;
uncertainty in T1,ult and T2,ult makes long-term projections unreliable.
In any case, historical observations of decoupling at national levels
are fraught, for the reasons articulated earlier. We conclude that
simplistically extrapolating historical trends is not a reliable
technique for projecting future decoupling behavior. Moreover, the
sophisticated analysis of H-D suggests that deviations from historical
trends in Tj may be plausible, as shown in Figs 2 and 3. Hence from here
onward we will focus on the Stretch scenario from H-D and assume it is a
plausible future of rapid technological development and proactive policy
settings, which could lead to rapid decoupling from energy and material
use.

In order to re-calibrate Eq (5) to create a more useful long-term
projection, we use the period 2015--2050 in H-D's Stretch scenario. The
scenario already contains embedded assumptions regarding strong
efficiency gains (30% drop in energy intensity and almost 70% drop in
material intensity by 2050). As with the historical calibration, T1 and
T2 are taken as H-D's predicted energy and material use, I1 and I2
respectively, divided by their predicted GDP. We adopt a single Tj,ult
scenario for each resource, and arbitrarily assume resource use
intensity can be reduced to 50% of the Tj attained by H-D's model in
2050, giving values of T1,ult = 0.881 MJ per thousand \$AUD and T2,ult =
0.139 tonnes per thousand \$AUD. The decline rates rj are calibrated in
the same manner as above.

Fig 3 shows the calibrated model runs, with a projection to 2100.
Calibrated decline rates are r1 = 2.06% (± 0.12%) and r2 = 5.59% (±
0.11%) for final energy demand and material extraction, respectively. A
95% confidence interval on each Tj prediction is obtained by performing
additional model runs using upper and lower values for rj (mean ± 1.96 ×
SE); this is included as a coloured band around each solid coloured line
in Fig 3, but is only clearly visible on T1, being too narrow to see on
T2. Finally, to check the appropriateness of our Tj,ult scenarios, a
further calibration is performed by varying both rj and Tj,ult. This
allows us to estimate the ultimate resource intensity if technology
followed the trend projected by H-D, giving calibrated values T1,ult =
1.64 (± 0.05) and T2,ult = 0.19 (± 0.01). From this we can see that our
projection is more optimistic than the Stretch scenario of H-D (which
was their most optimistic scenario), and we proceed on the basis that
our modelled conditions must be considered extremely favorable to
decoupling.

Fig 4 shows values of Tj inferred for current energy and total material
use across a range of countries, in order to provide some context to the
future decoupling scenarios being modelled. It is clear that by this
measure, Australia is already one of the most energy-efficient economies
in the world. H-D project that by 2050 Australia will improve further,
to be on par with Denmark and Sweden today, and our chosen T1,ult value
assumes Australia can ultimately become more energy-efficient (per unit
GDP) than any country on the planet today. With respect to material use,
H-D project that by 2050 Australia will have completely transformed from
being one of the most materially intensive economies today, to being one
of mid-range material intensity (by current measures). Our assumption of
a 50% further reduction in T2,ult would place Australia\'s ultimate
material efficiency at a level equivalent to high-income countries today
that have relatively low dependence on extractive industries, such as
New Zealand. These assumptions can indeed be viewed as an extremely
optimistic scenario of future technological improvement.

The calibrated model can now be used to explore the potential future
evolution of resource use under continued economic growth. For this
projection, the growth rate k = 2.41%, which is the average GDP growth
rate from 2015 to 2050 in H-D's Stretch scenario. Fig 5 shows the
modelled projection of impact Ij to 2100. Projected GDP at the end of
the century is 7.7 times its 2015 level. Material extractions and final
energy demand in 2100 are up 29% (95% confidence interval 28.4--30.7%)
and 256% (95% confidence interval 241--273%) respectively, relative to
2015 levels. Considering the embedded optimistic assumptions for Tj,ult,
this result is a robust rebuttal to the claim of absolute decoupling.
Fig 5 also includes the projections for Ij using the model in which both
rj and Tult were calibrated (i.e. most closely reproducing the trends in
H-D's projections). Using that model, energy demand in 2100 would be
five times higher than in 2015, and material extraction would rise by
71%.

Importantly, as Tj moves towards a constant value (Tj,ult), the growth
rate of Ij approaches the economic growth rate k. Thus, whilst in 2015
the growth rates for material extraction and final energy demand (-1.87%
and +1.47% respectively) are all less than the 2.41% economic growth
rate, by 2100 these have changed to +2.16% and +1.89% and by 2150, both
I1 and I2 exhibit growth rates close to the economic growth rate (2.42%
and 2.21% respectively).

On the basis of this simple modeling, we conclude that [decoupling of
GDP growth from resource use, whether relative or absolute, is **at best
only temporary**]{.underline}. [Permanent decoupling]{.underline}
(absolute or relative) [is **impossible** for essential,
non-substitutable resources because the efficiency gains are ultimately
governed by physical limits]{.underline}.

Discussion & Conclusions

Our model demonstrates that [growth in GDP ultimately cannot plausibly
be decoupled from growth in material and energy use, demonstrating
categorically that GDP **growth cannot be sustained
indefinitely**]{.underline}. [It is therefore misleading to develop
growth-oriented policy around the expectation that decoupling is
possible]{.underline}. However, we also note that GDP has been shown to
be a poor proxy for societal wellbeing, something it was never designed
to measure, and GDP growth is therefore a questionable long-term
societal goal in any case. The mounting costs of "uneconomic growth"
\[43\] suggest that the pursuit of decoupling--if it were possible--in
order to sustain GDP growth would be a misguided effort.

[Society can sustainably improve wellbeing, including the wellbeing of
its natural assets, but only by discarding the goal of GDP growth in
favor of more comprehensive measures]{.underline} of societal wellbeing
\[44\]. The 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), recently agreed
to by all UN countries, represent a much broader conception of the goals
of society. These goals include eliminating poverty and hunger, reducing
inequality, protecting and restoring the climate, and terrestrial and
marine ecosystems. Only one of the 17 goals mentions GDP growth, but it
is qualified as "inclusive and sustainable growth". Certainly, GDP
growth over the last several decades has not been inclusive--inequality
is getting worse in most countries. For GDP growth to be sustainable it
would have to be decoupled from energy and material use and
environmental impacts. We have shown that [there is little evidence that
GDP growth can be decoupled in the long-term]{.underline} (i.e. it is
not sustainable).

If GDP growth as a societal goal is unsustainable, then [it is
ultimately necessary for nations and the world to transition to a steady
or declining GDP scenario]{.underline}. [We contend that it will be
easier to start this **transition now** while there is still capacity
for technological gains, rather than go down the path of decoupling and
be forced to make a transition post 2050 when we are closer to the
theoretical limits to technological efficiency gains]{.underline}. We
argue that [**now is the time to recognize the biophysical limits**, and
to begin the overdue task of re-orienting society around a more
achievable and satisfying set of goals than simply growing
forever]{.underline} \[44,45\].

### 2NC -- AT: Inequality

#### Global inequality is [increasing]{.underline}\-\--their theory lacks [statistical proof]{.underline}.

**Ravallion \'17** \[Martin; 2017; PhD in economics from the London
School of Economics, Professor of Economics at Georgetown; \"Inequality
and globalization: A review essay Martin Ravallion,\"
www.ecineq.org/milano/WP/ECINEQ2017-435.pdf/\]

As normally measured, "global inequality" is the relative inequality of
incomes found among all people in the world no matter where they live.
Francois Bourguignon and Branko Milanovic have written insightful and
timely books on global inequality, emphasizing the role of
globalization. The books are complementary; Milanovic provides an
ambitious broad-brush picture, with some intriguing hypotheses on the
processes at work; Bourguignon provides a deep and suitably qualified,
economic analysis. The paper questions the thesis of both books that
globalization has been a major driving force of inequality between or
within countries. [The paper also questions the robustness of the
evidence for declining global inequality, and notes]{.underline} some
[conceptual limitations of standard measures in capturing the concerns
of many observers in the ongoing debates about globalization and the
policy responses.]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

Income inequality is in the news, and a policy concern in many
countries. Two new volumes by two leading scholars on inequality,
Francois Bourguignon (2016) and Branko Milanovic (2016), are thus
welcome. While both authors are economists who have contributed at the
frontiers of knowledge, each has written for a broad audience.
Non-economists will have little trouble following the arguments.
Economists will also appreciate the many subtleties of the subject that
the authors manage to convey in accessible terms. The books are
timely---even more so now than when they were written.

The Bourguignon volume provides a concise introduction to the economics
of inequality. The book's strengths are its clear exposition of the
economic forces impacting the global distribution of income and its
policy analysis. The strengths of the Milanovic volume are its
descriptions of how distribution has changed and its thought-provoking
interpretations of the political and economic forces at work.

The books provide measures of global income inequality (hereafter
"global inequality"), often drawing on the authors' own data work. But
the bulk of their effort is in trying to explain what they see in the
data. They bring perspectives from both macroeconomics (notably on
sources of growth within countries) and microeconomics (why some
households are better able to participate in that growth), as well as
from history and the history of thought. Both knowledgably span the
world, from poor to rich countries---as is appropriate for books on
global inequality. Bourguignon draws more completely on the theories and
evidence found in modern economic writings on the subject. Milanovic
takes a somewhat more idiosyncratic approach, grounded in his own
interpretations of the evidence he assembles. (I expect that Milanovic's
style sells more copies.) They broadly agree on the evidence.
Bourguignon probes more deeply in trying to understand that evidence as
an economist. Both authors sprinkle their text with their own opinions,
though Bourguignon provides a clearer idea of what they are based on.
The essay begins with an overview of what these books tell us about the
trends in global inequality. It then critically examines what they say
about the causative factors and policy responses. Finally, comments are
offered on some broader concerns, applicable to much of the literature
on global inequality.

The evidence on global inequality

The historical patterns identified in both books can be summarized as
follows. [Looking back over 200 years, one finds that global
inequality]{.underline}---defined as the relative inequality of incomes
among all peoples of the world ignoring where they live---[was on a
rising trend from 1820 to about 1990]{.underline}.2 This long period of
rising inequality was driven in the main by the divergent growth
processes, with today's rich world taking off economically from the
early C 19th (though with some late starters such as Japan). Average
inequality within countries was stagnant or even falling over much of
this period, most notably over the middle half century of the
C20th---known as the Great Levelling in the rich world.

This pattern changed dramatically toward the end of the C 20th with an
overall pattern of falling inequality between countries alongside rising
average inequality within countries. This new pattern in the evolution
of global inequality is the main focus of both books. Figure 1 shows the
series of global inequality measures provided by Bourguignon, using a
Theil index. 3 We see the fall in global inequality, markedly so in the
new Millennium. This has been driven by a decline in inequality between
countries, which accounts for the bulk of total inequality. [**Average
inequality within countries**]{.underline} (population-weighted) **[has
edged upwards since 2000]{.underline}**. 4

[There are numerous data issues underlying Figure 1, related to
household surveys, price indices, census data and the role played by
national accounts]{.underline}. Neither book goes into much detail on
these issues, though Chapter 1 of each book provides a brief summary of
how their estimates for global inequality were derived.5 Nor will this
essay focus on data issues. But I flag only one issue that should be
kept in mind. Along with both authors, I suspect that **[the
within-country component]{.underline}** in Figure 1 **[is being
underestimated]{.underline}**. There are a number of reasons. Selective
compliance in surveys is a concern almost everywhere; in particular, it
is plausible that the rich are less likely to participate in household
surveys. [The bias could well be large: Korinek]{.underline} et al.
(2006) [estimate that **correcting for such selective compliance adds**
about **five percentage points to the Gini index for the U.S.** There
are also concerns about under-reporting of incomes, especially income
from capital]{.underline}. [Estimates using income tax records have
indicated larger "highend" incomes than found in surveys]{.underline}
(Atkinson et al., 2011). **[It is likely that the true level
of]{.underline}** within-country **[inequality is higher than currently
measured]{.underline}**. It is less clear how much these measurement
errors matter to the trend, but my own expectation is that [inequality
within countries is rising]{.underline} more than the data in Figure 1
[suggest,]{.underline} on the presumption [that many newly affluent
respondents are reticent to fully reveal their gains or even to
participate in surveys.]{.underline}

[The aggregate summary statistics]{.underline} in Figure 1 [do not
reveal much about how income changes were distributed across the
population]{.underline}. Milanovic starts out with a more informative
tool for describing the evolution of income distribution in the world,
using a graph from Lakner and Milanovic (2016a) which plots the
proportionate gain in income over 1988-2008 against fractiles of the
income distribution, as reproduced in Figure 2. This is a version of a
"growth incidence curve" (GIC), as defined in formal terms for
continuous distributions by Ravallion and Chen (2003) who discuss the
curve's properties. 6 The methodology used to construct the GIC in
Figure 2 is explained in Lakner and Milanovic (2016a).

The Lakner-Milanovic graph has been dubbed [the "elephant
chart]{.underline}" since it traces the shape of an elephant's head with
its trunk held high. [Readers who are used to hearing about rising
inequality in the rich world will see that feature in the graph;
strikingly, between the 80th percentile]{.underline} (from the bottom)
[and the top 1% globally we see a steeply positive curve]{.underline}
(the elephant's raised trunk), [rising from near zero growth to over a
60% gain for the top percentile]{.underline}. But readers also see
something as striking---**[the marked proportionate rise in incomes for
those near the middle of the global distribution]{.underline}** (the
elephant's massive and expanding head). **[This came with considerably
slower growth for the poorest.]{.underline}**

As Lakner and Milanovic note, the Lorenz curves intersect internally, as
can be seen in Figure 3.While the overall Gini index fell (from 72% to
71%) this came with a marked inward shift of the Lorenz curve between
the 30th and 80th percentiles but an outward shift among the top decile
and a declining share for the poorest 5%. The Lakner-Milanovic estimates
imply that the share of the world's top 1% rose from 12% to 15% between
1988 and 2008.

So rather than suggesting a decline in global inequality, this is
actually quite an ambiguous picture of distributional change. Given that
there is not Lorenz dominance, **[the claim that global inequality is
falling is not robust]{.underline}** to the choice of index; [some valid
inequality measures]{.underline} (such as the Gini index and the Theil
index, as in Figure 1) [can show a decrease while other equally valid
measures do not]{.underline}. 7 [With sufficiently strong aversion to
inequality one would declare that global inequality has in fact
risen]{.underline}. Consider for example the Atkinson (1970) index,
which has a parameter  reflecting the aversion to inequality; a higher
value of  implies that one is willing to incur a greater loss when
transferring money from the rich to the poor (i.e., a lower share
actually reaching the poor) and yet still judge that social welfare has
increased.8 I calculate that the Atkinson index of global inequality has
fallen over 1988-2008 for   4 but that inequality has risen for   5
or 6. 9 The upshot of these observations is that with sufficiently
strong aversion to inequality, one will judge that **[global inequality
has risen]{.underline}** over this period.

### 2NC -- AT: Reform Solves

#### Reform fails\-\--accumulation [intrinsic to capitalism]{.underline} is unsustainable\-\--the magnitude of collapse is [underestimated]{.underline} and [outweighs]{.underline} all other impacts which are [recoverable shocks]{.underline}.

**Monbiot \'19** \[George; 4/25/19; columnist for The Guardian, has held
visiting fellowships or professorships at the universities of Oxford
(environmental policy), Bristol (philosophy), Keele (politics), Oxford
Brookes (planning), and East London (environmental science); \"Dare to
declare capitalism dead -- before it takes us all down with it,\"
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth/\]

But as I've grown older, I've come to recognise two things. First, that
[it is the system, **rather than any variant** of the system, that
drives us inexorably **towards disaster**. Second,]{.underline} that
[you do not have to produce a **definitive alternative** to say that
**capitalism is failing**. The statement stands in its own
right.]{.underline} But it also demands another, and different, effort
to develop a new system.

[Capitalism's failures arise from two of its defining elements. The
first is **perpetual growth**. Economic growth is the **aggregate
effect** of the quest to **accumulate capital** and **extract profit**.
Capitalism **collapses** without growth, yet **perpetual growth** on a
**finite planet** leads inexorably to **environmental
calamity**]{.underline}.

[Those who defend capitalism argue]{.underline} that, [as consumption
switches from goods to services, economic growth can be **decoupled**
from]{.underline} the [use of **material resources**]{.underline}. Last
week a paper in the journal New Political Economy, by Jason Hickel and
Giorgos Kallis, examined this premise. They found that [while some
**relative decoupling** took place in the 20th century]{.underline}
(material resource consumption grew, but not as quickly as economic
growth), [in the 21st century there has been a **recoupling**: rising
resource consumption has so far **matched** or **exceeded** the rate of
**economic growth**. The absolute decoupling **needed to avert
environmental catastrophe**]{.underline} (a reduction in material
resource use) [has **never** been achieved, and **appears impossible**
while economic growth continues. **Green growth is an
illusion**]{.underline}.

[A system based on **perpetual growth** cannot function without
**peripheries** and **externalities**. There must always be an
**extraction zone** -- from which materials are taken without full
payment -- and a **disposal zone**, where costs are **dumped** in the
form of **waste** and **pollution**. As the **scale** of **economic
activity** increases until capitalism affects everything, from the
**atmosphere** to the **deep ocean floor**, the entire planet becomes a
**sacrifice zone**]{.underline}: we all inhabit the periphery of the
profit-making machine.

[This drives us towards **cataclysm** on such a scale that most people
have **no means of imagining it**. The **threatened collapse** of our
life-support systems is **bigger** by far than **war**, **famine**,
**pestilence** or **economic crisis**, though it is likely to
incorporate all four. Societies can **recover from these** apocalyptic
events, but not from the **loss of soil**, an **abundant biosphere** and
a **habitable climate**.]{.underline}

[The second defining]{.underline} element [is the bizarre assumption
that a person is entitled to as great a share of the world's natural
wealth as their money can buy. This **seizure of common goods**
causes]{.underline} three [further dislocations. First, the **scramble
for exclusive control** of non-reproducible assets, which implies either
**violence** or **legislative truncations** of other people's rights.
Second, the **immiseration of other people** by an **economy based on
looting** across both **space** and **time**]{.underline}. Third, the
translation of economic power into political power, as control over
essential resources leads to control over the social relations that
surround them.

In the New York Times on Sunday, the Nobel economist Joseph Stiglitz
sought to distinguish between good capitalism, which he called "wealth
creation", and bad capitalism, which he called "wealth grabbing"
(extracting rent). I understand his distinction. But [from the
environmental point of view, **wealth creation is wealth grabbing**.
Economic growth, **intrinsically** linked to the increasing use of
material resources, means **seizing natural wealth** from both **living
systems** and **future generations**]{.underline}.

[To point to such problems is to invite a **barrage of
accusations**]{.underline}, many of which are [based on this premise:
capitalism has rescued hundreds of millions of people from
poverty]{.underline} -- now you want to impoverish them again. [It is
true]{.underline} that [capitalism, and the economic growth it drives,
has radically improved the prosperity of vast numbers]{.underline} of
people, [while simultaneously **destroying the prosperity** of many
others: those whose **land**, **labour** and **resources** were seized
to **fuel growth elsewhere**. Much of the wealth of the rich nations was
-- and is -- built on **slavery** and **colonial
expropriation**.]{.underline}

Like coal, [capitalism]{.underline} has brought many benefits. But, like
coal, it [now causes **more harm than good**]{.underline}. Just as we
have found means of generating useful energy that are better and less
damaging than coal, so [we need to find means of generating **human
wellbeing** that are **better** and **less damaging** than
**capitalism**]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- AT: Tech Solves

#### Tech fixes are a short-term delaying tactic to ensure fossil-fuel profits for as long as possible\-\--only anti-capitalist transformation of society can avoid business as usual. 

**Black '21** \[Emma; 5/23/21; writer for Red Flag; \"Capitalism's fake
solutions to the climate crisis,\"
<https://redflag.org.au/article/capitalisms-fake-solutions-climate-crisis/>\]

["Net zero by 2050"]{.underline} (or 2060 in China's case) [has become
the new mainstream **political mantra** on **climate change**. However,
this]{.underline} ambitious-sounding, yet [still **far from adequate**,
goal is premised on a series of **new technologies** that **remain
untested** at best and **completely hypothetical** at
worst]{.underline}.

[The name dropping of an array of]{.underline} these [high-tech
"solutions"]{.underline} to the climate crisis [was a feature
of]{.underline} US President Joe [Biden's Earth Day summit]{.underline}
in April. [Among those]{.underline} in which Biden has promised to
invest US\$35 billion as part of his proposed American Jobs Plan [are
**c**arbon **c**apture and **s**torage, **hydrogen**, **nuclear**,
floating **offshore wind**, **biofuels** and **e**lectric
**v**ehicles.]{.underline}

While the disappearance of the outright climate denialism of the Trump
era might seem cause for celebration, [the new trend for spruiking the
magical power of technology to solve]{.underline} the [climate crisis is
cause for **serious concern**]{.underline}. When you look beyond the
headline-grabbing announcements of increased long-term ambition, [the
Earth Day summit amounted to little more than another case of
**government greenwashing** of the **business as usual** of
fossil-fuelled capitalism]{.underline}.

Instead of detailing the changes to be made in the here and now to
reduce emissions, [Biden and other world leaders instead promoted
**faith** in the capacity of **science** and **technology** to come to
the **rescue** at an **indeterminate point**]{.underline} in the future.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison was among them. While the media
highlighted the supposed gulf between a progressive, "green" Biden and
the conservative, fossil-fuel-loving Morrison, they both promoted the
same faith in the powers of technology. Like Biden, Morrison has vowed
to invest tens of billions of dollars in developing carbon capture and
storage technologies, "clean" hydrogen, "blue" carbon and "green"
steel---among other colourful innovations.

In May's federal budget, the Coalition allocated more than half a
billion dollars to developing the first two of these
technologies---\$263.7 million for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and
\$275.5 million for "clean" hydrogen.

CCS mostly involves capturing C02 emissions at their source---in mines,
power stations and so on---and pumping them deep underground (so the
theory goes) to be permanently stored in appropriately porous and stable
rock formations. But despite politicians and business leaders spruiking
**[CCS]{.underline}** as an easy fix for the climate crisis for decades,
it [has **never been shown to work** on anything near the **scale
required**]{.underline}.

Australia already boasts the world's largest, supposedly functional, CCS
facility at Chevron's Gorgon gas project in Western Australia. However,
according to the Climate Council, "the Gorgon CCS trial has been a big,
expensive failure \... capturing less than half the emissions needed to
make CCS viable". In what is only the latest in a series of problems
since it became operational in 2019, Michael Mazengarb reported in Renew
Economy earlier this year that pumping equipment required to clear water
from the undersea formation into which the C02 is to be injected had
become clogged with sand.

However, [while CCS may be **useless** for addressing climate change, it
remains an extremely **useful political tool** for the
government---providing it with **green cover** while it continues to
funnel money to]{.underline} Coalition supporters in the [**coal** and
**gas**]{.underline} industries. And of course, [it's also useful for
those companies on the **receiving end**]{.underline} of the
government's "green" largesse.

Bernard Keane was right in his assessment of it as a scam in Crikey.
"Fossil fuel interests", he wrote in 2019, "sense the opportunity to
extract some taxpayer funding from a government worried it might have to
pretend it believes in climate change". With this year's budget, they
hit the jackpot.

But if CCS is a scam, what about "clean" hydrogen? In his speech to the
Earth Day summit, Morrison vowed to rival US innovation by investing
billions in high-tech "hydrogen valleys". "In the United States you have
the Silicon Valley", he said. "Here in Australia we are creating our own
'Hydrogen Valleys', where we will transform our transport industries,
our mining and resource sectors, our manufacturing, our fuel and energy
production."

[Hydrogen is potentially]{.underline} a [clean]{.underline} energy
source, [but only if it's produced using renewable energy. And to be
produced at the scale required to transform the economy]{.underline} in
the way Morrison is implying [would **require** a **lot of
electricity**]{.underline}.

In his recent contribution to the Quarterly Essay, Australia's former
chief scientist, Alan Finkel, calculates that to produce the equivalent
volume of hydrogen to what Australia currently exports in liquefied
natural gas would require "approximately 2,200 terawatt-hours" of
electricity. This, Finkel notes, "is about eight times Australia's total
electricity generation in 2019".

If Morrison genuinely believes the "hydrogen boom" he envisages will be
based on production of renewable energy on that kind of scale, the
government would have provided increased funding for renewables in the
budget. None was forthcoming.

The reality is that Morrison sees the talk of "hydrogen valleys" as a
way of greenwashing the same old "gas-fired recovery" he was promoting
last year. [The government doesn't envisage **producing hydrogen** with
electricity from renewables, but rather from **gas**. The focus on CCS
gives the game away. The "hydrogen valleys" of the future will be
criss-crossed with **pipelines** and peppered with **gas-fired power
stations** with]{.underline} (we're supposed to believe) [the magic of
CCS ensuring]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} whole [operation
can]{.underline} nevertheless [be run green and guilt-free]{.underline}.

["Clean" hydrogen then, just like CCS, turns out to be just another
**technological chimera** designed to **greenwash** capitalism's
continuing **addiction** to **fossil fuels**]{.underline}.

[What then of the other technological solutions]{.underline} being
touted? Perhaps the most headline grabbing of them has been Biden's
proposed US\$174 billion investment in the infrastructure for [electric
vehicles]{.underline} and their production. [On the surface,
again,]{.underline} this [might sound like a good idea]{.underline}. Who
wouldn't want to live in a world in which we can all drive around in
sleek, silent, powerful and "green" electric vehicles like Teslas?

[Again, however, this is just another **fake technological "fix"** to
the climate crisis that will]{.underline} help [perpetuate the
environmentally destructive status quo.]{.underline} A genuinely
sustainable society won't be built around the kind of car culture that
exists today. What's needed, among other things, is a massive investment
in public transport and the transformation of cities to reduce the need
for long commutes.

[The promotion of **e**lectric **v**ehicle**s** as part of a
technological "green" **utopia** is designed to **forestall** this kind
of change, to protect as much as possible the **car makers** and other
**big business** interests that **profit**]{.underline} from the status
quo.

Elon Musk personifies this. In his authorised biography, Elon Musk:
Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, Ashlee Vance
revealed that Musk's California "hyperloop" proposal was aimed at
quashing plans for a high-speed rail link between Los Angeles and San
Francisco. "Musk had dished out the Hyperloop proposal just to make the
public and legislators rethink the high-speed train", wrote Vance. "He
didn't intend to build the thing \... With any luck, the high-speed rail
would be cancelled. Musk said as much to me during a series of emails
and phone calls leading up to the announcement."

For those who can afford it (a base-level Tesla will set you back an
eye-watering \$73,900 in Australia today), [driving an electric car
might make you feel like you're doing something to help save the planet.
This is an **illusion**]{.underline}.

[Even if your car is **charged** from electricity produced by
**renewable energy**, you also have to consider all the **emissions
produced** in the **construction** and **maintenance** of the roads and
freeways]{.underline} on which you drive. [Then there's the **material**
of the car itself, and the **lithium** needed for the **battery**.
Already, the **skyrocketing demand** is causing major **environmental
problems** for major **lithium producers** like China, Chile and
Bolivia]{.underline}. Tellingly, Musk has already devised the ultimate
escape plan for himself---moving to Mars. This is not an option for most
people.

[The long list of **fake technological fixes** to the climate crisis is
nothing more than a **delaying tactic**, designed to **create** the
**impression of change** to ensure the **profits bonanza** of the
**fossil fuel economy** can continue for as long as possible. Only a
**total transformation** of **society**, in which technological
production is rationally designed and democratically organised and
controlled, can ensure that we are able, in **Marx's words**, "to
bequeath the Earth in an **improved state** to **succeeding
generations**]{.underline}".

### 2NC -- AT: World Better

#### Capitalism has [failed]{.underline}\-\--the world is unambiguously [not getting better]{.underline}.

**Foster \'19** \[John Bellamy; 2/1/19; Professor of Sociology at the
University of Oregon, PhD in Political Science from York University,
President and Board Member of the Monthly Review; \"Capitalism Has
Failed---What Next?\"
https://monthlyreview.org/2019/02/01/capitalism-has-failed-what-next/\]

Less than two decades into the twenty-first century, [it is evident that
**capitalism has failed**]{.underline} [as a]{.underline} [**social
system**. The world is mired in **economic stagnation**]{.underline},
**[financialization]{.underline}**, [and the most]{.underline}
**[extreme inequality]{.underline}** [in human history, accompanied
by]{.underline} **[mass unemployment]{.underline}** and underemployment,
**[precariousness]{.underline}**, **[poverty]{.underline}**,
**[hunger]{.underline}**, wasted output and lives, [and]{.underline}
what at this point can only be called [a planetary ecological "**death
spiral**."]{.underline}1 [The digital revolution]{.underline}, the
greatest technological advance of our time, [has rapidly mutated from a
promise of free communication and liberated production into new means of
**surveillance**,]{.underline} **[control]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[displacement]{.underline}** [of the working
population. The institutions of liberal democracy are at
the]{.underline} [**point of collapse**, while fascism, the rear guard
of the capitalist system, is again on the march, along with]{.underline}
**[patriarchy]{.underline}**, **[racism]{.underline}**,
[**imperialism**, and **war**]{.underline}.

To say that capitalism is a failed system is not, of course, to suggest
that its breakdown and disintegration is imminent.2 It does, however,
mean that it has passed from being a historically necessary and creative
system at its inception to being a historically unnecessary and
destructive one in the present century. [Today]{.underline}, more than
ever, [the world is faced with the epochal choice between "the
revolutionary reconstitution of society]{.underline} at large [and
the]{.underline} **[common ruin]{.underline}** [of the contending
classes]{.underline}."3

[Indications of this **failure of capitalism** are]{.underline}
**[everywhere]{.underline}**. [Stagnation of investment punctuated
by]{.underline} **[bubbles]{.underline}** [of financial expansion, which
then]{.underline} [**inevitably burst**, now characterizes the so-called
**free market**]{.underline}.4 [Soaring inequality in income and wealth
has its counterpart in the **declining material
circumstances**]{.underline} [of a]{.underline}
**[majority]{.underline}** of the population. [**Real wages** for most
workers]{.underline} in the United States [have barely budged in forty
years]{.underline} despite steadily rising productivity.5 Work intensity
has increased, while work and safety protections on the job have been
systematically jettisoned. [Unemployment data has become more and more
meaningless due to a new **institutionalized
underemployment**]{.underline} in the form of contract labor in the gig
economy.6 [**Unions** have been reduced to **mere shadows** of their
former glory as capitalism has **asserted totalitarian
control**]{.underline} [over workplaces]{.underline}. With the demise of
Soviet-type societies, [social democracy in Europe has
perished]{.underline} in the new atmosphere of "liberated capitalism."7

[The capture of]{.underline} the **[surplus value]{.underline}**
[produced by]{.underline} **[overexploited populations]{.underline}**
[in the]{.underline} **[poorest regions]{.underline}** of the world,
[via the **global labor arbitrage** instituted by **multinational
corporations**]{.underline}, [is leading to an **unprecedented**
amassing of **financial wealth**]{.underline} [at the]{.underline}
**[center]{.underline}** of the world economy [and relative]{.underline}
**[poverty in the periphery]{.underline}**.8 [Around \$21 trillion of
offshore funds are currently lodged in **tax havens**]{.underline} on
islands mostly in the Caribbean, constituting ["the fortified refuge of
Big Finance."]{.underline}9 [Technologically driven
**monopolies**]{.underline} resulting from the global-communications
revolution, [together with the rise to dominance of **Wall
Street**]{.underline}-based [financial capital geared to **speculative
asset creation**, have further contributed to the riches of today's "**1
percent**]{.underline}." [Forty-two billionaires now enjoy as much
wealth as half the world's population, while the three richest
men]{.underline} in the United States---[Jeff **Bezos**, Bill **Gates**,
and Warren **Buffett**]{.underline}---[have more wealth than half the
U.S. population]{.underline}.10 [In **every region** of the world,
**inequality has increased sharply**]{.underline} in recent decades.11
[The gap in per capita income and wealth between the richest and poorest
nations]{.underline}, which has been the dominant trend for centuries,
[is]{.underline} **[rapidly widening]{.underline}** once again.12 [More
than 60 percent of the world's employed population, some]{.underline}
[**two billion people**, now work in the **impoverished**]{.underline}
[informal sector, forming a massive **global proletariat**]{.underline}.
The global reserve army of labor is some 70 percent larger than the
active labor army of formally employed workers.13

#### Their notion of "progress" required massive [human and ecological harm]{.underline}\-\--don't ignore material change, but [recenter your conception]{.underline} of what type of progress is desirable.

**McCarraher \'19** \[Eugene; 11/12/19; Associate Professor of
Humanities at Villanova University, PhD in US Cultural and Intellectual
History from Rutgers University; The Enchantments of Mammon: How
Capitalism Became the Religion of Modernity, p. 13-14\]

Because I emphasize this enchanting carceral quality, some readers may
complain that I overlook the real [advances in **human
flourishing**]{.underline} [made possible by capitalism]{.underline}.
Although I [consider]{.underline} this objection [a]{.underline} **[red
herring]{.underline}**, I want to make clear that [I am not
one]{.underline} of those churlish reactionary radicals [who see nothing
in capitalist modernity]{.underline} but one long, unrelieved nightmare
of greed, brutality, and desiccating rationalization. [The technological
achievements of capitalism have surely improved the social and material
conditions of billions]{.underline} of people; as none other than Marx
asked in the Communist Manifesto, what earlier time "had even a
presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social
labor?" [Still]{.underline}---[and this needs to be reiterated at
a]{.underline} **[time of wavering]{.underline}** [but nonetheless
ascendant capitalist triumphalism]{.underline}---[these improvements
would also not have been possible without **labor unions**]{.underline},
**[radical movements]{.underline}**, **[welfare states]{.underline}**,
[and political parties that **mobilized** unremitting popular struggle
**against** the **imperatives** and **institutions** of
capital]{.underline}. Moreover, [it is essential to
**remember**]{.underline} that, as Benjamin observed, [every document of
civilization is also a **document of barbarism**; during the tragically
dialectical epoch of class struggle, all **human achievement is tainted
by oppression**]{.underline}. It's a ruefully ironic observation with
which Augustine would, I suspect, have concurred. Marveling in the City
of God at "all the arts discovered and developed by human genius,"
Augustine still insisted that [the aims and means]{.underline} of these
arts [could nonetheless be "**dangerous**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[harmful]{.underline}**" on account of our corruption.20

Thus, in the spirit of Augustine and Benjamin, [I don't deny the reality
of "progress," but]{.underline} I contend that [the problem of
"progress" is]{.underline} not as Christopher Lasch posed it in The True
and Only Heaven (1991)---" progress and its critics"---but [rather the
**meaning**]{.underline} [of "progress."]{.underline} 21 Despite
caricatures of Luddism or technophobia, [almost no]{.underline}ne of my
**[anticapitalist protagonists]{.underline}** [desired a]{.underline}
[reversion to premodern technology and social relations. It is more
accurate to say]{.underline} that [the **moral**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[ontological primacy]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[money]{.underline}** [in capitalist civilization has
**valorized**]{.underline} [a **particular conception** of "progress"
that was]{.underline}, in their view, **[humanly and ecologically
destructive]{.underline}** [despite all the material benefits it has
conferred]{.underline}. (Even Marx succumbed to it.) Yet they did not
call for the restoration of earlier social orders, nor did they believe
that hammers and hoes would exhaust the technical possibilities of a
world after capitalism. Their example suggests not that we should
resurrect the past, but that [we need to]{.underline}
**[revisit]{.underline}** [what we mean by "progress," and **not change
the subject**]{.underline} [by invoking **cyberspace**]{.underline} [or
holding up the newest]{.underline} version of the
**[iPhone]{.underline}**.

#### Economics under capitalism is a [straight line from colonialism]{.underline}\-\--cultural progress isn't because of capitalism and doesn't prove its desirability.

Local Futures and The International Alliance for Localization; This
Civilization is Finished: Conversations on the end of Empire---and what
lies beyond, Post-Script, no page #\]

[It's of **vital importance** to **distinguish** between two very
**different forms of progress**. The past century has seen **cultural
trends** that can generally be termed '**progressive**'; we are moving
away from the **outright barbarism**]{.underline} of the days [of
colonialism, and lessening]{.underline} the stronghold of [white
supremacy and patriarchy. The **economic trajectory**]{.underline},
however, [has remained **out of touch** with those changing values, and
has continued on a **straight line from colonialism**. Wealth
**inequality has expanded** to record extremes, and **slavery**,
cultural **destruction**, and **domination** over **nature** have only
become **more insidious**. From its]{.underline} very [inception in
17th-century Britain, the **global economy** set out to **invade** and
undermine local economies, **extract** their wealth, and **amalgamate**
them into a monocultural, centralised system. This was originally
achieved through **conquest**, **genocide**, and **slavery**. In the
**modern era**, with ever greater specialisation within large-scale
technological systems, it has become **increasingly difficult** for
individuals to recognise the **overall impact** of their actions.
Whether worker, consumer, politician, or CEO, it's virtually impossible
to be sure that you are not **harming ecosystems or people** on the
other side of the world.]{.underline} It's as though our arms have grown
so long we can't see what our hands are doing.

### 2NC -- Alt Solvency

#### **International organization and revolution is possible -- now is time to capitalize on energy**

**Tavan \'21** \[Luca; 3/7/21; writer for Red Flag; \"Worldwide
revolution is possible and necessary,\"
<https://redflag.org.au/article/worldwide-revolution-possible-and-necessary/>\]

From the moment [Marx and Engels urged **workers of the world** to
**unite** at the climax of the Communist Manifesto, the
goal]{.underline} of **[international revolution]{.underline}** has been
at the core of Marxist politics.

[International revolution isn't just a romantic dream, but an **urgent
necessity**. It's the **only means** by which **capitalism** can be
**permanently uprooted** and **replaced** with socialism. This is
because capitalism, unlike previous class societies, is a **globally
integrated** system]{.underline}. "For the first time in history", wrote
British Marxist Colin Barker of this phenomenon, "capitalism has created
a genuinely world society, where all our lives are entwined together in
a common history and a common fate".

[Capitalism has linked every nation in a **global chain of
production**]{.underline}. Take your mobile phone for example. It was
likely assembled in China, using computer chips manufactured in Taiwan,
powered by coal exported from Australia and produced with minerals mined
in the Democratic Republic of Congo according to specifications
developed in Europe or the United States. [No single country produces
all the things necessary to satisfy its population's needs, unlike the
various forms of society that came before capitalism]{.underline}, which
were mostly self-sufficient and organised around small local economies.

[Capitalism was established as a **world system** through immense
**robbery** and **violence**---from the international **slave
trade**]{.underline}, which fuelled the Industrial Revolution,
[to]{.underline} the [murderous **colonisation**]{.underline} of what is
now Australia. [That same violence is today used by **states** to
**defend** their **imperialist interests**, and discipline any
movements]{.underline} that get in their way. Movements that aspire to
national independence or that back left-wing reformist governments have
been demolished with the aid of the great capitalist powers countless
times in the past century, from the overthrow of the Allende government
in Chile in 1973 to the 2019 Bolivian coup.

Revolutionary movements that attempt to overturn the entire capitalist
system face a much more severe response. This was confirmed by the
defeat of the Russian Revolution. In 1917 workers, radicalised by years
of war and economic crisis, overthrew the tsarist regime and eventually
took power into their own hands. In response, the capitalist powers of
the world united to crush the workers' state, in alliance with
reactionaries who wanted to restore the tsarist regime. [Unless
revolutions can spread internationally and challenge the imperialist
powers that have an interest in destroying them, they will be
crushed.]{.underline}

A heroic effort by Russian workers and peasants fought off 16 foreign
invading armies, but at a great cost. The working class was decimated,
the factories were depopulated, and the radical working-class democracy
that had been built withered. The [isolation and poverty imposed on
Russia made building socialism an impossibility, and a new Stalinist
regime emerged]{.underline} that reversed most of the gains of the
revolution.

[Because Russian revolutionary socialists]{.underline} who pinned their
hopes on spreading revolution across the globe [were ultimately
defeated, their example is used by defenders of capitalism as a
**cautionary tale**]{.underline} today: [that a **worldwide revolution**
against the system is an **impossible dream**]{.underline}.

[But capitalism's **global nature** means that **revolts tend to
spread** across **national borders**. Workers today **share**
increasingly **similar experiences**: conditions of **work**, forms of
**consumption**, **lifestyles** and political **cultures**. And the
**global integration** of production serves to **transmit struggle**
from one country to another]{.underline}. In 1974, for instance,
[resistance to the brutal military dictatorship in Chile spread to East
Kilbride, Scotland, of all places]{.underline}. Workers at the Rolls
Royce factory there learned that the engines they were repairing were
being used by the Chilean air force to drop bombs on workers resisting
the coup. They downed tools and refused to work on the engines, keeping
them out of the hands of the military junta for four years.

[While nationalism still has a powerful hold]{.underline} on the
consciousness of many, [it's increasingly clear that the real **line of
polarisation** across the **globe** is between the **minority ruling
class** and the **majority working class**. And when **revolts** break
out in one part of the world, people can **identify with the causes and
motivations** of their struggles, and **draw comparisons** with their
own situation]{.underline}. "Languages remain different," observed UK
Marxist Chris Harman in 1992, "but [what they say is increasingly the
same]{.underline}". Harman's words ring true in every wave of political
radicalisation.

[1968 is remembered as a year of **global revolt**, when **millions** of
**workers**, **students** and **oppressed** people drew inspiration from
each other's movements. Activists in the **US**]{.underline} were
[radicalised by the heroic resistance of the **Vietnamese**
people]{.underline} to American imperialism. [**Irish** civil rights
activists emulated the militant politics of the Black
Panthers]{.underline}. When [students and workers united to launch a
massive general strike in **France**]{.underline} in May, [it taught
student radicals in **Australia** that they needed to link
up]{.underline} with the power of the organised working class in order
to win.

[The movements of 1968 **united people** across superficially very
**different societies**]{.underline}. For decades, Cold War common sense
had dictated that the greatest divide on the planet was between Western
liberal capitalism and Stalinist "Communism". But [in 1968, both sides
of the iron curtain **exploded in revolt**. The **triggers** for the
struggles may have been **different**, but they were all **responses**
to **similar** issues: **inequality**, **exploitation** and **war**,
imposed by monstrous **bureaucratic states**]{.underline}.

[In 2011, a]{.underline} poor [Tunisian street vendor set himself
alight]{.underline} to protest against police harassment. [Within days,
his act had inspired anti-government protests across the
country]{.underline}. Within weeks, the [protests escalated into a
**regional revolt** that challenged regimes across the **Arab world**.
One small act **tapped into resentment** against **inequality**,
**unemployment** and **state violence** that engulfed an entire region.
The **radical wave** spread even further: at a massive
demonstration]{.underline} against an anti-union bill [in the US city of
Madison, Wisconsin]{.underline}, a man held up a poster with a picture
of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak beside Republican Governor Scott
Walker. The caption read: "One dictator down. One to go". [The Arab
revolutions went on to **inspire** the **Occupy** movement, which spread
to more than 80 countries]{.underline}.

[Today, more than ever, **insurgent social movements** and working-class
**uprisings** are **spurring action** in other parts of the
world]{.underline}---from Hong Kong to Chile, from Lebanon to France.
One placard at a memorial for protesters murdered while resisting the
military coup in Myanmar took up Marx's incitement: "Workers of the
world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains".

[While the Russian Revolution is cynically held up by capitalist
ideologists]{.underline} as the ultimate argument against international
revolution, [it actually **proves the opposite**. It shows that the goal
is not only **necessary**, but also that it's **possible**. The news of
**workers seizing power** in Russia]{.underline}, overthrowing their
capitalist government [and declaring]{.underline} their [withdrawal from
WWI, created shock waves across the planet. Workers in **Germany** rose
in revolt a year later]{.underline}, ending the war for good and
building soviets, a form of radical working-class democracy inspired by
the Russian example. [This was followed by **uprisings** in **France**,
**Italy** and **Hungary**]{.underline}.

[The **revolutionary wave** spread further.]{.underline} A [classified
British government report]{.underline} from 1919 [noted a "very
**widespread feeling** among workers that thrones have become
anachronisms, and that the Soviet may be the **best form** of Government
for a democracy".]{.underline}

The rising tide of radicalism had an impact in Australia too.
Meatworkers in the Queensland city of Townsville donned red jumpers,
stormed the local police station to free jailed unionists, and placed
the city under workers' control. The editor of the conservative
Townsville Daily Bulletin lamented: "Townsville for the last year or so
has been developing Bolshevism \... the mob management of affairs in
this city, differs very little, from the Petrograd and Moscow brand".

[The Russian Bolsheviks]{.underline}, the revolutionary working-class
party that led the revolution to victory in 1917, [didn't just passively
wait for revolutions elsewhere. They **actively organised to spread the
revolt**]{.underline}. In 1919, [they established the **Communist
International**, an organisation for **debate**, **discussion** and
**coordination** between different revolutionary workers'
parties.]{.underline} Revolutionaries in Russia, Italy, France, Germany,
the US, Australia and elsewhere attempted [to clarify and develop a
strategy for **overthrowing capitalism**]{.underline} everywhere. In
none of these countries was there a party like the Bolsheviks, steeled
in years of organising working-class struggle to overthrow the state,
and capable of leading a revolution. But [for a number of years,
**workers came close** to overthrowing capitalism]{.underline} in
several countries.

[In periods of stability, when social conservatism dominates,
international revolution can **seem like a pipe dream**. Defenders of
the status quo **actively work** to **reinforce this illusion**. But
**history** proves that the **crises** that the **system generates** are
**international**, and that they will inevitably **provoke international
resistance**]{.underline}.

[Capitalism is a **global system**. It requires a **global movement** to
tear it up]{.underline}, root and branch. [But it also makes global
revolution more **possible**, and more **likely**. The most important
thing]{.underline} that socialists can do, whether you live in Hong Kong
or France, Myanmar or Australia, [is to get stuck into **organising for
it** today]{.underline}.

#### Worldwide movement is possible\-\--[latent discontent]{.underline} is mounting but unifying under [collective struggle]{.underline} is a [historical necessity]{.underline} to [preserve humanity]{.underline}.

Indeed, [history has been unkind to all such attempts to provide
detailed forecasts of the future]{.underline}, particularly if they
simply extend current trends and leave the bulk of humanity and their
struggles out of the picture. [It is for this reason that a
**dialectical view** is so important. The actual course of history can
**never be predicted**. The only thing certain about **historical
change** is the **existence** of the **struggles** that drive it forward
and that guarantee its discontinuous character. Both **implosions** and
**explosions** inevitably materialize, rendering the **world** for new
generations **different** than that of the old. History points to
**numerous social systems** that have **reached** the **limits** of
their ability to **adapt** their **social relations**]{.underline} to
allow for the rational and sustainable use of developing productive
forces. [Hence, the human past is dotted by **periods of regression**,
followed by **revolutionary accelerations**]{.underline} that sweep all
before them. As the conservative historian Jacob Burckhardt declared in
the nineteenth century, "a historical crisis" occurs when "a crisis in
the whole state of things is produced, involving whole epochs and all or
many peoples of the same civilization.... The historical process is
suddenly accelerated in terrifying fashion. Developments which otherwise
take centuries seem to flit by like phantoms in months or weeks, and are
fulfilled." He called this the "acceleration of historical processes."91

Burckhardt principally had in mind social revolutions, like the French
Revolution of 1789. This was an acceleration of history that, as the
modern French historian Georges Lefebvre explained, commenced as a
series of widening revolutions, mutating with terrifying speed, from an
aristocratic revolution to a bourgeois revolution to a popular
revolution and then a peasant revolution---finally taking on the
character of a historic "bloc, a single thing," seemingly unconquerable,
which reshaped much of world history.92

Could such a revolutionary acceleration of history, though on an
incomparably greater scale, happen in the twenty-first century? Most
establishment commentators in the hegemonic countries of the world
imperialist system would say no, based on their own narrow experience
and limited view of history. Nevertheless, [**revolutions** continue to
**break out** in the periphery of the world system]{.underline} and are,
even now, only put down by imperialist economic, political, and military
interventions. Moreover, [the **failure of capitalism** on a **planetary
scale** today **threatens all of civilization and life** on the
planet]{.underline} as we know it. [If **drastic changes** are not made,
**global temperature** this century will increase by 4° or even
6°C]{.underline} from preindustrial times, [leading to conditions that
will **imperil humankind**]{.underline} as a whole. Meanwhile, the
extreme capitalism of today seeks to expropriate and enclose all the
bases of material existence, siphoning off almost the entire net social
surplus and robbing the natural environment for the direct benefit of a
miniscule few.

[As a **direct result** of capitalist social relations, the **material
challenges** now facing humanity are greater than anything
ever]{.underline} seen before, [pointing to an **accumulation of
catastrophe** along with the **accumulation of capital**]{.underline}.93
[Hundreds of millions of people]{.underline} under these circumstances
[are already being **drawn into struggles** with the system, creating
the **basis** of a new **worldwide movement** toward
socialism]{.underline}. In his book [Can the Working Class Change the
World?]{.underline} Yates answers [**yes**, it can. But]{.underline} it
can [only]{.underline} do so [through a **unifying struggle** by workers
and peoples]{.underline} aimed at genuine socialism.94

[It may be **objected** that socialism has been tried and has failed and
hence **no longer exists** as an **alternative**]{.underline}. However,
[like the earliest attempts at capitalism]{.underline} in the Italian
city-states of the late Middle Ages, [which were **not strong enough**
to survive]{.underline} amongst the [feudal societies]{.underline} that
surrounded them, [the failure of the first experiments at socialism
presage nothing but its **eventual rebirth** in a new, **more
revolutionary**, **more universal** form, which examines and learns from
the failures]{.underline}.95 [Even in failure, socialism has this
advantage over capitalism: it is motivated by the demand for "freedom in
general," rooted in substantive equality]{.underline} and sustainable
human development---reflecting precisely those collective social
relations, [borne of **historical necessity** and the unending struggle
for human freedom, **crucial** to **human survival**]{.underline} in our
time.96

The great conservative economist Joseph Schumpeter, who, as Austrian
finance minister in Red Vienna, had allied himself for a time with the
socialist government and found himself attacked on all sides, once wrote
that [capitalism would perish not because of "the weight of economic
failure," but rather because its "very success" in pursuing its **narrow
economic ends**, had **undermined** the **sociological foundations** of
its existence. Capitalism]{.underline}, Schumpeter exclaimed,
["'inevitably' creates conditions in which it will not be able to
live]{.underline} and which strongly point to socialism as its heir
apparent."97 He was, it turns out, in many ways correct, though not
entirely in the way he expected. [The **global development** of
**monopoly capitalism** and **financialization** spearheaded by the very
same counterrevolutionary neoliberalism]{.underline} that first arose in
response to Red Vienna in the interwar years---at a time when Schumpeter
himself was a major actor---[has now undermined the material bases, not
so much of capitalism itself, but of global society and planetary
ecology. The result has been the emergence of an "atmosphere of almost
**universal hostility**" to the **prevailing social
order**]{.underline}, though, playing out in the confused context of the
present, less as opposition to capitalism itself than to
neoliberalism.98

[It is capitalism's undermining of the very basis of human existence
that will eventually **compel** the world's **workers** and **peoples**
to **seek new roads forward**. An **inclusive**, **class-based
movement** toward socialism in this century will **open up the
possibility** of qualitative **new developments** that the **anarchy**
of the capitalist-market society with its **monopolistic competition**,
**extreme inequality**, and **institutionalized greed** cannot possibly
offer]{.underline}.99 This includes the development of a socialist
technology, in which both the forms of technology utilized and the
purposes to which they are put are channeled in social directions, as
opposed to individual and class gain.100 [It introduces the prospect of
long-term **democratic planning** at all levels of society, allowing
decisions to be made and distributions to occur outside the logic of the
cash nexus]{.underline}.101 Socialism, in its most radical form, is
about substantive equality, community solidarity, and ecological
sustainability; it is aimed at the unification---not simply
division---of labor.

### 2NC -- Bioimperialism Alt 

#### The refusal of the aff's imaginary in favor of the world presented by the alt is the [only]{.underline} mechanism capable of reversing the bioimperialist trend

[The solution]{.underline}, I submit, [lies in imagining alternatives to
imperialist military-health configurations]{.underline}. Recall that the
[critical health practitionerscholars]{.underline} I mentioned in the
first section of this chapter [critiqued the imperial and transnational
dimensions of U.S. biodefense]{.underline}. [Their critique of the
militarization of health revolved specifically around the way in which
it negatively impacted global health equity]{.underline}---**[by
diverting resources from pressing endemic global health
problems]{.underline}**. They were concerned with the way the U.S.
national security apparatus pulled focus from global health. [Nurses'
organizations also took on a global focus in their critiques of the
NSVP]{.underline}---[they were concerned not solely with the risks of
the smallpox vaccine to the U.S. national population, but also with the
global implications of supporting a biodefense program that would fuel
an unjust war against Iraq]{.underline}. **[The Massachusetts Nurses
Association stated: "We must use our health care abilities to build an
international commitment to peace and human rights]{.underline}**. Let
the example of smallpox eradication be used to further cooperation....
We have pledged first to do no harm.... We will accept the smallpox
vaccination when it is part of a worldwide effort to eradicate the
disease. In that event the health care workers of Iraq would be
inoculated as well" ("Vaccinate against War, Not Smallpox" 2003).
**[This statement centered health care as a means to build international
relations founded on peace and human rights, rather than militarism and
oppression]{.underline}**. [It suggested an alternative to biodefense,
rebuking the narrative of Iraq as a threat whose citizens deserve no
protection as well as the complementary notion that the U.S. population
is uniquely deserving of health and security]{.underline}. The nurses'
statement proposed that Iraqi health and lives be accorded utmost
consideration. **[In doing so, the statement opposed bio-imperialism in
the most fundamental sense]{.underline}**---**[it called out the power
dynamics between the United States and Iraq, advocating that biological
resources, namely, the vaccine]{.underline}** (in theory), **[not be
hoarded by the United States, but should also benefit
Iraqis]{.underline}**. [This rejection of U.S. hegemony over biological
resources paved the way for health and security systems aimed at global
equity]{.underline}.

#### Collective action of the alt generates subjects capable of challenging and dismantling the bioimperialist virus-sharing scheme -- proves the alt solves the [entirety]{.underline} of the aff

[Collective action had brought about a profound restructuring in global
health governance, allowing significantly less powerful actors to be
relatively successful against more powerful ones.]{.underline}
[Discourse-making, moreover, was vital to their
accomplishments]{.underline}. **[The strategic displacement of "virus
sharing" to "benefits sharing" destabilized the entire discursive
scaffolding of "global health security."]{.underline}** Benefits sharing
reversed the construction of vulnerability: [if the existing view was a
Eurocentric one premised on the notion that the Global North needed to
be protected from the diseases of the Global South, the new paradigm
highlighted that it was the Global South that was made vulnerable
through the North's biocolonial extraction of disease data and
samples]{.underline}. This was a hard-won paradigm shift, as illustrated
by the U.S. pushback in the struggle to obtain MTAs for originating
countries. The United States had a strong stake in a system that gave
global powers prime access to the data and samples furnished to the WHO.
Accordingly, the United States rejected the Global South's attempt to
redistribute power through the MTA regime. At the World Health Assembly
meeting in May 2007, the United States presented its draft resolution,
which argued that adding MTAs would hinder the unfettered, immediate
transfer of materials, and thus negatively impact vaccine production
(Franklin 2009; Khor 2007; WHO 2008). In essence, the United States
stuck to the notion that vaccine production was the sole goal, ignoring
the crucial step that followed---how those vaccines would be
distributed. [The paradigm shift to benefits sharing also challenged
another fundamental premise of global health
security]{.underline}---[that international authorities should supersede
national ones.]{.underline} [Benefits sharing repositioned national
sovereignty over biological resources as the key mechanism for giving
impacted nations control over their health outcomes]{.underline}. [The
focus on national sovereignty was]{.underline}, in the terms of
sociocultural anthropologist Aihwa Ong (2008), [a strategic insertion of
"the nation as a scale of ethical exception to the global
commodification of health"]{.underline} (126). **[The concept of
national sovereignty prioritized the well-being of peoples actually
affected by H5N1, and interrupted the predatory extraction of samples
from the Global South]{.underline}**. [Thus, national sovereignty was
articulated not as selfish or provincial, but as key to ensuring the
health of those most impacted.]{.underline} [The discourse of national
sovereignty also chipped away at the rhetorics of security that had
helped justify pandemic preparedness as a security
imperative.]{.underline} It was certainly a difficult battle: the
discourse of global health security had not only diminished national
autonomy, but also coded nations such as China and Indonesia, who
asserted their authority, as security threats. At a March 2007 WHO
meeting held in Jakarta, for example, a WHO press release called
Indonesia's withholding of viruses a "threat to global public health
security" (WHO 2007). This married false universalism (a disaggregated
globe) with alarmist security rhetoric to sideline the equity issues
that had been highlighted by Indonesia and its allies. U.S. government
officials, along with much of the U.S. popular press, had also
frequently deployed these security frames in response to Indonesia's
actions. Prominent public health journalists Richard Holbrooke and
Laurie Garrett, in their denouncement of Indonesia's position, published
an article in August 2008 in the Washington Post that described
Indonesia's failure to provide viruses as posing a "pandemic threat to
all the peoples of the world." The authors followed this with further
security discourse: "Disturbingly, however, the notion \[of viral
sovereignty\] has morphed into a global movement, fueled by
self-destructive, anti-western sentiments" (Holbrooke and Garrett 2008;
emphasis added). This [characterization invoked the trope of the
West-hating terrorist, but also the post-9 / 11 frame that was its
complement]{.underline}---[U.S. vulnerability, here aimed at cowing
Global South nations that refused to comply with the North-led
international system]{.underline}. [The authors ended their article by
calling on Indonesia to conform to the demands of "globally shared
health risk," further coding Indonesia's challenge to the international
health system as a global threat and upholding the myth that the
international pandemic preparedness regime]{.underline}---[and its
fortification]{.underline}---[benefited all nations]{.underline}.
[Indonesia finished what China had started when the latter briefly
staged a flu sample sharing stoppage]{.underline}. [The shift to
benefits sharing and national sovereignty, and away from the rhetorics
of global health security, diminished both the discursive and the
institutional power of the North-led international system]{.underline}.
[Indonesia, along with its allies, interrupted the biocolonial
extraction of resources from the Global South and altered the system
itself, institutionalizing a redistribution of power to give the Global
South a greater role in global health governance]{.underline}.

#### It aligns with grassroots organization and activism that is actively challenging bioimperialism

[In order to sever science and public health from U.S.
empire]{.underline}---[with its trappings of militarism, racism, and
sexism]{.underline}---[those centrally involved and directly impacted
must play a key role]{.underline}. This book has recounted that U.S.
scientists failed to resist the Bush era specter of bioterrorism. As the
Bush administration expanded the biodefense industry and secured the
research therein from "restricted persons"---that is, foreign nationals
hailing from "state sponsors of terrorism" and other groups criminalized
under the USA PATRIOT Act---bioscience became yet another arena stoking
a racist, nativist post-9 / 11 imaginary. Scientists who objected to the
new restrictions on accessing and transferring research materials did so
largely because such restrictions hampered their "scientific freedom."
Their actions reflected the ideology that science is neutral and
value-free, and that scientists should be free to pursue any and all
research for the sake of technoscientific progress, while taking no
responsibility for the consequences and political dimensions of their
work. [Criticism of science's role in the war on terror came instead
from outside the scientific establishment]{.underline}. [Progressive
journalists and organizations concerned with science, such as biodefense
watchdog group the Sunshine Project and bio-artist collective Critical
Art Ensemble]{.underline} (to which Steve Kurtz belongs), [were vital to
holding the biodefense industry accountable]{.underline}. [They
critiqued the role of science in U.S. war and empire, but also the fact
that the U.S. public could obtain little information on these
projects]{.underline} (the increasing purview of the post-9 / 11 U.S.
national security apparatus was directly proportional to decreasing
public transparency). [These groups made the clandestine activities of
the U.S. biological warfare industry and its hazards publicly
visible]{.underline}. **[Pushing past the barriers of technical jargon
and the secrecy shrouding security practices, they trespassed into
realms typically reserved for the technocratic elite]{.underline}**. In
doing so, they accomplished an important first step toward public
accountability. [In 2014, the activist organization Science for the
People revived its sixties-era mission to "mobilize people working in
scientific fields to become active in agitating for science, technology,
and medicine that would serve social needs rather than military and
corporate interests]{.underline}."3 [The organization had emerged out of
the antiwar movement in 1969, after science students at MIT organized a
moratorium on war research, leading to protests at other
universities]{.underline}. Out [of that activism came Scientists and
Engineers for Social and Political Action, which later changed its name
to Science for the People. The organization critiqued the mainstream
scientific establishment's complicity in war, as well as sexism, racism
and capitalism.]{.underline} Members waged protests and boycotts, and
until 1989 published more than a hundred issues of a bimonthly magazine,
focusing on topics such as biological determinism and farm worker
mechanization. [In its current twenty-first century form, Science for
the People continues to organize scientists, along with activists,
students, and scholars interested in science, to take control of the
scientific agenda and direct it toward "a more humane and liberating
vision of science in society"]{.underline} (Science for the People
n.d.b). [The organization's working groups agitate against the status
quo of military, corporate, and elite interests directing science.4 They
connect to radical left movements, from Black Lives Matter's opposition
to state violence against black bodies to immigration justice
organizations' fight against ICE's dehumanizing, violent actions at the
border ordered by Trump's openly racist, xenophobic regime.]{.underline}
Science for the People has engaged in solidarity pickets, most notably
with tech workers calling for companies Microsoft, Google, and Amazon to
stop supplying technology platforms to ICE (Science for the People
n.d.c). It has also held events in support of the Green New Deal,
legislation that foregrounds the differential impacts of climate change
on women, indigenous peoples, peoples of color, and the Global South
(Science for the People n.d.d). **[This renewal of sixties-era mass,
organized movement holds the promise to repurpose science and technology
for social justice]{.underline}**. [In rejecting the ideology of
unregulated technoscientific progress and attempting to decouple
technoscientific practices from their imbrication with militarism,
racism, and sexism, theirs is a radical vision that holds scientists and
tech workers accountable for the consequences of their
labor]{.underline}---[research and development practices should be
rigorously evidence-based as well as socially meaningful]{.underline}.
**[It entreats scientists and tech workers to reconsider the ends to
which they ought to put their labor power: "Knowledge is won with our
labor and can be used to advance common goals"]{.underline}** (Science
for the People 2018). From Local to Global Wellness: Building
Intersections, Practicing Solidarity When Obama inherited the biodefense
budget of his predecessor, he conserved its levels, but rerouted funding
from biodefense to prevention of naturally arising diseases (Tucker
2010).5 Unlike bioweapons attacks, infectious disease remained a very
real occurrence. The H1N1 "swine" flu emerged in April 2009 in Mexico
and the United States (California).6 Less than two months later, the
World Health Organization (WHO) labeled it a pandemic. The Obama
administration met it with the pandemic preparedness regime set in
motion under Bush, but scaled back the contested role of border
controls---foregoing travel restrictions---and deemphasized
militarization as a means to secure public compliance (The 2009
Influenza Pandemic 2009). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) turned to equitable vaccine distribution, prioritizing populations
most at risk for severe illness (pregnant women, caregivers for young
children, healthcare workers and ER personnel, children and young
adults, and people with health conditions) (CDC n.d.c). U.S. efforts
experienced some stumbles---H1N1 vaccine stocks ran out as
pharmaceutical production slowed. Even so, flu vaccines are not a
perfect solution---strains mutate and make vaccines less effective or
obsolete. U.S. dependence on vaccines as the primary response to flu,
moreover, can distract from addressing underlying structures that cause
potentially pandemic human flu strains to emerge. Industrial factory
farming has produced large-scale animal outbreaks---the densely packed,
highly susceptible animals then pose a threat of infection to their
human handlers (Greger 2006); these farms also create large quantities
of animal waste that frequently contaminate nearby waters with viruses
and other germs that humans may consume, which can lead to strains that
can then infect and transmit among human populations (Singer 2009). In
addition to vaccination being an inadequate prevention strategy, as long
as health interventions rely heavily on vaccines and pharmaceutical
production, they remain entrenched in the agendas of global corporate
institutions. Yet, we must look to the incredible strides Indonesia and
its allies in the Global South made when they banded together during the
H5N1 epidemic to drastically transform a flu virus-sharing system that
was both deeply beholden to pharmaceutical corporations and structured
around the health priorities of the Global North. They bucked the
profit-driven, neocolonial virus-sharing system through a combination of
systemic analysis, strategic resource-leveraging, and alliance-building.
Through these sustained activities they built a global flu system that
foregrounded benefit sharing and the health of nations most impacted by
flu, which culminated in the 2011 Pandemic Influenza Preparedness
Framework adopted by the WHO. Although broader inequities in pathogen
sharing have remained, as North-based pharmaceuticals continue to find
ways to acquire the South's disease samples without providing adequate
compensation,7 the reformed global flu regulations nevertheless
constitute an extraordinary success for health equity. [The way that
national governments in the Global South were able to redistribute the
international balance of power in flu preparedness serves as a valuable
model for achieving global justice]{.underline}. [But social movements
and movement-based organizations remain pivotal in effecting
transnational change.]{.underline} [The Third World Network, an
independent nonprofit international research and advocacy organization
based in Malaysia, supported Global South governments' efforts to
rebalance the WHO global flu system]{.underline};8 [they were also vocal
advocates for indigenous groups, which face marginalization in the
Global South and North alike in access and benefitsharing systems
because these systems prioritize state sovereignty]{.underline}---rather
than indigenous people's sovereignty---[over biological
resources]{.underline} (Saez 2018).9 The nurses' organizations active in
countering the 2003 National Smallpox Vaccination Program offer a
U.S.-based exemplar of localized change-making that connects to global
justice. When they challenged the vaccination program, calling it out as
more harmful than healthful, they built on years of organizing through
professional associations and unions for safer working conditions and
better pay within male- and corporatedominated medical establishments in
the United States (Reverby 1987). And when they charged the Bush
administration with devising the vaccination program to boost its
war-mongering agenda against Iraq, they connected with broader struggles
against U.S. empire, acting in solidarity with the Iraqi people. In
2009, the California Nurses Association, the Massachusetts Nurses
Association, and the United American Nurses joined to form the broader
National Nurses United (NNU), becoming the largest organization of
registered nurses in the United States.10 They have continued to fight
in solidarity with progressive movements globally. Under Obama they were
at the forefront of fighting for universal health care (Healthcare-NOW
2009), and under Trump's austere health care vision they have continued
to lobby for Medicare for All (National Nurses United 2012).11 They have
also been quick to take action against the Trump administration's
perpetration of humanitarian and health crises: they have worked at the
U.S.-Mexico border in refugee support, advocated against the gun
epidemic, denounced the administration's tacit support of white male /
white nationalist violence, and promoted the global movement for climate
justice (National Nurses United 2014, 2019a). [The world's health
problems remain daunting, as many governments around the world continue
to disinvest in disease prevention and health infrastructure, as well as
over-rely on vaccines and other pharmaceutical
treatments]{.underline}---[made worse by corporate monopolies and
widening access disparities]{.underline}. [I continue to heed the
organizations and movements working to disentangle health care from
profit and militarism, and how they ground their struggle in coalition
building with other movements against injustice]{.underline}. [These
groups]{.underline}, I believe, [will persist in making significant
inroads on a structural level]{.underline}---[and on a global
scale]{.underline}---[to transform health care into a comprehensive,
equitable, and accessible public service.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Transition War

#### Peaceful transition is possible but [try or die]{.underline} for recovery post conflict if there's war.

World War,\"

It should not come as a surprise that a [change of the dominant mode of
production]{.underline} of human society [takes place by a **clash** of
**brute forces**]{.underline}, of worldwide war. Limiting his attention
to the aspect of equality of men the anthropologist Walter Scheidel
describes in fascinating historical detail how [wars always preceded the
setup of large scale new organization of society]{.underline}, see
\[Scheidel, 2017\]. To which extent such a war again is on the agenda
today - contrary to the existence of DC - clearly is a question of
forecasting. The previous section of this chapter used a scenario
technique to sketch some contours of a possible third World War. These
scenarios are not independent, mixtures of them are to be expected, e.g.
a common strategy of a player in scenario 1 is to stir up national civil
war (scenario 2) in a satellite country of its opponent (e.g.
Yugoslavia); or to use the rhetoric of scenario 3 to support the fight
of national class struggle (scenario 2). But [will WW3 happen at
all?]{.underline}

[Not necessarily,]{.underline} but with a frightening high probability.
[Some **counterstrategies** already have been mentioned]{.underline}
along the discussion of the scenarios. [The **immediate
candidate**]{.underline}, of course, [is a **global peace
movement**]{.underline}. This movement already played a pivotal role in
ending the Vietnam War, being an incubator for the worldwide cultural
revolution of 1968. As the short life and the macroeconomic impotence30
of this rebellion showed, any movement with durable impact needs not
only roots in personal perceptions and feelings, it also needs a very
sophisticated and well-developed blueprint of the overall working of a
global democratic society. [A mode of production is a complicated
political economy entity, which needs a **complicated system design**.
Fortunately, the explosive **accumulation** of **human knowledge**, of
**science**, should]{.underline} be able to [provide just that -- if it
were not handcuffed by]{.underline} the singular tasks tailored by
[Disintegrating Capitalism. The next best counteraction]{.underline}
thus [is to **organize** the carriers of this knowledge]{.underline},
e.g. [scientists, in a **progressive global class**. Even if WW3
happens, chances are that a **restart is possible** and the
**blueprint** of a **better mode of production** is
**needed**]{.underline}. In this case Umberto Eco's vision of an
upcoming new Middle Ages31, with monasteries (today: universities?)
preserving and developing secret knowledge, might become reality.

Our Future Must Be One Without Economic Growth

So focused on serving the needs of the wealthy elites, most governments,
[political leaders and policy-makers are stuck in the certainty that
"**there is no alternative**]{.underline}" and their plans lie at the
core of that belief. [The proposals support "**business as usual**" with
a coat of]{.underline} **[greenwash]{.underline}** and a nip and tuck
here and there. [They **fail** to recognize that economic **growth** is
in]{.underline} **[direct conflict]{.underline}** [with
**decarbonization**, slowing down **global warming**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} [**redistributing wealth**, and that we must eliminate
or vastly reduce certain activities altogether]{.underline}.

[It is time to **expose** the]{.underline} **[extreme
fallacy]{.underline}** [behind mainstream policy positions regarding the
climate crisis. Decarbonization that will slow global warming is going
to require **more than a few tweaks to the system**]{.underline} and
nods to green investment. [It will demand that we]{.underline}
**[jettison our current economic paradigm]{.underline}** altogether [and
replace it with a more]{.underline} **[socialist]{.underline}**,
**[participatory]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[democratic]{.underline}** [paradigm that puts social and
environmental needs at its center and massively redistributes
wealth]{.underline}. We are only kidding ourselves if we think it can
happen any other way.

[Many millions of us have already come to this realization. Recent polls
conducted in Britain]{.underline}, for example, [showed that just 6
percent wanted to go back to the economy as it was before the COVID-19
pandemic]{.underline} and 82 percent wanted to prioritize health and
well-being over economic growth. [Grassroots **activists**
and]{.underline} **[movements]{.underline}** [are busy creating and
implementing the]{.underline} **[alternatives]{.underline}** [to the
status quo. "Ordinary" people are light-years ahead of the governments
and political leaders in taking these courageous steps.]{.underline}

Despite the heroic efforts of everyday people working at localized
levels, there are three hard truths we must face. The first is that [our
governments and political leaders are a major barrier. They may be
pathetic but they hold the levers of power]{.underline}, albeit on
behalf of the elites. [The second hard truth is that efforts at
localized levels are insufficient. Solving the climate crisis will
necessitate the **end of capitalism**]{.underline} [and that
necessitates **action on a global scale**]{.underline} [through global
**coordination**]{.underline}, **[planning]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[regulation]{.underline}**. Both of these truths,
therefore, make it critical for our governments and leaders to catch up
and start working for and with us.

### 2NC -- AT: Capitalism Inevitable/Resilient

#### Capitalism has primed you with [cognitive bias]{.underline}\-\--the belief that capitalism is [inevitable]{.underline} or [natural]{.underline} is a myth that [ignores decades of interdisciplinary science]{.underline}\-\--organization without privatized profit is both possible and [naturally aligned]{.underline} with human nature.

Producer, Designer, and Creative Director of The Response; \"How
Economists Tricked Us Into Thinking Capitalism Works,\"
https://truthout.org/articles/how-economists-tricked-us-into-thinking-capitalism-works/\]

These days, it seems like [someone is always trying to]{.underline}
**[privatize]{.underline}** [something.]{.underline} One day it's the
Trump administration contemplating the privatization of the Department
of Veterans Affairs. The next it's the Tories looking to sell off the
U.K.'s National Health Service, or [economists promoting "market-based"
solutions to the]{.underline} [**climate crisis**. In this age of
**neoliberalism**, the rallying cry for politicians and
economists]{.underline} alike [is always]{.underline} for "[More
privatization! More markets!]{.underline} Sell it all off to the private
sector!"

Of course, much of the time [this faith in the market is used as a cover
by those looking to simply **make a profit**]{.underline} --- or by the
politicians representing their interests. But this is not always the
case. [There are many who actually believe]{.underline}, wholeheartedly,
[that markets are the]{.underline} **[most efficient]{.underline}** [and
even]{.underline} the **[most ethical]{.underline}** [way to run a
society. And because this is the worldview that is]{.underline}
**[taught in the vast majority]{.underline}** [of economics
departments]{.underline} throughout the world, [it's not surprising that
this is the dominant worldview among those in power]{.underline}.

[It's an ideology that was]{.underline} **[carefully
crafted]{.underline}** [during the time of the early Western economists
like]{.underline} **[Adam Smith]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**David Ricardo**. Homo sapiens are actually **Homo economicus**, the
theory goes: selfish, competitive, rational agents who are
all]{.underline} [constantly seeking to]{.underline} efficiently
[maximize their own personal well-being]{.underline}.

No need to despair, however, because economists have figured out that
these inherent traits can actually be utilized for good, through a
social relation known as the market. By its nature, the market
encourages competition and efficiency, and thus, by relying on the
self-maximizing behavior of individuals, market capitalism is the only
economic system that truly accepts human nature for what it is. And in
fact, it's the only system uniquely situated to actually channel this
nature into a net positive outcome for society.

How does this all work? Well, when they are free to make choices that
maximize their own interests, people in a market system negotiate on a
price and quantity of a product or service until a sort of equilibrium
is established. It's a natural process of compromise that leaves
everyone satisfied and also leads to an efficient way of producing and
distributing goods and services. Everyone wins. And, the theory goes, it
just so happens that the process aligns perfectly with human nature.
It's a fascinating theory. The only thing is, it's completely wrong.

[The **foundation** of this **theory** relies on an **assumption** about
**human nature** that has been]{.underline} **[discredited over and
over]{.underline}** [by research across **multiple scientific
disciplines**]{.underline}. It turns out that [Homo economicus is
a]{.underline} [**fairytale**, an outdated **misconception**, a
gross]{.underline} **[distortion of reality]{.underline}**. [Yet, it
still serves as the **theoretical foundation** of our entire economic
system]{.underline}.

Studies have determined that [the Homo economicus personality is an
extremely rare one]{.underline}. Instead, [most humans are marked by a
deep capacity for **reciprocity**, **cooperation** and
**selflessness**.]{.underline} For example, research shows that [by 14
months of age, children are already beginning to help each
other]{.underline} by handing over objects that others are
unsuccessfully reaching for. [This]{.underline} **[empathic
behavior]{.underline}** [only increases as children grow older and begin
to share]{.underline} things that they value with others [and even
object to other people's violation of social norms]{.underline}.

[These are all early signs of]{.underline}
**[prosociality]{.underline}** --- [behavior that is marked by
an]{.underline} **[intent to help or benefit others]{.underline}**. [And
importantly, this behavior is motivated by a]{.underline} **[genuine
concern]{.underline}** for others and not by selfishness.

[Evolutionary biologists]{.underline} have [also largely debunked the
theory of Homo economicus]{.underline}. Researchers like David Sloan
Wilson and others have determined that [more prosocial groups will
robustly outcompete less prosocial groups, meaning that prosociality was
an **advantageous trait**]{.underline} [when it came to the]{.underline}
**[natural selection]{.underline}** of early humans. And [these theories
are not new]{.underline}. Over a century ago, the anarchist theorist
Peter Kropotkin wrote convincingly on how [the **survival of our
species**]{.underline} [has depended more on cooperation than on the
heroic efforts of isolated individuals]{.underline}. It certainly is
difficult imagining an early human taking down a woolly mammoth without
engaging in highly coordinated prosocial behavior. How else could the
human species evolve to dominate the globe if not by cooperating with
one another to overcome the many challenges our species faced?

Another place where we see the myth of Homo economicus debunked is in
the research that comes out of post-disaster communities. In her
landmark book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Rebecca Solnit presents a
thesis arguing that [humans have an **innate capacity**]{.underline}
[toward]{.underline} **[collectivism]{.underline}** --- and that these
traits tend to reveal themselves most strongly in community response to
disasters. Far from resorting to antisocial behavior after a disaster (a
myth which the media tend to elevate), Solnit's book outlines enumerable
instances where communities demonstrate prosocial behaviors like
cooperation, solidarity, sacrifice and generosity instead.

"In the wake of an earthquake, a bombing, or a major storm, most people
are altruistic, urgently engaged in caring for themselves and those
around them, strangers and neighbors as well as friends and loved ones,"
Solnit writes. "Decades of meticulous sociological research on behavior
in disasters, from the bombings of World War II to floods, tornadoes,
earthquakes, and storms across the continent and around the world, have
demonstrated this."

Yet, [despite the overwhelming evidence contradicting it, we've come
to]{.underline} **[accept Homo economicus]{.underline}** as the truth.
[Perhaps not always consciously, but it]{.underline} haunts our dreams,
our imagination. It [**confines** our **sense of
possibility**]{.underline} [and **imposes boundaries**]{.underline} [as
arbitrary as those that **carve** up **ecosystems** and **communities**
into nation-states]{.underline}.

[Market capitalism has been **imposed onto us**, often at the point of a
gun, and as a result, we've been]{.underline} **[forced to
internalize]{.underline}** [the idea that we are a]{.underline}
[**selfish**, **competitive** and **greedy** species]{.underline}. Well,
that's just human nature, we'll acquiesce when we hear about the
profiteering of pharmaceutical companies or the greed of investment
bankers. But [the thing this, that's]{.underline} **[not human
nature]{.underline}** --- [it's just what we've been]{.underline}
**[coerced into thinking]{.underline}** [by an unfeeling economic system
that dominates every facet of our life]{.underline}. And in many ways,
**[Homo economicus is a self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}**.

It's been demonstrated that studying economics actually makes you more
selfish. Studies have shown that economics students are much less likely
than other students to donate money that was given to them into a common
pool; that they are more likely to "freeride" and are also more likely
to defect than to cooperate; that they are more likely to participate in
deception for personal gain; and even that they are more likely than
their peers to rate greed as "generally good," "correct" and "moral."

And it's not just students: economics professors give less money to
charity than professors in other fields --- including history,
philosophy, education, psychology, sociology, anthropology, literature,
physics, chemistry and biology.

[When faced with the overwhelming evidence that Homo
economicus]{.underline} --- [and thus the whole neoclassical economic
project]{.underline} --- [is]{.underline} [**nonsense**, the
**defenders** of the]{.underline} **[status quo]{.underline}** [tend to
rely on another]{.underline} **[myth]{.underline}**: [that **there is no
alternative**]{.underline}. Margaret Thatcher famously uttered those
words over 30 years ago, paving the way for an age of neoliberalism that
has seen the dismantling of the social safety net, the stagnation of
wages and the rise of extreme inequality.

But the thing is, [there are alternative ways of **organizing society**
that reflect the human capacity for **reciprocity**, **selflessness**
and **cooperation**. The **worker cooperative model**]{.underline}
[promotes **equity**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[democracy]{.underline}** [by giving workers ownership and control
over their workplaces.]{.underline} It does so in a way that not only
aligns with our inherently human traits, but in a way which has been
shown to be more efficient and productive than the traditional workplace
models.

[There is also the **commons model**]{.underline} [that reflects how
communities **organized themselves** for **thousands of
years**]{.underline} [before they were torn off their land in the
enclosure acts of 17th-century England. The commons are a way
of]{.underline} **[organizing production and distribution]{.underline}**
[where resources are **held in common**]{.underline} [and
are]{.underline} **[accessible to every member of society]{.underline}**
[to be managed collectively for the]{.underline} **[benefit of
all]{.underline}**.

In fact, the political economist Eleanor Ostrom actually won the Nobel
Prize in Economics in 2009 for disproving the long-held belief known as
[the "tragedy of the commons,"]{.underline} a theory [which
held]{.underline} that [resources held in common by communities
would]{.underline} naturally [be overused and depleted]{.underline}.
Ostrom's work demonstrated that this assumption [is]{.underline}
**[false]{.underline}**, and that [it is in fact very possible for
resources to be managed collectively **without
privatization**.]{.underline}

There are many ways that community resources can be collectivized
instead of privatized, from land trusts that take land off of the market
to policy proposals like Medicare for All, which represents a major
shift in how we view our collective responsibility when it comes to
health care, or the Green New Deal, which recognizes our collective
responsibility to prioritize climate justice in the fight against
climate change.

[The alternatives to market capitalism are out there]{.underline} ---
and the thing is, [they actually align much more closely to the natural
human tendencies toward reciprocity and sharing. The theories behind
modern economics have left us with a]{.underline} **[burning
planet]{.underline}** [and with]{.underline} **[skyrocketing
inequality]{.underline}** --- it's time to put them to rest.

And [whether economists and politicians choose to accept it or not, the
days of Homo economicus are]{.underline} [**limited**, because a
**society based off of a lie cannot go on indefinitely**]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- AT: Military Fights the Alt

#### Veterans and active military members are sympathetic to communism due to the military's failures

Mary **Esch '18**, Associated Press, "US Army boots West Point officer
who touted communist revolution during graduation ceremony", 6/19/18,
USA Today,
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2018/06/19/us-army-boots-west-point-officer-who-touted-communism-during-graduation/713286002/

Less than a year after Rapone's images drew a firestorm of vitriol and
even death threats, the second lieutenant who became known as **[the
"commie cadet" is officially out of the U.S. Army]{.underline}** with an
other-than-honorable discharge.

Top brass at Fort Drum's 10th Mountain Division accepted Rapone's
resignation Monday after an earlier reprimand for "conduct unbecoming of
an officer." [Rapone said an investigation found he went online to
advocate for a socialist revolution and disparage high-ranking officers
and U.S. officials]{.underline}. Officially, the Army said in a
statement only that it conducted a full investigation and "appropriate
action was taken."

[An unrepentant Rapone summed up the fallout in yet another tweet Monday
that showed him extending a middle finger at a sign at the entrance to
Fort Drum, accompanied by the words, "One final salute."]{.underline}

\[Embedded Tweet Removed\]

"**[I consider myself a revolutionary socialist,]{.underline}**" **[the
26-year-old Rapone told]{.underline}** The Associated Press in a series
of interviews. "**[I would encourage all soldiers who have a conscience
to lay down their arms and join me and so many others who are willing to
stop serving the agents of imperialism and join us in a revolutionary
movement]{.underline}**."

**[Rapone said his journey to communism grew out of his experiences as
an Army Ranger in Afghanistan before he was accepted into the U.S.
Military Academy. And those views only hardened during his studies of
history as one of the academy's "Long Gray Line."]{.underline}**

[He explained that he took the offending selfies at his May 2016 West
Point graduation ceremony and kept them to himself until last September,
when he tweeted them in solidarity with NFL quarterback Colin
Kaepernick, who was taking heat for kneeling for the national anthem to
raise awareness of racism]{.underline}. Many other military personnel
also tweeted in favor of Kaepernick, although most were supporting free
speech, not communism.

West Point released a statement after Rapone posted the photos, saying
his actions "in no way reflect the values of the U.S. Military Academy
or the U.S. Army." And U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican,
called on the secretary of the Army to remove Rapone from the officer
ranks.

"While in uniform, Spenser Rapone advocated for communism and political
violence, and expressed support and sympathy for enemies of the United
States," Rubio said Monday, adding "I'm glad to see that they have given
him an 'other-than-honorable' discharge."

One of six children growing up in New Castle, Pennsylvania, [Rapone said
he applied to West Point, which is tuition-free, because he couldn't
afford college. He was nominated out of high school by then-U.S. Rep.
Jason Altmire in 2010.]{.underline}

"He was an honors student, an athlete, a model citizen who volunteered
in the community," recalled Altmire, a Democrat. "During the interview,
he expressed patriotism and looked just like a top-notch candidate.
There were no red flags of any kind."

[But he wasn't accepted to West Point, so Rapone enlisted in the
Army.]{.underline} [He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 and was
assigned as an assistant machine gunner in Khost Province]{.underline}.

"**[We were bullies in one of the poorest countries on
Earth]{.underline}**," **[Rapone said]{.underline}**. "**[We have one of
the most technologically advanced militaries of all time and all we were
doing is brutalizing and invading and terrorizing a population that had
nothing to do with what the United States claimed was a
threat]{.underline}**."

T[oward the end of his deployment, he learned West Point fulfills a
certain quota of enlisted soldiers every year]{.underline}. **[Despite
his growing disillusionment about the military, he applied and got
in]{.underline}**.

"**[I was still idealistic]{.underline}**," he said**[." I figured maybe
I could change things from inside]{.underline}**."

**[In addition to classic socialist theorists such as Karl Marx, Rapone
says he found inspiration in the writings of Stan Goff, a retired
Special Forces master sergeant who became a socialist anti-war
activist]{.underline}**.

Even while still a cadet, Rapone's online postings alarmed a West Point
history professor, who wrote Rapone up, saying his online postings were
"red flags that cannot be ignored." Rapone was disciplined but still
allowed to graduate.

Greg Rinckey, an attorney specializing in military law, said it's rare
for an officer out of West Point to receive an other-than-honorable
discharge. He added that it's also possible the military academy could
seek repayment of the cost of Rapone's education because he didn't serve
the full five-year service obligation required upon graduation.

"I **[knew there could be repercussions," said Rapone, who is scheduled
to speak at a socialism conference]{.underline}** in Chicago next month.
"**[Of course my military career is dead in the water. On the other
hand, many people reached out and showed me support. There are a lot of
veterans both active duty and not that feel like I do]{.underline}**."

### 2NC -- AT: Not Concrete

#### There's no one-size-fix-all alternative\-\--our task is shaping the [best proposals]{.underline} into a [unified alternative]{.underline} to capitalism.

**Monbiot \'19** \[George; 4/25/19; columnist for The Guardian, has held

Brookes (planning), and East London (environmental science); \"Dare to

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/25/capitalism-economic-system-survival-earth/\]

[So what does a **better system** look like? I don't have a **complete
answer**, and I don't believe any one person does. But I]{.underline}
think I [see a **rough framework** emerging]{.underline}. Part of it is
provided by the ecological civilisation proposed by Jeremy Lent, one of
the greatest thinkers of our age. Other elements come from Kate
Raworth's doughnut economics and the environmental thinking of Naomi
Klein, Amitav Ghosh, Angaangaq Angakkorsuaq, Raj Patel and Bill
McKibben. [Part of the answer lies in the notion of "private
sufficiency, public luxury". Another part arises from the creation of a
**new conception of justice** based on this simple **principle**: every
generation, everywhere, shall have an **equal right** to the
**enjoyment** of **natural wealth**]{.underline}.

I believe [our task is to identify the **best proposals** from many
**different thinkers** and **shape them** into a **coherent
alternative**. Because no economic system is only an
economic]{.underline} system [but intrudes into every aspect of our
lives, we need many minds from various disciplines -- **economic**,
**environmental**, **political**, **cultural**, **social** and
**logistical** -- **working collaboratively** to create a **better way
of organising**]{.underline} ourselves [that meets our needs without
destroying our home]{.underline}.

[Our choice comes down to this. Do we stop life to allow capitalism to
continue, or stop capitalism to allow life to continue?]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Scenario Planning

#### A Marxist economy could be implemented through participatory economic planning which solves scenario planning

**Eagleton 11 **\[Terry, Distinguished Professor of English Literature
at Lancaster University, *Why Marx Was Right*, 2011, Yale University:
New Haven, CT, p. 25-26\]

Education and state monitoring might diminish these dangers,
but some Marxists look instead to an economy which would be neither
centrally planned nor market-governed.π On this model, resources would
be allocated by negotiations between producers, consumers,
environmentalists and other relevant parties, in networks
of **[workplace]{.underline}**, neighbourhood and **[consumer
councils]{.underline}**. The broad parameters of the economy, including
decisions on the overall allocation of resources, rates of growth and
investment, energy, transport and ecological policies and the
like, would be set by **[representative assemblies ]{.underline}**at
local, regional and national level. These general decisions about,
say, allocation would then be devolved downwards to regional and local
levels, where more detailed planning would be **[progressively worked
out]{.underline}**. At every stage, **[public debate]{.underline}** over
alternative economic plans and policies **[would be
essential]{.underline}**. In this way, what and how we produce could
be determined **[by social need]{.underline}** rather than private
profit. Under capitalism, **[we are deprived of the
power]{.underline}** to decide whether we want to produce
more **[hospitals or]{.underline}** more **[breakfast
cereals. ]{.underline}**Under socialism, this **[freedom would be
regularly exercised]{.underline}**. Power in such assemblies would pass
by democratic election from the bottom up rather than from the top
down. Democratically elected bodies representing each branch of commerce
or production would negotiate with a national economic commission to
achieve an agreed set of investment decisions. Prices would be
determined not centrally, but by production units on the **[basis of
input from consumers]{.underline}**, users, interest groups and so on.

 

#### Utopian specifics are bad -- produces a psychological investment in narrow-minded visions that foreclose change

**Eagleton 11 **\[Terry, Distinguished Professor of English Literature
at Lancaster University, *Why Marx Was Right*, 2011, Yale University:
New Haven, CT, p. 64-67\]

 ''**[So will there still be road accidents in this Marxist
utopia of yours]{.underline}**?'' This is the kind of sardonic inquiry
that Marxists have grown used to dealing with. In fact, the comment
reveals more about the ignorance of the speaker than about the illusions
of the Marxist. Because if utopia means a perfect society, then
''Marxist utopia'' is a contradiction in terms. There are, as it
happens, far more interesting uses of the word ''utopia'' in the Marxist
tradition.∞ One of the greatest of 64 65 English
Marxist revolutionaries, William Morris, produced an unforgettable work
of utopia in News from Nowhere, which unlike almost every other utopian
work actually showed in detail how the process of political change had
come about. When it comes to the everyday use of the word, however, it
should be said that **[Marx shows not the
slightest interest]{.underline}** in a future free of suffering, death,
loss, failure, breakdown, conflict, tragedy or even labour. In fact, he
doesn't show much interest in the future at all. It is a notorious fact
about his work that he has very little to say in detail about what a
socialist or communist society would look like. His critics may
therefore accuse him of unpardonable vagueness; but they can hardly do
that and at the same time accuse him of drawing up utopian
blueprints. **[It is capitalism]{.underline}**, not
Marxism, **[that trades in futures]{.underline}**. In The German
Ideology, he rejects the idea of communism as ''an ideal to which
reality will have to adjust itself.'' Instead, he sees it in The German
Ideology as ''the real movement which abolishes the present state of
things.''≤ Just as the Jews were traditionally forbidden to foretell the
future, so Marx the secular Jew is mostly silent on what might lie
ahead. We have seen that he probably thought socialism was inevitable,
but he has strikingly little to say about what it would look like. There
are several reasons for this reticence. For one thing, the future does
not exist, so that to forge images of it is a kind of lie. To do so
might also suggest that the future is predetermined---that it lies in
some shadowy 65 66 realm for us to discover. We have seen that there is
a sense in which Marx held that the future was inevitable. But the
inevitable is not necessarily the desirable. Death is inevitable, too,
but not in most people's eyes desirable. The future may be
predetermined, but that is no reason to assume that it is going to be an
improvement on what we have at the moment. The inevitable, as we have
seen, is usually pretty unpleasant. Marx himself needed to be more aware
of this. Foretelling the future, however, is not only pointless;
it **[can actually be destructive]{.underline}**. To have power even
over the future is a way of giving ourselves a **[false sense of
security]{.underline}**. It is a tactic for **[shielding
ourselves]{.underline}** from the open-ended nature of the present, with
all
its **[precariousness]{.underline}** and **[unpredictability]{.underline}**. It is to
use the future as a kind of fetish---as a **[comforting idol to cling
to]{.underline}** like a toddler to its blanket. It is an absolute
value which will not let us down because (since it does not exist) it
is as insulated from the winds of history as a phantom. You can also
seek to monopolise the future as a way of dominating the present. The
true soothsayers of our time are not hairy, howling outcasts luridly
foretelling the death of capitalism, but
the **[experts]{.underline}** hired by the **[transnational
corporations]{.underline}** to peer into the entrails of the system
and assure its rulers that their **[profits are safe]{.underline}** for
another ten years. The prophet, by contrast, is not a clairvoyant at
all. It is a mistake to believe that the biblical prophets sought to
predict the future. Rather, the prophet denounces the greed, corruption
and power-mongering of 66 67 the present, warning us that unless we
change our ways we might well have no future at all. Marx was a prophet,
not a fortune-teller.

### 2NC -- AT: Soviet Union failed

#### Soviet failure doesn't disprove our alternative, but the aff -- the aff still consolidates the military industrial complex by maintaining the leadership of the military as being credible and worth spending money on -- the alternative consolidates socialist and communist thought around peace 

**Adams '02** -- is the coordinator of the Culture of Peace News
Network. He retired in 2001 from UNESCO where he was the Director of the
Unit for the International Year for the Culture of Peace, proclaimed for
the Year 2000 by the United Nations General Assembly (Dr. David, "THE
AMERICAN PEACE MOVEMENTS CHAPTER 8: THE ROOT CAUSES OF WAR", Pg 25-27,
http://www.culture-of-peace.info/apm/chapter8-25.html)

In the 1985 edition of this book [the argument was made that the
socialist countries were escaping from the economic causation of war. In
comparison to the capitalist countries, they did not have the same
dynamic of over-production and cyclical depression, with periods of
enhanced structural unemployment. As]{.underline} **[for exploitation
and imperialism, despite the frequent reference in the American media to
\"Soviet imperialism,\" the direction of the flow of wealth was the
opposite of what holds true under capitalist imperialism]{.underline}**.
Instead of the rich nations extracting wealth from the poor ones, which
is the case, for example between the U.S. and Latin America, [the net
flow of wealth proceeded from the Soviet Union towards the other
socialist countries in order to bring them towards an eventually even
level of development]{.underline}. According to an authoritative source
associated with the U.S. military-industrial complex, the net outflow
from the Soviet Union amounted to over forty billion dollars a year in
the mid-1980\'s. [In one crucial respect, however, the 1985 analysis was
incorrect.]{.underline} **[It failed to take account of the
military-industrial complex that had grown to be the most powerful force
of the Soviet economy, a mirror image of its equivalent in the
West]{.underline}**. The importance of this was brought home to those of
us who attended a briefing on economic conversion from military to
civilian production that was held at the United Nations on November 1,
1990, a critical time for Gorbachev\'s program of Perestroika in the
Soviet Union. The speaker, Ednan [Ageev]{.underline}, was the head of
the Division of International Security Issues at the Soviet Ministry of
Foreign Affairs. He [was asked by the Gorbachev administration to find
out the extent to which the Soviet economy was being used for military
production]{.underline}. Naturally, he went to the Minister of Defense,
where he was told that this information was secret. Secret even to
Gorbachev. [In conversation, Ageev estimated that 85-90% of Soviet
scientific researchers were in the military sector]{.underline}. **[That
seems high until you realize that the Soviet\'s were matching U.S.
military research]{.underline}**, development and production on the
basis of a Gross National Product only half as large. Since about 40% of
U.S. research and development was tied to the military at that time, it
would make sense that the Soviets would have had to double the U.S.
percentage in order to keep pace. [How could the Gorbachev
administration convert their economy from military to civilian
production if they could not even get a list of defense
industries?]{.underline} Keeping this in mind, [**along with the
enormous militarization of the Soviet economy, it is not so surprising
that the Soviet economy collapsed, and with it the entire political
superstructure.** Th**e origins of the Soviet military-industrial
complex can be traced back to the Russian revolution which instituted
what Lenin**]{.underline}, at one point, **[called \"war
communism\".]{.underline}** **[He warned that war communism could not
succeed in the long run and that instead of a top-down militarized
economy, a socialist economy needed to be structured as a \"cooperative
of cooperatives.\"]{.underline}** **[But war communism was entrenched
during the Stalin years, carried out of necessity to an extreme during
the Second World War, and then perpetuated by the Cold War. The economic
causation of the war system is not new]{.underline}**. It originated
long before capitalism and socialism. From its beginnings in ancient
Mesopotamia, the state was always associated with war, both to capture
slaves abroad and to keep them under control at home. [As states grew
more powerful, war became the means to build empires and to acquire and
rule colonies.]{.underline} In fact, the economic causation of war
probably extends back even further into ancient prehistory. From the
best analysis I know, that of Mel and Carol Ember, using the methods of
cross-cultural anthropology, it would seem that war functioned as a
means to survive periodic but unpredictable food shortages caused by
natural disasters. Apparently, tribes that could make war most
effectively could survive natural disasters better than others by
successfully raiding the food supplies of their neighbors. [While
particular wars can be analyzed]{.underline}, as we have done above, [in
terms of immediate, short-term causes, there is a need to understand the
war system itself]{.underline}, which is as old as human history.
[Particular wars are the tip of a much deeper iceberg]{.underline}.
[Beneath war, there has developed a culture of war that is entwined with
it in a complex web of causatio]{.underline}n. On the one hand, the
culture of war is produced and reinforced by each war, and, on the other
hand, the culture of war provides the basis on which succeeding wars are
prepared and carried out[. The culture of war is a set of beliefs,
attitudes and behaviors that consists of enemy images, authoritarian
social structure, training and arming for violence, exploitation of man
and nature, secrecy and male domination]{.underline}. Without an enemy,
without a social structure where people will follow orders, without the
preparation of soldiers and weapons, without the control of information,
both propaganda and secrecy, no war can be carried out. [The culture of
war has been so prevalent in history that we take it for granted, as if
it were human nature]{.underline}. However, anthropologists point to
cultures that are nowhere near as immersed in the culture of war, and it
is the opinion of the best scientists that a culture of peace is
possible. [Peace movements have not given enough attention to the
internal use of the culture of war]{.underline}. [The culture of war has
two faces, one facing outward and the other inward]{.underline}.
[Foreign wars are accompanied by authoritarian rule inside the warring
countries]{.underline}. Even when there is no war threat,
[armies]{.underline} (or national guards) [are kept ready not just for
use against foreign enemies, but also against those defined as the enemy
within: striking workers, movements of the unemployed, prisoners,
indigenous peoples, just as in an earlier time they were used against
slave rebellions]{.underline}. As documented in my 1995 article in the
Journal of Peace Research (Internal Military Interventions in the United
States) the U.S. Army and National Guard have been used an average of 18
times a year, involving an average of 12,000 troops for the past 120
years, mostly against actions and revolts by workers and the unemployed.
[During periods of external war, the internal wars are usually
intensified and accompanied by large scale spying, deportations and
witch hunts. It would appear that we have once again entered such a
period in the U.S. We are hardly alone in this matter]{.underline}.
Needless to say, [the culture of war was highly developed to stifle
dissent in the Soviet Union by Stalin and his successors of \"war
communism.\"]{.underline} The internal culture of war needs to be
analyzed and resisted everywhere. For example, readers living in France
should question the role of the CRS. **[The internal use of the culture
of war is no less economically motivated than external
wars]{.underline}**. [The socialists]{.underline} at the beginning of
the 20th Century [recognized it as \"class war,\" carried out in order
to maintain the domination of the rich and powerful over the poor and
exploited]{.underline}. **[Not by accident, it has often been socialists
and communists who are the first to be targeted by the internal culture
of war in capitalist countries]{.underline}**. And [they]{.underline},
in turn, [have often made the most powerful critique of the culture of
war and have played a leading role in peace movements for that
reason]{.underline}. **[Their historical role for peace was considerably
compromised, however, by the \"war communism\" of the Soviet
Union]{.underline}**. **[With its demise, however, there is now an
opportunity for socialists and communists to return to their earlier
leadership against war, both internal and external, and to insist that a
true socialism can only flourish on the basis of a culture of
peace]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Collapse Now = Better

#### Time frame is [everything]{.underline} -- collapse [quicker]{.underline} is better than [later]{.underline}.

SA: You alluded earlier to the saying that [**every crisis** is an

**more crises** there are, the **more opportunities** there

romanticising or desiring crisis like some dreamyeyed fool. In fact, our

prospects of smoother and less disruptive modes of societal
transformation. So perhaps [crisis might be our **best hope for
disrupting the status quo** and **initiating the transition** to
something else.]{.underline}

[When the crises of capitalism **deepen**, as they seem **destined** to
do]{.underline} in coming years and decades, [the task will be to
**ensure** that such destabilised conditions are used to **advance
progressive**]{.underline} humanitarian and ecological [**ends** rather
than **exploited to further entrench**]{.underline} the austerity
politics of **[neoliberalism]{.underline}**. I recognise, of course,
that [the latter remains a **real possibility**]{.underline}, as did the
arch-capitalist Milton Friedman, who expressed the point in these terms:

**[Only a crisis]{.underline}**---actual or perceived---[**produces real
change**. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on
the ideas that are lying around]{.underline}. That, I believe, is our
basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep
them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the
politically inevitable.

It is not often that I am in agreement with Friedman. With reluctance I
have come to the conclusion that [it is]{.underline} probably [**only
through deepening crisis** that the **comfortable global consumer
class** will become **sufficiently perturbed** that the **sedative** and
**depoliticising effects** of affluence might be
**overcome**]{.underline}. In fact, I feel [it is **better** that
citizens are **not**]{.underline} in fact [**protected from every crisis
situation**, given that the **encounter** with crisis can play an
**essential consciousness raising role**]{.underline}, if it triggers a
desire for and motivation toward learning about the structural
underpinnings of the crisis situation itself.

RR: Yes, [the **danger**, if we are **protected from crisis for too
long**, is that we **wait even longer** than we would have **done
otherwise** before addressing it]{.underline}. This is why Jared Diamond
and others have emphasised the grave danger of highly unequal societies
(such as, disastrously, the one we now inhabit): for [the **elite** in
such societies can **fool themselves** into thinking that things
are]{.underline} basically [OK **way past the point of no return**,
while the masses **suffer** and start to **experience collapse**; and
then it is **surer** that the **society as a whole will
collapse**]{.underline}.

#### Crisis galvanizes existing movements

**Alexander, 15**---lecturer at the Office for Environmental Programs,
University of Melbourne (Samuel, *Sufficiency Economy* pg 150-152, dml)

[The **largest empirical analysis**]{.underline} of the Voluntary
Simplicity Movement (Alexander and Ussher, 2012) [shows]{.underline}
that [there could now be as many as **200 million people**]{.underline}
[in the developed]{.underline} regions of the [world
exploring]{.underline}, to varying degrees, [lifestyles of **reduced**
and **restrained consumption**. This signifies an **emerging social
movement** of **potentially transformative significance**]{.underline},
especially if it were ever to radicalise and organise itself with
political intent. Notably, [that same empirical study showed that the
movement was developing both a '**group consciousness**' and a
'**political sensibility**', features that are]{.underline} arguably
[**necessary** for any social movement to use its collective power in
**influential ways**]{.underline}. As more people are exposed to the
type of reasoning unpacked by Kevin Anderson -- that is, as more people
see that responding to climate change actually requires consuming less
-- the Voluntary Simplicity Movement could well grow in size and
influence, perhaps with surprising speed.

Interestingly, the justification for embracing a lifestyle of voluntary
simplicity does not begin and end with ecological or humanitarian
arguments. In recent decades there has been a huge amount of literature
exploring the relationship between income and subjective wellbeing (see
Alexander, 2012b), and the results undermine the culturally entrenched
assumption that 'money buys happiness'. Although the empirical debate is
not over, the weight of evidence strongly suggests that money and
material wealth is important at low levels of income, but once basic
material needs for food, shelter, clothing, etc. have been met, money
has fast diminishing marginal returns. In other words, beyond the basic
needs threshold, the things that really contribute most to human
wellbeing are not monetary or material, but instead things like
socialising, creative activity, meaningful work, and other nonmaterial
sources of meaning and satisfaction. This literature is arguably a
ticking time bomb for consumer culture, because if more people came to
see that consumerist lifestyles are not a reliable path to a happy and
meaningful existence, they would presumably give up the consumerist
lifestyle and seek happiness and meaning in realms other than
consumption. Although this culture shift might be motivated primarily by
self-interest, clearly it would have beneficial social and ecological
implications. The point is that a very strong case is developing for
people to explore post-consumerist lifestyles of reduced or restrained
consumption, suggesting that the conditions for a cultural revolution
are ripe.

It is also worth acknowledging a new and controversial analysis
presented by David Holmgren (2013), co-originator of the permaculture
concept, which provides further grounds for thinking that the Voluntary
Simplicity Movement could have disruptive potential. Voluntary
simplicity has always been an implicit feature of the permaculture
worldview, insofar as permaculture is about designing a way of life that
minimises waste in order to work with nature rather than against nature
(Holmgren, 2002). But Holmgren recently placed voluntary simplicity at
the centre of his thinking, and arrived at a theory of change that has
received a vast amount of online attention.

Always doubtful of the prospects of convincing politicians to lead the
necessary transition to a low-carbon world, Holmgren has grown
increasingly sceptical that any mass movement at the social level is
going to produce significant change either. Accordingly, his pessimism
has driven him to conclude that [the best we can hope]{.underline} at
this late stage [is to **deliberately 'crash'** the]{.underline}
existing fossil fuel-based [system]{.underline} and build a permaculture
alternative as the existing system deteriorates. His provocative theory,
to oversimplify, is that if [a]{.underline} new, **[relatively small
social movement]{.underline}** of anti-consumers were able to radically
reduce their consumption, this reduction in demand for commodities
[could **destabilise the global economy**, which is **already
struggling**]{.underline}. More precisely, Holmgren hypothesises that if
[**merely 10%** of people in a nation]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
reduce their consumption by 50%, this could signify a 5% reduction in
total demand, which, although small, would likely [**cause havoc** with
any growth-based economy]{.underline}. It is important to emphasise that
Holmgren does not romanticise the process of collapse; he acknowledges
the worrying risks his strategy poses. First and foremost, it is
unpredictable in its consequences. Nevertheless, he argues that whatever
risks his strategy poses, there are greater risks -- both socially and
environmentally -- in letting the existing system continue to degrade
planetary ecosystems. What is most interesting about Holmgren's strategy
is that [it **does not rely on a mass movement**]{.underline}. He
believes that [a **relatively small** but radical anti-consumerist
movement could be a **truly disruptive force**.]{.underline}

## Impact Turns

### Cap Good/Transition Bad

#### Spreading capitalism creates [global prosperity]{.underline} and [environmental sustainability]{.underline}. Abandoning it is [disastrous]{.underline}.

**Rhonheimer, 20**---teaching professor at the Pontifical University of
the Holy Cross (Martin, "Capitalism is Good for the Poor -- and for the
Environment,"
<https://austrian-institute.org/en/subjects-en/catholic-social-doctrine-2/capitalism-is-good-for-the-poor-and-for-the-environment/>,
dml)

[It is **not social policy** but **capitalism** that has **created
today's prosperity**]{.underline}.

What is important is that [what **made today's mass prosperity
possible** -- a phenomenon **unprecedented in history** --
was]{.underline} not social policy or social legislation, organised
trade union pressure, or corrective interventions in the capitalist
economy, but rather [**market capitalism** itself, due to its **enormous
potential for innovation** and the **ever-increasing productivity** of
human labour that resulted from it.]{.underline}

[Increasing prosperity and quality of life are **always the result** of
increasing labour productivity. **Only increased productivity** enabled
**higher social standards**, **better working conditions**, the
**overcoming of child labour**, a **higher level of education**, and the
**emergence of human capital**. This process]{.underline} of increasing
triumph over poverty and the constantly rising living standards of the
general masses [is taking place on a **global scale** -- but **only**
where the **market economy** and **capitalist entrepreneurship are able
to spread**]{.underline}.

From industrial overexploitation of nature to ecological awareness

[The **first phase** of]{.underline} industrialisation and [capitalism
was characterised by]{.underline} an enormous
**[consumption]{.underline}** of resources [and]{.underline} frequent
**[overexploitation]{.underline}** of nature, [which]{.underline} soon
[**gave the impression** that this process **could not be
sustainable**]{.underline}. Since the end of the 19th century,
[**disaster** and **doom** scenarios have **repeatedly been put
forward**, but]{.underline} in retrospect they [have **proved to be
wrong**: The combination of **technological innovation**, **market
competition**, and **entrepreneurial profit-seeking** (with the
compulsion to **constantly minimise costs**) have meant that these
scenarios **never occurred**. The **ever-increasing population** has
been **increasingly better supplied** thanks to **innovative
technologies**, **ever-increasing output** with **lower consumption** of
resources **less harmful** to the environment]{.underline} -- e.g.
[**less arable land** in agriculture, or **oil** and **electricity**
instead of **coal**]{.underline} for rapidly increasing mobility. [More
recent disaster scenarios]{.underline}, such as those [spread by
**reputable scientists**]{.underline} since the late 1960s and in the
1970s, [have also proved to be **inaccurate**]{.underline}.

[The **reason** things developed differently was the **always
underestimated innovative dynamism** of the **capitalist market
economy**, a **growing ecological awareness** and]{.underline}, as a
result, [legislative intervention that **took advantage** of the logic
of market capitalism]{.underline}: As a result of the ecological
movement that had come out of the United States since 1970, wise
legislation began to use the price mechanism to apply market incentives
to internalize negative externalities. [Environmental pollution was
**given a price-tag**]{.underline}.

[This led to an **enormous decrease in air pollution** and **other
ecological consequences** of growth, which is **only possible in free**,
**market-based societies**, because the production process here is
characterized by **competition** and **constant pressure to reduce
costs**]{.underline}, i.e. [to the **most profitable use** of
resources]{.underline}. On the other hand, **[all forms of
socialism]{.underline}**, i.e. a state-controlled economy, [have proved
to be **ecological disasters** and have left behind **destruction of
gigantic proportions**, without providing the population with
**anything** that is **near comparable in prosperity**, often even by
**destroying existing prosperity**, such as happened in
**Venezuela**]{.underline}.

Capitalist profit motive combined with digitalization as a solution:
Increasing decoupling of growth and resource consumption

Moreover, [**technological innovations** combined with **capitalist
profit-seeking** and **market competition** have led to a new and
surprising phenomenon]{.underline} over the past decades, [which is
still **hardly noticed**]{.underline} in the public debate: [the
**decoupling** of growth and resource consumption]{.underline}
("**[dematerialization]{.underline}**"). [In a **wide variety** of
industrial sectors, the developed countries]{.underline}, above all the
U.S., [are now achieving **ever greater productive output** with
**increasingly fewer resources**]{.underline}. This has a lot to do with
technology, especially the digitalization of the economy and of our
entire lives.

As the well-known MIT professor Andrew McAfee shows in his book More
from Less, published in October 2019, [this]{.underline} process also
[follows the logic of **capitalist profit maximization**]{.underline}.
To get it going, we do not need politics, even though wise, properly
incentivizing legislation can be helpful and sometimes necessary. Above
all, however, it is [the **combination of technological innovation**,
**capitalist profit-seeking**, and **market-based entrepreneurial
competition**]{.underline} that [will]{.underline} also
**[solve]{.underline}** the problem of man-made **[global
warming]{.underline}**.

In addition, [**property rights** and their protection are **decisive**
for the **careful use of natural resources**]{.underline}. And where
this is not possible, legal support for collective self-governing
structures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, are
important---as is analysed by Nobel Economic Prize winner Elinor Ostrom.
By contrast, the growing ideologically motivated [**anti-capitalist
eco-activism**, and the policies influenced by it, are leading in the
**wrong direction**, **distracting precisely** from what would be **best
for the climate** and the **environment**---and **distracting us** from
what could **help protect us** against the **inevitable consequences of
global warming**]{.underline}.

### Cap Solves War

#### The spread of capitalism causes [world peace]{.underline}!

**Mousseau, 19**---Professor in the School of Politics, Security, and
International Affairs at the University of Central Florida (Michael,
"The End of War: How a Robust Marketplace and Liberal Hegemony Are
Leading to Perpetual World Peace," International Security, Volume 44,
Issue 1, Summer 2019, p.160-196, dml)

Is war becoming obsolete? [There is **wide agreement** among scholars
that war has been in **sharp decline** since]{.underline} the defeat of
the Axis powers in [1945]{.underline}, even as there is little agreement
as to its cause.1 [Realists **reject** the idea that this trend will
continue, citing]{.underline} states\' concerns with [the "**security
dilemma**"]{.underline}: that is, in anarchy states must assume that any
state that can attack will; therefore, power equals threat, and changes
in relative power result in conflict and war.2 Discussing the rise of
China, Graham Allison calls this condition "Thucydides\'s Trap," a
reference to the ancient Greek\'s claim that Sparta\'s fear of Athens\'
growing power led to the Peloponnesian War.3

This article argues that **[there is no Thucydides Trap]{.underline}**
in international politics. [Rather, the world is **moving rapidly toward
permanent peace**, **possibly in our lifetime**]{.underline}. Drawing on
economic norms theory,4 I show that [what sometimes appears to be a
Thucydides Trap may instead be a function of factors **strictly
internal** to states and that these factors **vary** among
them]{.underline}. In brief, [leaders of states with advanced
market-oriented economies have **foremost interests** in the principle
of **self-determination** for all states, large and small, as the
foundation for a **robust global marketplace**. **War** among these
states, **even making preparations** for war, is **not possible**,
because they are in a **natural alliance to preserve** and **protect the
global order**]{.underline}. In contrast, [leaders of states with **weak
internal markets** have **little interest** in the global marketplace;
they pursue wealth **not through commerce**, but through **wars of
expansion** and **demands for tribute**]{.underline}. For these states,
power equals threat, and therefore they tend to balance against the
power of all states. [Fearing stronger states, however, minor powers
with weak internal markets tend to **constrain their expansionist
inclinations** and, for security reasons, **bandwagon** with the
**relatively benign market-oriented powers**]{.underline}.

I argue that [this liberal global hierarchy is **unwittingly** but
**systematically buttressing states\' embrace of market norms** and
**values** that, if **left uninterrupted**, is likely to culminate in
**permanent world peace**, perhaps even]{.underline} something close to
[**harmony**. My argument **challenges the realist assertion** that
great powers are engaged in a **timeless competition** over global
leadership]{.underline}, because hegemony cannot exist among great
powers with weak markets; these inherently expansionist states live in
constant fear and therefore normally balance against the strongest state
and its allies.5 [Hegemony can exist **only among market-oriented
powers**, because only they care about global order. Yet, there can be
**no competition for leadership** among market powers, because they
**always agree** with the goal of their strongest member]{.underline}
(currently the United States) [to **preserve** and **protect the global
order** based on the principle of self-determination. If another
commercial power, such as a rising China, were to **overtake the United
States**, the world would take **little notice**, because the new
leading power would **largely agree** with the global rules promoted and
enforced by its predecessor]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin\'s Russia, on
the other hand, seeks to create chaos around the world. Most other
powers, having market-oriented economies, continue to abide by the
hegemony of the United States despite its relative economic decline
since the end of World War II.6

To support my theory that domestic factors determine states\' alignment
decisions, I analyze the voting preferences of members of the United
Nations General Assembly from 1946 to 2010. I find that [states with
weak internal markets tend to **disagree** with the foreign policy
preferences of the largest market power]{.underline} (i.e., the United
States), [but more so if they are major powers or have stronger rather
than weaker military and economic capabilities. The power of states with
**robust internal markets**, in contrast, appears to have **no effect**
on their foreign policy preferences, as market-oriented states align
with the market leader **regardless of their power status** or
**capabilities**]{.underline}. I corroborate that [this pattern may be a
**consequence of states\' interest** in the **global market order** by
finding that states with **higher levels of exports** per capita are
**more likely**]{.underline} than other states to have preferences
**[aligned]{.underline}** with those of the United States; [those with
**lower levels** of exports are **more likely** to]{.underline} have
interests that do **[not align]{.underline}** with the United States,
but again more so if they are stronger rather than weaker.

Liberal [scholars]{.underline} of international politics
[have]{.underline} long offered explanations for why the incidence of
war may decline, generally beginning with [the assumption that although
the security dilemma **exists**, it can be **overcome** with the help of
factors external to states]{.underline}.7 Neoliberal institutionalists
treat states as like units and international organization as an external
condition.8 [Trade interdependence is **dyadic** and thus an **external
condition**]{.underline}.9 Democracy is an internal factor, but theories
of democratic peace have an external dimension: peace is the result of
the expectations of states\' behavior informed by the images that
leaders create of each other\'s regime types.10 In contrast, I show that
[the security dilemma **may not exist at all**]{.underline} and how
[peace can **emerge in anarchy** with states pursuing their interests
**determined entirely by internal factors**]{.underline}.11

### Framing

#### Two framing issues:

#### If we win the direction of [recent trends]{.underline}, we win. Our arg isn't that things are [good enough]{.underline}, but that they [will get better]{.underline}. 

**McAfee, 19**---cofounder and codirector of the MIT Initiative on the
Digital Economy at the MIT Sloan School of Management, former professor
at Harvard Business School and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society (Andrew, "Getting So Much Better," *More from Less:
The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using Fewer
Resources---and What Happens Next*, Chapter 11, pg 223, Kindle, dml)

Before I show the evidence, I want to be clear about one thing: [I\'m
**not trying to make the case** that things today are **good enough**.
Because they're **certainly not**. The world has **too many poor**,
**hungry**, and **sick people**]{.underline}. Too many children are
malnourished and uneducated. Too many people, despite the laws on the
books, are forced into indentured servitude and slavery. [We continue to
**pump greenhouse gases** into the atmosphere, **dump plastic** into the
oceans, **kill rare animals**, **cut down tropical forests**,
and]{.underline} otherwise **[befoul our planet]{.underline}**.

[But **we can document improvements without saying**]{.underline} or
implying [that **everything\'s okay** now. We should **document the
improvements** because they **tell us something critically important**:
what we\'re doing is **working** and therefore we should **keep doing
it** instead of **contemplating huge course changes**]{.underline}. As
Lomborg wrote in The Skeptical Environmentalist, [\'When things are
improving we **know** we are **on the right track**]{.underline}\....
Maybe [we can **do even more**]{.underline} to improve\... [but the
**basic approach is not wrong**]{.underline}.\"

[The **basic approach** we\'ve taken in **recent
decades**]{.underline}--- letting the four horsemen of the optimist
gallop faster around the world---is far from wrong. [It\'s causing some
**startlingly fast** and **broad improvements**]{.underline}. So we need
to encourage them to ride faster and farther. [We need to **step on the
accelerator**, not **yank the steering wheel in a different
direction**]{.underline}.

#### Problems with capitalism aren't [inevitable]{.underline}, but emerge where there [isn't enough of it]{.underline}.

**McAfee, 19**---cofounder and codirector of the MIT Initiative on the
Digital Economy at the MIT Sloan School of Management, former professor
at Harvard Business School and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society (Andrew, "Adam Smith Said That: A Few Words about
Capitalism," *More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to
Prosper Using Fewer Resources---and What Happens Next*, Chapter 8, pg
170-171, Kindle, dml)

But [hasn\'t capitalism also **let people down** in Latin America and
the world\'s other **less developed regions**?]{.underline} Perhaps its
failures haven\'t been as rapid and grotesque as socialism\'s in
Venezuela, but [hasn\'t it still **failed**?]{.underline} Ricardo
Hausmann argues that [it **hasn\'t**. It\'s **worked quite well** where
it has **taken hold**. The **problem**]{.underline}, he points out, [is
that it **hasn\'t been allowed to spread widely**]{.underline}. As he
puts it, \"[The capitalist reorganization of production **petered out**
in the developing world, leaving the **vast majority** of the labor
force **outside its control**]{.underline}. The numbers are astounding.
While only one in nine people in the United States are self-employed,
the proportion in India is nineteen out of twenty. Fewer than one-fifth
of workers in Peru are employed \[in\] private businesses\... In Mexico,
about one in three are.\" In the rich world self-employed people are
often freelancers or consultants, interacting professionally with
companies when they choose to. [In the **developing
world**]{.underline}, however, [the **great majority** of the
self-employed would **love to have a job with a company**, but **none
are available**. So people have to try to make a living as solo farmers,
merchants, or tradespeople]{.underline}.

[Hausmann has observed that **different regions** in developing
countries have **different economies**, and he notes a **fascinating
pattern**: where there is **more capitalism**, there is **more
prosperity**]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} the Mexican state of
**[Nuevo León]{.underline}**, for example, [**two-thirds** of the people
are employed by companies. In **Chiapas**]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[**fewer than 15 percent** are. Average incomes in Nuevo León are **nine
times higher**]{.underline}. Hausmann doesn\'t think this is a
coincidence: \"[The developing world\'s **fundamental problem** is that
capitalism **has not reorganized production** and **employment** in the
poorest countries and regions, leaving the bulk of the labor force
**outside its scope** of operation]{.underline}. \"

### Growth/Innovation Good

#### Innovation and growth are good -- any less capitalist or less growth-oriented model wrecks it, which impoverishes society and ensures violent conflict 

**Tudoreanu '20** \[Mihnea; 9/23/20; doctoral candidate in economics at
the University of Massachusetts Amherst; David M. Kotz; professor
emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst;
\"Stable Jobs or iPhones? The Dilemma of Innovation in Socialism,\"
Review of Radical Political Economics, Vol. 52, Vol. 4, p. 642-649\]

**Note: DPS = Democratically Planned Socialism**

[One]{.underline} of the [advantage]{.underline}s [for innovation in DPS
is]{.underline} that [it can]{.underline} effectively [take into account
social and environmental costs,]{.underline} including the jobs lost or
disrupted by the introduction of a new technology.8 [But this can also
be **problematic**, in that it is likely to make **innovation slower**
in **socialism** than in **capitalism**. Democratic majorities are **not
immune** to]{.underline} some of [the **same factors** that caused
**Soviet managers** to be technologically conservative]{.underline}.

On the one hand, DPS should not suffer from taut planning, unrealistic
plan targets imposed from the top down, or an incentive structure that
discourages risk-taking by trying out new technologies. But on the other
hand, [innovation is **always disruptive** in **any** kind of **economic
system**. As old technologies are **superseded**, product lines become
**obsolete** and production processes are changed, and as a result
certain]{.underline} kinds of [jobs are **no longer needed**. Even
with]{.underline} an [employment guarantee, the loss of one's job may
have to involve **retraining**, **changing careers**, or
**moving**]{.underline} across the country. So, [it is reasonable to
expect]{.underline} that [workers will **resist new
technologies**]{.underline}.9 Yet at the same time, in their capacity as
consumers, they will demand new and better products.

[This is]{.underline} the "[Stable jobs or iPhones?" dilemma. We can
prioritize]{.underline} cutting-edge [consumer products, or]{.underline}
we can prioritize [stable employment, but]{.underline} perhaps **[not
both]{.underline}**.10 In DPS, the people will be able to decide between
one and the other, on a case-by-case basis, so that [some
innovations]{.underline} will be pursued, others [will be scrapped
because of their **disruptive effects**, and some]{.underline} will be
[introduced at a **deliberately slow pace**. Meanwhile, capitalism
always comes down in favor]{.underline} of the iPhones despite the
conflict with stable jobs. [Since socialism will not]{.underline} always
do this, [it is likely that socialism will have]{.underline} more job
security but [fewer **cutting-edge**]{.underline} consumer [products
than capitalism]{.underline}.

[If there is]{.underline} an [**international rivalry** between
**socialism** and **capitalism**, the citizens of the two]{.underline}
kinds of [societies will]{.underline} be able to [compare their
lifestyles]{.underline} with those in the other economic system. Workers
living under capitalism may be attracted by the stable jobs, shorter
working hours, democratic workplaces, and social benefits provided by
socialism. However, [those]{.underline} living [under socialism will
likely also be **attracted** by the **rapid introduction** of
new]{.underline} consumer [goods under capitalism]{.underline}.
Moreover, [as long as the **speed of innovation** in socialism is
**lower**]{.underline} than that in capitalism, [the "**consumer gap**"
with capitalism would **grow**]{.underline} over time.

This may not be considered a problem for socialism if most of the
population value stable jobs more than iPhones, but there would likely
be a minority who do not. If the consumer gap is large enough, and/or
that dissenting minority has an overriding preference for new consumer
goods, then [we have a category of people with a **material interest**
in **supporting capitalism**, which values a **new
technology**]{.underline} over job stability, [even though they are part
of the working class]{.underline}.

[A common response to]{.underline} the [flaws of Soviet socialism has
been]{.underline} to [propose **other models of socialism** that would
not have those **flaws**. But the **trade-off** between **job security**
and **innovation** is not one that can be **easily eliminated** within
socialism. It is not due to]{.underline} the [overly centralized or
undemocratic nature of Soviet socialism]{.underline}.

Furthermore, there is **[a]{.underline}** [military]{.underline} aspect
to the [innovation]{.underline} problem. Innovations that aid the
military are also likely to have a disruptive effect on employment, as
in the case of consumer-oriented innovations. This is a problem because
it might [put DPS at a **military disadvantage** with respect to
capitalism, which would **hurt** the **socialist side** in
**international relations** even if no military conflict takes place. If
one side knows it would **lose any war**]{.underline} that did take
place, then [that side will **act timidly** and avoid even nonviolent
confrontation]{.underline}, so as [to **avoid provoking** the other
side]{.underline} into war. [For both sides to stand]{.underline} a
[good chance of success in a peaceful rivalry, they must be]{.underline}
more or less [evenly matched]{.underline} militarily, [so that neither
feels that it can do whatever it wants with impunity]{.underline} or
that it must tread lightly to avoid confrontation.

[The Cold War was]{.underline} a [multifaceted struggle]{.underline}
between two different systems. [Any future socialist economic order will
most likely face capitalism in a]{.underline} somewhat [similar
struggle]{.underline}. Can such a struggle be won by socialism without
matching capitalism's rate of technological development? That is the
question.

## Link Defense

### AT: Cyber

#### Cyber threat is [legitimate]{.underline}\-\--means and motive exist. 

**Wintch '21** \[Timothy; April 30; active-duty major in the United
States Air Force, M.A. in Military Studies from the American Military
University; Homeland Security Today, "Perspective: Cyber and Physical
Threats to the U.S. Power Grid and Keeping the Lights on,"
<https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/>\]

[Among **critical infrastructure**]{.underline} sectors [in the U.S.,
**energy** is]{.underline} perhaps the most [crucial]{.underline} of the
16 sectors defined by the Department of Homeland Security. [This
sector]{.underline} is so vital because it [provides the energy
**necessary** to run **every other** critical infrastructure
sector]{.underline}. However, [the U.S. **power grid**, the **backbone**
of the]{.underline} energy [sector, is built upon an **aging skeleton**
that is becoming **increasingly vulnerable** every day. Whether from
**terrorists** or]{.underline} nation-states like [**Russia** and
**China**, the]{.underline} power grid [is susceptible]{.underline} to
not just physical attacks, but also [to cyber intrusion]{.underline} as
well. However, much of this threat can be mitigated if the U.S. takes
the appropriate steps to safeguard the power grid and avoid a potential
catastrophe in the future.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism on U.S. soil has been at the forefront
of American consciousness. [**C**ritical **i**nfrastructure provides an
**appealing target** because of the **disproportionally** large impact
even a **small attack** can have on]{.underline} the
[sectors]{.underline}. In particular, [the power grid represents
a]{.underline} particularly [lucrative target]{.underline}, both [in
terms of]{.underline} the [**ease of access** and the **large
impact**]{.underline} it can make. The National Research Council stated
that [the]{.underline} U.S. power [grid is "**vulnerable** to
intelligent **multi-site attacks** by]{.underline} knowledgeable
[attackers intent on causing **maximum**]{.underline} physical
[damage]{.underline} to key components [on a **wide geographical
scale**."]{.underline}[\[1\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn1)
Additionally, the physical security of transmission and distribution
systems is difficult due to the dispersed nature of these key
components, which in turn is advantageous to attackers as it reduces the
likelihood of their
capture.[\[2\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn2)
From 2002-2012, approximately 2,500 physical attacks occurred against
transmission lines and towers worldwide and approximately 500 attacks
against transformer
substations.[\[3\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn3)
[Terrorists have the **motivation** to attack the]{.underline} U.S.
power [grid]{.underline} but [the **very nature** of the **grid** makes
it **highly vulnerable**. The power grid is]{.underline} not only [at
risk from]{.underline} physical attacks, but also [nation-state
**cyberattacks**]{.underline}.

[One nation that has]{.underline} shown [both the **capability** and
**intent**]{.underline} to use attacks against critical energy
infrastructure [is **Russia**]{.underline}, as demonstrated in their
2015 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. A Russian cyber threat group
known as Sandworm, which used its BlackEnergy malware, attacked
Ukrainian computer systems that provide remote control of the Ukraine
power
grid.[\[4\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn4)
This attack, and another in 2016, each left the capital Kiev without
power, prompting cyber experts to raise concern about the same malware
already existing in NATO and the U.S. power
grids.[\[5\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn5)
In any conflict between Russia and NATO, not only would similar
cyberattacks pose a threat, but so would potential physical attacks
severing fuel oil and natural gas lines to Western Europe. [Russia
has]{.underline} both [the capability and intent to **attack** critical
infrastructure, particularly **power grids**, during **future
conflicts** in their "**hybrid warfare**"]{.underline} approach.

[Another nation]{.underline} that has the capability to attack critical
energy infrastructure [is **China**]{.underline}, representing a threat
to not just the U.S. energy infrastructure but also that of our allies
whose support would be vital in a major conflict. A recent NATO report
highlighted this threat from China's Belt and Road Initiative, stating
that ["\[China's\]]{.underline} foreign direct [investment in strategic
sectors]{.underline} \[such as energy generation and distribution\]
[...raises **questions** about whether]{.underline} access and control
over such [infrastructure can be maintained]{.underline}, particularly
[in **crisis**]{.underline} when it would be required to support the
military."[\[6\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn6)
Like Russia, [China has been **active** with **cyber intrusions**
in]{.underline} U.S. [energy infrastructure]{.underline}. The Mission
Support Center at Idaho National Laboratory characterized these as
attacks as "multiple intrusions into US ICS/SCADA \[Industrial Control
Systems/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\] and smart grid tools
\[that\] may be aimed more at intellectual property theft and gathering
intelligence to bolster their own infrastructure, but it is likely that
they are also using these intrusions to develop capabilities to attack
the \[bulk electric system\], as
well."[\[7\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn7)
China, therefore, has both the capability and intent to conduct cyber
intrusions and attacks for myriad reasons.

Another arm of this threat is the reliance the U.S. energy industry has
on imports from China, especially transformers. In early 2020, federal
officials seized a transformer in the port of Houston that had been
imported by the Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Company before sending it to
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque. Sandia is contracted by the
U.S. Department of Energy for mitigating national security
threats.[\[8\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn8)
The Wall Street Journal reported that "Mike Howard, chief executive of
the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility-funded technical
organization, said that the diversion of a huge, expensive transformer
is so unusual -- in his experience, unprecedented -- that it
suggests officials had significant security
concerns."[\[9\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn9)
Previously destined for the Washington Area Power Administration's Ault,
Colo., substation, the transformer is believed to have been seized due
to "backdoor" exploitable hardware emplaced by the Chinese prior to
shipment.[\[10\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn10)
Shortly after these events, President Trump issued Executive Order
13920, "[Securing the United States Bulk-Power
System](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-united-states-bulk-power-system/),"
essentially limiting the import of Chinese-built critical energy
infrastructure components due to concerns about
cybersecurity.[\[11\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn11)
Interestingly, Jiangsu Huapeng "boasted that it supported 10 percent of
New York City's electricity
load."[\[12\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn12)

Franklin Kramer, the former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs, testified before a U.S. House of
Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee during an energy and
power hearing in 2011 and said that a ["**highly-coordinated** and
**structured** cyber,]{.underline} physical, or blended [attack on the
bulk power system]{.underline}, however, [could result in
**long-term**]{.underline} (**[irreparable]{.underline}**) [damage to
key system components in]{.underline} multiple simultaneous or
[**near-simultaneous** strikes."]{.underline} He added that ["an
**outage** could]{.underline} result with the potential to [affect a
**wide geographic area** and cause large]{.underline} population
[centers to lose power]{.underline} for extended
periods."[\[13\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn13)
Even the inclusion of features such as smart grids to [the **overall**
grid structure poses **new vulnerabilities** through]{.underline} their
[connectivity]{.underline}. Kramer stated that "such [connectivity
means]{.underline} that the [distribution system could be a **key
vector** for a]{.underline} national [security **attack** on the
grid."]{.underline}[\[14\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn14)

#### Private telecom is key\-\--their alt wrecks global cybersecurity 

**Marar '20** \[Satya; October 17; policy analyst at Reason Foundation
and a Young Voices tech policy fellow; "5G nationalization will leave
America behind,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/521502-5g-nationalization-will-leave-america-behind\]

The Department of Defense (DOD) is currently considering a proposal
that'll effectively nationalize 5G technology and networks in the United
States. [By abandoning the **market-driven strategy**]{.underline} that
won the 4G race for the nation, [America would]{.underline} merely
[be]{.underline} undermining its own progress --- and [losing to
China.]{.underline}

This is especially concerning since [China sees itself as a **rival** to
U.S. hegemony and is increasingly exerting its diplomatic and military
influence in a **brazen** way. It has launched cyberattacks and
attempted to acquire sensitive military secrets]{.underline} and
[intel]{.underline}ligence. It has already made strides in the 5G race
and is rapidly acquiring key 5G patents. Its flagship telecommunications
giant is propped-up by \$75 billion in subsidies and was slated to build
the UK's 5G network this year. The British government only reneged after
U.S. diplomatic pressure.

Concerningly, [Chinese laws effectively compel Huawei to hand over user
data]{.underline} and to assist it in industrial espionage and state
surveillance. If the world becomes increasingly reliant on Chinese
government-controlled and operated telecommunications infrastructure,
then that will leave U.S. manufacturers and innovators at an
ever-increasing disadvantage. With 5G technology expected to contribute
\$2.2 trillion, roughly 5 percent of global GDP, to the world economy
within 15 years, this is a race America must win.

Troublingly enough, the DOD suggests a move that mirrors China in many
ways. It'd replace the existing Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
plan to auction off frequency ranges within the mid-band spectrum to
private companies who can then develop the necessary infrastructure
networks, which is ideal for 5G development. Instead, a network built
and deployed by the U.S. government would act as a wholesaler to
telecommunications companies who could turn around and sell 5G plans to
retail consumers.

But [national 5G networks are already being built across the country
with private investment totaling billions]{.underline} of dollars. Why
would taxpayers pay such a hefty sum for something that American
companies are already developing? Conversely, government agencies have
already compromised the nation's position in the 5G race by allocating
mainly less-than-ideal low-band and high-band frequencies for 5G
development. Unlike the mid-band spectrum that the U.S. military largely
monopolizes, low-band frequencies mean slow connections. High-band
frequencies are localized and require significantly more infrastructure
investment to cover the same range. By contrast, China has utilized its
mid-band spectrum for 5G deployment.

This is why a lone Chinese cellular tower now covers the same range as
100 high-speed American towers.

[The U.S. should be auctioning frequency ranges]{.underline} within the
mid-band spectrum to companies that are already equipped to build
infrastructure. [If the U.S. wants to "**catch-up**" with
China]{.underline}, then [it should be **taking advantage** of the
already **robust American private sector** instead of adopting China's
strategy of **state control**, **debt-funded subsidies** and
**loans**.]{.underline}

[A federal government **5G** network could take **decades** to build and
could be replete with setbacks]{.underline} --- [at the expense of
consumers and taxpayers.]{.underline}

Take a look at [South Africa and Mexico]{.underline} for proof. Those
are two countries where [national]{.underline}ized
[telecom]{.underline}munications networks **[failed]{.underline}**.

Or look to Australia, where the "National Broadband Network" turned into
a financial disaster. Originally projected to cost \$29.5 billion in
2013, it was completed only this year, with the final cost running past
\$51 billion. And that's not counting a recently announced \$4.5 billion
upgrade since the technology is out of date already. But it's not
politicians and bureaucrats' own money they're playing around with. It's
taxpayers' dollars on the line.

Conversely, proponents of a nationalized 5G network claim that
auctioning off spectrum to private network builders could leave
consumers worse off, since there's theoretically nothing stopping them
from charging high prices once they own the network. After all, American
mobile services are relatively more expensive than those in many
European nations.

Yet, this can hardly be blamed on privately owned network infrastructure
when infrastructure in European countries with significantly cheaper
mobile service is also privately owned. After all, American prices are
influenced by the relatively higher costs of extending coverage across a
nation that's so vast, unevenly populated and geographically diverse.

Moreover, European regulations that are designed to lower prices for
consumers by boosting retail competition (such as the UK rule requiring
network owners to sell access to competitors at cost) come at the
expense of decreased network investment that left Europe years behind
the United States in 4G development. This trade-off may be undesirable,
given how important fast, reliable and expansive 5G networks are for
keeping innovative companies and industries in the United States
competitive.

Nationalization also won't uphold security since **[a
single]{.underline}** nationwide **[network]{.underline}**,
government-owned or otherwise, [is]{.underline} even **[more vulnerable
to hacking]{.underline}**. Furthermore, infrastructure builders and
equipment providers who raise national security concerns are already
prohibited from purchasing spectrum licenses.

### AT: Biotechnology

#### Capital is [crucial]{.underline} for biotechnology -- solves a laundry list of impacts

Chris **Edwards '21**, Director of Tax Policy Studies and Editor,
Down​siz​ing​Gov​ern​ment​.org, "The Triumph of Biotechnology and Private
Capital", CATO, 9/24/21,
https://www.cato.org/commentary/triumph-biotechnology-private-capital

[People often claim that capitalism focuses only on short-term
profits]{.underline}. **[But the venture capitalists and angel investors
who fund firms such as Moderna and BioNTech are hugely patient, and they
lose money on most of their investments]{.underline}**. Typically, their
model rests on the calculation that a small percentage of their
investments will generate a sufficiently high return on going public or
being sold to both "pay" for those that --- as will often be the case in
a very tricky sector --- lose money (or make very little) and make the
sort of good money that they and their clients are expecting when
putting together an investment portfolio.

**[In biotechnology and other leading-edge industries, after-tax
investor gains are often reinvested in the next round of risky startups,
thus creating a virtuous cycle]{.underline}**. [If the government had
taxed away the Struengmanns' capital gains from selling Hexal, they
might not have had the cash or incentive to invest in
BioNTech]{.underline}. **[One of the reason that nearly all high-income
countries keep capital-gains taxes low is to help ensure that investors
and entrepreneurs are incentivized to take the risk of committing time
and resources to ventures that can offer no promise of a good
return]{.underline}**, the sort of ventures, in other words, **[so
typical of ventures relying on scientific and technical
innovation]{.underline}**. Those who take high risks should be rewarded,
if that risk works out, with high rewards.

Unfortunately, that logic eludes President Biden and congressional
Democrats. They not only would like to raise capital-gains-tax rates,
but some of them would also like to broaden the capital-gains-tax base,
including by taxing gains before they are realized. If applied to
startup investing, that could do terrible damage to the ability of early
stage companies to secure the patient capital that they need. Punishing
capital gains makes no sense if we want investors and entrepreneurs to
pursue valuable but risky growth opportunities.

[Some cynics are griping about the big profits that Moderna and BioNTech
are now making, but investors in those firms absorbed losses for a
decade]{.underline}. **[Besides, there is no better place for profits to
flow right now than to biotech firms and their research]{.underline}**.
**[BioNTech announced that it will build on its mRNA advances to develop
shots against malaria and tuberculosis, which together kill more than a
million people a year. And numerous biotech firms are now aiming to
create more effective influenza vaccines based on mRNA
technologies]{.underline}**.

One of the key moments in the development of the biotech sector as we
know it today was the launch of Genentech in 1976, backed by
venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins. The success of that pioneering
firm "gave credence to the view that scientific research, infused with
start-up firm spunk, could be a critical component of economic growth,"
noted a history of the industry by Walter Powell and Kurt Sandholtz.

[To undermine an approach that has worked so well, and delivered so
much, by raising capital gains makes no economic sense]{.underline}.
**[Worse still, as we consider the lives saved or improved by companies
in biotechnology and other innovative sectors, companies that relied on
private risk capital, it may well come at considerable human cost,
too]{.underline}**.

### AT: Artificial Intelligence

#### AI regulation is [good]{.underline}! Positive benefits solve extinction. 

**Tzimas '21** \[Themistoklis; 2021; Faculty of Law at the Aristotle
University of Thessaloniki; Legal and Ethical Challenges of Artificial
Intelligence from an International Law Perspective, "Chapter 2: The
Expectations and Risks from AI," p. 9-32\]

Therefore, [it is]{.underline} only [natural to be]{.underline} at least
[skeptical towards a future with entities possessing equal or superior
intelligence and levels of autonomy; the prospect even of **existential
risk** looms as **possible**]{.underline}.7

AI that will have reached or surpassed our level of intelligence make us
wonder why would highly autonomous and intelligent AI want to give up
control back to its original creators?8 Why remain contained in
pre-deﬁned goals set for it by us, humans?

[Even AI in its **current** form]{.underline} and narrow intelligence
[poses risks because of its **embedded-ness** in an ever-**growing
number** of **crucial aspects of our lives**. The role of AI in
**military**, **ﬁnancial**]{.underline},9 [**health**, **educational**,
**environmental**, **governance networks**-among **others**---are areas
where **risk** generated by AI---even **limited**]{.underline}---
autonomy [can be **diffused** through]{.underline} [**non-linear
networks**, with **signiﬁcant** impact--- even
**systemic**]{.underline}.10

The answer therefore to the question whether AI brings risk with it is
yes; as Eliezer Yudkowski comments the greatest of them all is that
people conclude too early that they understand it11 or that they assume
that they can achieve it without necessarily having acquired complete
and thorough understanding of what intelli- gence means.12

Our projection of our---lack of complete---understanding of the concept
of intelligence on AI is owed to our lack of complete comprehension of
human intelligence too, which is partially covered by the prevalent and
until now self- obvious, anthropomorphism because of which we tend to
identify higher intelligence with the human mind.

Yudkowski again however suggests that AI "refers to a vastly greater
space of possibilities than does the term "Homo sapiens." When we talk
about "AIs" we are really talking about minds-in-general, or
optimization processes in general. Imagine a map of mind design space.
In one corner, a tiny little circle contains all humans; within a larger
tiny circle containing all biological life; and all the rest of the huge
map is the space of minds-in-general. The entire map ﬂoats in a still
vaster space, the space of optimization processes."13

Regardless of what our well-established ideas are, there are many,
different intelligences and even more signiﬁcantly, there are
potentially, different intelli- gences equally or even more evolved than
human.

From such a perspective, the unprecedented---ness of potential AI
developments and the mystery surrounding them emerges as not only the
outcome of pop culture but of a radical transformation of our---until
recently---self---obvious identiﬁcation of humanity with highly evolved
and dominant intelligence.14

[The **lack of understanding** of intelligence and therefore of AI may
be **frightening** but **does not lead necessarily to regulation**---at
least to a **proper** one. We could **even** be led into **mak**ing
potentially **catastrophic choices**, on the basis of **false
assumptions**.]{.underline}

[On top of our lack of understanding, we should add a sentiment of
**anxiety**]{.underline} as well as of expectations, [which intensiﬁes
as an atmosphere of emergency]{.underline} and of expected
groundbreaking developments [grows]{.underline}. The most graphic
description of this feeling is the potential of a moment of singularity,
as mentioned above according to the description by Vinge and Kurzweil.

As the mathematician I. J. Good--Alan Turing's colleague in the team of
the latter during World War II---has put it: "Let an ultraintelligent
machine be deﬁned as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual
activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is
one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could
design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an
"intelligence explosion," and the intelligence of man would be left far
behind. Thus the ﬁrst ultraintelligent machine is the last invention
that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to
tell us how to keep it under control."15 This is in a nutshell the
moment of singularity.

The estimates currently foresee the emergence of ultra or super
intelligence---as it is currently labelled---or in other words of
singularity, somewhere between 20 and 50 years from today, further
raising the sentiment of emergency.16 We cannot even foretell with
precision how singularity would look like but we know that because of
its expected groundbreaking impact, both states and private entities
compete towards gaining the upper hand in the prospect of the
singularity.17

Despite the fact that such predictions have been proven rather
optimistic in the past18 and therefore up to some extent inaccurate,
there are reasons to assume that their materialization will take place
and that the urgency of regulation will be proven realistic.

After all, part of the disappointments from AI should be blamed on the
fact that certain activities and standards, which were considered as
epitomes of human intelligence have been surpassed by AI, only to
indicate that they were not eventu- ally satisfactory thresholds for the
surpassing of human intelligence.19 Partially because of AI progress we
realize that human intelligence and its thresholds are much more
complicated than assumed in the past.

The vastness's of deﬁnitions of intelligence, as well as its
etymological roots are enlightening of the difﬁculties: "to gather, to
collect, to assemble or to choose, and to form an impression, thus
leading one to ﬁnally understand, perceive, or know".20

As with other relevant concepts, the truth is that until recently our
main way to approach intelligence for far too long was "we know it, when
we see it". AI is an additional reason for looking deeper into
intelligence and the more we examine it, the most complicated it seems.

The combination of lack of complete understanding of intelligence, the
unpredictability of AI, its rapid evolution and the prospect of
singularity explain both the fascination and the fear from AI. Once the
latter emerges, we have no real knowledge about what will happen next
but only speculations, which until recently belonged to the area of
science ﬁction.

We are for example pretty conﬁdent that the speed of AI intelligence
growth will accelerate, once self---improvement will have been achieved.
The expected or possible chain of events will begin from AI capacity to
re-write its own algorithms and exponentially self---improve, surpassing
human intelligence, which lacks the capacity of such rapid
self---improvement and setting its own goals.21

We can somehow guess the speed of AGI and ASI evolution and possibly
some of its initial steps but we cannot guess the directions that such
AI will choose to follow and the characteristics that it will
demonstrate. Practically, we credibly guess the prospects of AI beyond a
certain level of development.

Two [**existential issues** could emerge: ﬁrst, an imbalance of
intelligence at **our expense**]{.underline}---with us, humans becoming
the inferior species---[in favor of non-biological entities and secondly
a lack of even fundamental conceptual communication between the two most
intelligent "species". Both of them heighten the fear of **irreversible
changes**]{.underline}, once we lose the possession of the superior
intelligence.22

[However, we need to consider the **expectations as well**. The
**positive side**]{.underline} [focuses on the so-called **friendly**
AI, meaning AI which will **beneﬁt** and **not harm** humans, thanks to
its advanced intelligence]{.underline}.23

[AI bears the promise of signiﬁcantly enhancing human life on various
aspects, beginning from the already existing, narrow
applications]{.underline}. The [**enhance**d
**automation**]{.underline}24 in the industry [and the shift
to]{.underline} **[autonomy]{.underline}**,25 [the take---over by AI of
tasks]{.underline} even at [the]{.underline} **[service
sector]{.underline}** which can be considered as "tedious"---i.e. in the
banking sector---[**climate** and **weather forecasting**]{.underline},
[**disaster** response]{.underline},26 [the potentially better
**coop**eration among different actors in complicated matters such as in
matters of **information**, **geopolitics** and **i**nternational
**r**elations]{.underline}, [**logistics**, **resources**]{.underline}
ex.27

[The realization of the positive expectations depends up to some extent
upon the **complementarity** or not, of AI with **human**
intelligence]{.underline}. However, what friendly AI will bring in our
societies constitutes a matter of debate, given our lack of unanimous
approach on what should be considered as beneﬁcial and therefore
friendly to humans---as is analyzed in the next chapter.

[Friendly AI for example bears the prospect of freeing us from hard
labor or even further from **unwanted** labor; of generating further
economic **growth**; of dealing in unbiased, speedy, effective and
cheaper ways with sectors such as **policing**]{.underline},
[**justice**, **health**, **environment**al **crisis**, natural
**disasters**, **education**, **governance**, **defense**]{.underline}
[and several more of them which necessitate decision-making, with the
involvement of sophisticated intelligence]{.underline}.

[The synergies between human intelligence and AI "promise" the
**enhancement of humans in most of their aspects**]{.underline}. Such
synergies may remain external---humans using AI as external to
themselves, in terms of analysis, forecasts, decision---making and in
general as a type of assistant-28 or may evolve into the merging of the
two forms of intelligence either temporarily or permanently.

The second profoundly enters humanity, existentially---speaking, into
uncharted waters. Elon Musk argues in favor of "having some sort of
merger of biological intelligence and machine intelligence" and his
company "Neuralink" aims at implanting chips in human brain. Musk argues
that through this way humans will keep artiﬁcial intelligence under
control.29 The proposition is that of "mind design", with humans playing
the role that God had according to theologies.30

While the temptation is strong---exceeding human mind's capacities, far
beyond what nature "created", by acquiring the capacity for example to
connect directly to the cyberspace or to break the barriers of
biology31---the risks are signiﬁcant too: what if a microchip
malfunction? Will such a brain be usurped or become captive to
malfunctioning AI?

The merging of the two intelligences is most likely to evolve initially
by invoking medical reasons, instead of human enhancement. But the
merging of the two will most likely continue, as after all the limits
between healing and enhancement are most often blurry. This development
will give rise, as is analyzed below, to signif- icant questions and
issues, the most of crucial of which is the setting of a threshold for
the prevalence of the human aspect of intelligence over the artiﬁcial
one.

Human nature is historically improved, enhanced, healed and now,
potentially even re-designed in the future.32 Can a "medical science"
endorsing such a goal be ethically acceptable and if yes, under what
conditions, when, for whom and by what means? The answers are more
difﬁcult than it seems. As the World Health Organi-
zation---WHO---provides in its constitution, "Health is a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the
absence of disease or inﬁrmity".33

Therefore, why discourage science which aims at human-enhancement, even
reaching the levels of post-humanism?34 Or if restrictions are to be
imposed on human enhancement, on what ethics and laws will they be
justiﬁed? How ethically acceptable is it to prohibit or delay
technological evolution, which among several other magniﬁcent
achievements, promises to treat death as a disease and cure it, by
reducing soul to self, self to mind, and mind to brain, which will then
be preserved as a "softwarized" program in a hardware other than the
human body?35

After all, "According to the strong artiﬁcial intelligence program there
is no fundamental difference between computers and brains: a computer is
different machinery than a person in terms of speed and memory
capacity."36

While such a scientiﬁc development and the ones leading potentially to
it will be undoubtedly, groundbreaking technologically-speaking, is it
actually---ethically- speaking---as ambivalent as it may sound or is it
already justiﬁed by our well--- rooted human-centrism?37

Secular humanism may have very well outdated religious beliefs about
afterlife in the area of science but has not diminished the hope for
immortality; on the contrary, science, implicitly or explicitly predicts
that matter can in various ways surpass death, albeit by means which
belong in the realm of scientiﬁc proof, instead of that of metaphysical
belief.38

If this is the philosophical case, the quest for immortality becomes
ethically acceptable; it can be considered as embedded both in the
existential anxiety of humans, as well as in the human-centrism of
secular philosophical and political victory over the dei-centric
approach to the world and to our existence.

From another perspective of course and for the not that distant
philosophical reasons, the quest for immortality becomes ethically
ambiguous or even unacceptable.39 By seeking endless life we may miss
all these that make life worth living in the framework of ﬁniteness. As
the gerontologist Paul Hayﬂick cautioned "Given the possibility that you
could replace all your parts, including your brain, then you lose your
self-identity, your self-recognition. You lose who you are! You are who
you are because of your memory."40

In other words, once we begin to integrate the two types of
intelligence, within ourselves, until when and how we will be sure that
it is human intelligence that guides us, instead of the AI? And if we
are not guided completely or---even further---at all by human
intelligence but on the contrary we are guided by AI which we have
embodied and which is trained by our human intelligence, will we be
remaining humans or we will have evolved to some type of meta-human or
transhumant species, being different persons as well?41

AI promises tor threatens to offer a solution by breaking down our
consciousness into small "particles" of information---simplistically
speaking---which can then be "software-ized" and therefore "uploaded"
into different forms of physical or non-physical existence.

Diane Ackerman states that "The brain is silent, the brain is dark, the
brain tastes nothing, the brain hears nothing. All it receives are
electrical impulses\--not the sumptuous chocolate melting sweetly, not
the oboe solo like the ﬂight of a bird, not the pastel pink and lavender
sunset over the coral reef\--only impulses."42 Therefore, all that is
needed---although it is of course much more complicated than we can
imagine---is a way to code and reproduce such impulses.

Even if we consider that without death, we will no more be humans but
something else, why should we remain humans once technologies allow us
be something "more", in the sense of an enhanced version of "being"? Why
are we to remain bound by biological evolution if we can re-design it
and our future form of existence?

Why not try to achieve the major breakthrough, the anticipated or hoped
digita- lization of the human mind, which promises immortality of
consciousness via the cyberspace or artiﬁcial bodies: the uploading of
our consciousness so that it can live on forever, turning death into an
optional condition.43

Either through an artiﬁcial body or emulation-a living, conscious
avatar---we hope---or fear---that the domain of immortality will be
within reach. It is the prospect of a "substrate-independent minds," in
which human and machine consciousness will merge, transcending
biological limits of time, space and mem- ory" that fascinates us.44

As Anders Sandberg explained "The point of brain emulation is to
recreate the function of the original brain: if 'run' it will be able to
think and act as the original," he says. Progress has been slow but
steady. "We are now able to take small brain tissue samples and map them
in 3D. These are at exquisite resolution, but the blocks are just a few
microns across. We can run simulations of the size of a mouse brain on
supercomputers---but we do not have the total connectivity yet. As
methods improve, I expect to see automatic conversion of scanned tissue
into models that can be run. The different parts exist, but so far there
is no pipeline from brains to emulations."45

The emulation is different from a simulation in the sense that the
former mimics not only the outward outcome but also the "internal causal
dynamics", so that the emulated system and in this particular case the
human mind behaves as the original.46 Obviously, this is a challenging
task: we need to understand the human brain with the help of
computational neuroscience and combine simpliﬁed parts such as simulated
neurons with network structures so that the patterns of the brain are
comprehended. We must combine effectively "biological realism
(attempting to be faithful to biology), completeness (using all
available empirical data about the system), tractability (the
possibility of quantitative or qualitative simulation) and understanding
(producing a compressed representation of the salient aspects of the
system in the mind of the experimenter)".47

The technological challenges are vast. Technologically speaking, the
whole concept is based on some assumptions which must be proven both
accurate and feasible.48 We must achieve technology capable of scanning
completely the human brain, of creating software on the basis of the
acquired information from its scanning and of the interpretation of
information and the hardware which will be capable of uploading or
downloading such software.49 The steps within these procedures are
equally challenging. Their detailed analysis evades the scope of this
book.

Some critical questions---they are further analyzed in the next
chapters---emerge however: how will we interpret free will in emulation?
What will be the impact of the environment and of what environment? How
will be missing parts of the human brain re-constructed and emulated?
What will be the status of the several emulations which will be
created---i.e. failed attempts or emulations of parts of the human
brain---in the course of the search for a complete and functioning
emulation? Will they be considered as "persons" and therefore as having
some right or will they be considered as mere objects in an experimental
lab? How are we going to decode the actual subjective sentiments of
these emulations? Essentially, are emulations the humans "themselves"
who are emulated or a different person? Even further what will human and
person mean in the era of emulation?

From a different perspective, the victory over death may be seen as a
danger of mass extinction, absorption or de-humanization. In this new,
vast universe of emulations will there be place for humans?50

From the above---mentioned discussion, it becomes obvious that at a
large extent, the prospect of risk or of expectation is a matter of
perspective, for which there is no unanimous agreement in the present.
This may be the greatest danger of all, for which Asimov warned us:
unleashing technology while we cannot communicate among us, in the face
of it.

The existential prospect as well as the risks by AI may self-evidently
emerge from technological advances but are determined on the basis of
politico---philosophical or in the wider sense, ethical assumptions.
This is where the need for legal regulation steps in. Such a need was
often underestimated in the past in favor of a solely technologically
oriented approach---although exceptions raising issues other than
technological can be found too.51 The gradual raising of
ethic---political, philosoph- ical and legal issues constitutes a rather
recent development, partially because of the realization of the
proximity of the risks and of the expectations.

The public debate is often divided between two "contradictory" views:
fear of AI or enthusiastic optimism. The opinions of the experts differ
respectively.

Kurzweil, who has come with a prediction for a date for the emergence of
singularity---until 2045---expects such a development in a positive way:
"What's actually happening is \[machines\] are powering all of us,"
Kurzweil said during the SXSW interview. "They're making us smarter.
They may not yet be inside our bodies, but, by the 2030s, we will
connect our neocortex, the part of our brain where we do our thinking,
to the cloud."52

In a well-known article---issued on the occasion of a ﬁlm---Stephen
Hawking, Max Tegmark, Stuart Russell, and Frank Wilczek shared a
moderate position: "[The potential **beneﬁts** are **huge**;
**everything that civilization has to offer** is a product of **human**
intelligence; we cannot **predict** what we might achieve when this
intelligence is **magniﬁed** by the tools **AI** may provide, but the
**eradicat**ion of **war, disease, and poverty**]{.underline} [would be
high on anyone's list. Success in creating AI would be the **biggest
event in human history**. . . Unfortunately, it **might also be the
last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks**]{.underline}."53

### Perm

#### The perms solve best -- restructuring capitalism is possible

**Mazzucato '21** \[Mariana; Jan 28; Professor in the Economics of
Innovation and Public Value at University College London where she is
the founding director of the UCL Institute for Innovation and Public
Purpose; "Mission Economy: A Moonshot Guide to Changing Capitalism," p.
204-10\]

This book has applied what I believe is the immensely powerful idea of a
mission to solving the 'wicked' problems we face today. In it, I have
argued that [tackling grand challenges will only happen if we reimagine
**government as a prerequisite for restructuring capitalism** in a way
that is inclusive, sustainable and **driven by
innovation**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, this means reinventing government for the
twenty-first century -- equipping it with the tools, organization and
culture it needs to drive a mission-oriented approach. It also means
bringing purpose to the core of corporate governance and taking a very
broad stakeholder position across the economy. It means changing the
relationship between public and private sectors, and between them and
civil society, so they all work symbiotically for a common goal. The
reason for the emphasis on rethinking government is simple: **[only
government has the capacity to bring about transform]{.underline}**ation
**[on the scale needed.]{.underline}** The relationship between economic
actors and civil society shows our problems at their most profound, and
this is what we must unravel.

[We can start by recognizing that capitalist markets are an outcome of
how each actor in the system is organized and governed, and how the
different actors relate to one another]{.underline}. This holds for the
private and public sectors and for other sectors such as non-profits.
**[No particular kind of market behaviour is inevitable]{.underline}**.
[For example, the market pressure often cited as forcing a business to
neglect the long term in favour of the short term, as too many companies
do today, is the product of a particular organization of the
market]{.underline}. **[Nor is there anything inevitable in government
bureaucracies]{.underline}** [being too slow to react to challenges such
as digital platforms and climate change.]{.underline} Rather, [both are
outcomes of agency, actions and **governance** structures that are
chosen inside organizations, as well as the legal and institutional
relationships between them. It is all down to design within and between
organizations.]{.underline}

Capitalism is, indeed, in crisis. But the good news is that we can do
better. We know from the past that public and private actors can come
together to do extraordinary things. I have reflected on how, fifty
years ago, going to the moon and back required public and private actors
to invest, to innovate and to collaborate night and day for a common
purpose. Imagine if that [collaborative purpose]{.underline} today was
to [build a more inclusive and sustainable capitalism: green production
and consumption]{.underline}, [less inequality]{.underline}, greater
personal fulfilment, **[resilient health care]{.underline}** and healthy
ageing, sustainable mobility and digital access for all. But small,
incremental changes will not get us to those outcomes. We must have the
courage and conviction to lift our gaze higher -- to lead transformative
change that is as imaginative as it is ambitious, aiming for something
far more ambitious than sending a man to the moon.

To do this successfully, [governments need to invest in their internal
capabilities -- building the competence and confidenc]{.underline}e to
think boldly, partner with business and civil society, catalyse new
forms of collaboration across sectors, and [deploy instruments that
reward actors willing to engage with the difficulties]{.underline}. The
task is neither to pick winners nor to give unconditional handouts,
subsidies and guarantees, but to pick the willing. And missions are
about making markets, not only fixing them. They're about imagining new
areas of exploration. They're about [**taking risks**, not only
'de-risking']{.underline}. And if this means making mistakes along the
way, so be it. Learning through trial and error is critical for any
value-creation exercise. [Ambitious missions also have the courage to
tilt the playing field.]{.underline}

If [government]{.underline} is indeed a value creator that is driven by
public purpose, its [policies should reflect and reinforce]{.underline}
that. Too many green policies today are just minor adjustments to a
trajectory that still favours the old waste-prone behaviours and the
financial casino that worsens inequality. [A healthy economy that works
for the whole of society must tilt the playing field consistently to
reward behaviours that help us achieve agreed and desirable
goals.]{.underline} That means achieving [coherence in a **multiplicity
of fields**]{.underline}, from **[taxes]{.underline}** to
**[regulation]{.underline}**, from **[business law]{.underline}** to the
**[social safety net]{.underline}**.

As emphasized throughout the book, [it is key to not pretend that social
missions are the same as technological ones]{.underline}. With
challenges that are more 'wicked' it is essential that moonshot thinking
is linked with support to underlying government systems. For example, a
[moonshot around]{.underline} disease testing or **[health
priorities]{.underline}** [must interact closely with the public-health
system, not **replace** or **circumvent** it]{.underline}. Similarly, a
moonshot around [clean growth]{.underline} must [interact with transport
systems and planning authorities and understand behavioural
change]{.underline}. Thus it is [critical to]{.underline} perceive
missions not as siloed projects but as being intersectoral, bottom-up,
and [building on existing]{.underline} systems (such as **[innovation
systems]{.underline}**, among others).

Governments cannot pursue missions alone. They must work alongside
purpose-driven businesses to achieve them. As I've argued in this book,
this requires addressing one of the biggest [dilemmas of modern
capitalism]{.underline}: **[restructuring business]{.underline}** [so
that private profits are reinvested back into the economy rather than
being used for short-term financialized purposes]{.underline}. Missions
can accelerate this shift by shaping expectations about where business
opportunities lie and also getting a better return for public
investment. In this sense they can begin to walk the talk of stakeholder
value. This means creating a more symbiotic form of partnership and
collaboration in different sectors, whether in health, energy or digital
platforms. A market-shaping perspective requires governing these
interactions so that intellectual property rights, data privacy, pricing
of essential medicines and taxation all reflect what needs to happen to
reach the common objective. [In health that must mean health innovation
driven by the mission of better health care for all; in energy it must
mean divestment from fossil fuels and the creation of public goods like
green infrastructure and green production systems]{.underline} that
protect the earthly oasis that Armstrong referred to; and in the digital
domain it must mean the use of [digitalization to improve the access of
all people to the power of the technologies of the twenty-first
century]{.underline} -- while ensuring both data privacy and that our
welfare states are strengthened, not weakened, by digital platforms.

**[Doing capitalism differently]{.underline}** [requires reimagining the
full potential of a public sector driven by public purpose --
democratically defining clear goals]{.underline} that society needs to
meet by investing and **[innovating together]{.underline}**. It requires
a fundamentally new relationship between all economic actors willing and
able [to tackle complexity to achieve outcomes that matter.]{.underline}

[Growing distrust of capitalism follows from]{.underline} its failure to
address major [socioeconomic challenges]{.underline}, not least [climate
change and inequalities]{.underline} in opportunity, income, and wealth.
While private [incentives under capitalism are good at stimulating
**efficiency, growth, and innovation**]{.underline}, [they]{.underline}
also [generate unequal income]{.underline} and wealth distributions
(even in a context of intense competition), often at odds with social
norms of fairness. Moreover, [capitalist systems tend to underinvest in
public goods]{.underline} like education, health care, and social
insurance -- all critical factors in the pandemic response -- while also
discounting negative externalities such as greenhouse-gas emissions.

[These shortcomings of capitalism]{.underline} are predictable, but they
[are **remediable through public policies and institutions**. Tax and
transfer policies and minimum wages]{.underline} can reduce income and
wealth disparities, just as [public investment in education, training,
and health care can enhance opportunity]{.underline} by providing access
to good jobs and fostering the creation of new enterprises. Likewise, [a
price on carbon dioxide and regulations limiting or banning carbon
emissions]{.underline} can help the world avert the existential threat
of climate change.

[Critics of capitalism]{.underline} often [miss]{.underline}
([or]{.underline} choose to [ignore]{.underline}) [that there is **no
single canonical model**]{.underline}. [Europe's]{.underline} various
["social market" models differ]{.underline} significantly [from the
neoliberal variant in the US.]{.underline} And even within the US, there
are important differences between states and localities.

Some of these distinctions have been highlighted in the responses to the
COVID-19 pandemic and recession. All advanced economies have deployed
unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus in the face of
"K-shaped" or "dual" recessions in which lower-wage workers have
suffered disproportionately more than other cohorts. Unlike the US,
[Germany and several other European countries have deployed measures
specifically designed to keep as many workers as possible in their
jobs]{.underline}. Because these countries have generous social
insurance and benefits, including sick leave and family leave, workers
and their families have been able to cope with both COVID-19 and sudden
drops in their incomes.

Differences in national health-care models have also become more
apparent. Unlike European capitalist systems that provide universal
coverage, 14.5% of America's non-elderly population (ages 18-64) remains
uninsured. Moreover, owing to America's heavy reliance on employer-based
insurance, the pandemic has pushed at least 15 million more workers at
least temporarily into the uninsured pool.

With their strong public-health systems, many European countries were
also better equipped to carry out widespread testing and vaccine
distribution. The US, meanwhile, has utterly failed to contain the
virus, and is now delegating the vaccination campaign to under-resourced
state and local authorities.

In another contrast with the US, Europe has dedicated about one-third of
its massive stimulus program to investments aligned with its commitment
to achieve carbon neutrality by mid-century. America's federal stimulus
measures have been silent on climate with few conditions of any kind.

Within the US, individual states' responses to the COVID-19 crisis
reflect different variants of capitalism. In California, Governor Gavin
Newsom's recent 2021-22 budget proposal reveals some distinctive
features. In terms of health-care coverage, California remains a
national leader with a Medicaid program covering more than 13 million
people. Despite the pandemic-induced recession, the state is increasing
its minimum wage to \$14 per hour in 2021, on track to realize the
target of \$15 per hour in 2022 for all businesses employing 26 or more
workers; many municipalities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco,
have already achieved or exceeded the \$15 target. (On January 1, 2021,
20 other states also raised their minimum wages, whereas the US federal
minimum wage has remained unchanged at \$7.25 per hour since 2009.)

California has also expanded coverage of its Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) and Young Child Tax Credit to include undocumented workers who
are otherwise denied the benefits of federal stimulus packages.
Together, these tax credits applied to 3.6 million California households
in 2020, adding \$1 billion in total income. The state also passed new
legislation significantly expanding unpaid family-leave rights.
Employers with as few as five employees now must provide this option as
well as more time for paid sick leave for workers forced to self-isolate
or quarantine as a result of COVID-19 exposure or diagnosis.

Looking ahead, Newsom has proposed an additional \$600 one-time cash
payment to all taxpayers who are eligible for the state's EITC in 2021.
His proposed 2021-22 budget also earmarks \$372 million to expedite the
distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and includes \$4.5 billion for
programs to drive economic growth and job creation once restrictions on
normal activities have been lifted. These programs include \$575 million
in grants to small businesses and nonprofits, in addition to the \$500
million for such grants implemented in late 2020 amid forced business
closures. The proposal also allocates up to an additional \$50 million
for the California Rebuilding Fund, a public-private partnership, to
support up to an additional \$125 million of low-interest loans to
underserved small businesses throughout the state.

California's distinctive approach to market capitalism also emphasizes
climate sustainability, using both carbon pricing and efficiency
standards to achieve ambitious decarbonization targets. Under a 2018
state law, 60% of electricity must come from renewable resources by
2030, and 100% by 2045. California runs the world's fourth-largest
cap-and-trade system and will be setting even lower caps (and thus a
higher carbon price) next month. In September 2020, Newsom announced an
executive order requiring that zero-emission vehicles account for 100%
of new car sales by 2035. His proposed budget seeks \$1.5 billion to
accelerate the infrastructure investment needed to achieve this goal.

President-elect Joe [Biden has just announced a \$1.9 trillion emergency
rescue plan to counter the pandemic's surge and provide substantial
relief to workers, families, small businesses, and state and local
governments]{.underline}. Prompt congressional passage of this plan is a
critical first step in the renovation of America's outdated neoliberal
version of capitalism. As the economy recovers from the deep and uneven
COVID-19 recession, [the US must "build back better"]{.underline} by
strengthening its social safety net, increasing public investment in
education, health care, and other public goods, and rejoining the global
charge against climate change. **[Lessons from the more successful
variants of market capitalism in Europe and California point the way
forward.]{.underline}**

#### The alt [locks in extinction]{.underline} if they're right about [environmental sustainability]{.underline}\-\--there [isn't time]{.underline} for a [global transition]{.underline} from capitalism and [no certainty]{.underline} it [ends emissions]{.underline}.

https://bostonreview.net/science-nature-global-justice/noam-chomsky-robert-pollin-c-j-polychroniou-political-economy-saving\]

There are important elements of truth in such views, but we should also
be careful to not push this point too far. [Some commentators have
argued that one **silver lining** outcome of the **pandemic** was that,
because of the **economic lockdown**, **fossil fuel** consumption and
**CO2 emissions** plunged alongside overall **economic
activity**]{.underline} during the recession. While this is true, [I do
not see any positive lessons here with respect to advancing a **viable
emissions program** that can get us to **net zero** emissions by
**2050**]{.underline}. Rather, [the experience demonstrates why a
**degrowth approach** to **emissions reduction** is **unworkable**.
Emissions did indeed fall sharply because of]{.underline} the pandemic
and the [recession. But that is only because **incomes collapsed** and
**unemployment spiked** over this same period. This only **reinforces
the conclusion** that the **only effective** climate stabilization
**path** is the **Green New Deal**, as it is the only one that does not
require a **drastic contraction**]{.underline} (or "degrowth") [of jobs
and incomes to drive down emissions]{.underline}.

[A genuinely **positive development** of]{.underline} the pandemic and
[recession is that **progressive activists** around the world have
fought to include **Green New Deal investments** in their countries'
**economic stimulus**]{.underline} programs. [It is **critical** to
**keep pushing** the **development** and **success** of these
initiatives]{.underline}.

[In support of that end, we must **seriously consider** how to **best
maximize** both the **short-term stimulus**]{.underline} benefits [and
long-term impacts of Green New Deal programs]{.underline}. I know the
importance of such considerations from personal experience working on
the green investment components of the 2009 Obama American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act, in which \$90 billion of the \$800 billion total was
allocated to clean energy investments in the United States. The
principles underlying these investment components were sound, but the
people who worked on the program in its various stages, including
myself, did not adequately calculate the time necessary to execute many
of the projects. We knew that it was critical to identify "shovel-ready"
projects---ones that could be quickly implemented on a large scale and
provide an immediate economic boost. But relatively few green investment
projects were truly shovel-ready at that time, as the green energy
industry was still a newly emerging enterprise. Therefore, the backlog
of significant new projects was thin. It is only moderately less thin
today.

This means that people designing Green New Deal stimulus programs must
identify the subgroup of green investment projects that can
realistically roll into action at scale within a matter of months. One
example that should be applicable in almost every country would be
energy efficiency retrofits of all public and commercial buildings. This
would entail improving insulation, sealing window frames and doors,
switching over all lightbulbs to LEDs, and replacing aging heating and
air conditioning systems with efficient ones (preferably heat pumps).
These programs could quickly generate large numbers of jobs for
secretaries, truck drivers, accountants, construction workers, and
climate engineers. They could also save energy and reduce emissions
quickly and relatively cheaply. Building off of such truly shovel-ready
projects, the rest of the clean energy investment program could then
accelerate and provide a strong foundation for economies moving out of
recession and onto a sustainable recovery path.

CP: [Eco-socialism is becoming a major tenet of the **ideological
repertoire**]{.underline} of green parties in European countries and
elsewhere, which may be the reason for their increasing appeal with
voters and especially the youth. Is eco-socialism a cohesive enough
political project to be taken seriously as an alternative for the
future?

NC: Insofar as I understand eco-socialism---not in great depth---it
overlaps greatly with other left socialist currents. That being said, [I
don't think we're at a stage where **adopting** a **specific "political
project"** is very helpful. There are **crucial issues** that **have**
to be **addressed**, **right now**. Our efforts should be **informed**
by the kind of **future society** that we want, and the kind that **can
be constructed** within our existing society]{.underline}. It's fine to
stake out specific positions about the future in more or less detail,
but for now these seem to me at best ways of sharpening ideas rather
that platforms to latch on to.

[A **good argument** can be made that **inherent features** of
capitalism lead]{.underline} inexorably [to the ruin of the environment,
and that **ending capitalism** must be a **priority** of the
environmental movement. But there's one **fundamental problem** with
this argument:]{.underline} [**time scales**. Dismantling capitalism is
**impossible in the time frame that we have** for taking urgent action,
which requires **national** and **international** mobilization if
**severe crisis** is to be averted]{.underline}.

[Furthermore, the whole discussion]{.underline} around eco-socialism [is
**misleading**. The **two efforts**]{.underline}---[averting
**environmental disaster**, and **dismantling capitalism** in favor of a
**freer** and more **just society**]{.underline}---[should and can
**proceed in parallel**]{.underline}. One [example is Tony Mazzocchi's
efforts to **forge a labor coalition** that would not only **challenge**
owner-**management control** of the workplace, but also be at the
**forefront** of the **environmental movement** while attempting to
**socialize major sectors** of U.S. industry. There's **no time to
waste**. The struggle must be]{.underline}, and can be, [undertaken on
all fronts.]{.underline}

CP: Bob, in your view, can eco-socialism coexist with the Green New Deal
project? And, if not, what type of a politico-ideological agenda might
be needed to generate broad political participation in the struggle to
create a green future?

RP: In my view, [details of rhetoric and emphasis aside, eco-socialism
and the Green New Deal are fundamentally the same project.]{.underline}
[The Green New Deal, as we have discussed the term, offers the **only
path to climate stabilization** that can also expand **good job
opportunities** and **raise living standards** in **all regions** of the
world. It defines an **explicit** and **viable alternative** to
austerity economics on a **global scale**]{.underline}. My coworkers and
I have worked on this issue---advancing the Green New Deal as an
alternative to austerity economics---in different country settings over
the past few years, including in Spain, Puerto Rico, and Greece. [In my
view, the Green New Deal is the **only approach to climate
stabilization** also **capable** of **reversing rising inequality** and
**defeating** global **neoliberalism** and]{.underline} ascendant
**[neofascism]{.underline}**.

[Beyond the Green New Deal, I don't know what exactly "eco-socialism"
could mean. Does it mean the **overthrow** of **all private ownership**
of productive assets for public ownership?]{.underline} As Noam
suggested, [do people **seriously think** that this could happen within
the **time frame we have** to stabilize the climate, that
is]{.underline}, within [less than **thirty years**? And are we certain
that eliminating all private ownership would be workable or desirable
from a **social justice** standpoint]{.underline}---i.e. from the
standpoint of advancing well-being for the global working class and
poor? [How do we deal with the fact that **most** of the world's
**energy assets** are **already publicly owned**]{.underline}? How,
[more specifically, can we be **certain** that a transition to
**complete public ownership** would itself deliver zero net emissions by
2050? To me, the **overarching challenge** is trying to understand
**alternative pathways** to most **effectively building** truly
egalitarian, democratic, and ecologically sustainable
societies]{.underline}---[putting all labels aside and being willing, as
**Marx** himself insisted, to employ "ruthless criticism" toward all
that exists, including all past experiences with Communism and
Socialism.]{.underline} And, for that matter, being open to criticizing
all authors, including Marx himself. Indeed, my favorite quote from Marx
is "I am not a Marxist."

activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The climate threat is certainly dire]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are
unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [But eco-socialism
is]{.underline} probably [**not** going to be an **effective method** of
addressing that threat. **Dismantling** an **entire economic system** is
**never easy**, and probably would **touch off armed conflict** and
**major asdasd upheaval**. In the scramble to win those battles, even
the socialists would almost certainly abandon their limitation on
**fossil-fuel use**]{.underline} --- [either to support **military
efforts**, or to keep the population from turning against them. The
precedent here is the **Soviet Union**, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[Even **without international conflict**, there's **little guarantee**
that moving away from capitalism would **mitigate our impact** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
**faced with a choice** of enriching their people or helping to save the
climate, even **socialist leaders** will often choose the former. And
that same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [leaders who
demand **draconian cuts** in **living standards** in pursuit of
environmental goals will have **trouble staying in power**]{.underline}.

[The **best hope** for the climate therefore lies in **reducing the
tradeoff** between **material prosperity** and **carbon emissions**.
That requires **technology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological improvement** as a **key
feature**.]{.underline}

### AT: Inequality

#### Inequality is decreasing at [unprecedented rates]{.underline} by [every metric]{.underline}.

**McAfee, 19**---cofounder and codirector of the MIT Initiative on the
Digital Economy at the MIT Sloan School of Management, former professor
at Harvard Business School and fellow at Harvard's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society (Andrew, "The Global Gallop of the Four Horsemen,"
*More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Learned to Prosper Using
Fewer Resources---and What Happens Next*, Chapter 10, pg 235-240,
Kindle, dml)

In 2016 the economist and columnist Noah Smith reviewed [the evidence on
**poverty around the world**]{.underline}, and his conclusion was
notably exuberant: \"This [is]{.underline} incredible---[**nothing short
of a miracle**. Nothing like this has **ever happened before** in
recorded history]{.underline}.\" A graph created by Max Roser clearly
reveals the \"miracle\" Smith was talking about, and how right he was
that [the improvement is **without precedent**]{.underline}. The graph
doesn\'t show the percentage of people living in poverty, but instead
something even more important: the total number of extremely poor people
on earth.

The World\'s War on Poverty

[The **total number of poor people** in the world]{.underline} peaked
right at the time of the first Earth Day in 1970, then [started to
**slowly decrease**]{.underline}. But the real miracle came when
[this]{.underline} happy [decline **accelerated** during the twenty-
first century. In **1999**, **1.76 billion** people were living in
extreme poverty. Just **sixteen years later**, this number had
**declined by 60 percent**, to **705 million**]{.underline}. Hundreds of
millions fewer people are living in poverty now than in 1820, when the
world\'s total population was seven times smaller than it is today.

[Much of this decline is reflective of what occurred in **China**,
which]{.underline}, as we saw in the previous chapter, threw off
economic socialism beginning in 1978 and [**let capitalism work its
poverty-reducing miracles**. But the story of global poverty reduction
**isn\'t a purely Chinese one**]{.underline}. As the graph below shows,
[**every region around the world** has seen **large poverty reductions**
in recent years]{.underline}. The speed of the recent decline indicates
that [it\'s **no longer ridiculous** to talk about **completely
eliminating extreme poverty** from the planet]{.underline}. The World
Bank thinks [this might be possible by **2030**]{.underline}.

[It\'s **not just incomes** that have improved]{.underline}. As I
consult Our World in Data and other **[comprehensive sources of
evidence]{.underline}**, I [**struggle** to find **even a single
important measure** of human material well-being that\'s **not getting
better** in most regions around the world]{.underline}.

Here are recent trends in a few key areas.

Daily Bread

[As recently as **1980**, the global average number of available daily
calories **wasn\'t enough**]{.underline} to permit an active adult male

[**every region in the world** met this standard of twenty-five hundred
daily calories]{.underline}.

[More than **90 percent** of the world\'s people now have access to
**improved water**]{.underline};VII [in **1990** only a bit more than
**75 percent** did. The situation is similar for **sanitation**: in
**1990** only a **bit more than half** of the world\'s people had it;
now, **more than two-thirds** do]{.underline}.

Young Minds

[The trend in **secondary education enrollment** around the world
is]{.underline} similar to the one for sanitation, but [**even
sharper**: in 1986 **fewer than half** of the world\'s teenagers were in
school; at present, **more than 75 percent** are]{.underline}.

One Thing We Say to Death: Not Today

By now the pattern should be familiar: [**life expectancy** at birth has
**gone up around the world**]{.underline} in recent decades:

![Diagram Description automatically
generated](media/image6.png){width="3.349501312335958in"
height="2.2498906386701663in"}

As we saw in chapter 1, [global life expectancy was about **28.5 years
in 1800**. Over the next 150 years, that number **increased by 20
years**. Then]{.underline}, in the years between 1950 and 2015, it
increased [by **25 more**. These gains are **now
universal**]{.underline}; Southern Africa has regained the 10 years of
expected life lost during its terrifying AIDS crisis.

[One of the reasons life expectancy has **gone up so quickly** is the
**collapse** in both **child** and **maternal mortality** around the
world]{.underline}:

generated](media/image7.png){width="3.356687445319335in"
height="2.4763287401574803in"}

[I find these mortality declines **especially fast**, **large**, and
**broad**]{.underline}. Today, [we **still have desperately poor
regions**, **failed states**, and the **decimations of war**. But in
**no region today** is the child mortality rate **higher** than the
world\'s average rate was in **1998**]{.underline}.

Convergent

Trends in maternal and child mortality highlight a critical fact that\'s
often overlooked: [**around the world**, inequality in **most important
measures** of human material well-being is **decreasing**. Poor
countries are **catching up** to rich ones, and **gaps** that were once
large are **shrinking**. Inequalities in income and wealth dominate the
news, and in many places these gaps are large and growing]{.underline}.
They re also important, so well look at economic inequality in the next
two chapters.

[But]{.underline} it\'s true, too, that [there are **other kinds of
inequality** that we should care about as we examine the human
condition: inequalities in **health**, **education**, **diet**,
**sanitation**, and other things that **matter deeply** for the quality
of a person\'s life. Here the news is **profoundly good**; these
inequalities are **collapsing**]{.underline}. As the four horsemen have
galloped around the world in recent decades, they\'ve made life better
not only for those people and countries that were already rich but for
just about everyone else. [**Everywhere**, **fewer mothers** and
**babies are dying**, more kids are **getting an education**, more
people have **adequate nutrition** and **sanitation**.]{.underline}

[It\'s **essential to acknowledge these global victories** because they
show us that **what we\'re doing is working**]{.underline}. Tech
progress, **[capitalism]{.underline}**, public awareness, and responsive
government [are **spreading around the world** and **improving
it**]{.underline}. It\'s often said that insanity is doing the same
thing over and over but expecting different results. The corollary might
be that ignorance is not examining the results of what\'s being done.
Over and over, when we look at the evidence, we see that the four
horsemen are improving our world.

### AT: "Neoliberalism 

#### Neoliberalism is a useless concept---reject it and their answers that this is just propaganda

**Dunn, 16**---Department of Political Economy at the University of
Sydney (Bill, "Against neoliberalism as a concept," Capital & Class,
November 23, 2016, dml)

This article argues that [the left should **abandon** the concept of
neoliberalism]{.underline}. As such, it contributes to a growing
discontent with the term but makes a specific argument about its use by
[those opposed to what they characterise as neoliberal]{.underline},
those on the political left, who [**gain little by invoking it**. The
term is **not recognised by our opponents**, whom it **fails to
challenge**, and it **provides little help** identifying **strategic
tasks** for the left, **muddying rather than clarifying** political
choices]{.underline}.

As the next section elaborates, [neoliberalism has been understood in
**diverse ways** to characterise a **huge range of social practices**.
Often writers are talking about **similar things**, but there is **no
essential core meaning** and in at least some cases rival
interpretations become **something close to opposites**]{.underline}.
This conceptual sprawl is well documented elsewhere. Here, brief
illustrations merely demonstrate the range of practices claimed as
neoliberal and two particularly striking antinomies: in idealist and
materialist interpretations and in depictions of neoliberalism
alternatively as state retreat and as a policy of strong states. It is
suggested that [while the social change and the social complexity
underlying the diverse characterisations are **real**, the **blanket
term** becomes an **obstacle** to critical social scientists' efforts to
**identify the relations** between **different social practices** and
the **main drivers of change**]{.underline}. Social science cannot be
precise and many concepts are contested, but here the diversity of usage
is particularly great with as yet little indication even of any movement
towards establishing means of adjudicating between rival
interpretations. This discussion is substantially unoriginal but
provides a necessary background for the second part of the article,
which asks why and for whom the term is being used.

This second section argues that [neoliberalism is **almost exclusively**
a term of the left, which **gains no advantage** by invoking it. It is
**used by opponents**, mainly **elite** or **academic opponents**, of
the phenomena it claims to characterise. This **builds barriers rather
than bridges** to a dialogue with our intellectual opponents. **Nor**
does the term help to **orient political strategy**]{.underline}. Taken
literally, [neoliberalism tends to **exaggerate the novelty** and
**liberal character** of many contemporary social practices, while the
**sheer diversity** of phenomena to which it has been applied
**obstructs rather than helps** to **identify strategic priorities**. A
tendency to **mirror a libertarian binary**, which posits the state and
market as **bad** and **good**, is **particularly
unhelpful**.]{.underline}

A few preliminary disclaimers are probably in order. First, with well
over 400,000 academic publications having now used the term, it is
impossible to engage with more than a tiny fraction of even the most
influential sources. There have been some heroic efforts to review the
literature as a whole, but these risk simultaneously oversimplifying the
work with which they do engage and ignoring vast swathes of material. No
such a comprehensive appraisal is attempted here. Second, this should
underline that the criticisms here are not directed against any and
every particular interpretation of neoliberalism. Many authors are
internally consistent in their usage and unambiguous in the political
practices towards which they point. The problem remains that if other
accounts, including many of the most influential, use the term in a
different way, the cogency of such particular interpretations might be
better understood as emerging despite, rather than because of, the
invocation of the term. Third, it should therefore be clear that no
attempt is made to assert yet another, new and improved, interpretation
of neoliberalism. That would merely add to the confusion. Fourth, [this
is **not** an argument that **'it' does not exist**. The different
accounts can point to **real social phenomena**; the criticism is
directed **purely at the designation**]{.underline}. Fifth, [objections
to the use of the term should not somehow be taken to **imply an
approval** of the numerous practices identified as neoliberal. To query
the term is **not to accept**]{.underline}, as some have implied, [a
right-wing position]{.underline} (Venkatesan 2015: 911). It will be
argued here that right-wingers do reject the term and that we should
take their objections seriously, but their standpoint is not mine, which
is that of revolutionary Marxism.
