In contrast to national assessments, this analysis focuses on the formal
institutions of the Alliance. [[NATO is]{.mark} **unique** among
alliances in that it is **[not only]{.mark}**]{.underline} a
[treaty-based [agreement among member states]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[an]{.mark} **[international
organization]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} a [highly
institutionalized]{.underline} one at that. Since its early years, NATO
has been comprised of a permanently staffed formal political
headquarters supported by a network of military and civilian
organizations. Particularly noteworthy is NATO's integrated joint
multinational military structure, a unique innovation without equivalent
among other alliances or international organizations.

This integration, capped by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium, extends through various echelons and included
the ISAF headquarters and other NATO structures in Afghanistan.7 Thus,
for this article, "[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[refers to the]{.mark}

actors. Nor does the article address the efficacy of counterinsurgency

1\. NATO's transformation and the development of Japan--NATO
cooperation: How to use NATO9

\(1\) NATO as a political partner

From a Japanese perspective, NATO can be seen, first, as a political
partner, meaning a partner with which to have political dialogue. When
visiting NTO and addressing the North Atlantic Council (NAC), both
Foreign Minister Taro Aso (May 2006) and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
(January 2007) spent a great deal of time talking about the security
environment in Asia, including the abduction and other issues of North
Korea as well as China's military buildup.10 Abe directly requested the
understanding and support of NATO members concerning Japan's stance on
the North Korean abduction and other issues. This illustrates the fact
that, for Japan, dialogue with NATO is a new venue to acquire
understanding and support from Europe for its position on problems
related to politics and security in Asia.

With regard to political and security dialogue between Japan and Europe,
in addition to traditional bilateral frameworks between Japan and major
European countries like the UK, France and Germany, there is now a
channel between Japan and the EU (to be discussed later). Dialogue with
NATO provides a new venue for discussion. In addition to Prime Minister
and ministeriallevel visits to NATO (meetings with the NATO Secretary
General and the NAC) and dialogue with the NATO Secretary General during
his visits to Japan, at the officials' level there is the annual Japan
--NATO High-Level Consultation. Moreover, in addition to dialogue with
NATO officials ---the International Staff and the International Military
Staff--- ad hoc meetings are held from time to time between Japanese
officials and representatives of the member states' delegations to NATO
in the context of the Political Committees (PC), Policy Cooperation
Groups (PCG), and other frameworks depending on the topics to be
discussed, such as the security situation in East Asia, Central Asia,
and missile defense. In recent years, the NAC and the Secretary General
have issued statements condemning North Korea's nuclear and missile
tests, which Japan appreciates a lot, showing one aspect of NATO's value
as a political partner.11 NATO is a forum suitable for Japan to discuss
Asian security and other security-related issues mainly because many
security experts, both civilian and military, are assembled and deal
with various security problems on a daily basis.

Japan is not alone in seeing NATO as a political partner. NATO is often
described as the strongest and the most successful military alliance in
history and encompassing all major powers from North America and Europe.
Thus, NATO inevitably carries a unique weight in international security
and world politics. That weight may even be heavier than NATO itself is
aware.12 In fact, demand from non-members to conduct political dialogue
with NATO has been increasing. At the same time, countries that do not
necessarily have positive perceptions of NATO or that do not share
fundamental values with the Alliance often see the strengthening of
relations between NATO and non-members with concern and suspicion. For
instance, Russia and China often react with vigilance when Japan and
NATO cooperate. This partly comes from their genuine concerns over the
strengthening of concrete military cooperation between Japan and NATO,
but it also has to do with their recognition of NATO's political weight.
Moreover, these countries view Japan--EU and Japan --NATO cooperation
differently. Put simply, they react more negatively to the latter than
the former. This fact demonstrates that NATO carries a distinctive
profile as a political actor that differs from that of the EU.

Nevertheless, it goes without saying that NATO is a military alliance
based on collective defense. NATO is not supposed to be aiming to expand
its political and diplomatic influence as a political actor in
international relations. This is how NATO differs from the EU, which has
been trying to construct a common foreign, security, and defense policy.
At the same time, however, NATO is not an alliance that concerns
military affairs alone. NATO has long labeled itself a politicalmilitary
alliance, and even its founding North Atlantic Treaty emphasizes
political and economic cooperation among the Allies (Parties).13

\(2\) NATO as an operational partner

NATO today can be characterized as an "alliance in action." In addition
to large-scale operations in Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (ISAF), NATO
is currently conducting an antiterrorism operation in the Mediterranean
(OAE), antipiracy measures off the coast of Somalia, and a training
mission in Iraq (NTM-I). Furthermore, from March to October 2011, NATO
conducted an operation over Libya. Many non-NATO countries, as well as
NATO Allies, are contributing troops to those operations and missions.
In the case of ISAF, for instance, in addition to all of the 28 NATO
countries, a total of around 20 non-members are participating as
Non-NATO Troop Contributing Nations (NNTCNs). The presence of non-member
contributors has grown considerably in the context of ISAF over the past
several years.14 In the past, Australia and New Zealand had contributed
troops to NATO-led operations in the former Yugoslavia, such as in
Bosnia in the 1990s. However, the current level of non-members'
involvement in NATO-led operations is truly a new phenomenon. One reason
behind this is the expansion of NATO's operational commitments beyond
the capacity of its members. In other words, it is impossible for the
Alliance to conduct all the operations alone as a self-sufficient
entity. At the same time, as most former communist countries in Europe
have already become members of the Alliance, the weight of the countries
outside the Euro--Atlantic region that used to be referred to as contact
countries ---Japan, Australia, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, etc.---
is increasing instead. From NATO's point of view, cooperation with new
partners is in essence an "import of support" 15 and NATO naturally
welcomes countries with the will and capabilities to contribute to the
operations that it leads.

On the other hand, operational cooperation with NATO is often an
effective means for nonmembers in terms of enhancing their efforts in
international peace and security, not least in the context of
international peace operations. Most of these operations today are
conducted multilaterally. What is more, looking at global trends in
international peace operations, it is clear that the weight of United
Nations-led peacekeeping operations (PKO) has been relatively decreasing
in recent years. In its place is a growing presence of peace operations
led by regional organizations such as NATO, the EU, and the African
Union (AU).16 While the activities of the AU are limited to
intra-regional operations on the African continent, NATO and EU
operations (other than territorial defense mission by NATO) are
basically assumed to take place outside of their member states.17

As a result of the expanding operational engagements of NATO and the EU
outside of Europe, other countries including Japan often find themselves
in a situation where they need to cooperate with NATO and the EU whether
they like it or not. When the ISAF operation in Afghanistan was launched
at the end of 2001, it was commanded on a half-year rotation by
countries with the will and capacity to command. However, due to cost
and complexities related to the establishment and maintenance of the
headquarters, NATO took over command in August 2003.18 Furthermore, ISAF
later expanded its area of responsibility and came to cover the whole
country. As a result, those who were deploying troops in Afghanistan had
no choice but to cooperate with NATO as long as they wanted to continue
their engagement. Seen from a different angle, it can also be said that
countries can use NATO as a framework through which to participate in
international efforts. Without such a framework, small to medium-sized
countries may not able to make contributions.

Nevertheless, there are various ways to pursue operational cooperation
with NATO. Potential contributors could complete official procedures,
including concluding a participation agreement with NATO, become a
troop-contributing country, and then deploy troops under the ISAF
command, or they could cooperate locally via individual arrangements
made with other countries already active in the area (without having
official relations with NATO).19 Theoretically, at least, it is even
possible for those countries to conduct a completely independent
operation on its own in Afghanistan. However, regardless of how
self-contained the activities are, the necessity to coordinate on issues
such as the division of roles with ISAF will of course come up, and it
is practically impossible to assume that the countries that endeavor to
send troops to Afghanistan could conduct its own activities without
relying on the capabilities and various infrastructure of ISAF at all,
including in extremis support and security information. Furthermore,
even assuming it is feasible, it will not be the most efficient way to
use the limited amount of resources available. In sum, it is not only in
NATO's interest, but also non-NATO troop contributors' interest to
cooperate with each other. Former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop
Scheffer succinctly pointed out that, "NATO is a framework that they
\[nonmembers\] can use to make their own efforts more effective." 20
Furthermore, if a country completes official procedures with NATO and
takes position as an official ISAF troop contributing nation, they can
participate in various levels of ISAF meetings, receive more
information, and get more involved in policy-shaping.

For a number of constitutional, legal and domestic political reasons, it
is very difficult for the SDF to operate under the command of NATO.21
Short of coming under NATO's command, however, various options are
conceivable for the SDF to work with NATO in the areas where it
operates. At the same time, operational cooperation with NATO does not
need to be limited to the military domain alone. In Afghanistan, since
2007 Japan has provided humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in
cooperation with PRTs, and since 2009 has dispatched development experts
(civilian assistance teams) to the Lithuania-led PRT in Chaghcharan,
Ghor province.22 Assistance from Japan was of great value for Lithuania,
a country which does not have much funding and experience in development
assistance. From a Japanese point of view, the importance of this scheme
comes from the fact that it enables Japan to expand the geographical
reach of its development assistance beyond those areas where an Embassy
or the Japanese aid agency (JICA) are already present. Without the
cooperation of the Lithuania-led PRT, it is easy to imagine that Japan
would not have been able to operate in a remote province like Ghor.
Moreover, Japan and NATO concluded a security agreement in June 2010,
which allows Japan and NATO to share classified information with each
other.23 This is expected to be a foundation for deeper dialogue and
practical cooperation between Japan and NATO.24

\(3\) NATO as another venue of cooperation with the United States

The [[comparative]{.mark} advantage]{.underline} that [[cooperation with
NATO offers]{.underline}]{.mark} Japan, [[**as opposed to** bilateral
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} with major European countries and with
the EU, is the fact that the US, Japan's only formal ally, is part of
NATO. For all NATO Allies excluding the US, what NATO means is
essentially an alliance with the US. When NATO was founded within the
context of the Cold War, it was primarily seen as a means to secure US
commitment to defend Western Europe. Moreover, for former communist
nations that joined NATO after the end of the Cold War, the NATO
membership was synonymous with receiving a commitment from the US for
collective defense, exemplified by Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty. For those reasons, NATO is usually conceived in the context of
policy toward the US in many countries.

4.5 Conclusions

This chapter has described the [[institutional framework of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. Member States are represented in [[the
**N**]{.mark}orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline} (NAC), which is the highest political
organ of the Alliance. [Decisions on NATO operations]{.underline} are
[taken by the Council through **[consensus]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
Secretary General of the Alliance is responsible for steering this
process of consultation and has several tools at its disposal to achieve
consensus, in particular the so-called 'silence procedure'.
[Consensus]{.underline} and the silence procedure [show]{.underline}
that [[NATO enjoys]{.underline}]{.mark} a degree of [[**autonomy** from
its member States]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Alliance can function
even without full agreement of all of the members.

The [NAC]{.underline}, its supporting International Staff and the
civilian agencies [constitute the]{.underline} civilian [**structure**
of the Alliance]{.underline}. The military structure consists of the
Military Committee, supported by the International Military Staff, the
two Supreme Commands and international military headquarters subordinate
to them. Supreme Allied Commander Europe commands NATO operations.
SACEUR has "operational command and control" over the military forces
assigned to him by the Troop Contributing Nations, which could either be
member States or States that are not member to NATO (Non-NATO
Contributing Nations, or NNCN). Two aspects are relevant to note here.
First, States that participate in NATO-led operations transfer a
significant degree of control over military forces to NATO. Chapter 7
will examine in more detail whether the degree of control transferred to
NATO by States equates to 'effective control'. If NATO does have
effective control over conduct of forces placed at its disposal, the
conduct can be attributed to NATO. Secondly, it is relevant to note that
the [participation of NNCN in NATO]{.underline}-led
[operations]{.underline} show that [[NATO is a **separate entity** from
its member States]{.underline}]{.mark}. NNCN do not take part in the
decision-making process at the political level and neither have
operational command and control over their forces once they are placed
under the authority of SACEUR. This illustrates that [NATO]{.underline}
can [[act **separately** from]{.mark} its [member
States]{.mark}]{.underline} and [enjoys]{.underline} a [[**high degree**
of autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}. This feature -- further examined in
Chapter 5 -- speaks in favour of the existence of international legal
personality of NATO.

At the beginning of the policy game, most [[European teams
adopted]{.mark} a]{.underline} "**[[wait-and-see]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[approach focused on persuading the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [to **return to NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline},
offering concessions that were unthinkable before (from trade to
energy). The unfortunate message for transatlantic relations seems to be
that a threat to abandon NATO might actually yield some results.
[[Europeans started to take proactive steps **only
once**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[security situation]{.mark} in the
scenario **[deteriorated significantly]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and
when it became **clear**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the [U.S.
**withdrawal**]{.mark} **decision**]{.underline} --- at least in this
simulation --- [[was **irreversible**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Faced with a
crisis in a NATO member state in the western Balkans (in the scenario, a
pro-Russian coup d'état with Russian warships blocking access to the
Mediterranean Sea), most teams anticipated that remaining NATO members
would struggle to agree to invoke the principle of collective defense
under Article 5 in this grey-zone scenario. Instead, the invocation of
Article 4 --- which involves only consultations in case the security or
independence of a NATO member state is threatened --- paired with
sanctions on Russia and a robust response within ad-hoc coalitions were
the preferred means of action. Without U.S. security guarantees, it
seems, the credibility of Article 5 and the mutual defense commitment
are questionable.

[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}.[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[support for greater
European **defense**]{.mark} **efforts**]{.underline} has
[[always]{.mark} been **[conditional]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Successive
U.S. administrations have supported European moves to bolster their
defense capabilities, provided that such efforts would strengthen,
rather than weaken, the political cohesion of the Atlantic alliance.
Those conditions were framed most prominently in 1998 by former U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Following a U.K.-France meeting
at St. Malo, at which London and Paris declared that the EU "must have
the capacity for autonomous action," Secretary Albright penned a piece
in the Financial Times stating that U.S. support for greater European
efforts would be contingent on avoiding "three D's:" discrimination
against non-EU NATO members, decoupling of European and North American
security, and duplication of NATO's operational planning system or its
command structure. "No duplication" was neither defined nor intended to
mean that Europe should not develop certain capabilities that already
existed in the alliance; indeed, much of the Clinton administration's

[[danger]{.mark} would [exist **as long as NATO\'s transformation was
ongoing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, it is worth recalling that
it was precisely the idea that NATO after the Cold War would be a
transformed alliance more political than military in nature that helped
U.S. policymakers justify NATO\'s eastward expansion, and so helped
bring about the present crisis in transatlantic credibility.39 It is
therefore questionable whether policymakers, having recently decided to
again treat NATO as a military vehicle, can reverse course a third time
and treat NATO as a political organization at a moment when relations
with Russia seemingly necessitate a military response.

[[Although]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}]{.underline} can
[[make **every effort**]{.mark} to send **clear signals** and
**communicate effectively** with Russian leadership]{.underline}, [there
is **always** a risk]{.underline} that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
will [[misinterpret U.S.]{.mark} and [NATO actions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
A variety of factors beyond the control of the deterring party ---
including [[cultural differences]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[cognitive
biases]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[irrational behavior]{.underline}]{.mark},
and **[flawed [assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- can [cause the
target state to mis-read or misjudge]{.underline} the [actions of its
adversary]{.underline}.99 Domestic concerns or political constraints can
also color how a state perceives and reacts to the actions of its
adversary. One potent example of misperception occurred in 1983, when
the Russians mistook a NATO nuclear warfare exercise called "[[Able
Archer]{.underline}]{.mark}" as a cover for an actual nuclear strike,
and nearly retaliated in kind.100 Only belatedly did then-President
Ronald Reagan come to the realization that

> \[m\]any people at the top of the Soviet hierarchy were genuinely
> afraid of America and Americans many of us in the administration took
> it for granted that the Russians, like ourselves, considered it
> unthink-able that the United States would launch a first strike
> against them. But I began to realize that many Soviet officials feared
> us not only as adversaries but as potential aggressors who might hurl
> nuclear weapons at them in a first strike. . . .101

This incident [[illustrates]{.underline}]{.mark} the [importance of
trying to understand how the **other side** will interpret one's actions
and]{.underline} the [[dangers of **presuming**]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [the [adversary will share]{.mark} the **same [logic]{.mark} and
assumptions**]{.underline}.

Moreover, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} tends to [[view **any**]{.mark}
**defense- or [security]{.mark}-related [actions]{.mark}** [taken by the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [or NATO]{.mark} in the European
theater as [being targeted at it]{.mark}]{.underline},
[regardless]{.underline} of the actual intent behind these actions. As
one RAND report notes,

> [[**Any actions** in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} to support American
> operations elsewhere have been and [will be [observed
> by]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[Russian military **more
> interested**]{.mark} **in us** [than we are]{.mark}]{.underline} in
> it. It is critical that operational planning take this into account

> [Russia]{.underline} from [[mistaking]{.underline}]{.mark} operations
> and [[actions as **unintended**]{.underline}]{.mark}
> "**[[signals]{.underline}]{.mark}**."102

Of course, Russia may also make such claims about perceived U.S. and
NATO "aggression" with the aim of justifying its own defense- or
security-related actions. Whether rooted in genuine concern over U.S.
actions or political theater, the reality is that Russia frequently does
not modulate its responses based on the perceived or stated U.S. intent
behind its actions, but rather reacts to transgressions of its redlines
irrespective of the reason behind the violation. Nonetheless, [[if U.S.
and NATO planners fail to account for Russian **sensitivities** and
**assumptions**]{.mark} when deciding on courses of action]{.underline},
**[[seemingly minor or irrelevant actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** could
[**inadvertently [trigger escalation]{.mark}** with Russia]{.underline}.

Worse, [[Western officials]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[insisted]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Russia would have **nothing to
say**]{.underline}]{.mark} about the matter. Jens Stoltenberg,
[[NATO]{.mark}'s]{.underline} Secretary General, was [**[especially
blunt]{.mark}** and arrogant on that score]{.underline}. He summarily
rejected Moscow's demands in late 2021 that NATO provide binding
security guarantees to Russia, including a commitment that Ukraine would
never be offered membership, and that NATO military forces would not be
deployed in that country. Stoltenberg's response could not have been
more uncompromising. "NATO has an open‐​door policy. This is enshrined in
NATO's founding treaty ... The message today to Russia is that it is for
Ukraine as a sovereign nation to decide its own path. And for the 30
NATO allies to decide when Ukraine is ready to become a member."

[Western officials **implicitly [assumed]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
Russia could be intimidated and eventually compelled to accept Ukraine
as part of NATO. [They [dismissed]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[Kremlin's]{.mark} **increasingly pointed**
[warnings]{.mark}]{.underline} that efforts to make Kyiv an Alliance
asset [would cross a **red line**]{.underline} that violated Russia's
security. Their [[assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Moscow]{.mark}
would **[tamely accept]{.mark}**]{.underline} a [[NATO]{.mark}
presence]{.underline} inside Russia's core security zone
[[proved]{.underline}]{.mark} to be **[[spectacularly
wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and [Ukraine is]{.mark} now
**[paying]{.mark} a very high price**]{.underline} in treasure and blood
for their miscalculation.

[[One]{.mark} might [hope]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} leaders would have [[learned a]{.mark}n

[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they are **stubbornly
ignoring**]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[new set of]{.mark} **ominous
[warnings]{.mark}** [from Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this time,
the [[price of such]{.underline}]{.mark} tone‐​deaf [[arrogance could
be]{.mark} **utterly catastrophic**]{.underline}. Indeed, it is
[creating]{.underline} the [risk of a [**nuclear clash** between Russia
and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. In his
first speech announcing the "special military operation" in Ukraine,
Vladimir [Putin warned]{.underline} all outside parties (clearly meaning
NATO members) not to interfere. "[Anyone who tries to
interfere]{.underline} with us ... [must know that Russia's response

#### Russia hates the institution of NATO\-\--withdrawal is key

Near Abroad\". Sciendo. 9-23-2020.

[[Moscow]{.mark} has [remained **sceptical**]{.mark} of the security
alliance]{.underline}, once aimed at defending Western Europe from the
Soviet Union remaining in existence following its collapse. Richard
Sakwa (2016) argued that [[NATO's **very being** is]{.mark} 'justified
by the need [to manage]{.mark} the security
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline} provoked by its enlargement' (4). While
this commentary ignores why the former Warsaw Pact and Baltic states
would perceive Moscow as a threat, it still serves to represent
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** alternative [**[view]{.mark}point**, not
[of]{.mark} a benevolent [NATO]{.mark} seeking peace and justice, but of
[a **menacing military alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline} taking over
strategic territory through membership.

Furthermore, **[[NATO is viewed as]{.mark} a lingering tool of [U.S.
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Europe. For many realists, [the
survival of [NATO]{.mark} following the Cold War [says more about
**American** ]{.mark}**power and [influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} over
Europe than multilateral institutions (Waltz 2000, 20). Waltz argued,
'[that]{.underline} international [institutions serve primarily
**national**]{.underline} rather than international
**[interests']{.underline}** (21). In other words, [NATO survived
because it was in the national interest of the United
States]{.underline} and its expansion continues to be a policy pursued
for American interests. **[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore,
**[[perceives NATO as an imperial weapon]{.mark} of an expansionist,
unchecked U.S. power]{.underline}**.

To this end, [**Russia sees NATO as a weapon** against its interests
[and]{.mark} a potential **[threat to its
survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russian academic Sergei Karaganov
(2014) argued, '[the West has continually sought to expand]{.underline}
its zone of military, economic, and political influence through NATO and
the EU. Russian interests and objections were flatly ignored. Russia was
treated like a defeated power, though we did not see ourselves as
defeated'. [This perception is **not isolated** within
Moscow]{.underline}. Prominent Cold War figures warned of the policy of
expansion towards Russian borders. George Kennan (1997), the American
diplomat and author of the original containment policy, warned that
expansion of NATO would be disastrous for U.S.--Russia relations, as
perception in Moscow questions the need for a military alliance
following the end of hostile tensions.

Debate centred on whether the West 'promised' not expand into the Near
Abroad continues among academics (for discussion, see Kramer 2009;
Kramer and Shifrinson 2017). However, these issues are secondary to the
security issues of strategic depth between Moscow and the West. Since
realists argue that [states pay close attention to relative gains from
rivals, and]{.underline} since [perceptions play a key role]{.underline}
in this analysis, [**[any perception]{.mark} of an advantage [equates
to]{.mark} an [advantage]{.mark}**[. For Moscow, there is a
perception]{.mark} that the admissions [of]{.mark} former]{.underline}
World Trade Organization (WTO) [states represent]{.underline} these
[**[broken promises]{.underline}**]{.mark} by NATO (Waltz 2000, 22). The
2008 discussion of membership to both Georgia and Ukraine signalled
further 'violations' of this agreement, but the power gains remain the
primary concern. During a March 2014 press conference, Putin expressed
his frustration at the West. He said, 'We understand what is happening;
we understand that these actions were aimed against Ukraine and Russia
and against Eurasian integration. And all this while Russia strived to
engage in dialogue with our colleagues in the West'. Putin went on to
say that the West repeatedly lies to Moscow, 'This happened with NATO's
expansion to the East, as well as the deployment of military
infrastructure at our borders. They kept telling us the same thing:
"Well, this does not concern you". That's easy to say' (Ibid.).

[According to the official Russian version of the call, his American
counterpart assured him the alliance did not have \"provocative or
expansionist\" intentions \-- and that Russia should know
this.]{.underline}

But [[**it hardly seems to matter** how]{.mark} often [NATO
makes]{.mark} these [assurances. The Kremlin will **never trust them**.
Fear of the]{.mark}]{.underline} Western military
[[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s steady march east [[**is
deep-rooted**. It strikes at the **very heart of Russia\'s**]{.mark}
national sense of [security]{.mark}]{.underline}, a relic of Cold War
enmity which has seeped down to post-Soviet generations.

Ilya Saraev is a 15-year-old pupil at the First Moscow cadet school in
Moscow. He thinks long and hard when I ask him about NATO. \"I think
NATO might be a friend to Russia but there\'s one point I don\'t
understand: Why it needs to approach the border with Russia more and
more,\" he says.

Cadet school is an education in patriotism, like something from a bygone
era. Besides the regular classes, there are lessons in ballroom dancing.
Teenage cadets proudly leading local beauties through the waltz while
outside their classmates rehearse the goosestep.

After the takeover of Crimea, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused
Russia of behaving in a 19th century fashion in the 21st century. In
some ways it\'s an epithet that seems to ring true here. The children
are immaculately mannered and thoughtful. They write to their fellow
cadets in Crimea. They say they feel sad there\'s this tension between
brother nations \-- Russia and Ukraine.

\"People still don\'t realize that war means despair and grief,\" says
16-year-old Vlad Voinakov. \"They can\'t find a compromise because
people\'s interests become involved and that\'s where the problem
lies.\"

[[Russia and NATO have **never been able** to find]{.underline}]{.mark}
much of a [[compromise. Russia\'s **repeated stance**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [after German reunification,
[promises]{.mark} were made that NATO would never expand eastward \--
and [were]{.mark} promptly **[broken]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO says
this is simply not true. \"No such pledge was made, and no evidence to
back up Russia\'s claims has ever been produced,\" the alliance wrote in
an April fact sheet entitled \"Russia\'s accusations \-- setting the
record straight.\"

[NATO]{.underline} says it has [tried]{.underline} hard [to make Russia
a]{.underline} \"privileged [partner]{.underline}.\" It has worked
together with Russia on a range of issues from counter-terrorism and
counter-narcotics to submarine rescue and emergency planning. NATO says
that fundamentally Russia\'s anti-NATO rhetoric is an attempt to
\"divert attention away from its actions\" in Ukraine. Now all
cooperation is off the table.

\"[[From the Russian side]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}-Russian [[cooperation was
**just**]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[camouflage]{.mark}**,\" says
Vladimir Batyuk of Russian think tank]{.underline}, the Institute of USA
and Canada Studies. \"After the Cold War Russia tried several times to
become a member and the Americans always said, \'it\'s not going to
happen.\'\" He quotes Lord Ismay, NATO\'s first Secretary General, on
[[the **object of NATO\'s existence**]{.mark}**: \"To [keep the Russians
out]{.mark}**, the Americans in and the Germans down.\"]{.underline}

Although the Soviet Union is dead, Orenstein explains that for a Russian
government determined to win back the former Soviet empire, [[the very
**existence of NATO** and]{.mark} its **[security
guarantees]{.mark}**]{.underline} to member states [[constitute a
**threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. An enlarged [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
alliance [[threatens Russia's]{.mark} attempts to \[**re\]establish
itself as a great power** with a legitimate **[s]{.mark}phere
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence**]{.underline} --- whether or not the
lands in between acknowledge or accept that influence.

Or, to put it in more plain terms, "[where the West sees democracy
promotion]{.underline} as a strategy for promoting peace in Europe,
[[Putin sees]{.underline}]{.mark} it as an act of **[[war
against]{.mark} Russia and [his regime]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
particular. ... [[Russia regards]{.mark} the **battle for
[influence]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}in the lands in between
[**[as]{.underline}**]{.mark} a [**[zero-sum]{.underline}**]{.mark}
game, to be won or lost." [[This]{.mark} conflict of visions has **[led
to]{.mark} a [conflict in reality]{.mark}**]{.underline} as Russia
conducts [hybrid **war** and operates in a **gray area**]{.underline},
daring Western nations to stop it.

#### The CP maintains its potential\-\--outweighs intentions

Mitch **Potterstaff 08**. Reporter at The Star. \"Putin questions
existence of NATO\". thestar.
https://www.thestar.com/news/2008/04/05/putin_questions_existence_of_nato.html

BUCHAREST--Describing his two terms in power as \"the resurrection of
Russia,\" Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} yesterday [delivered a bracing
broadside to]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} summit, warning that
while there is no danger of another Cold War, [[there
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[no possibility of global security without
full **Russian engagement**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Addressing reporters in the wake of candid closed-door meetings with
NATO heads of state, the Russian president prefaced his criticisms with
an assurance that it is in nobody\'s interest to plunge back into the
\"murky waters of Cold Wars.\"

Such a scenario, he said, would be impossible regardless because the old
\"ideological differences\" no longer exist.

But with the same reasoning, [[Putin questioned the **very existence of
NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark}, saying the purpose of the expanding
transatlantic alliance is unclear today, given that the Soviet Union it
was designed to counter is a thing of the past. Instead, he said, NATO
appears on a track to continue getting bigger -- and nearer to Russia\'s
borders -- even when its future role lacks clarity.

\"[Who is NATO against]{.underline}?\" Putin asked. \"[The emergence of
the powerful [military bloc **at our borders will be seen as a direct
threat to Russia\'s security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I heard them saying
today that the expansion is not directed against Russia. But [[it\'s the
**potential, not intentions, that matters**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

Although Trump has now left office, **[NATO
is]{.underline}** nonetheless **[in for difficult times]{.underline}**,
as strategic circumstances change and China's rise draws American
attention toward East Asia. Though some European NATO members now
express interest in helping to counter Beijing, and the alliance itself
is working to stake out a position on China's rise, as the NATO
Reflection Group Report underscored in November 2020, **[the United
States will inevitably be more invested in Asian developments than will
other NATO members]{.underline}**.16 **[The net result
presents]{.underline}** two possible avenues for deeper, **[substantive
divides in the alliance]{.underline}**. First, if competition with
Beijing
escalates, **[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[may
be impelled to devote fewer resources and attention to European
affairs]{.underline}**. **[This would invert the Cold War
experience]{.underline}**, **[creating the potential for the alliance to
wither away as American attention moves elsewhere]{.underline}** **[and
NATO's European members]{.underline}** **[seek alternatives for their
security]{.underline}**. Alliances, after all, usually change as new
threats appear; **[as American priorities change]{.underline}**, **[NATO
cohesion may decline]{.underline}** as well. Then, too, European actors
might also be expected to complain about prospective American
"abandonment." Mounting Chinese--American competition may also encourage
NATO's European members to distance themselves, perhaps dramatically,
from the United States. During the contest with the Soviet Union,
European allies regularly feared that Soviet--American tensions might
entangle them in a conflict with Moscow at times and places beyond their
control. A U.S.--China contest would carry even greater risks. With less
at stake in Asia, NATO's European members can be expected to separate
themselves from U.S. policy. If the United States were to respond by
pressuring its European allies to assist against Beijing, an alliance
rupture would become possible. President Biden's path forward
Recognizing these limits, what are the options for the United States
under the Biden administration? Any policy must start from a recognition
that **[America's postwar mission in Europe has reached a natural
end-state born of overwhelming success]{.underline}**. Great powers no
longer pose threats to dominate the region's security or deny the
independence of most countries therein. China, of course, is making
economic and political inroads in the area, but is also encountering
increasing opposition as it overplays its hand and, in any case, does
not threaten the survival or sovereignty of European states. Russia, on
the other hand, has notable military capabilities that can threaten
neighbors along its immediate perimeter, but it lacks the wherewithal to
imperil countries much beyond that. Moreover, its force structure seems
designed to raise the costs for any U.S.--led NATO operation near
Russia's own borders, just as Europe's member states have the economic
and military capacity to oppose any Russian designs. As a result, **[a
stable European balance of power can exist]{.underline}**. This is a
sea-change from the postwar, or even post--Cold War periods. NATO's
original purpose has been vindicated; the victory is won. Any policy
must start from a recognition that America's postwar mission in Europe
has reached a natural end-state born of overwhelming success. In
addition, **[the United States faces diminishing returns, and several
negative results, from continuing its present approach to
NATO]{.underline}**. The alliance has now been enlarged to the point
where few strategically meaningful European actors exist outside of
NATO's orbit, even as those that exist, such as Ukraine, would
constitute a net loss for U.S. national security by risking a direct
conflict with Moscow. In short, little can be gained from continued
expansion. **[Likewise, as European leaders continue pressing for
greater autonomy from the United States and NATO, the U.S. will generate
increased friction with its allies if it continues to suppress their
initiatives in this direction]{.underline}**. This tension, meanwhile,
comes at a time when Europe itself is of diminishing relative importance
to an American grand strategy increasingly fixed on Asia, as most of the
actors involved recognize. As the U.S.--led alliance continues moving
toward Russia's borders, it may play some role in driving Moscow and
Beijing to cooperate in international affairs. In short, U.S. policy in
Asia complicates U.S. strategy in Europe, and vice-versa. The **[United
States requires a course correction]{.underline}**. **[U.S. policy
toward NATO now injects ]{.underline}**a large degree of **[instability
and unsustainability into the region]{.underline}**, which ironically
possesses the preconditions for an unprecedented degree of stability
thanks in part to prior U.S. efforts. In consequence,
the **[Biden ]{.underline}**administration **[should ]{.underline}**consider
proceeding along four tracks, with the goal of significantly reducing
the U.S. security presence via NATO. Ending enlargement In coordination
with its partners, the United States should credibly renounce further
NATO enlargement. Whatever one makes of the merits of America's
post--1945 presence in Europe, the gains from further enlargement are
few and the risks substantial. Several pathways exist to develop a
policy of ceasing enlargement. Most directly, the U.S. government could
simply declare it will not support the alliance's further growth; thanks
to NATO's "one state, one vote" procedures, this would be enough to
scuttle a further expansion push. Less unilaterally, U.S. planners could
attempt to craft an intra--NATO consensus that expansion is no longer
worth the costs. Given that many alliance members have long been
skeptical of the merits of expansion --- German policymakers, for
example, were famously ambivalent over the Bucharest Declaration of
2008, which embraced Ukraine's and Georgia's interest in NATO membership
--- forging a broad front on this agenda ought not be difficult. Along
the way, U.S. and allied diplomats should also seek to dampen the
membership aspirations of those states still outside the alliance.
Cutting troop commitments Second, the U.S. government should forgo
permanently stationing combat forces in the Eastern European states
admitted to NATO since the Cold War. Amid mounting calls to bolster the
alliance's presence along the so-called "eastern flank" due to
collapsing relations with Moscow, the U.S. government
should **[encourage European NATO members to bear primary
responsibility for defense obligations east of the Oder--Neisse
line]{.underline}**. Not only have NATO's European members taken an
active role in the alliance's ongoing "Enhanced Forward Presence" in
Poland and the Baltic States; there is more than enough latent military
capability in the European portion of the alliance to see this task
through.17 For example, the former members of the Warsaw Pact (excluding
Albania and the Baltic States) that have joined NATO since 1995 have
nearly the same gross domestic product (\$1.55 trillion, measured in
2010 dollars) as Russia (\$1.76 trillion). Their population, 92 million
people versus Russia's 144 million, is also significant. Add in the
other European members of NATO, and the numbers shift decisively against
Russia. Although non--U.S. military investments in NATO remain
underwhelming, **[even limited growth]{.underline}** **[in non--U.S.
NATO defense capabilities could]{.underline}** thus **[provide a
significant force able to take the lead in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}**. **[The United States should promote this result,
with the goal of shifting the defense burden in Europe to the highly
capable states in the area to reduce U.S. defense
obligations. ]{.underline}**Rebalancing trans--Atlantic politics **[The
United States ought to prepare for a broader recalibration of political
responsibilities in Europe]{.underline}**. Precisely because the United
States has other domestic and international obligations, and because
NATO's European members are increasingly disenchanted with U.S.
predominance, **[conditions are ripe to empower the European
allies]{.underline}**. The objective should be **[to strengthen
intra--European solidarity and cooperation while the United
States]{.underline}** **[steps back from active management of European
security]{.underline}**. The United States should pivot toward becoming
the pacifier of last resort rather than the manager of early squabbles.

International factors play a key role in the
[[Russia]{.mark}n]{.underline} reasoning. The [whole security apparatus
[**closely monitors** developments]{.mark} in other
countries]{.underline}, including but not limited to the U.S., China,
Israel, and South Korea. [[In]{.mark} the **current
[atmosphere]{.mark}** [of distrust between Russia and]{.mark} the
**U.S./[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [[feeling of
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}22 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[global
**AI**]{.underline}]{.mark} or tech [[race]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[appear **inescapable**]{.underline}]{.mark}.23 Thus, [demonstrating
**capabilities in [AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}, autonomy, and automation
[becomes [important for sending]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[message]{.underline}]{.mark}** that Russia is entering, or already
part of, the global competition. As Vadim Kozyulin from the PIR Center
think tank notes, for Russia, "combat robots have become one of the
symbols of the renaissance of armed forces, a promising export product
and a signal to the world of the country's readiness to challenge the
technological leadership of the United States."24

At the same time, Russia's pursuit of weaponized AI should not only be
associated with strategic motivations. Ideology and beliefs about
Russia's state identity and its role in the world are important features
of the discourse relating to AI. As Putin has said, he is convinced that
Russia "must, and can, become one of the global leaders in the sphere of
AI. This is a question of our future, the place of Russia in the
world."25

[[Tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline} and scientific
[innovation]{.underline} has historically been [[**closely associated**
with Russia's]{.mark} self-[perception]{.mark}]{.underline} as a great
power and quest to be recognized as such.26 As noted by Federation
Council Chairwoman Valentina Matviyenko, science and technology have
been key factors in the development of Russia throughout history. She
quotes the scientist Mikhail Lomonosov, who said in the 17th century
that, "The honor of the Russian people demands that they should show
their ability and sharpness in science."27 Mastering
[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [comes to be perceived as continuing
the trajectory of previous technological achievements presented as part
of Russia's **great power status**]{.underline}, such as space
exploration and nuclear weapons.

[Military technology [is]{.mark}]{.underline} arguably [[**particularly
important** for signaling]{.mark} great power
[status]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [demonstrating military
revival]{.underline} is [closely related to Russian]{.underline}
leadership's [quest to be taken]{.underline} "[seriously]{.underline}"
[by other great powers]{.underline} in what it sees as a post-hegemonic,
multipolar (or polycentric) world.28 To be recognized as part of the
modern great power club, [[Russia believes]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[it must be at the **forefront** of AI]{.mark}
development]{.underline}. As [[Putin]{.mark}
[argued]{.mark}]{.underline}, "it is not coincidental that many
developed countries of the world have already adopted their own action
plans for the development of such technologies. And we, of course, must
ensure technological sovereignty in the field of AI."29

### 2NC --- Exemptions Bad --- Cyber

#### Security cooperation with NATO over cyber [uniquely provokes]{.underline} Russia.

**Zhiping '22** --- Qi; observer on international affairs. April 22,
2022; \"US sets dangerous precedents in cyberspace\"; *Global Times*;
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202204/1260039.shtml; //CYang

In the context of a hot war, [[situations won't]{.mark} **exactly
[follow]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[US script]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[whether engagement in cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark} would be
considered armed engagement or whether it [would
[provoke]{.mark}]{.underline} another [**[nuclear]{.mark} weapon state**
to [escalate]{.mark} the conflict]{.underline}. Against the backdrop of
Russia's announcement to raise its nuclear preparedness and unspecified
cyberattacks on Russian nuclear facilities, [US direct
[engagement]{.mark} in cyber]{.underline} conflict with Russia will
[[**easily lead** to]{.mark} a **strategic
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation**]{.underline}. The Russian Foreign Ministry
condemned the [[US and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} in a statement for
[[waging a]{.underline}]{.mark} cyber war against Russia involving a
broader scale of hackers. This is a stern warning against the US'
"**[[dangerous game]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[in]{.mark}
**[cyberspace]{.mark}** which]{.underline} would possibly
[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[conflict between
**nuclear**]{.mark}**-weapon [states]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The second precedent the US sets is a proxy war in cyberspace. The US
uses China and Russia as imaginary enemies to promote its cyber strategy
of "hunt-forward" and "persistent engagement." The US is deeply involved
in building the cyber power of Ukraine, using it as a bridgehead for
close reconnaissance, network penetration and cyber attacks against
Russia, preparing for its cyber confrontation with Russia. Apart from
Ukraine, the US is also doing the same in the Asia-Pacific region,
hyping China's cybersecurity threats to China's neighbors and thus
luring them into "cybersecurity cooperation" in an attempt to bring the
US cyber tentacles to China's doorstep. This is similar to US intention
of deploying its missile and anti-missile systems in the vicinity of
China and Russia, which not only enhances the US deterrence and
offensive capabilities, but also takes the opportunity to force China
and Russia's neighboring countries to the US' chariot.

The [**tragedy in [Ukraine]{.mark}** [is a lesson]{.mark}]{.underline}
to be learned. [For the [US]{.mark}]{.underline}, [there will
be]{.underline} a [**greater [security dilemma]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [pursuit of its]{.underline} own absolute
[security]{.underline} in spite of security concerns of others, or even
at the cost of others' insecurity. [With [good intentions to strengthen
cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} security and [**[cooperation]{.mark}** with
the US]{.underline}, [regional countries]{.underline} not only failed to
enhance their own security, but also [[put themselves in]{.mark} the
**[vortex]{.mark} of competition** [between major
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[became]{.mark} **cannon [fodder]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} major power
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The third precedent has been set for non-compliance with international
rules. The US clamors that cyber attacks constitute armed attacks, and
pushed NATO to declare for the first time at its 2021 summit that
\"significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." But the
US launched such cyber activities that should be defined by itself as
"armed attacks" against Russia. The US underlines that all offline rules
apply online as well, fabricating cyber attacks charges, accusing other
countries and abusing sanctions. At the same time, the US sees the
digital world as a \"land beyond law,\" and does not hesitate to attack
other countries\' critical infrastructure. While advocating democracy,
freedom and human rights and opposing information manipulation and
disinformation, the US cut off the Internet services for Russia, blocked
Russia's voice, and spread disinformation against Russia without limits,
in a bid to confuse the public. Behind these actions is the arrogance of
the US and its blatant double standards for international rules.

Coincidentally, the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} completely ignored the
international consensus reached last year of "developing and
implementing globally interoperable common rules and standards for
supply chain security," in the UNGGE report, and [**[deliberately
create]{.mark}d** [**closed** and **exclusive**]{.mark} small
[circles]{.mark} to discuss]{.underline} supply chain issues for
[geopolitical purposes]{.underline}.

What the [US wants]{.underline} has never been universally applicable
international rules in cyberspace, but \"domestic laws\" and \"[rules of
its **small [gang]{.mark}**]{.underline}\" [[to serve
its]{.underline}]{.mark} own **[selfish
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The "framework for responsible State
behavior" which the US claimed to adhere to only holds other countries
accountable, and the US itself is above international rules.
Washington's practices of disregarding international rules have severely
interfered with the efforts of the international community to establish
order in cyberspace, and may even lead to serious consequences of a
collapsed order.

[[Cyberspace is a **common space**]{.underline}]{.mark} shared by all
countries. The [[US should stop]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[playing]{.mark}
the **[touch ball]{.mark}**]{.underline}" in cyberspace. Instead, it is
supposed to shoulder the responsibility of a major power, avoid
strategic misjudgments, and earnestly maintain strategic stability among
major powers and build a peaceful and secure cyberspace.

### AT: Global Times Indict

#### This is Western conflation.

Millennials. April 28, 2017; "China's Angriest Newspaper Doesn't Speak
for China"; *Foreign Policy*;

\[TITLE\]: "[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} Angriest [[Newspaper
**Doesn't Speak** for China]{.underline}]{.mark}"

But that nickname is revealing in more ways than one. By its own
admission, the [[paper's]{.mark} actual [relationship with
**China**]{.mark}**'s levers of power** [is **tangential at
best**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And while the [[Global Times and the
Chinese government]{.mark} have interests that overlap]{.underline},
they [[aren't]{.mark} **nearly [identical]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Several current and former editors at the paper say business incentives
drive it to be intentionally provocative whenever possible. Provocations
that involve straying from the official line of the Chinese government
are welcome, so long as they don't entirely sever the illusion of a
tight connection between it and the newspaper.

The newspaper owes its outsized voice in international media and
politics precisely to that illusion of "official" status. On its own,
the Global Times's sensationalism (conveniently available in English)
may have earned it an international audience, but not nearly the
influence it currently enjoys. In his rambling interview with The
Associated Press this month, U.S. President Donald Trump cited what was,
most likely, the Global Times as evidence his policy was working. "You
saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed
to have nuclear, you know, et cetera," he stated. "People have said
they've never seen this ever before in China."

[[**Western** headlines **regularly fail** to distinguish between the
Global Times and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Chinese
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}. Take the round of such stories after
the election, following Trump's promises of targeting Beijing over
trade. "China warns of 'tit for tat' on iPhone sales if Trump starts
trade war," read one NBC headline. "China threatens to cut iPhone sales
and replace Boeing with Airbus," reported the Independent. "China warns
iPhone sales could be hurt," said Fox News. After Trump's call with
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, headlines talked of China promising it
would "take revenge." In every case, it wasn't "China" that was talking
but one newspaper.

# Updates --- NATO Bad

## Assurance

### 1NC --- Assurance

#### Credibility of NATO is key to assurance and deterrence globally --- alliance commitments [spill over]{.underline}.

**Beauchamp '18** --- Zach; senior reporter at Vox, where he covers
global politics and ideology, and a host of Worldly, Vox\'s podcast on
covering foreign policy and international relations. June 12, 2018; "How
Trump is killing America's alliances"; *Vox*;

//CYang

Thankfully, those predictions turned out to be wrong. There are multiple
reasons for that, but one big one --- one that also helped keep
relations between other historical enemies, like South Korea and Japan,
peaceful --- is a shared participation in US alliance networks. The
[[US]{.mark} serves as [the **ultimate security
blanket**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[preventing]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[countries from having to build]{.mark} up their own [armaments
and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [risk a [replay]{.mark} of
**[W]{.mark}**orld **[W]{.mark}**ar **[I]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But
[[if American alliance commitments become]{.underline}]{.mark} and
remain [[less credible]{.underline}]{.mark}, it's possible [[this
order]{.underline}]{.mark} could **[[crack]{.underline}]{.mark}** up.
America's partners aren't ~~stupid~~. They understand that Trump is the
product of deep forces in American politics, and that his victory might
not be a one-off. If they think that this won't be the last "America
First" president in modern history, depending on America the way that
they have in the past could quickly become a nightmare. The worst-case
[[scenarios]{.mark} for]{.underline} a [collapse in the US alliance
system are **terrible**]{.underline}. Imagine [[full **Japanese** and
**German** rearmament]{.underline}]{.mark}, alongside [**[rapid-fire
prolif]{.mark}eration** [of **nuclear weapons**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Imagine a [[crack-up]{.mark} of [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
[[European powers at loggerheads]{.underline}]{.mark} while
[[Russia]{.underline} [**gobbles up** the Baltic
s]{.underline}]{.mark}[tates [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the rest of
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. Imagine [[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea's
**historical [tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with Japan
**reigniting**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} a [[war between
those two]{.mark} countries]{.underline} or any combination of them
[[and China]{.underline}]{.mark}. All of this seems impossible to
imagine now, almost absurd. And indeed, in the short run, it is. There
is no risk --- zero --- of American allies turning on each other in the
foreseeable future. And it's possible that the next president after
Trump could reassure American allies that nothing like this could ever
happen again. But the truth is that there's just no way to know. [When a
**fundamental force** for world peace starts to **weaken**]{.underline},
[no one can really be sure]{.underline} how well the system will hold
up.

The [[spread of nuclear weapons poses]{.underline}]{.mark} at least six
[[**severe threats** to **international**]{.mark} **peace** and
[security]{.mark} including]{.underline}: [[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}, [nuclear [terror]{.mark}ism]{.underline},
[global and regional [instability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [constrained US
freedom of action]{.underline}, [weakened alliances]{.underline}, [and
**[further]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}. Each
of these threats has received extensive treatment elsewhere and this
review is not intended to replicate or even necessarily to improve upon
these previous efforts. Rather the goals of this section are more
modest: to usefully bring together and recap the many reasons why we
should be pessimistic about the likely consequences of nuclear
proliferation. Many of these threats will be illuminated with a
discussion of a case of much contemporary concern: Iran's advanced
nuclear program.

Nuclear War

The [**greatest threat** posed by]{.underline} the [spread of nuclear
weapons is **nuclear war**]{.underline}. [[The more states in possession
of nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
[greater]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[probability]{.underline}]{.mark}
that somewhere, someday, [[there will be]{.mark} a **catastrophic
[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To date, nuclear weapons have only been used in warfare once. In 1945,
the United States used nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts point to the
65-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that nuclear
weapons are unusable, but it would be [naïve to think]{.underline} that
[nuclear weapons will **never be used** again]{.underline} simply
because they have not been used for some time. After all, analysts in
the 1990s argued that worldwide economic downturns like the Great
Depression were a thing of the past, only to be surprised by the dot-com
bubble bursting later in the decade and the Great Recession of the late
2000s.48 This author, for one, would be surprised if nuclear weapons are
not used again sometime in his lifetime.

[[Before]{.underline}]{.mark} reaching a state of
[[MAD]{.underline}]{.mark}, [new [nuclear states go
through]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**[transition]{.mark} period** [in which
they lack]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**secure-[second strike]{.mark}**
capability]{.underline}. In this context, [one or both
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} might [believe]{.underline} that [it
has]{.underline} an [[incentive]{.mark} [to **use**]{.mark} **nuclear
weapons [first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, if Iran acquires
nuclear weapons, [neither]{.underline} Iran, nor its [nuclear-armed
rival]{.underline}, Israel, will [have]{.underline} a
[secure]{.underline}, [second-strike capability]{.underline}. Even
though it is believed to have a large arsenal, given its small size and
lack of strategic depth, Israel might not be confident that it could
absorb a nuclear strike and respond with a devastating counterstrike.
Similarly, Iran might eventually be able to build a large and survivable
nuclear arsenal, but, when it first crosses the nuclear threshold,
Tehran will have a small and vulnerable nuclear force.

In these pre-MAD situations, there are at least three ways that nuclear
war could occur. First, the [[state]{.mark} with]{.underline} the
[nuclear advantage might [believe it has]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**splendid [first strike]{.mark}** [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
a crisis, [Israel]{.underline} might, therefore, [decide to
[launch]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[preventive]{.mark} nuclear
[strike]{.mark} to disarm **Iran's nuclear capabilities**]{.underline}.
Indeed, this incentive might be further increased by Israel's aggressive
strategic culture that emphasizes preemptive action. Second, the [[state
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a [small and [vulnerable]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this case Iran, might [[feel **use
them or lose them**]{.mark} pressures]{.underline}. That is, in a
crisis, Iran might [decide to strike first rather than risk having its
**entire nuclear arsenal** destroyed]{.underline}. Third, as Thomas
Schelling has argued, [nuclear war]{.underline} could [result due to the
[**reciprocal fear** of **surprise attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}.49 If
there are advantages to striking first, one state might start a nuclear
war in the belief that war is inevitable and that it would be better to
go first than to go second. Fortunately, there is no historic evidence
of this dynamic occurring in a nuclear context, but it is still
possible. In an Israeli--Iranian crisis, for example, Israel and Iran
might both prefer to avoid a nuclear war, but decide to strike first
rather than suffer a devastating first attack from an opponent.

[[Even in]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[world of
[MAD]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, when both sides have secure,
second-strike capabilities, [[there is still]{.mark} a [risk of nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rational deterrence theory assumes
nuclear-armed states are governed by rational leaders who would not
intentionally launch a ~~suicidal~~ nuclear war. This assumption appears
to have applied to past and current nuclear powers, but there is [[no
guarantee]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[it will]{.mark} **continue to
[hold]{.mark}** in the future]{.underline}. Iran's theocratic
government, despite its inflammatory rhetoric, has followed a fairly
pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it contains leaders who hold
millenarian religious worldviews and could one day ascend to power. [We
cannot rule out]{.underline} the [possibility]{.underline} that, [as
nuclear weapons continue to spread]{.underline}, [some
leader]{.underline} somewhere [will choose to **launch a nuclear
war**]{.underline}, knowing full well that it could result in
self-destruction.

One does [[not]{.mark} need to resort to
**[irrational]{.mark}ity**]{.underline}, however, [to imagine nuclear
war under MAD]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons may deter leaders from
intentionally launching full-scale wars, but they do not mean the end of
international politics. As was discussed above, [nuclear-armed
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[have conflicts of interest]{.mark}
and leaders]{.underline} still [seek to coerce nuclear-armed
adversaries]{.underline}. [Leaders]{.underline} might, therefore, choose
to [[launch]{.mark} a [limited nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}.50 This
strategy might be [**especially attractive** to states in]{.underline} a
[position of **conventional inferiority** that]{.underline} might
[have]{.underline} an [incentive to [escalate]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**crisis [quickly]{.mark}** to the nuclear level]{.underline}. During
the Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear weapons first to
stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's conventional
inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has deteriorated since the
end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more heavily on nuclear
weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, [Russian strategy calls
for]{.underline} the [use of nuclear weapons **early** in a
conflict]{.underline} (something that most Western strategists would
consider to be escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a crisis. Similarly,
[Pakistan's military plans for nuclear use in]{.underline} the [event
of]{.underline} an [invasion from]{.underline} conventionally stronger
[India]{.underline}. And finally, [Chinese generals openly talk
about]{.underline} the [possibility of **nuclear use** against a **US
superpower**]{.underline} in a possible East Asia contingency.

Second, as was also discussed above, [leaders]{.underline} can [make
a]{.underline} '[threat that leaves something to chance]{.underline}'.52
They can initiate a nuclear crisis. By [[playing]{.mark} these **risky
[games]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **nuclear
[brinkmanship]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [states]{.underline} can
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[risk of nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark} in an attempt to force a less resolved
adversary to back down. Historical crises have not resulted in nuclear
war, but many of them, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, have
come close. And scholars have documented historical incidents when
accidents nearly led to war.53 [When we think about [future]{.mark}
**nuclear crisis [dyads]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as Iran and Israel,
[[with fewer sources of stability]{.underline}]{.mark} than existed
during the Cold War, we can see that there is a [real risk]{.underline}
that a [fut[ure crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[result in]{.mark} a
**[devastating nuclear exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 2NC --- Credibility Theory

#### Security guarantees solve.

**Bleek & Lorber '14** --- Philipp C. Bleek, Nonproliferation and
Terrorism Studies Professor at the Middlebury Institute of International
Studies. Eric B. Lorber, Political Science PhD at Duke University,
Adjunct Fellow at the Center for a New American Security. 2014;
"Security Guarantees and Allied Nuclear Proliferation"; *The Journal of
Conflict Resolution*, Special Issue: Nuclear Posture, Nonproliferation
Policy, and the Spread of Nuclear Weapons; Accessed Online via
University of Michigan Libraries; //CYang

**[[Multivariate Analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**

We present [both]{.underline} \"**[core]{.underline}**\"
[and]{.underline} \"**[fully specified]{.underline}**\"
[models]{.underline} to [shed light on the relationship between security
guarantees and proliferation behavior while [controlling]{.mark} for a
**range of [variables]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Table 2 presents our core
models.

[[Security guarantees are **statistically significant** and negative for
**all**]{.mark} **three [stages of prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline};
[we can be **[highly confident]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[states
receiving security guarantees]{.mark} are [less likely to
**explore**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[pursue]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and **acquire** nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The other results are unsurprising. Economic and nuclear capacity are
significantly and positively associated with all the three stages of
proliferation. Conventional threat is significantly and positively
linked to both exploration and pursuit, though not acquisition. The
latter is puzzling, but the more fully specified model reported later,
as well as almost all the additional models we ran as robustness checks,
found conventional threat to be robustly and positively linked to
acquisition. Nuclear threat is significantly and positively linked to
exploration, but has no relationship to pursuit and acquisition,
consistent with Bleek\'s (2010) previously reported findings employing a
different model but contra conventional wisdom about \"reactive
proliferation\" dynamics.

Prior studies have incorporated other potentially relevant variables,
and the fully specified model in Table 3 includes an array of these.
Despite the large number of variables, the core result on security
guarantees remains robust, although as expected the large number of
variables reduces statistical significance across the board.

Table 3, Fully Specified Multivariate Hazard Modeling Results, omitted.

With regard to the core control variables, economic capacity is no
longer statistically significant for explore or pursue, though still
significantly and positively correlated with exploration and
acquisition. And dropping a few of the variables that are never
significant for any stage of proliferation behavior restores the highly
significant and positive relationship at the pursue stage without
meaningfully affecting the results for other variables. Nuclear capacity
remains significant at explore and pursue, albeit no longer at acquire.
Like economic capacity, dropping a few variables that are never
significant for any stage of proliferation behavior restores the
statistically significant and positive correlation at the acquire stage.
Conventional threat is no longer statistically significant for explore,
but is highly significant for both pursue and acquire. Nuclear threat
yields the same results as the core models at reduced statistical
significance.

As for the new variables, sensitive nuclear assistance is statistically
significant for explore but not for pursue, and, more importantly,
acquire. Since states presumably seek sensitive assistance because they
are interested in exploring and pursuing nuclear weapons, the
relationship at the explore stage is unsurprising. The lack of
relationships at the pursue and acquire stages runs contra Kroenig \'s
(2009b) reported findings. Civil nuclear assistance is never significant
for any stage of proliferation, contra Fuhrmann (2009).

NPT ratification is significantly and negatively linked to all stages of
proliferation behavior, as expected. Because most states presumably join
the NPT because they do not intend to proliferate, this is unsurprising
and sheds limited light on whether the NPT curbs proliferation, although
it is not inconsistent with that argument. 20 The proportion of states
in the international system that have ratified the NPT has no
relationship to whether states engage in any stage of proliferation
behavior, although given likely nonlinear effects, these results are a
poor basis for dismissing the treaty \'s importance.

Intuitively, major powers are more likely to pursue and acquire nuclear
weapons, though no more or less likely to explore them. Regional powers
are more likely to explore and acquire, but no more or less likely to
pursue nuclear weapons. Democracies are neither more nor less likely to
engage in any level of proliferation behavior. And neither states \'
openness to the international economy, nor changes in it, have any
relationship to any level of proliferation behavior, contra Solingen\'s
(1994, 2007) arguments.

[By [including **so many variables**]{.mark}]{.underline}, we [[stacked
the deck against]{.mark} **reaching [statistical
significance]{.mark}**]{.underline} on any. The [[**continued
robustness** of]{.underline}]{.mark} our [**core [results]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} regard to [security guarantees]{.mark}]{.underline}
therefore [[inspires **confidence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the
variables testing arguments advanced by Kroenig (2009b, 20 10), Fuhrmann
(2009), Solingen (1994, 2007), and with regard to the NPT and democracy,
which fail to reach statistical significance, even more trimmed models,
not reported here, yield little additional support.

Assessing Substantive Effects

Unlike more conventional regression approaches, magnitude cannot be
directly interpreted from the coefficients in hazard analysis. We
calculate hazard ratios for our core models and observe that the
[[relationship]{.mark} between security guarantees and proliferation is
**not only statistically significant** but [also **substantively
large**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [States receiving security
guarantees]{.underline} from nuclear-armed superpower allies are [only
**[22 percent]{.mark} as likely** [to explore]{.mark} nuclear
weapons]{.underline} as those who do not, [**[13 percent]{.mark} as
likely** [to pursue]{.mark} them]{.underline}, [and **[15
percent]{.mark} as likely** [to acquire]{.mark} them]{.underline} in a
given year, conditional on their not having done so previously.

Robustness Checks

We subjected our analysis to a variety of robustness checks, some
already mentioned. Detailed results are reported in the Supplemental
Appendix, and in all cases supported our findings on security guarantees
unless otherwise mentioned. We substituted a rudimentary industrial
capacity variable for the at least partially endogenous nuclear
capability variable. We allowed all nuclear-armed states, not merely
superpowers, to extend security guarantees. We extended security
guarantees to the Latin American countries that had a defense pact with
the United States ending in 1945. We recoded the United States-South
Korean alliance relationship as a defense pact. We
[[reran]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[models using]{.mark} a variable based
on]{.underline} the **[[ATOP]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than COW
codings and, in this case, found that security guarantees narrowly
missed statistical significance at the pursuit stage, though they were
still significant and negative for both explore and acquire. We
truncated our analysis to begin in 1945, the first year in which it was
possible to extend nuclear security guarantees. We truncated our risk
pool by dropping all country-years in which the level of economic
capacity was lower than that of Pakistan in 1972, the year it initiated
its nuclear weapons program. We substituted Singh and Way\'s (2004)
dependent variable codings for ours. We [reran]{.underline} our [models
using the **[Cox semiparametric]{.mark} approach**]{.underline} rather
than the Weibull one. Following Jo and Gartzke (2007), we censored the
pursuit and acquisition models, so that only states that had previously
explored or pursued nuclear weapons were in the risk pool for potential
pursuit or acquisition. Given the small number of states that have
proliferated, for a number of models this proved too restrictive for
hazard analysis. For the \"core\" models, censoring for either prior
exploration or pursuit led all independent variables except economic
capacity to no longer be significant, including security guarantees. 2 1
For the \"fully specified\" models, censoring for prior exploration in
the pursuit model yielded broadly consistent results, including on
security guarantees. Censoring for prior exploration yielded broadly
consistent results for the acquisition model, while censoring for prior
pursuit led the model not to complete. Finally, we [**systematically
[dropped]{.mark}** [variables]{.mark}]{.underline}, one at a time,
[[based on **p values**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the pursue model.
[[Of]{.mark} the resulting **[thirty-six]{.mark} multivariate
[models]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is, twelve sets of models for each
of the three stages of proliferation behavior, [[all **robustly
supported**]{.mark} the [results]{.mark}]{.underline} reported earlier
with regard to security guarantees.

Nuclear Terrorism

The [[spread of nuclear weapons]{.mark} also
[increases]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk of **nuclear
terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}.54 While September 11th was one of the
greatest tragedies in American history, it would have been much worse
had Osama Bin Laden possessed nuclear weapons. Bin Laden declared it a
'religious duty' for Al- Qa'eda to acquire nuclear weapons and radical
clerics have issued fatwas declaring it permissible to use nuclear
weapons in Jihad against the West.55 [Unlike states]{.underline}, which
can be more easily deterred, [there is **little doubt**]{.underline}
that [[if terrorists acquired nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[they **would use** them]{.underline}]{.mark}.56 Indeed, in recent
years, many US politicians and security analysts have argued that
[nuclear terrorism [poses the **greatest threat** to US]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}.57

[[Analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[pointed out]{.underline}]{.mark}
the tremendous [[hurdles]{.underline}]{.mark} that [terrorists would
have to overcome]{.underline} in order to acquire nuclear weapons.58
[[Nevertheless]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as nuclear weapons
spread]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[possibility]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} will eventually [[fall into terrorist hands
**increases**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[States]{.underline}]{.mark} could
[**[intentionally transfer]{.mark}** nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**fissile
[material]{.mark}** required]{.underline} to build them, to terrorist
groups. There are good reasons why a state might be reluctant to
transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, as nuclear weapons spread,
the probability that a leader might someday purposely arm a terrorist
group increases. Some fear, for example, that Iran, with its close ties
to Hamas and Hizballah, might be at a heightened risk of transferring
nuclear weapons to terrorists. Moreover, [even if no state would **ever
intentionally transfer** nuclear capabilities to
terrorists]{.underline}, a [[new nuclear state]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[with **underdeveloped**]{.mark} **security
[procedures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, might be [[vulnerable to
theft]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[allowing terrorist]{.mark} group[s]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} corrupt]{.underline} or [**ideologically-motivated
[insiders]{.mark}** [to transfer]{.mark} **dangerous [material]{.mark}**
to terrorists]{.underline}. There is [[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark},
for example, that representatives [[from Pakistan]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
atomic energy establishment met with Al-Qa'eda members to discuss a
possible nuclear deal.59

Finally, a [nuclear-armed [state]{.mark} could
**[collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[result]{.mark}ing
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} a breakdown of law and order and a [[loose
nukes]{.underline}]{.mark} problem. US officials are currently very
concerned about what would happen to Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the
government were to fall. [[As nuclear weapons
spread]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[this problem is]{.mark} **only further
[amplified]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Iran is a country with a history of
revolutions and a government with a tenuous hold on power. The [regime
change]{.underline} that Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran
[could]{.underline} actually [become a **nightmare**]{.underline} if a
nuclear-armed Iran suffered a breakdown in authority, forcing us to
worry about the fate of Iran's nuclear arsenal.

need to fear direct military attack from other states, but
[[states]{.mark} with nuclear weapons]{.underline} can be

disloyalty]{.underline} can damage, or even [destroy]{.underline},
[alliances]{.underline} with other states. Because of this belief in
interdependence --- that developments in one alliance will also affect
other alliances --- the desire to demonstrate loyalty has exercised a
tremendous influence on U.S. policy. But is indiscriminate loyalty what
allies want? The First [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait Crisis]{.underline}
(1954--55) case study [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[allies do
not desire]{.mark} U.S. [loyalty in **all
situations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, they want the \[US\] United
States to be a reliable ally, posing no risk of abandonment or
entrapment. [In the]{.underline} First [Taiwan Strait

[U.S. [loyalty]{.mark} to the Republic of China
[increased]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk of]{.mark} **unwanted
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and as the crisis persisted, these
allies sought to restrain the United States and thus reduce the
likelihood of war. Although U.S. leaders were reluctant to coerce the
Republic of China into backing down during this territorial dispute with
the People\'s Republic of China, other [U.S. [allies **actively
encouraged**]{.mark}]{.underline} such
[[disloyalty]{.underline}]{.mark}. These findings have significance for
theories of alliance politics and international reputation, as well as
contemporary alliance management.

Introduction

Do states judge their ally\'s behavior toward its other allies? If yes,
how? Historically, decisionmakers have instinctively adopted deterrence
theory\'s logic that a state\'s character is judged through displays of
innate loyalty: if a state is disloyal to one ally, then this will
create a reputation for disloyalty, which will cause other allies to
doubt the state\'s reliability. Thus, disloyalty can have calamitous
consequences: the aggrieved ally will punish the betrayal; other allies
will suffer crises of faith; and adversaries will conclude that the
state\'s alliances are cheap talk. The logic is that discrete alliance
commitments are interdependent---that what happens in one alliance
affects the expectations of other allies---and that this interdependence
is underpinned by demonstrations of loyalty. President Lyndon Johnson
said that if the United States were "driven from the field in Viet-nam,
then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in American
promise or in American protection."1

These convictions regularly animate contemporary debates: Nancy Bernkopf
Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue that if the United States were to abandon
Taiwan in a conflict with China, this could deal "a fatal blow to the
U.S.-Japan alliance" and might lead to South Korea "renouncing its
security alliance with Washington and aligning with Beijing."2 Aaron
Friedberg writes that expecting a U.S. "back down ... \[and\] a Chinese
victory over Taiwan ... to leave America\'s Asian alliances unscathed,
is to indulge in wishful thinking of the most dangerous kind."3 Others
suggest cross-regional effects, claiming that by "retreating from the
Middle East and abandoning Ukraine to Russian aggression," President
Barack Obama left "America\'s Asian allies ... bewildered and
alienated."4 If alliance interdependence exists, and is governed by
innate loyalty, then fighting for reputation is crucial, because any
single alliance rift could quickly tear asunder other alliance
relationships.

Some scholars, described as "reputation skeptics," dispute this common
wisdom. Skeptics argue that because "[[reputation]{.mark} is [in the
**eye of the beholder**]{.mark}]{.underline}," the [United States should
**never** regard demonstrating loyalty as sufficient grounds for
military action]{.underline}.5 Jonathan Mercer argues that [when
[allies]{.mark} observe the **U**nited **S**tates demonstrating
loyalty]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} will [[attribute]{.mark} this
**desired [behavior]{.mark}** [to **situational causes**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [will [not conclude]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [it will be loyal in **[future crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
contrast, he concludes that [[when]{.mark} the **U**nited **S**tates is
[disloyal]{.mark}]{.underline}, this [[undesired
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} will be [[attributed to **national
character**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [but]{.underline} will
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} always [[cause allies to expect **similar
behavior** in the future]{.underline}]{.mark}.6 Reputation skeptics
believe that "[leaders are **tragically mistaken**]{.underline} when
they commit to the use of force in the expectation of long-term benefits
beyond any gains in the immediate dispute."7

### 1NC --- AT: Assurance --- Offense

#### The nuclear umbrella is [unsustainable]{.underline} and fails to prevent proliferation or solve deterrence.

Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard University.
March 23, 2021; \"It's Time to Fold America's Nuclear Umbrella\";
*Foreign Policy*;
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/23/its-time-to-fold-americas-nuclear-umbrella/>;
//CYang

Why is this statement so intriguing? Because it shows the authors of
this report recognize that [[Europe]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline}
might be [[**more secure** if it]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[rely on a
**local**]{.mark}**ly based [deterrent]{.mark}** [instead
of]{.mark}]{.underline} continuing to shelter under [[the U.S. nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}]{.mark}. And if that is true for the nations of
Europe, then it might well be [true for others]{.underline}. Although
the report's authors are opposed to new states joining the nuclear club
(Britain and France are already members), their statement clearly
implies that [deterrence]{.underline} would be [strengthened if states
facing **serious external threats** had a nuclear guarantee that didn't
depend on **Uncle Sam**]{.underline}.

This is hardly a new issue. Since fairly early in the nuclear age, the
United States has used nuclear weapons to "extend deterrence" and shield
some of its allies. It sought to convince potential adversaries that the
United States might use its formidable nuclear arsenal if these allies
were attacked, even if the United States was not. Of course, there was
always some chance that a war involving one of the United States' allies
might escalate to the nuclear level, either by accident, through
inadvertence, or via deliberate decision, no matter what U.S. leaders
said in advance. Even so, Washington went to considerable lengths to
make its nuclear umbrella credible, partly to discourage enemies from
attacking but also to convince its allies not to get nuclear weapons
themselves.

Accordingly, U.S. leaders made lots of public statements linking the
U.S. arsenal to its core alliance commitments, and NATO drew up various
plans and doctrinal pronouncements designed to reinforce perceptions of
a reliable U.S. guarantee. The United States also deployed thousands of
warheads on some of its allies' territory, along with dual-key
arrangements that gave those allies some say in how, when, or if these
fearsome weapons got used. Lastly, and very importantly, the United
States kept trying to achieve a meaningful degree of nuclear superiority
to make a possible first use of nuclear weapons to defend allies more
credible. Instead of acquiring a "minimum deterrent" (i.e., retaliatory
forces that could survive any possible attack and then inflict
unacceptable damage on an aggressor), U.S. war plans and weapons
decisions always focused on trying to come out on top in the awful event
of an actual nuclear war.

Why did the United States do this? In good part because convincing
people you might use nuclear weapons to defend an ally isn't easy. One
might imagine a U.S. president using nuclear weapons to retaliate
against a direct attack on U.S. territory or to deter the extremely
unlikely prospect of a conventional invasion that threatened U.S.
independence. This is the one thing nuclear weapons are good for:
deterring existential threats to their possessors' independence or
autonomy. This form of deterrence (sometimes termed "basic" or "Type I")
works because the deterring side will almost certainly care more about
preserving its own independence than a potential attacker is likely to
care about trying to take it away. Because the balance of resolve favors
the defender, even much weaker nuclear powers can deter enemies from
attacking them directly. If you don't find this argument persuasive,
remember the U.S. attacked non-nuclear Iraq in 2003 and non-nuclear
Libya in 2011, but it leaves nuclear-armed North Korea alone.

By contrast, [[deterring]{.underline}]{.mark} a conventional or a
[nuclear attack on an ally [by threatening]{.mark} to go
[nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and convincing your allies that you
really mean it --- [[is]{.mark} **more
[challenging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is one thing to threaten to use
nuclear weapons to keep one's own country from being subjugated but
quite another to do so to save an ally from defeat or domination. Or, as
people used to wonder back in the Cold War, [[would]{.mark} a U.S.
[president]{.mark} really [risk Washington]{.mark} or Chicago [to save
Paris]{.mark} or Berlin]{.underline}? Long after they had left office, a
few former U.S. officials suggested the [answer was]{.underline} almost
**[[certainly]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Extended deterrence could still work because potential attackers can't
be sure about any of this, but it still [[isn't]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[**[credible]{.mark}** as deterring attacks]{.underline} on one's own
territory.

The [[solution to this conundrum]{.underline}]{.mark} --- if one can
call it that --- [[is]{.mark} to achieve
**[overwhelming]{.mark}**]{.underline} "**[[nuclear
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**." If you could wipe out an
adversary's entire nuclear force in a first strike, you wouldn't have to
fear its retaliation, and using nuclear weapons to defend an ally would
be much more credible. Even if a splendid first strike were not
possible, perhaps you could convince a potential attacker that it will
end up even worse off than you are at the end of a nuclear war to
convince it not to put so much as a toe on the first rung of the
escalation ladder.

Thus, the perceived need to extend deterrence is one of the reasons why
the United States has long sought nuclear superiority. It's not the only
reason: A genuine first strike capability could limit damage in the
event of an actual war. A few commentators have also tried to argue ---
not very convincingly --- that superiority would enable the stronger
side to coerce weaker states in crises. Chasing the holy grail of a
first-strike advantage was also popular with defense contractors and
parts of the armed services because it requires spending billions of
dollars annually on more and more accurate weapons, more efficient and
destructive warheads, improved surveillance and anti-submarine warfare
capabilities, and lots of other shiny objects.

Interestingly, a number of sophisticated [scholars]{.underline} have
[recently claimed]{.underline} that [technological advances]{.underline}
have [put the United States on the brink of]{.underline} a [true
**first-strike capability**]{.underline}. [Perhaps in
theory]{.underline}, [but **certainly not**]{.underline} as a
[usable]{.underline} option. To see why, ask yourself what you would do
if you were president and facing a serious crisis with a nuclear-armed
adversary. You've put the armed services on alert, and there is some
danger that force might be used and fighting could escalate. Suppose
your military advisors and intelligence experts tell you if you order a
first strike now, you can almost certainly destroy the enemy's entire
nuclear arsenal, leaving the United States unscathed and in an ideal
position to resolve the dispute on favorable terms.

Being a sensible person, you'd undoubtedly ask them: "Can you guarantee
that? Are you absolutely, 100 percent sure the enemy will have zero
usable weapons left, and therefore, we won't even get our hair mussed?"

"We are highly confident of success," you are told. "But there is a slim
chance that a few enemy weapons would survive and reach U.S. soil. No
more than one to three."

Even if you weren't troubled by the moral issues involved in ordering an
[attack that would kill **untold numbers** of people]{.underline} (and
you ought to be), would you do it? Of course you wouldn't, because you
[wouldn't]{.underline} want to [risk]{.underline} losing [New
York]{.underline}, [Los Angeles]{.underline}, [Chicago]{.underline},
[Boston]{.underline}, [or any other]{.underline} major [U.S.
city]{.underline}, which is what might happen if that first strike you
authorized turned out to be just a tiny bit less effective than your
advisors predicted. To issue a launch order, you'd have to believe the
proposed attack would work perfectly the very first time it was executed
(simulations and exercises aren't the same), almost all of the missiles
and bombs that have been sitting in silos or storage facilities for
years would work as designed, and the other side wouldn't have dispersed
its own forces or hidden some extra weapons in places you had failed to
detect. Based on everything the United States' knows about complex
military operations and the limits of intelligence, [you'd be a
[**fool** to **roll the dice**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this way.

One more thing: [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} first-strike [[capabilities
improve]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[respond by keeping forces on **higher alert**]{.mark} or
adopting]{.underline}
"[**[l]{.mark}**aunch-**[o]{.mark}**n-**[w]{.mark}**arning]{.underline}"
[procedures that [increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk of
**accidental** or **inadvertent** war]{.underline}]{.mark}. No matter
what U.S. forces are capable of in theory, in short, it's hard to see
how any president would be willing to use nukes first even if the
probability of "success" was extremely high. This reality casts further
doubt on the whole idea of extended deterrence, insofar as it is based
on the threat to deliberately escalate to the nuclear level if a key
ally is in danger of being conquered.

Extending a protective umbrella over allies in Europe and Asia may have
made good sense during the Cold War, both to protect them and to
discourage proliferation. But the [**[nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[environment]{.mark}** [has changed]{.mark}]{.underline}: The number of
nuclear-armed states has crept upward, and several countries (India,
Pakistan, and the United Kingdom) are increasing the size of their own
arsenals (though they remain far lower than U.S. or Russian levels).
Moreover, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is [not]{.mark}
as **tightly [coupled]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} some of its]{.underline}
traditional [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} as it was during the Cold War,
[and serious [rifts]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[continue to grow]{.mark}
despite]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration's [efforts
to restore **alliance solidarity**]{.underline} and reassert U.S.
leadership.

Which raises the obvious question: Does it still make sense to shield
allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella? [[Using]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[threat of nuclear use to protect other countries]{.mark} is not cost-
or risk-free]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it may even be [**[more
dangerous]{.mark}** [than letting]{.mark}]{.underline} some [other
[states acquire **arsenals of their own**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
encouraging them to rely on "Type I" deterrence provided by their own
national capabilities.

This view has been advanced before --- most notably by Kenneth Waltz in
a controversial Adelphi Paper 40 years ago. Waltz was not advocating
giving other states the bomb or arguing that the rapid spread of nuclear
weapons would be desirable; his central point was that trying to prevent
the slow spread of these weapons was not without costs of its own and
that in some cases, as he put it, "more may be better." The question is:
Is that becoming the case today?

To be sure, folding the nuclear umbrella might well have some negative
effects. It might make states long accustomed to U.S. protection
question its commitment (though there's no logical reason for them to do
so if it is still in the United States' interest to aid their defense in
other ways). It could also reduce U.S. influence or leverage if certain
allies were no longer as dependent on U.S. protection, though folding
the umbrella would not eliminate their reliance on other elements of
U.S. power. Removing the U.S. nuclear guarantee might encourage a few
states to pursue nuclear arms of their own, but it is not obvious that
acquisition by Japan or Germany would be a terrible outcome from a
purely U.S. perspective.

Moreover, even the possibility that these states might take over
responsibility for deterring attacks on their own territory could have a
sobering effect on a rising China and a recalcitrant Russia. In
particular, it would remind Beijing and Moscow that their own behavior
will affect the strategic calculations that their neighbors make in the
near future, including decisions about nuclear arms. If China doesn't
want to face more nuclear weapons states in its immediate region, for
instance, then its leaders should start asking themselves what they can
do to make those neighbors feel less need for additional protection. The
obvious answer: Stop harassing them in various ways, drop the
sharp-elbowed approach to diplomacy, stick to agreements previously
reached, and do more to resolve existing disputes on a fair-minded
basis.

Whatever Washington ultimately chooses to do with its nuclear umbrella,
the [[more important]{.mark} task is [to **move
beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[tendency to see nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s as]{.mark} **potent [signs]{.mark}** [of
status]{.mark}]{.underline}, [indispensable tools of
statecraft]{.underline}, [or **powerful sources** of
leverage]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons are extremely useful for
deterring direct and all-out attacks on one's own homeland but not much
else. For that purpose, a great power doesn't need an enormous arsenal
or some hypothetical capability to "fight and win" a nuclear exchange.
All it needs is a stockpile that can survive an enemy attack and be able
to respond in kind. Properly concealed or protected, they don't need to
be poised and ready to strike at a moment's notice. [**[Fetishizing the
bomb]{.mark}** and using it to try to protect others is]{.underline}n't
just expensive; it may also be [dangerous]{.underline}.

make]{.underline} a [moral case against]{.underline} the [current grand
strategy]{.underline}. But they share a common claim: that the United
States would be better off if it dramatically reduced its global
military footprint and security commitments. 

[This is [a **false promise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for a number of
reasons. First, [retrenchment]{.underline} would [[worsen]{.mark}
regional [security competition in **Europe** and
**Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The realists recognize that the [U.S.
military presence in Europe and Asia]{.underline} does [dampen
**security competition**]{.underline}, but they claim that it does so
at [too high a
price](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/restraint-new-foundation-us-grand-strategy)
--- and one that, at any rate, should be paid by U.S. allies in the
regions themselves. Although pulling back [would invite regional
**security competition**]{.underline}, realist retrenchers admit, the
United States could be safer in a more dangerous world because regional
rivals would check one another. This is a perilous gambit, however,
because [[regional conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} often [end up
implicating U.S. interests]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} might thus
[end up [draw]{.mark}ing [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[back in]{.mark}]{.underline} after it has left --- [resulting in a
**much more dangerous** venture than heading off]{.underline} the
[conflict in the first place]{.underline} by staying. Realist
retrenchment reveals a hubris that the United States can control
consequences and prevent crises from erupting into war. 

The progressives' view of regional security is similarly flawed. These
retrenchers reject the idea that regional security competition will
intensify if the United States leaves. In fact, they argue, U.S.
alliances often promote competition, as in the Middle East, where U.S.
support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has emboldened
those countries in their cold war with Iran. But this logic does not
apply to Europe or Asia, where U.S. allies have behaved responsibly. A
U.S. [[pullback]{.underline}]{.mark} from those places is more likely to
[[embolden]{.mark} the **regional powers**]{.underline}. Since 2008,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[invaded]{.underline}](https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine) two
of its [neighbors that are not **members of NATO**]{.underline}, [and if
the [Baltic]{.mark} states were no longer protected by]{.underline} a
[U.S. security guarantee]{.underline}, it is [conceivable]{.underline}
that [Russia would [test the boundaries]{.mark} with gray-zone
warfare]{.underline}. [[In East Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [U.S.
withdrawal]{.underline} would force [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} to
increase its defense capabilities and change its constitution to enable
it to compete with [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} on its own, [straining
relations with **[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}.

The [second problem]{.underline} with retrenchment [involves **nuclear
[prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}. If the United States pulled out
of NATO or ended its alliance with Japan, as many realist advocates of
retrenchment recommend, some of its [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[no
longer protected by the U.S. **nuclear umbrella**]{.underline}]{.mark},
would be [[tempted to acquire nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} of their own. Unlike the progressives for
retrenchment, the realists are comfortable with that result, since they
see deterrence as a stabilizing force. Most Americans are not so
sanguine, and rightly so. There are good reasons to worry about [nuclear
proliferation](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-10-15/do-nuclear-weapons-matter):
[nuclear materials]{.underline} could [[end up in]{.mark} the [hands of
**terrorists**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[states with less
experience]{.underline}]{.mark} might be [[more prone to]{.mark}
**nuclear [accidents]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} nuclear
powers in **close proximity** have **[shorter response times]{.mark}**
and]{.underline} thus [conflicts]{.underline} among them [[have]{.mark}
a [**greater chance** of spiraling]{.mark} into escalation]{.underline}.

Third, [retrenchment]{.underline} would [[heighten **nationalism** and
**xenophobia**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In Europe]{.underline}, a [U.S.
withdrawal]{.underline} would [[send]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[message]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[every country]{.mark} must **[fend
for itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It would therefore
[empower]{.underline} the [far-right groups]{.underline} already making
this claim --- such as the [[Alternative for
Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[League in
Italy]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the [[National Front in
France]{.underline}]{.mark} --- while undermining the centrist
democratic leaders there who told their populations that they could rely
on the United States and NATO. As a result, [Washington]{.underline}
would [[lose]{.mark} leverage over]{.underline} the [domestic politics
of **individual allies**]{.underline}, [particularly]{.underline}
younger and more [**[fragile democracies]{.mark}** such as
Poland]{.underline}. And since these nationalist populist groups are
almost always protectionist, retrenchment would damage U.S. economic
interests, as well. Even more alarming, many of the [right-wing
nationalists]{.underline} that retrenchment would empower have [called
for **greater accommodation** of China and Russia]{.underline}.

A fourth problem concerns regional stability after global retrenchment.
The [most likely end state is
a **[s]{.mark}**pheres-**[o]{.mark}**f-**[i]{.mark}**nfluence system]{.underline},
[whereby China and Russia dominate their neighbors]{.underline}, but
[such an order is **inherently [unstable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[lines of demarcation]{.underline} for such spheres tend to be
[unclear]{.underline}, [and there is no guarantee]{.underline} that
[[China and Russia]{.mark} will not seek to **[move]{.mark} them
[outward]{.mark}**]{.underline} over time. Moreover, the United States
cannot simply grant other major powers a sphere of influence --- the
countries that would fall into those realms have agency, too. If the
United States
ceded [Taiwan](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2019-02-15/will-china-seize-taiwan) to
China, for example, the Taiwanese people could say no. The current U.S.
policy toward the country is working and may be sustainable. Withdrawing
support from [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} against its will [would
plunge **cross-strait relations** into [chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
entire idea of letting regional powers have their own spheres of
influence [has an imperial air]{.underline} that is [at odds with modern
principles of sovereignty and **i**nternational **law**]{.underline}.

A fifth problem with [[retrenchment]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it
[[lacks **domestic support**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The American people
may favor greater burden sharing, but there is no evidence that they are
onboard with a withdrawal from Europe and Asia. As a survey conducted in
2019 by the [Chicago Council on Global
Affairs](https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/publication/rejecting-retreat) found,
seven out of ten [Americans believe]{.underline} that [maintaining
military superiority makes the **U**nited **S**tates safer]{.underline},
and almost three-quarters think that alliances contribute to U.S.
security. A 2019 [Eurasia Group Foundation
poll](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/9QHRCwpR0mHqMQmCVthSz?domain=egfound.org) found
that over 60 percent of Americans want to maintain or increase defense
spending. As it became apparent that China and Russia would benefit from
this shift toward retrenchment, and as the United States' democratic
allies objected to its withdrawal, the [**[domestic]{.mark} political
[backlash]{.mark}** would grow]{.underline}. One
[[result]{.underline}]{.mark} could be a [[prolonged foreign policy
debate that]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[cause the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [to **oscillate** between retrenchment and
reengagement]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [creating
**uncertainty**]{.underline}]{.mark} [about]{.underline} its
[commitments [and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[raising the risk of
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation** by Washington]{.underline}, [its
allies]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} its [rivals]{.underline}.

[Realist and progressive retrenchers]{.underline} like to
[argue]{.underline} that the [architects of the United States' postwar
foreign policy]{.underline} naively [sought to remake the world in its
image]{.underline}. But [[the **real revisionists** are those who argue
for **retrenchment**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a [**geopolitical
experiment** of unprecedented scale]{.mark} in modern
history]{.underline}. If this camp were to have its way, [Europe and
Asia]{.underline} --- two stable, peaceful, and prosperous regions that
form the two main pillars of the U.S.-led order --- [would be [plunged
into]{.mark} an **era of [uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} of this sort [have been a [staple of
**hard-line**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and [especially
**[neocon]{.mark}servative**]{.underline})
[[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} [for decades]{.underline}. Like the
domino theory, which refuses to die no matter how often it is disproved,
such [claims transform]{.underline} the [outcome of a single conflict
into]{.underline} a [struggle for]{.underline} the [fate of the **entire
planet**]{.underline}. The choice we are said to face is stark. Down one
path: a revitalized liberal order led by a unified alliance of powerful,
peace-loving democracies, and a future where war is rare and prosperity
reigns. Down the other path: a world of rising autocracy, eroding human
rights, and more war. According to this view, Ukraine must win big, or
all is lost.

Framing the issue in this way [[stacks the deck in favor of **always
doing more**]{.mark} and rejecting any]{.underline} sort of
[compromise]{.underline}, but is the choice as stark as hard-liners make
out? [[Does defeating an aggressor]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[teach
others to **behave**]{.mark} **better**]{.underline}? It would be a more
benign world if this were the case, but a quick glance at the [past
[century]{.mark}]{.underline} or so [[suggests
**otherwise**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Start with World War I. Although all the major European powers played a
role in the outbreak of war, Germany was the driving force during the
July Crisis of 1914. Overly fearful of rising Russian power, German
leaders used the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
and the confrontation between Austria-Hungary and Serbia as the occasion
for a preventive war for hegemony in Europe. The result was four
horrific years of war, a total German defeat at the hands of the Allies,
the end of the Hohenzollern monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian and
Ottoman allies, and the imposition of a highly punitive peace treaty.

The [**stark reality** of Germany's **[W]{.mark}**orld **[W]{.mark}**ar
**[I]{.mark}** defeat [didn't teach]{.mark}]{.underline} Adolf [[Hitler
not to make his]{.mark} own [bid for]{.mark} **European
[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline} 20 years later; indeed, the
[[myth]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Germany]{.mark} had been [stabbed in
the back]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [**harsh peace** imposed at
Versailles]{.underline} helped [[fuel]{.mark} the [rise of **Nazism**
and set the stage for]{.mark}]{.underline} another round of
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Nor]{.underline}]{.mark} did the carnage
of the First World War [teach **Imperial [Japan]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that [trying to carve out its]{.underline} own [empire in Asia was a
**bad idea**]{.underline}.

The chief aggressors were also soundly punished in World War II. Japan
was firebombed repeatedly, and two of its cities were destroyed by
atomic bombs; Germany was occupied and subsequently divided into two
separate states; and Hitler and Italian leader Benito Mussolini both
ended up dead. A clearer demonstration that "aggression does not pay"
would be hard to imagine, and a good case can be made that both Germany
and Japan learned that lesson well. But this [lesson [didn't stop
Kim]{.mark} Il Sung]{.underline} from [attacking South Korea [in
1950]{.mark}]{.underline} ([with]{.underline} Joseph
**[[Stalin's]{.mark} full support]{.underline}**) [or convince various
leaders]{.underline} elsewhere [in [Asia or the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} that [going to [war was]{.mark} **always
[unwise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Similarly, one might have thought the French and American experiences in
[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark} would [offer a vivid and **enduring
reminder** of]{.underline} the [[dangers of **hubris**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[limits of]{.mark} military
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, not to mention the futility of trying to
nation-build in a deeply divided society without a competent local
partner. Yet the George W. Bush administration paid no heed to this
lesson when it invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.

Mind you, it's not just great powers that get taught harsh lessons after
launching an aggressive war. Back in 1982, Argentina's military junta
decided that the British Falkland Islands (which they call the Malvinas)
were theirs and decided to take the territory by force. Britain sank the
flagship of the Argentine navy and successfully retook the islands, and
popular protests in Argentina eventually swept the generals from power.

Iraq's Saddam Hussein eventually suffered a similar fate. His decision
to attack revolutionary Iran in 1980 led to nearly eight years of war in
which hundreds of thousands of Iraqis lost their lives and Iraq's
economy cratered. Two years later, he decided to solve the economic
problems the first war had created by seizing neighboring Kuwait, only
to be ignominiously expelled by a U.S.-led coalition and placed under
highly intrusive United Nations sanctions. Aggression didn't pay in
either case, but Saddam's failures didn't stop some other countries ---
including some prominent democracies --- from starting new wars
themselves.

[[If]{.mark} **painful [defeats]{.mark}** [really sent]{.mark} **clear
[warnings]{.mark}**]{.underline} to others, the [Soviet and American
experiences in [Afghanistan]{.mark} and]{.underline} the U.S. experience
in [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} after 2003 [[would have taught
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} and his associates that [invading
[Ukraine]{.mark} was [likely to trigger]{.mark} a **[powerful]{.mark}
nationalist [reaction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and encourage outside
powers to do what they could to thwart his aims. Surely he knew that the
United States had helped defeat the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan by
supplying the mujahideen, just as Syria and Iran had each helped the
Iraqi insurgents defeat the U.S. effort in Iraq. The
[lesson]{.underline} of these two conflicts [[seems]{.mark} **all too
[obvious]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} seems
to have [[convinced himself it **didn't apply**]{.mark} to
Ukraine]{.underline}.

Not every aggressive war ends in defeat, of course, but there seems to
be no shortage of cases where aggressors were badly beaten and more than
a few where the people who started the war paid a large personal price
for their folly. Yet the lesson that "[[aggression does not
pay]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[**ignored** or **forgotten**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Why?

One reason is that the lessons of any given war aren't always clear-cut,
and reasonable people can draw different conclusions from a defeat. Was
going to war a bad idea from the start, or was defeat due to poor
implementation or just bad luck? The lessons from a failed war will also
be discarded if [policymakers [believe that this time is
**different**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that [new
knowledge]{.underline}, [new technology]{.underline}, a [clever new
strategy]{.underline}, or a **[uniquely favorable]{.underline}** set of
[political circumstances]{.underline} will bring success this time
around. One should never underestimate what [elites]{.underline} can
[[talk themselves into]{.underline}]{.mark} if they really want to go to
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Leaders may be intimately familiar with their own national histories,
but they know and care less about what happened to other nations in
similar circumstances.

A second problem --- one highlighted in the work of the late scholar
Robert Jervis --- is that humans tend to place more weight on their own
experiences than on the experiences of others. Leaders in one country
may be intimately familiar with their own national history (though they
have probably absorbed a self-serving version of it), but they will know
and care less about what happened to other nations in similar
circumstances.

And it's [easy to dismiss]{.underline} another country's [failure by
claiming]{.underline} their [cause was not as just]{.underline}, their
[resolve not as great]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} their [military
not as competent]{.underline} as one's own. Moreover, because decisions
for war typically reflect a complex weighing of threats, opportunities,
expected costs, and alternatives, what happened to another country in a
wholly different conflict may not loom large in their calculations.

Furthermore, [leaders who start wars]{.underline} are often [aware that
there are **risks involved**]{.underline}, and they sometimes recognize
that the odds of victory are slim. Even so, [they will]{.underline}
"**[roll the iron dice]{.underline}**" if they believe the alternative
is even worse. To take an obvious example, Japan's leaders in 1941
understood that the United States was vastly stronger and that attacking
[[Pearl Harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} was a huge gamble that would
probably fail. Nonetheless, they believed the alternative was bowing to
U.S. pressure and giving up their quest for great-power status and Asian
dominance --- an outcome they regarded as infinitely worse.

The bottom line is that [U.S. policymakers should [not]{.mark}
base]{.underline} their [actions today on]{.underline} the [belief that
victory in [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} (or
[[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} or [[Ethiopia]{.underline}]{.mark} or
[[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}) is [[going to tilt]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**arc of [history]{.mark}** [decisively]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
directions they favor. [[Nor will]{.underline}]{.mark} the [outcome of
[today's]{.mark} conflicts [have]{.mark}]{.underline} much [[effect on
how future leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} think about their own prospects
when they are [**[deciding]{.mark} whether** [to launch a
war]{.mark}]{.underline}.
