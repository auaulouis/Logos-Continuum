WASHINGTON --- NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Tuesday that
[the world's most powerful military alliance reached a deal to **admit
Sweden and Finland** after resolving the concerns of holdout
**Turkey**]{.underline}.

[The three countries]{.underline}' foreign ministers [signed a
memorandum to **confirm that Turkey will back Sw**eden and Fin**land**'s
NATO bids]{.underline} during a summit in Madrid this week, Finnish
President Sauli Niinisto said in a statement.

"[Our joint memorandum underscores the commitment of Finland, Sweden and
Turkey to extend their full support against threats to each other's
security]{.underline}," the Finnish leader said.

"Us becoming NATO allies will further strengthen this commitment," he
added.

The push to add Sweden and Finland to NATO comes as Russia's assault on
Ukraine stokes fears of other countries in the region. Moscow, long wary
of NATO expansion, has opposed the two nations' plans to join the
alliance.

**[Previously]{.underline}**, Turkish President Recep Tayyip
[**Erdogan** said he **would not approve** the
applications]{.underline}, **[citing]{.underline}** their support for
Kurdish organizations that Turkey considers **[security
threats]{.underline}**.

[All 30 NATO members must approve]{.underline} a country's bid for it to
be accepted into the alliance.

Last week, Stoltenberg told reporters that he was working to add Finland
and Sweden to NATO "as soon as possible." He said it will "make them
safer, NATO stronger and the Euro-Atlantic area more secure."

"We are now working actively on the next steps in the accession process
of both Finland and Sweden. And addressing Turkey's security concerns,
including in the fight against terrorism," Stoltenberg said during a
discussion hosted by Politico.

#### Many thumpers to Erdogan PC -- Ongoing Finanical Crisis, Dependence on Chinese Imports and Russia Gas, Russia-Ukraine war, looming conflict with the US over Sryia

With [**general elections** scheduled for June **2023**]{.underline},
the [Turkish public will have its biggest opportunity]{.underline} since
[2018 to set the course for their domestic and foreign
policies]{.underline}. [The election comes at an **unsettled time for
Turkish foreign policy**]{.underline}. [Turkey's **ongoing financial
crisis**]{.underline} has [made it more dependent on Chinese imports and
Russian gas]{.underline}. The [**Russia-Ukraine war** has increased
concerns about Russia among the Turkish public]{.underline}, but the
[recent spat with NATO and a **looming conflict with the US over** a
possible Turkish offensive in **Syria**]{.underline} could limit how
much Turkish views of NATO and the West improve.

Keen observers of Turkish politics will know that negative Turkish views
of the United States, NATO, and the EU are, to an extent, nothing new.
What is new is the emergence of Russia and China as a viable foreign
policy alternative within the Turkish public consciousness. With
[significant numbers of Turks unsatisfied with the state of their
Western foreign alliances]{.underline} and general elections coming up
next year, whether more Turks will favor a reorientation eastward is
something to watch.

### 1AR -- AT: Election Ploy

#### This card flows aff -- proves no link because security cooperation with NATO caused a RISE in PC for Erdogan -- nowhere does it mention anti-NATO rhetoric

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was staunch in his demands of
Sweden and Finland, which centered on their relationships with groups
that Turkey's government deems a terrorist threat.

[What is a **big win for NATO** is also a **victory for
Erdogan**]{.underline}, analysts say, and one that [the president needed
in order to shore up **domestic support**]{.underline} as his economy
flounders and Turks struggle with inflation that's exceeded 70%.

"[Win all around]{.underline}, apart from Putin who is the big loser in
all this," Timothy Ash, an emerging markets strategist at Bluebay Asset
Management, wrote in a note Wednesday. "[Good decision by Erdogan. He
takes some **political capital** into elections."]{.underline}

"[He negotiated hard]{.underline}, right up to the last minute[, and got
real wins with assurances" on **security issues** and likely on more
military equipment from the U.S]{.underline}., Ash wrote. "He had his
call with Biden and will get his one-on-one with Biden at Madrid. He
comes back in from the cold with the West."

[Turkey 'got what it wanted']{.underline}

[The breakthrough with Turkey]{.underline} followed four hours of talks
and weeks of deliberations and debate, [culminating in a trilateral
agreement between Turkey, Sweden and Finland]{.underline}. The agreement
involved the Nordic countries lifting arms embargoes they had previously
imposed on Turkey, toughening their laws against Kurdish militant
activists that Ankara deems to be terrorists, and addressing Turkish
extradition requests for suspected Kurdish fighters.

#### This card flows aff -- it only talks about NATO members hating Erdogan, not voters -- if the neg ev is right that an anti-NATO rhetoric gains PC for Erdogan, than the Swinland deal was good

In the weeks and months ahead, Erdogan will talk up his success in Spain
as he ratchets up his re-election campaign. With less than a year to go
before he faces an electorate in severe economic distress, the president
will take any opportunity for chest-thumping he can get.

But Turks paying close attention to the 11th-hour machinations in Madrid
will know Erdogan gained very little --- and may have lost a lot. If he
got a few talking points for his campaign speeches, the president gave
up a chance to return Turkey to the high table of international affairs.

He could have played it differently. Instead of holding up Sweden and
Finland, Erdogan might have used his status as NATO's longest-serving
leader to be the statesman at a time of strife. His views about the
crisis growing along NATO's eastern borders, with the war in Ukraine and
anxiety in the Baltics, would have been especially valuable because he
enjoys a closer relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin than
anybody else in the alliance.

Instead, [his gamesmanship confirmed Erdogan's **reputation within
NATO** as a spoiler who pursues personal advantage above the collective
good. When Sweden and Finland join the alliance, the list of members
with bitter experience of his self-serving opportunism will grow by two.
The **others**, **already angered** by his making common cause with
Putin and compromising the security of the group as a whole by
purchasing Russian missile-defense systems, won't forget that when a
major crisis confronted them all, **Erdogan chose to play parochial
politics**.]{.underline}
