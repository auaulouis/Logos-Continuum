### SC =/= frameworks

#### Security cooperation activities are conducted THROUGH frameworks

**CRS 16** (Congressional Research Service, informing the legislative
debate since 1914, "DOD Security Cooperation: An Overview of Authorities
and Issues", 8/23/16,
<https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R44602.html>) // EL

This report provides a general overview of current DOD Title 10
authorities to assist foreign governments, militaries, security forces,
and populations funded by the DOD budget. [It presents background
information on the evolving DOD security cooperation mission and the
recent development of the **statutory framework through which DOD
conducts security cooperation activities**. It provides summary
overviews of nine categories of security cooperation assistance and
activities, including the amounts of congressionally authorized funding,
where available, and any legislatively required State Department
input.]{.underline} It discusses recent issues related to the
development, implementation, sustainment, and coordination of security
cooperation to support continuing congressional oversight. Two tables in
the appendix provide information on current Title 10 security
cooperation authorities. The first catalogs current security cooperation
authorities, noting legislative mandates for State Department input and
notification and reporting requirements. The second provides a snapshot
of authorized and/or appropriated funding levels for select security
cooperation authorities.

### SC -- Includes Training and Interoperability

#### SC includes arms sales, training and exercises, interoperability, and sovereign defense capabilities

Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, and the

**[US security cooperation historically encompasses facilitating arms
sales, staging military training and exercises, developing
interoperability among allies and partners, and bolstering the sovereign
defense capabilities of security partners]{.underline}**. All these
efforts need to continue at a deliberate pace---but in a post-Cold War
world, the United States no longer has a monopoly on arms sales with an
overt technological advantage in all areas.

### SC -- Broader than DoD

#### SC is a community of branches not just a single branch or organization AND includes the DoS

The Security Cooperation Community

[This appendix describes some of the significant organizations within
the security cooperation community and explains their responsibilities
with regard to security cooperation]{.underline}. It supplements the
description of the security cooperation community in Chapter Two but is
still only a partial rendering of those organizations that at various
times contribute to the DoD's conduct of security cooperation.
Understanding organizations' general roles and functions within the
community is important for understanding the competencies members
require in order to perform their functions. To recapitulate, [the
security cooperation community is]{.underline}

[a subset of U.S government Executive Branch entities within the
security cooperation enterprise directly responsible for managing or
executing security cooperation programs or the policies that affect
those programs]{.underline} (DoD, 2016, p. 9).

Overall, [the goals of security cooperation community are]{.underline}

[to build defense relationships that promote specific US security
interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
selfdefense and multinational operations]{.underline}, and provide US
forces with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation (Joint
Chiefs of Staff, 2016, p. 9).

**[No single organization has primary responsibility for attaining these
objectives or concentrates exclusively on one aspect of security
cooperation]{.underline}**. Rather, [security cooperation is a
capability that combatant commanders and U.S. embassies employ to
further other U.S]{.underline} objectives, and is supported by
capabilities in DoD components developed primarily to support the
development and maintenance of U.S. military capabilities and capacity.
To the extent that organizations and capabilities devoted primarily to
security cooperation exist, they are constituted primarily to facilitate
the leveraging of other U.S. military capabilities.

Within that general framework, org[anizations in the security
cooperation community fall into one of four broad categories described
briefly below and in greater detail in succeeding sections]{.underline}
(see Figure A.1):

- [Enterprise management]{.underline} (in the yellow box) [organizations
  provide strategy and policy guidance and oversight to multiple
  security cooperation programs]{.underline}; they are responsible for
  integrating efforts from different U.S. and foreign stakeholders to
  achieve U.S. strategic goals.

- [Implementing agencies]{.underline} (in the dark green box) [ensure
  that individual programs are properly resourced and executed in
  accordance with policy guidance]{.underline}.

- [Relationship management]{.underline} (in the light green box)
  [organizations are responsible for translating strategy into action in
  specific countries and regions]{.underline}. They help initiate, plan,
  and facilitate security cooperation program activities involving U.S.
  and partner nation officials. It should be noted that these
  organizations also have a profound role in the development of strategy
  with respect to the country or region with which they are associated.

- [Execution]{.underline} (in the light brown box) elements [carry out
  program activities with partner-nation counterparts at the behest of
  higherlevel components of the community]{.underline}. For the most
  part, [execution elements are not dedicated security cooperation
  assets but are operating force units or elements from organizations in
  the DoD infrastructure employed in support of security cooperation
  activities]{.underline}.

Yet while organizations may fall primarily into one of these four
categories, members of their workforce do not align exclusively with
these functions. For example, [security cooperation offices have
individuals with primary responsibility for international training
manage]{.underline} - \[Image inserted\]

[ment and finance]{.underline}. Officials in implementing agencies
maintain direct lines of contact with customers in partner nations, as
do officials in organizations with a primary focus on enterprise
management. The major salient characteristic of the security cooperation
community is that it is complex, with diffuse authorities and
responsibilities. [Its success depends on the ability of officials to
work across organizational and functional boundaries to achieve the
larger goals of U.S. strategy.]{.underline}

### SC -- Includes the DHS

#### The DHS can increase SC on cyber -- empirics

**DHS 22** \[The United States Department of Homeland Security is the
U.S. federal executive department responsible for public security;
"**[DHS to Increase Security Cooperation with Israel through New
Arrangements]{.underline}**"; 3/3/22;

//CH

WASHINGTON -- [This week, Department of Homeland Security]{.underline}
(DHS) [Under Secretary for Policy Robert Silvers visited Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv, Israel to sign security agreements with the Government of
Israel, engage with key Israeli government and private sector partners
on a range of joint security issues]{.underline}, and deliver keynote
remarks on DHS cybersecurity priorities at the CyberTech Global
Conference.

"[DHS is proud to continue to strengthen the bilateral relationship
between the United States and Israel through new security
arrangements]{.underline}," said DHS Under Secretary for Policy Robert
Silvers. "[The arrangements signed this week between our Department and
the Government of Israel underscore that Israel is a critical partner in
advancing a broad range of international technology and security
priorities]{.underline}."

[Under Secretary Silvers and Israel National Cyber
Directorate]{.underline} (INCD) [Director General Gaby Portnoy issued a
Joint Statement of Intent that reflects a shared commitment between the
two agencies to work together to combat ransomware, bolster cooperative
research and development, strengthen critical infrastructure
cybersecurity, increase resilience to cyber threats, and pursue expert
exchanges in the area of emerging technology]{.underline}.

[Building on the long-standing relationship between DHS and
INCD]{.underline}, Under Secretary Silvers and Director Portnoy signed
an arrangement with Israel's Ministry of Public Security for INCD to
join the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development
Homeland Security Program, which will facilitate cyber-related research
and development to enhance both countries' resilience to evolving
threats. [They also signed a Memorandum of Understanding to further the
joint work between INCD and DHS's Transportation Security
Administration]{.underline} (TSA) [to advance cybersecurity cooperation
in the aviation, maritime, mass transit, freight and passenger rail, and
oil and natural gas sectors]{.underline}.

### SC -- Not OHDACA

#### SC is distinct from actions under OHDACA

**Defense 18** \[The Office of the Secretary of Defense is a
headquarters-level staff of the United States Department of Defense;

//CH

[DoD provides a range of humanitarian activities funded by the Overseas
Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA) appropriation, from
foreign disaster relief operations authorized by the Secretary of
Defense to GCC security cooperation efforts]{.underline}. Although
**[the purpose of foreign disaster relief operations is not security
cooperation]{.underline}**, the byproduct often strengthens existing
bilateral security relationships and provides a bridge to new partners.
Steady-state [humanitarian assistance]{.underline} (HA) [includes
activities designed to relieve or reduce endemic conditions such as
human suffering, disease, hunger, and privation. HA may also bolster a
host nation's capacity to reduce the risk of, prepare for, mitigate the
consequences of, or respond to humanitarian disasters.]{.underline}

### SC -- Yes OHDACA

#### OHDACA is part of security cooperation AND is part of the DoD

**DSCA 20** \[The Defense Security Cooperation Agency is a part of the
United States Department of Defense; "C12 - Overseas Humanitarian,
Disaster, and Civic Aid (OHDACA)"; Last Cited 2020 (10 U.S.C. 2561, 2020

C12.1. - Overview

C12.1.1. General. [The DoD conducts HA to relieve or reduce endemic
conditions such as human suffering, disease, hunger, privation, and the
adverse effects of unexploded explosive ordnance]{.underline} (UXO),
[particularly in regions where humanitarian needs may pose major
challenges to stability, prosperity, and respect for universal
human]{.underline} values. The OHDACA appropriation funds DoD HA
activities that build the capacity of a partner nation (PN) government
to provide essential humanitarian services to the civilian population
and supports PN efforts to reduce the risk of, prepare for, and respond
to humanitarian disasters thereby **[OHDACA-funded programs offer a
unique security cooperation tool]{.underline}** reducing reliance on
international disaster relief assistance. When authorized, OHDACA funds
are used to conduct FDR activities. [OHDACA-funded programs offer a
unique security cooperation tool for Combatant Commands]{.underline}
(CCMDs) [to gain access, visibility, and influence within their regions
and achieve theater and U.S. national security objectives]{.underline}.

### Cybersecurity -- Cyber Threats

#### Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems from cyberthreats

**[Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as
hardware, software and data from cyberthreats]{.underline}**. The
practice is [used by individuals and enterprises to protect against
unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized
systems]{.underline}.

[A strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture
against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or
extort an organization\'s or user\'s systems and sensitive data.
Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks that aim to
disable or disrupt a system\'s or device\'s operations.]{.underline}

Why is cybersecurity important?

With an increasing number of users, devices and programs in the modern
enterprise, combined with the increased deluge of data \-- much of which
is sensitive or confidential \-- the importance of cybersecurity
continues to grow. The growing volume and sophistication of cyber
attackers and attack techniques compound the problem even further.

[What are the elements of cybersecurity]{.underline} and how does it
work?

[The cybersecurity field can be broken down into several different
sections, the coordination of which within the organization is crucial
to the success of a cybersecurity program]{.underline}. These sections
include the following:

- [Application security]{.underline}

- [Information or data security]{.underline}

- [Network security]{.underline}

- [Disaster recovery/business continuity planning]{.underline}

- [Operational security]{.underline}

- [Cloud security]{.underline}

- [Critical infrastructure security]{.underline}

- [Physical security]{.underline}

- [End-user education]{.underline}
