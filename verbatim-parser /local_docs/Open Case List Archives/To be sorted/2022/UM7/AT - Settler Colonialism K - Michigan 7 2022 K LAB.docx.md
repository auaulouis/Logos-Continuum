Indigenous Engagement with 'Space' \[image omitted\] \"River of Souls\"
by Carl Gawboy (as published in Indian Country Today, 4/2/16) I want to
now turn our attention towards the possibilities that exist regarding
Indigenous engagement with outer space. After all, the timing could not
be more urgent to do so---we are now at a point where after generations
and generations of building the myth that America was built out of
nothing, we are now ready to resume the project of extending the reach
of American military and economic might in space. To be fair, there are
plenty of advances that can be made scientifically with a renewed focus
on space exploration. However, history shows us that [[space exploration
has been historically tied to military hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark},
and there is nothing in Mr. Trump's temperament or attitude towards a
re-engagement with space that suggest that his push toward the stars
will be anything different. A sustained conversation needs to be
had---will this exploration be ethical and beneficial to all Americans?
One potential avenue of [[Indigenous involvement comes through the
active involvement of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous perspectives in
space exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course. This involvement can
be possible through viewing outer space through a 'decolonial' lens, for
instance. [Astronomers]{.underline} such as Prescod-Weinstein and
Walkowicz [have spoken about the need to [avoid replicating colonial
frameworks of occupation and use of space]{.mark}]{.underline} when
exploring places such as Mars, for example (Mandelbaum, 2018). The rise
of logics of resource extraction in outer-space bodies have led to
engagements by other academics such as Alice Gorman on the agency and
personhood of the Moon. Collaborations between Indigenous people and
space agencies such as NASA help provide the Indigenous perspective
inside space exploration and the information that is gleaned from it,
with implications both in space and on a Earth that is dealing with
climate crisis (Bean, 2018; Bartels, 2019). Another potential avenue of
engagement with Indigenous methodologies and epistemologies related to
space comes with engaging with Indigenous thinkers who are already
deeply immersed into explorations of Indigenous 'space' here on
Earth---the recent works of Indigenous thinkers such as Waziyatawin
(2008) Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (2017), Natchee Blu Barnd (2018) and
others provide a unique viewpoint into the ways that Indigenous peoples
make and remake space---perhaps this can provide another blueprint for
how we might engage with space beyond Earth. And that is just the work
that exists within the academic canon. [In[digenous people have always
been engaged with the worlds beyond the Earth, in ways that often stood
counter to accepted 'settler' conventions of space exploration]{.mark}
(Young, 1987). In one example, when asked about the Moon landings,
several Inuit said, \"We didn\'t know this was the first time you white
people had been to the moon. Our shamans have been going for
years.]{.underline} They go all the time\...We do go to visit the moon
and moon people all the time. The issue is not whether we go to visit
our relatives, but how we treat them and their homeland when we go
(Young, 1987: 272)." In another example, turning to my own people[, the
Ojibwe, we have long standing cultural connections to the stars that
influence storytelling, governance, and religious tenets]{.underline}
(CHIN, 2003). This engagement continues through to the present day, and
points to a promising future. [A new generation of Indigenous artists,
filmmakers, and writers are beginning to create works that place the
Indigenous individual themselves into narratives of space travel and
futurity, unsettling existing settler notions of what our future in
space might look like]{.underline}. As Leo Cornum (2015) writes,
"[[Outer space, perhaps because of its appeal to our sense of endless
possibility, has become the imaginative site for re-envisioning how
black, indigenous and other oppressed people can relate to each other
outside of and despite the colonial gaze]{.mark}."]{.underline} \[image

examples should serve as a reminder that the historical underpinnings of
our great national myth are built upon shaky intellectual ground---we
need to be honest about this. America did not just spring forth out of
nothing; it came from the brutal occupation and control of Native lands.
Despite the best efforts of the settler state, Native people are still
here, we still exist and make vital contributions to both our tribal
communities and science. We cannot expect Donald Trump to turn his back
on the national myth of what made the United States the United
States---in his mind, this is the glorious history of what made America
great in the past. And it should serve as no surprise that Trump and
others wish to extend this history into outer space. Even when Trump's
days in the White House are over[, [the settler colonial logics that
underpin our engagement with land on Earth will still loom large over
the ways that we may]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[engage with
outer space]{.mark}.]{.underline} But for those of us who do work in
Indigenous geographies and Indigenous studies, [it becomes even more
vital that we heed the calls of Indigenous thinkers inside and outside
formal academic structures, validate Indigenous histories, and push to
deconstruct the American settler myth and to provide a new way of
looking at the stars, especially at a crucial moment where the settler
state turns its gaze towards the same.]{.underline} \[i\] While this
essay focuses on an American context, I highly recommend reading Alice
Gorman's piece "The cultural landscape of interplanetary space" for some
examples outside of the United States, such as the British/Australian
Woomera rocket range and its effects upon Aboriginal peoples.

#### Settler colonialism is an [essentialist framework]{.underline} -- in its desire to simplify the Native/Settler binary, it reproduces [epistemological whiteness]{.underline} and undermines Indigenous knowledge

**Andersen 9** (Chris, Associate Professor of Native Studies at Alberta,
"critical indigenous studies From Difference to Density", Cultural
Studies Review, Vol. 15 No 2 2009, pg. 80-100) //Don Markos

**[Champagne's abstraction]{.underline}**, imprecision and internal
contradictions **[make it difficult to produce definitive conclusions
about his work]{.underline}**. However, **[Indigeneity-as-different
constitutes a major staple of his argument and even a sympathetic
reading requires some agility to avoid the essentialism which grounds
it.]{.underline}** My point is this: Champagne's argument that the
'**[continued [emphasis on ho]{.mark}w race and [ethnic identity in
mainstream institutions]{.mark} tends to overshadow the less well
understood perspectives of an Indigenous paradigm [grounded in the
cultures]{.mark}, sovereignty, identities, land, and nation building [of
indigenous peoples'42]{.mark} [loses its relevance if it fails to
include a precise explanation of what the]{.mark} latter [terms
mean]{.mark} and how they differ from 'race' and 'ethnic
identity'.]{.underline}** **[His repeated [failure to delineate them
leaves little analytical purchase to deal with the complexities of being
Indigenous]{.mark} in modern, Western societies, either with respect to
how we identify ourselves, how we critique dominant, whitestream
representations or how we employ Western discursive authorities in our
daily struggles]{.underline}**. For example, **[Champagne proposes
that]{.underline}** '\[i\]mproving existing theories or categorizations
\[of Western disciplines\] will involve significant revision, and it is
doubtful that existing theories can conceptualize or explain the
cultural, land, self-government, and col- onial histories of Indigenous
nations';^43^ and further, that '**[[most]{.mark} current [theories do
not provide powerful enough tools for explaining the Indigenous
experience]{.mark}']{.underline}**.^44^ **[One of many questions which
arise from such statements]{.underline}**, of course, **[is the extent
to which Indigenous studies]{.underline}**---which must necessarily
**[place itself within the same academic relations of power that shape
'Western' disciplines]{.underline}**---**[can under any circumstances
cash the kind of cheque Champagne is writing on its
behalf]{.underline}** (more on this in part three). Of more immediate
concern: **[given that [Native studies must operate within the forms of
power and]{.mark} associated [conditions of possibility]{.mark} that
characterise other academic disciplines, what allows it to step outside
in ways the other disciplines cannot? For Champagne]{.underline}**, it
is our valorisation of Indigenous epistemologies. Given the centrality
of his criticism of Western concepts, his positioning of their central
terms deserves to be quoted in their full length, pre- cisely because
they explicate the conceptual bases from which he launches his critique
of Western disciplines: race: 'Race and critical race theories focus on
marginalization of socially conceived racial groups and provide
critiques of dominant group methods of oppression and control \...
**[[the focus of race and critical race theories tends to assume
achievement of equality and inclusion into US
society]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a primary goal.

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40 But my unease was also emerging from
something else, which is what I want to focus on in this article: the
problem that encounters and conflicts are yet again made sense of within
overarching structures of knowledge production rather than cultivation
(despite the intention to do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes
clear in the quotation above, what is encountered as "different" is
inevitably described "in forms that I could understand" (my
emphasis)---even whilst simultaneously recognising that one's
description does not capture what the encountered practices actually do.
Sense-making, for de la Cadena, takes place at what could be called two
levels: At a first level, there is the inevitable process of making
sense of an alienating affective experience on the spot, from within
one's own framework of understanding the world. At a second level, then,
de la Cadena attempts to make legible her grappling and
not-understanding in the context of a book for an academically literate
and interested audience---in other words, in the writing-up of her
ethnographic research. In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given
that their articles do not aim to make an empirical contribution,
sense-making takes place at what could be called a third level: what is
drawn upon is the understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic
work of others, which is brought into conversation with various bodies
of theoretical work in order to make a conceptual contribution. This
takes place via the coining of central concepts and the outlining of
all-encompassing frameworks that are meant to help us understand the
analytical, normative and political consequences of their argument for
scholarly work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are
used to delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR
and beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place. [This is]{.underline} also [the problem
of some **central decolonial work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard
Glissant, Mignolo, for example, critiques the "requirement of
transparency" that forms the basis for understanding in Western social
science scholarship. He argues for [the "**right to opacity**" of those
located on the **other side of the colonial difference**]{.underline}.41
But this claim sits at odds with his simultaneous desire to write a new,
all-encompassing history of "the modern/colonial world system". 42 And
like in Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's articles, terms such as
"pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44 [are coined in order to have a
(**one!**) concept for a **similarly all-encompassing solution** to
domination]{.underline}. While de la Cadena is critical of her own
"anxiety to understand coherently (with which I meant clearly and
without contradiction"), and while she points out how [this]{.underline}
"was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well as Rojas and Blaney and
Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such [anxiety in **yet another
coherent framework** that **holds everything together**]{.underline}.
The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46 But as I have already indicated in relation to de la
Cadena's work, when writing up their research for academic purposes,
even those who have directly experienced ontological encounters find it
hard to resist the tendency to conclude their work with stringent,
overarching, coherent conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can
grasp and "take home". In the next section, I will draw on two
anthropological ethnographic texts that are significant for research on
the GMO controversy to show how this works. The two texts that will be
analysed in the next section engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay
and Mexico respectively, and they have stood out for me in the way they
manage to convey a sense of unease and grappling with ontological
encounters and conflicts. However, as the next section will show, they
as well end up providing a framework and conclusions that can
accommodate and make sense of the encountered ontological difference. 3.
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy According to Susana
Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research that is carried out
in relation to the question of what smallholder producers in the Global
South truly think of (and say about) agricultural biotechnology is
unable to grasp the "ontological incompatibility" that exists between
the experienced human/nonhuman relations in small-scale agriculture on
the one hand, and the logic that underlies genetic engineering (GE) on
the other.47 This is precisely because most social research is itself
grounded in the crucial modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the
former can only be known through scientific means, while the latter can
be known through the study of social/cultural/political practices.
Knowledge about nature is about establishing "facts", which are either
true or false (i.e. nature as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly
represented), while knowledge about culture is about studying meaning,
which is necessarily (due to the existence of different cultures)
multiple. The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual"
danger consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences,
which therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are
made about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else: Until this point,
I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion with and about
humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was with what Antonio
said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing at the beans, and
I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying that this was a
figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even to claim that
this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly framed 'la soja
mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather than analysis
itself worthy of response.50 However, Hetherington points out that not
believing in the truth of the killer bean did not prevent him from
"participating in Antonio's knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved
in the anti-soy bean activism of the peasants, Hetherington became "part
of the situation" that made the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in
a court case that was brought against two soy farmers for the murder of
two activist peasants. As a result, killer beans became transformed into
a matter of national concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation
involved more than joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief:
it led to him becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and
beans that started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's
words, he indeed became "partially connected": 52 Beans didn't scare me
at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation that gives rise to
killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of soy were a familiar,
even a comforting sight. But it took only a few months with Antonio for
me to start feeling the menace from those fields. Soon, the sweetish
smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and especially the corpselike
smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin my appetite and make me
expect to see people emerge from their homes to show me pustules on
their legs and stomachs.53 Similar observations are also found in
Carro-Ripalda and Astier's contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and
Human Values symposium on the challenges of making smallholder producer
voices being heard in relation to agricultural biotechnology.54 While
most of the contributions to the symposium concentrate on how to tease
out smallholders' "real" voices in the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda
and Astier critically reflect on their own perceived failure to become
knowledgeable about smallholders' voices in their research on GM maize
cultivation in Mexico. It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural
areas in Central Mexico, in-depth structured interviews, focus groups,
participant observation and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City
with over 50 stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the
actual voices of peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55
However, particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create
conditions under which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on
their own terms about GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the
conditions of exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56
The public discourse that centres on questions of safety, science,
possibilities of regulation and problems of potential contamination, and
which is upheld by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists,
dominated the workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised
different concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main
ones, as if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all".
The way that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas,
and desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57 Carro-Ripalda and Astier
are focused on the dominance of one particular (techno-scientific,
regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled smallholder voices
engaged in different discourses from speaking up or, when speaking, from
being heard. In other words, smallholders were unable to adequately
represent their own understanding of what is at stake in the GM maize
controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have pointed out in the
previous section, based on Rojas, difference is thereby transformed into
an epistemological, rather than an ontological one: Carro-Ripalda and
Astier's argument is implicitly based on the assumption that, under the
right conditions, difference can be translated into something that can
be communicated to, and discussed with, other stakeholders. But the term
"ontological incompatibility" that the authors themselves use indicates
there is something else at play, which cannot easily be translated: the
nature of the relation of smallholder producers to their "land, seed,
crop, climate ... as told and understood by themselves"; the "central
place" that Maize continues to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic
cosmology, and "the social and cultural significance" that goes along
with that.58 Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the
dominant discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination
this discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the
Mexican agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to
understand what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is
about. At the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers
whom they have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable:
at stake for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their
lives as maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge,
and their ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access
to their 'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional'
ways of agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort. Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
article is meant to render legible their own encounter of ontological
difference for an academic audience. Is it possible for the reader to
dig below these representational strategies, and to relate more directly
to their encounter of what they themselves call ontological
incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their final workshop,
in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a few places in
the article in which their inability to put into words and arguments all
of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons that bind
people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this complexity
is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62 Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we
felt that that, through our research on the ground, we had engaged with
male and female farmers, heard about their perspectives on GM and their
visions of a rural future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and
markets. So, what do smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What
meanings did they convey to us? We will provide here but a few of those
sounds and meanings ... 63 Despite returning to the idea of voices as
conveying "meaning" in this quote, meaning is related to sounds, to
walking together, to particular places with their own sounds, smells,
and colours. The sample of actual "voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then
choose to present yet again invoke an intricate sense of the
relationality of farmers and nonhumans: It is a joy to plant, getting
hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob which is pleasant, to go to the
harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all regular. Because this is what
sustains me. You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ...
You need to look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the
difference. It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it
\[for replanting the following year\].64 By contrast, GM maize is
associated by the smallholders whom Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with
feelings of "artificiality, estrangement and distrust towards the
created object (the GMO) in itself, not only because of deep ontological
considerations ... but because of the political and economic motives
which are 'assembled' into it."65 Although the authors make a
distinction between ontology and politics/ economics here, their
invoking of the "assemblage" precisely shows how the latter becomes part
of ontology itself, and then (as in the case of Hetherington) impacts on
the sensual, bodily connection with the maize. Understanding the
relation between "things" in this way allows for an analysis of power
and domination that has at least the potential of moving beyond
pre-given frameworks; strategically suspending them in order to "sharpen
\[the\] analysis of exactly how power operates, how relations are made
and undermined, and with what consequences". 66 Genetically modified
maize is a problem because it is part of particular Mexican neoliberal
visions and strategies, but in the context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and
Astier, that vision is not only (and not even primarily) made sense of
through given frames of knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the
exploitation of labour, but sensually, through the way it disrupts the
(physical) pleasure and joy that has sustained the
farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology externalises the maize
from farmers and estrange them from their ways of life; and it is only
through this externalisation that GM maize becomes perceivable as a
potential source of "contamination", as a danger against which farmers
need to "defend" their seeds.68 Now, some might counter that the
previous paragraph in practice only provides a fancy repackaging of the
two well-rehearsed arguments brought forward by many anti-GMO activists:
(a) that the problem of GMOs is an intrinsic property that makes it
"unsafe" (which activists try to scientifically prove), and/or (b) that
the fundamental problem of agricultural biotechnology is that it
estranges farmers from their traditional, ancestral way of life, that it
allows for their exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold
for neoliberal visions of how the world should be ordered. Both
arguments are grounded in modern ontology: the first goes down the route
of science (contesting "facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis
of science itself), while the second goes down the "social" route by
either making a case for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or
for the need to prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use
of all of these routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and
intellectual Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating
character of the GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time
depicting smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or
indigenous knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity
through their traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and
Astier, this "unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder
producers as passive, timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely
the sort of romanticised reification of "difference" that I have
critiqued in the previous section of this article---paradoxically, in
this case, on the basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it
regards both "things" and "people" as ontologically stable and
classifiable. By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed
in this section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by
the nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)? This
article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections. 4. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections
on What Questions to Ask The pull of hegemonic systems of academic
knowledge production is difficult to avoid. This is the case even in
writings that are directly based on ontological encounters and
controversies, and that reflect on the displacement that encountering
different ontologies has entailed. But as I have indicated, this problem
is even more pronounced in writings---like my own---that provide what I
have previously called "third-level" sense-making of ontological
encounters. The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a
conceptual one, which makes it by definition veer towards the general
and abstract rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on
decolonial thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in
three different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide
an understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the
former as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo
Viveiros de Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that
ontology can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as
always being "enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an
understanding of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines
reality as "always in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid
assemblages". 73 Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards
answering the question of what reality as such, in general is about.
Secondly, there is an ambition to coin the general normative-political
project that arises out of this understanding with a singular concept,
such as the pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological
multiplicity and the emancipatory-decolonial political projects that
arise out of its recognition are written for an audience of a particular
discipline, such as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general
rethinking, or, indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74 What sort of
questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and what desire "to
know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee philosopher Brian
Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions we choose to ask
are more important than any truths we might hope to discover in asking
such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is always (at least
in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge of the form 'that
something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified by referring to
direct experiences: "there must be something underlying them and
justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77
Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.
Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79 But even for
those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical research, there
is space to push the boundaries of what can and should be written about
(and how). For decades there have been attempts to provide "innovative"
platforms, for example at conferences, to talk about "stuff" in
different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic practices; not at
least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80). However, these
"innovations" are still at the margins, and they will most likely never
be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge production outlets such
as journal articles and scholarly books. But even within the latter,
there is always at least some space to push for more open-endedness,
more reflection on the author's embodied positionality, more
auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even if this is based on
reading about the ontological encounters of others). Although this sort
of embodied self-reflection on a writer's "situatedness" (which in my
own case means being "on the colonising side of a divide"81) has
obviously been advanced by many critical scholars for decades (including
feminists and post- as well as decolonial scholars), this article has
hopefully shown that [there is still (**always**) a **need to go
further**, in order to **more fundamentally challenge hegemonic**,
**modern/colonial modes** of knowledge production]{.underline}. The
sense of unease that I have outlined in section two was particularly
strong when reading conclusions that were geared towards making
recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for "international
politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic conclusions for**
]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**, or [global
"**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

#### Liberal democracy is self-reflexive and good

//Don Markos

Reflections on liberalism's future Current [international political
trends are complex and still in flux.]{.underline} History shows that
[there are no iron laws of democratisation]{.underline}, and [dominant
political dynamics can prove strikingly changeable]{.underline}. The
easy triumphalism of the liberal democracy agenda in the 1990s was
misplaced. However, [much [criticism]{.mark} now **[risks
over-shooting]{.mark}**]{.underline}.18 [The [Bush]{.mark}
administration [provided an easy dog to kick]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
[its excessive awfulness skewered the nature of conceptual
debate]{.underline}: **[[critical theory has become]{.mark} as [lacking
in self-reflexivity as the 'liberal imperialism' it everywhere
sees]{.mark} and excoriates]{.underline}**. A nuanced view is warranted
of the 'democracy backlash'.19 [[We should be attentive to a **lack of
flexibility**]{.mark} **in the conceptualisation of
democracy**.]{.underline} The consideration of a variety of models is
necessary and desirable. However, [the [evidence does not sustain the
suggestion that the most serious problem]{.mark} with democracy
promotion today **[is an excess of the 'liberal']{.mark}**]{.underline}
in liberal democracy. Indeed, in many places quite the reverse is true.
[[The most worrying problem is]{.underline}]{.mark} not practitioners'
lack of willingness to consider varieties of democratic institutions,
but **[[the lack of priority attached to advancing core liberal
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[As Western powers decline, this trend
is likely to deepen]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}. [Liberalism will
increasingly be on the back foot]{.underline}. In this sense, [[those
that assume that liberalism is dominant **risk lagging behind**]{.mark}
**the policy curve**.]{.underline} Dahl's definition of democracy may be
partial and narrow, but [can we really not say with confidence that it
is better than the authoritarianism that the West is still propping up
under the guise of respect for 'local values']{.underline}? Moreover,
the 'liberal overdose' argument is curious to the extent that since the
end of the 1990s a central thrust of debate common to development,
security and governance circles has been 'the rediscovery of the state'.
[[The stress on core liberal political norms is]{.mark} today
**[under]{.mark}- not over-[played]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It continues
to be the centrally important area where local reformers look to the
international community for support]{.underline} -- most commonly, in
vain. Deliberations over precise institutional configurations and
second-generation reforms are of a lesser order of importance. Michael
McFaul observes that some debates about the intricate sequencing of
reform and different varieties of institutional pathways look
incongruous, as the US can today do little to influence such details,
but rather simply back core democratic values.20 Yet it still hesitates
to do so, for all the standard commentary on US 'liberal imperialism'.
[[Liberal internationalism is]{.mark} still de-[legitimised **by
the**]{.mark} **pervasive [assumption that it is concerned]{.mark}
primarily [with mobilising military force]{.mark} in support of
democratic values;**]{.underline} it must be made clearer that
**[[military power is]{.mark} simply [anathema to the]{.mark} standard
[day-to-day agenda of democracy support]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
There are different levels of critique, which risk elision. One thing is
to argue that [[Western powers should support]{.mark} core [liberal
democratic principles]{.mark}]{.underline}, then from this base work to
build into their policies a concern with social equality, participation,
deliberation and religious identity. It would be entirely convincing to
argue that, while democracy promoters have advanced, they could and
should be doing more in this direction. But [it is quite another thing
to suggest that such aims should be supported against or instead of core
liberal norms]{.underline}. In practice, [[what many]{.mark} critics
appear to [advocate is]{.mark} not a cumulative combination, but [a
dilution of the liberal component]{.mark} in favour of other
forms]{.underline}. [They betray a core inconsistency: [they dislike
democracy promotion for being]{.mark} overly [intrusive, but]{.mark}
then **[advocate modifications that would make it more]{.mark}, not
less, [intrusive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is because most suggested
'alternative forms of democracy' breach the line between process and
substantive policy outputs -- they advocate particular ends, not just a
type of policy-making means. The concrete examples of European policies
demonstrate that it is hardly credible to 'accuse' Brussels of being an
unthinking citadel of blinkered liberalism. Indeed, in this author's
experience, conversations with policy-makers reveal this to be akin to
an almost unmentionable L-word. When so much doubt and ambivalence now
suffuses democracy support strategies, it is unconvincing to admonish
the latter for being uniformly, heavily prescriptive. Donors' tendency
to see democracy through the prism of their own political systems still
often surfaces. But in terms of the way that the 'democracy' in
democracy support is defined conceptually it would seem somewhat
redundant now to warn donors of the dangers of heavily-prescriptive
institutional templates. [[There is]{.mark} some evidence of the
**[self-reflexive policy-learning on]{.mark} the part of [democracy
promotion practitioners]{.mark}** that many critics assume is entirely
lacking]{.underline}. Indeed, [genuine doubt over the most suitable
paths forward has reached the point where some actors' policies are
reduced to immobilism.]{.underline} The problem is that while
policy-relevant knowledge has accumulated, it has done so in an ad hoc
fashion and has not been systematised into common or comprehensive new
approaches.21 The influences on democracy strategy of academic
traditions are eclectic. If we were to trace the philosophical roots of
European good governance and democracy support policies, it is simply
not the case that Locke prevails over all else. The breadth of democracy
assistance programmes goes way beyond the Schumpeterian. The stress on
the role of the state and the existential identity-value of the
political community found in many current policy initiatives finds
resonance (if unconsciously) in thinking that historically stood as the
antithesis to political liberalism. Such a line can be traced from
Aristotle's view of the political community as a biological organism; to
Rousseau's insistence that the general will embodies a mystical,
spiritual collective identity of the political community above and
beyond the will of the majority; through to Hegel's system centred on
the state as the organic embodiment of collective interests and
identity, the 'absolute' within which the individual finds his very
meaning. This is not to say any such strand of thinking would capture
entirely the ideas that inform today's foreign policies. However, the
pertinent point is that the underpinnings of these policies can be seen
in writers who were in combat with Lockean liberalism. The standard
European discourse on equality being more important than formal
political democracy has a direct echo in (politically) anti-liberal
Rousseau. Concerns over the 'tyranny of the majority' that inform
power-sharing strategies in post-conflict situations have a long line of
antecedent philosophers who inveighed strongly against the will of the
majority, from Aristotle through even to Kant (who was concerned with
the republican separation of executive and legislation but certainly not
with augmenting popular power against the aristocracy). Even Benthamite
radical utilitarianism shines through, in its concern with a strong rule
of law to restrain individual freedoms and ensure greater equality in
the furtherance of collective interests. If any modern philosopher is
the thinker of choice for today's discerning Eurocrat it is Habermas,
not the classic liberals. In general, deliberative democracy has been
most widely advocated as a means of situating abstract cosmopolitan
universalism within concrete and varied social settings.22 And all this
is quite apart from the more obvious cases of cynical realpolitik that
take their cue from the more violent illiberalism of Machiavelli and
Hobbes.23 [It is self-evident that liberal democracy now shares the
conceptual field with rivals in a way that it did not in the 1990s. This
may provide for vibrant debate and much-needed
selfexamination]{.underline}. But [it does not necessarily mean that
alternatives have superior legitimacy. [Allowing]{.mark} analytic [space
for a wider variety of]{.mark} forms and definitions of [democracy
**does not mean that**]{.mark} **[sovereign]{.mark} democracy,
[Islamic]{.mark} democracy, [tribal]{.mark} democracy [or Bolivarian
democracy are]{.mark} necessarily [superior or more in tune]{.mark} with
local demands**]{.underline}. [With the West accused of being
overly-prescriptive of a liberal form of democracy, [it would be
**subversive of the critique to jump straight into**]{.mark}
**advocating [other]{.mark} pre-cooked [forms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
should be remembered that [a form such as social democracy is **just as
'Western' in it origins as liberal democracy:**]{.underline} [there is
no reason a priori to assume that it corresponds more closely to 'local
demands' in the way that is routinely and rather uncritically
suggested]{.underline} (however one may oneself desire socially
democratic outcomes). [If the ascendance of conceptual competitors can
add]{.underline} usefully [to the parameters of desirable political
reform]{.underline}, **[[it is not incompatible]{.mark} with this [that
they should]{.mark} at the same time [sharpen the West's defence of core
liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Critical
theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} skate a thin line: they [issue pleas for
a rethinking of democracy]{.underline}, but scratch beneath the surface
**[and what they really [lionise is undemocratic state-led
development]{.mark}]{.underline}**; [theirs is in fact not a genuine
concern with reconceptualising democracy so much as a pretty wholesale
questioning of the democracy agenda,]{.underline} dressed up in softened
discourse. [A central pivot of many such critiques is the criticism of
liberalism's teleological arrogance.]{.underline} But this centres too
much on one influential book published at one rather distinctive moment
in time24; liberalism more broadly and properly understood is not
teleology. Moreover, many writers argue against teleology and
prescription but then in the next breath confidently assert that social
democracy must be a superior and more acceptable form of democracy
outside the West and one which has a more sustainable long-term future.
This may be the case, but [they have no philosophical justification for
saying so without replicating the very same methodological features they
profess to dislike in 'liberal' tenets]{.underline} -- and thus
contradicting themselves. Clearly, more debate about different forms of
political representation would be healthy. [Allowing space for a
plurality of routes to and types of political reform would sit well with
the core spirit of democracy]{.underline}. However, while more
flexibility and open mindedness are still required in democracy
promotion, [there is a risk of being unduly defensive about the virtues
of liberal democracy's core tenets]{.underline}. **[[The problem]{.mark}
in many places of the world is [the absence of liberalism's core
values]{.mark}, not their excess]{.underline}**. Vigilance in the need
for democracy's reconceptualisation is indeed merited. But [[it would be
a muddled reasoning that took this]{.mark} to provide a case [for the
wholesale pull back from the]{.mark}]{.underline} (already anaemic)
[[support for liberal democracy's notion of]{.mark} fundamental
political [rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} We need more fully to understand
local demands. But [there is an automatic assumption routinely made that
such demands are for more diverse, anti-liberal political
forms]{.underline}. This may in many places be the case, but the
evidence must be assembled. One cannot simply assert this as if it were
axiomatic to the emerging world order; there is no reason for supposing
a priori that this is a natural outcome of the rebalancing of
international order. [[The evidence that exists
points]{.underline}]{.mark}, again, [[to a]{.mark} more nuanced
conclusion: **a [demand for the essential tenets of liberal
universalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [made relevant to and expressed
through the language and concepts of local cultures and
histories]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} A growing focus within
political philosophy has been on 'capabilities': negative liberal
freedoms need to be deepened but also combined with the locally-rooted
capabilities that ensure their effective realisation.25 The central
thrust of Locke's liberalism was anti-dogmatism and prudence. The irony
-- and, for anyone concerned over democracy's health, the tragedy -- is
that international support for a supposedly liberal democratic agenda is
today associated with exactly the opposite of these values. [[It is the
non-dogmatic spirit that liberalism must work to recover]{.mark}:
[liberal democracy]{.mark} as a system that]{.underline} (simply)
[[creates space for a variety of different local
choices]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Advocates and opponents of liberalism are
trapped in a circular debate over this matter]{.underline}: [while core
liberal freedoms are required to make such local choices]{.underline},
critics insist that those very liberal rights are themselves a
corruption of local autonomy. [[The imperative is not for liberalism to
cede to other creeds, but to work towards squaring the circle that has
always existed]{.mark} at its heart: [that is]{.mark}, [liberalism
is]{.mark} in its very essence [the rejection of utopian political
design]{.mark}]{.underline}, yet, if not pursued with care, it can
appear as an unbending utopia. This defines its challenge: can
liberalism stand convincingly as an anti-utopian creed whose own
propulsion requires courageous normative conviction? Can it strike the
Rawlsian balance of deepening a plurality of values without descent into
relativism?

### State Good

#### Their understanding of the state as [unified]{.underline}, [immutable]{.underline}, and [inevitably dangerous]{.underline} to Indigenous actors creates a [pessimism trap]{.underline} that [stifles]{.underline} Indigenous agency and activism. 

**Lightfoot, 20**---associate professor in First Nations and Indigenous
Studies and the Department of Political Science, University of British
Columbia, Ojibwe (Sheryl, "The Pessimism Traps of Indigenous
Resurgence," *Pessimism in International Relations*, Chapter 9, pp
162-170, SpringerLink)

[Pessimism Trap 2: The State is **Unified**, **Deliberate** and
**Unchanging** in Its Desire to **Dispossess**]{.underline} Indigenous
Peoples [and **Gain Unfettered Access** to Indigenous Lands]{.underline}
and Resources

[In other words, colonialism by settler states is a **constant**, **not
a variable**, in both **outcome** and **intent**]{.underline}. Further,
the state is not only intentionally colonial, but it is also unifed in
its desire to co-opt Indigenous peoples as a method and means of
control.

In 2005's Wasase, Alfred presents the state as unitary, intentional and
unchanging in its desire to colonise and oppress Indigenous peoples
noting, 'I think that the only thing that has changed since our
ancestors first declared war on the invaders is that some of us have
lost heart'.22 Referring to current state policies as a
'self-termination movement', Alfred states, 'It is senseless to advocate
for an accord with imperialism while there is a steady and intense
ongoing attack by the Settler society on everything meaningful to us:
our cultures, our communities, and our deep attachments to land'.23

Alfred's Peace, Power, Righteousness (2009) also argues that the state
is deliberate and unchanging, stating quite plainly that 'it is still
the objective of the Canadian and US governments to remove Indians, or,
failing that, to prevent them from benefitting, from their ancestral
territories'.24 Contemporary states do this, he argues, not through
outright violent control but 'by insidiously promoting a form of
neo-colonial self-government in our communities and forcing our
integration into the legal mainstream'.25 According to Alfred, the state
'relegates indigenous peoples' rights to the past, and constrains the
development of their societies by allowing only those activities that
support its own necessary illusion: that indigenous peoples today do not
present a serious challenge to its legitimacy'.26

Linking back to the aim of co-option, Alfred argues that while the
state's desire to control Indigenous peoples and lands has never
changed, the techniques for doing so have become subtler over time.
'Recognizing the power of the indigenous challenge and unable to deny it
a voice', due to successful Indigenous resistance over the years, 'the
state has (now) attempted to pull indigenous people closer to it'.27
According to Alfred, the state has outwitted Indigenous leaders and
'encouraged them to reframe and moderate their nationhood demands to
accept the fait accompli of colonization, (and) to collaborate in the
development of a "solution" that does not challenge the fundamental
imperial lie'.28

In a similar vein, Coulthard's central argument is centred on his
understanding of the dual structure of colonialism. Drawing directly
from Fanon, Coulthard finds that colonialism relies on both objective
and subjective elements. The objective components involve domination
through the political, economic and legal structures of the colonial
state. The subjective elements of colonialism involve the creation of
'colonized subjects', including a process of internalisation by which
colonised subjects come to not only accept the limited forms of
'misrecognition' granted through the state but can even come to identify
with it.29 Through this dual structure, colonial power now works through
the inclusion of Indigenous peoples, actively shaping their perspectives
in line with state discourses, rather than merely excluding them, as in
years past. Therefore, any attempt to seek 'the reconciliation of
Indigenous nationhood with state sovereignty is still colonial insofar
as it remains structurally committed to the dispossession of Indigenous
peoples of our lands and self-determining authority'.30

Concerning the state in relation to Indigenous peoples on the
international level, Corntassel argues that states and global
organisations, for years, have been consistently framing Indigenous
peoples' self-determination claims in ways that 'jeopardize the futures
of indigenous communities'.31 He claims that states frst
compartmentalise Indigenous self-determination by separating lands and
resources from political and legal recognition of a limited autonomy.
Second, he notes, states sometimes deny the existence of Indigenous
peoples living within their borders. Thirdly, a political and legal
entitlement framing by states deemphasises other responsibilities.
Finally, he claims that states, through the rights discourse, limit the
frameworks through which Indigenous peoples can seek self-determination.
Like Alfred and Coulthard, Corntassel has concluded that states are
deliberate and never changing in their behaviour. With [this
move]{.underline}, Corntassel [**limits** and actually **demeans
Indigenous agency**, **overlooking** the reality that **Indigenous
organisations themselves** chose the **human rights framework** and
**rights discourse** as a target sphere of action **precisely because**,
as was **evident** in earlier struggles like **slavery**, **civil
rights** or **women's rights**, these were **tools available to them**
that had a **proven track record of opening up new possibilities** and
**shifting previous state positions** and **behaviour**. Indigenous
advocates also **cleverly realised**]{.underline}, by the 1970s, [that
the **anti-discrimination** and **decolonisation frames** could be
**used together against states**. States did, **in no way**,
**nefariously impose a rights framework** on Indigenous peoples. Rather,
Indigenous organisations and savvy Indigenous political actors
**deliberately chose** to frame their self-determination struggles
**within the human rights framework** in order to **bring states into a
double bind** where they **could not credibly claim** to adhere to human
rights and claim that they uphold equality while **simultaneously
denying Indigenous peoples' human rights** and leaving them with a
**diminished** and **unequal right of self-determination**]{.underline}.
But, because he is caught in [the pessimism trap of **seeing the state
only as unified**, **deliberate** and **unchanging**]{.underline},
Corntassel [**overlooks** and **diminishes** the clear story of
**Indigenous agency** and the **potential for positive change** in
advancing self-determination in a multitude of ways]{.underline}.

[Pessimism Trap 3: **Engagement** with the Settler State is
**Futile**]{.underline}, if Not Counter-Productive

[Since the state always intends to **maintain**, if not **expand**,
**colonial control**]{.underline}, and is seeking to co-opt as many
Indigenous peoples as possible in order to maintain or expand its
dispossession and control, [it is therefore **futile**]{.underline}, at
best, [and]{.underline} actually [**dangerous** to Indigenous existence
to engage with the state]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**all patterns of
engagement** will lead to **co-optation** as the state is **cunning**
and **unrelenting** in its desire to co-opt]{.underline} Indigenous
leaders, academics and professionals in order to gain or maintain
control of [Indigenous peoples]{.underline}.

Alfred argues, in both his 2005 and 2009 books, that any Indigenous
engagement with the state, including agreements and negotiations, is not
only futile but fundamentally dangerous, as such pathways do not
directly challenge the existing colonial structure and 'to argue on
behalf of indigenous nationhood within the dominant Western paradigm is
self-defeating'.32 Alfred states that a 'notion of nationhood or
self-government rooted in state institutions and framed within the
context of state sovereignty can never satisfy the imperatives of Native
American political traditions'33 because the possibility for a true
expression of Indigenous self-determination is 'precluded by the state's
insistence on dominion and its exclusionary notion of sovereignty'.34
Worst of all, according to Alfred, when Indigenous communities frame
their struggles in terms of asserting Aboriginal rights and title, but
do so within a state framework, rather than resisting the state itself,
it 'represents the culmination of white society's efforts to assimilate
indigenous peoples'.35

Because it is impossible to advance Indigenous self-determination
through any sort of engagement with the state, Coulthard also advocates
for an Indigenous resurgence paradigm that follows both his mentor
Taiaiake Alfred but also Anishinaabe feminist theorist Leanne Simpson.36
As Coulthard writes, 'both Alfred and Simpson start from a position that
calls on Indigenous peoples and communities to "turn away" from the
assimilative reformism of the liberal recognition approach and to
instead build our national liberation efforts on the revitalization of
"traditional" political values and practices'.37 Drawing upon the
prescriptive approach of these theorists, Coulthard proposes, in his
concluding chapter, five theses from his analysis that are intended to
build and solidify Indigenous resurgence into the future:

1\. On the necessity of direct action, meaning that physical forms of
Indigenous resistance, like protest and blockades, are very important
not only as a reaction to the state but also as a means of protecting
the lands that are central to Indigenous peoples' existence;

2\. Capitalism, No More!, meaning the rejection of capitalist forms of
economic development in Indigenous communities in favour of land-based
Indigenous political-economic alternative approaches;

3\. Dispossession and Indigenous Sovereignty in the City, meaning the
need for Indigenous resurgence movements 'to address the interrelated
systems of dispossession that shape Indigenous peoples' experiences in
both urban and land-based settings'38;

4\. Gender Justice and Decolonisation, meaning that decolonisation must
also include a shift away from patriarchy and an embrace of gender
relations that are non-violent and refective of the centrality of women
in traditional forms of Indigenous governance and society; and

5\. Beyond the Nation-State. While Coulthard denies that he advocates
complete rejection of engagement with the state's political and legal
system, he does assert that 'our efforts to engage these discursive and
institutional spaces to secure recognition of our rights have not only
failed, but have instead served to subtly reproduce the forms of racist,
sexist, economic, and political confgurations of power that we initially
sought...to challenge'.39 He therefore advocates expressly for 'critical
self-refection, skepticism, and caution' in a 'resurgent politics of
recognition that seeks to practice decolonial, gender-emancipatory, and
economically nonexploitative alternative structures of law and sovereign
authority grounded on a critical refashioning of the best of Indigenous
legal and political traditions'.40

Corntassel also demonstrates the third pessimism trap, that all
engagement with the state is ultimately futile. For the most part,
however, Corntassel's observation is that the UN system operates like a
reverse Keck and Sikkink 'boomerang model' and 'channels the energies of
transnational Indigenous networks into the institutional fiefdoms of
member countries', by which an 'illusion of inclusion' is created.41 He
argues that, in order to be included or their views listened to,
Indigenous delegates at the UN must mimic the strategies, language,
norms and modes of behaviour of member states and international
institutions. Corntassel fnds that 'what results is a cadre of
professionalized Indigenous delegates who demonstrate more allegiance to
the UN system than to their own communities'.42 In his final analysis,
he charges that the co-optation of international Indigenous political
actors is highly 'effective in challenging the unity of the global
Indigenous rights movement and hindering genuine dialogue regarding
Indigenous self-determination and justice'.43

Finding that states deliberately co-opt and provide 'illusions of
inclusion' to Indigenous political actors in UN settings, Corntassel
comes to the same conclusion as Alfred concerning the futility of
engagement, arguing that because transnational Indigenous networks are
'channeled' and 'blunted' by colonial state actors, 'it is a critical
time for Indigenous peoples to rethink their approaches to bringing
Indigenous rights concerns to global forums'.44

Imagining a Post-Colonial Future: Pessimistic 'Resurgence' Versus
the Optimism and Tenacity of Indigenous Movements on the Ground

[All of these]{.underline} writers [advocate **Indigenous resurgence**,
through a combination of **rejecting**]{.underline} the current
reconciliation politics of [**settler colonial states**, coupled with a
**return to land-based Indigenous expressions** of governance as the
**only viable**, '**authentic**' and **legitimate path** to a better
future for Indigenous peoples, which they refer to as
**decolonisation**]{.underline}. While inherently critical in their
orientation, these three approaches do make some positive and productive
contributions to Indigenous movements. They help shed light on the
various and subtle ways that Indigenous leaders and communities can
become co-opted into a colonial system. They help us to hold leadership
accountable. They also help us keep a strong focus on our traditional,
cultural and spiritual values as well as our traditional forms of
governance which then also helps us imagine future possibilities.

As I have pointed out here, however, [all]{.underline} three theorists
[are]{.underline} also [**caught** in the]{.underline} same three
[**pessimism traps**: **authenticity versus co-option**; a vision of the
state as **unified**, **deliberate** and **never changing** in its
desire to **colonise** and **control**; and a view of engagement with
the state as **futile**, if not **dangerous**, to Indigenous sovereignty
and existence]{.underline}. When combined, [these]{.underline} three
pessimism [traps]{.underline} aim to [**inhibit Indigenous peoples'
engagement** with the state in **any process** that could potentially
**re-imagine** and **re-formulate** their current relationship into one
that could be **transformative** and **post-colonial**, as envisioned by
the **UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**.
The]{.underline} pessimism [traps]{.underline} together work to
[**foreclose any possibility** that there could be **credible openings
of opportunity** to negotiate a **fairer** and **just relationship** of
co-existence with **even the most progressive state
government**.]{.underline}

[This]{.underline} pessimistic approach [is **not innocuous**. By
**overemphasising structure** and granting the state an **enormous
degree of agency** as a **unitary actor**, this]{.underline} pessimistic
approach [**does a remarkable disservice** to Indigenous resistance
movements by **proscribing**, from **academia**, an **extremely narrow
view** of what Indigenous self-determination **can** and **should mean**
in practice. By **overlooking** and/or **discounting Indigenous agency**
and **not even considering the possibility** that Indigenous peoples
**could themselves be calculating**, **strategic political actors** in
their own right, and vis-à-vis states, the pessimistic lens]{.underline}
of the resurgence school [**unnecessarily**, **unproductively** and
**unjustly limits the field of possibility** for Indigenous peoples'
decision-making, thus **actually countering** and **inhibiting
expressions of Indigenous self-determination**. By
**condemning**---**writ large**---**all Indigenous peoples** and
**organisations** that wish to **seek peaceful co-existence** with the
state, **negotiate mutually beneficial agreements** with the state,
and/or who have **advocated on the international level**
for]{.underline} a set of **[standards]{.underline}** that can provide a
positive guiding framework [for Indigenous-state relations, the
pessimistic lens]{.underline} of resurgence [**forecloses much potential
for new** and **improved relations**, in **any form**, and is **very
likely** to lead to **deeper conflicts** between states and Indigenous
peoples, and potentially, even **violent action**]{.underline}, which
Fanon indicated was the necessary outcome. [The pessimism
traps]{.underline} of the resurgence school [are therefore]{.underline},
likely [**self-defeating** for all but the **most remote** and
**isolated Indigenous communities**]{.underline}. Further, [this
approach is **quite out of step** with the **actions** and **vision of
many Indigenous resistance movements** on the ground who have been
**working for decades** to advance Indigenous self-determination, both
**domestically** and **globally**, in ways that **transform the colonial
state** into something **more just** and may eventually **present
creative alternatives** to the Westphalian state form in ways that could
**respect** and **accommodate Indigenous nations**]{.underline}. Rather,
[it aims to **shame** and **blame** those who wish to **explore
creative** and **innovative post-colonial resolutions** to the colonial
condition]{.underline}.

[The **UN Declaration**]{.underline} on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(the Declaration or UN Declaration) was adopted by the General Assembly
in 2007 after 25 years of development. The Declaration [is
**ground-breaking**, given the **key leadership roles** Indigenous
peoples played in **negotiating** and **achieving** this
agreement]{.underline}.45 Additionally, for the first time in UN
history, the rights holders, [Indigenous peoples, **worked with states**
to develop an instrument that would serve to **promote**, **protect**
and **affirm Indigenous rights**, both **globally** and in **individual
domestic contexts**.]{.underline}46

[Many **Indigenous organisations** and **movements**, from **dozens of
countries** around the world, were **involved in drafting** and
**negotiating** the UN Declaration and are now **advocating for its full
implementation**, both **internationally** and in **domestic** and
**regional contexts**]{.underline}. In Canada, some of the key
organisational players---the Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee),
the Assembly of First Nations, and the Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, or their predecessor organisations---were involved in the
drafting and lengthy negotiations of the UN Declaration during the
1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the United States, organisations like the
American Indian Law Alliance and the Native American Rights Fund have
been involved as well as the Navajo Nation and the Haudenosaunee
Confederacy, who represent themselves as Indigenous peoples' governing
institutions. From Scandinavia, the Saami Council and the Sami
Parliaments all play a key role in advancing Indigenous rights. In Latin
America, organisations like the Confederación de Nationalidades
Indígenas del Ecuador (CONAIE) and the Consejo Indio de Sud America
(CISA) advocate for implementation of the UN Declaration. The three,
**[major transnational Indigenous organisations]{.underline}**--- the
World Council of Indigenous Peoples, the International Indian Treaty
Council and the Inuit Circumpolar Council---[were all **key members** of
the drafting and negotiating team for the UN Declaration,
and]{.underline} the latter two, which are still in existence,
[**continue their strong advocacy** for its full
implementation]{.underline}.

Implementation of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
requires fundamental and significant change, on both the international
and domestic levels. Because implementation of Indigenous rights
essentially calls for a complete and fundamental restructuring of
Indigenous-state relationships, it expects states to enact and implement
a signifcant body of legal, constitutional, legislative and policy
changes that can accommodate such things as Indigenous land rights,
free, prior and informed consent, redress and a variety of
self-government, autonomy and other such arrangements. [States are **not
going to implement** this multifaceted and complex set of changes **on
their own**]{.underline}, however. [They will require **significant
political** and **moral pressure to hold them accountable** to the
**rhetorical commitments** they have made to support this level of
change. They will also require **ongoing conversation** and
**negotiation** with Indigenous peoples along the way, lest the process
becomes **problematically one-sided**. Such processes ultimately require
**sustained political will**, **commitment** and **engagement** over the
**long term**, to reach]{.underline} the end result of [**radical
systemic change** and Indigenous state relationships grounded in
**mutual respect**, **co-existence** and **reciprocity**. This type of
fundamental change requires **creative thinking**, **careful
diplomacy**, **tenacity**, and]{.underline} above all, [**optimistic
vision**, on the part of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The
**[pessimistic approaches]{.underline}** of the resurgence school
[are]{.underline} ultimately [of **little use**]{.underline} in these
efforts, [other than as a **cautionary tale** against state power, of
which the organisational players are **already keenly
aware**]{.underline}. Further, by [**dismissing** and **discouraging all
efforts at engagement** with states, and]{.underline} especially with
[the **blanket accusations** that all who engage in such efforts are
'**co-opted**' and not '**authentically**' Indigenous]{.underline}, the
resurgence school [actually creates **unnecessary negative feelings**
and **divisions** amongst Indigenous movements who should be **pooling
limited resources** and **working together towards better
futures**]{.underline}.

#### The state is [inevitable]{.underline}---engaging the state doesn't necesarilly mean endorsing it---they devolves politics into a dogmatic void that the right will fill

**Choat, 16**---PhD in Political Science at Queen Mary University of
London, member of the Political Studies Association, Senior Lecturer in
the School of Economics, Politics, and History (Simon, "Marxism and
anarchism in an age of neoliberal crisis,"
<http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/32233/1/Choat-S-3223-AAM.pdf>)

The anarchist critique of Marxist organisational forms is unconvincing,
then, because it does not acknowledge the diversity of Marxist
approaches and it tends towards a theoreticism that sees a linear,
causal, and continuous line from theory to practice. Nonetheless, there
are significant differences of strategy between anarchism and Marxism:
it is just that these are less to do with organisation as such, and are
much more broadly to do with differing attitudes toward politics and the
state. Although **[[some]{.underline}]{.mark}** (though by no means all)
**[anarchists]{.underline}** have supported formal political
organisations, with rules, membership criteria, and even internal
discipline (Schmidt and van der Walt 2009: 247-263), they
**[have]{.underline}** traditionally **[[rejected]{.mark} [any]{.mark}
[engagement]{.mark} with the state -- whether it be voting, demanding
legal rights or protections, forming political parties, or attempting
the revolutionary seizure of government -- [on the basis]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} such [engagement]{.mark} [can]{.mark} [only]{.mark}
[end]{.mark} [up]{.mark} [replicating]{.mark} the oppressive
[hierarchies]{.mark} that they are fighting: either it will lead to new
forms of dictatorship and bureaucracy]{.underline}** (such as developed
in the Soviet Union); **[or]{.underline}** it will lead to parliamentary
**[reformism and]{.underline}** hence **[merely reinforce existing
structures and relations of power. If Marxists support]{.underline}**
(qualified) **[engagement with the state and even the formation of
political parties]{.underline}**, however, **[it is not because they
think that centralised hierarchies are desirable or inevitable, but
because they begin from a different understanding of
politics]{.underline}**. They argue that **[the]{.underline}**
**[anarchist]{.underline}** **[[abstention]{.mark} from state politics
[denies us the most effective means]{.mark} of political action: [we
disempower ourselves rather than the state]{.mark} when we refuse to
engage with it. [Making demands]{.mark} on the state [does not]{.mark}
necessarily [entail an]{.mark} [endorsement]{.mark} of the state, any
more than the demands that are made by employees during a strike are an
endorsement of the employer or of the system of
wage-labour]{.underline}** (Marx 1988). Anarchists themselves have at
least implicitly recognised the efficacy of political engagement by
occasionally supporting the policies of certain governments and even
participating in elections (Engels 1988; Franks 2012: 216). More than
this, **[abstention from state politics is not a genuine option: whether
we like it or not, [we are all already involved]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[state politics, because]{.mark} [we are]{.mark} all [always]{.mark}
already [submitted]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [state]{.mark} [power]{.mark},
control, and oppression.]{.underline}** Anarchists are concerned that
participation in conventional politics will lead to parliamentary
reformism. But this concern is itself ultimately premised on a tacit
acceptance of the liberal-parliamentary understanding of politics: to
claim that we can safely repudiate state politics simply by refusing
ever to enter a polling booth is to assume that 'the state' stops at the
door of Parliament. Marxists, in contrast, have argued that the state
apparatus includes educational institutions, the media, churches, the
family, and so on (e.g. Althusser 1971): simply in going about our daily
lives we are all therefore implicated in state politics. Given our
necessary involvement within politics, the question is not whether we
engage with it, but how we do so; even libertarian Marxists like
Holloway argue that engagement with the state is inevitable (Holloway
2005: 40). In contrast, the anarchist recommendation of disengagement
from the state risks a politics of withdrawal and isolation. There are
two related reasons why under our current conditions in particular the
Marxist willingness to engage in state politics is preferable to an
anarchist position. The first is the dominance of neoliberalism today.
Given the strength of neoliberalism since the crisis that it created,
there is a strong case for a certain pragmatism in our response. A
danger of the prefigurative politics favoured by anarchists is that it
dogmatically dictates an a priori exclusion of certain forms of
political action. For Marxists, on the other hand, **[political
[strategies must be decided according to particular conditions and
within a certain context]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In a context in which
private companies are increasingly undertaking tasks previously
performed by the state, **[[the]{.mark} active [defence of]{.mark} state
services and [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}** can be viewed as a
radical position to adopt: defending welfare provision, public pensions,
universal healthcare, and free higher education **[[should be
seen]{.mark} not as a reformist compromise with the existing order but
[as safeguarding the gains of]{.mark} class [struggle]{.mark} against
capitalist processes of accumulation by dispossession.]{.underline}**
This leads to the second reason for doubting the refusal of state
politics as a viable tactic under current conditions, which concerns the
specific role of the state under neoliberalism. The anti-state politics
of anarchism may have made sense during eras in which the state could
plausibly be presented as the main threat to freedom and equality:
during the period of nation-building and imperialistic expansion in the
mid- to late-19th century, of the rise of fascism in the early-20th
century, or even of the development of welfare capitalism after WWII.
But it has far less purchase in an era in which neoliberalism, as both
the official ideology and a form of everyday common sense, is
anti-statist. Put simply, the attack on state power too easily echoes
the rhetoric of neoliberalism itself (Taylor 2013: 735). When government
actors themselves are explicitly endorsing the retreat of the state,
then anarchist attacks on state power have limited efficacy either as a
tactical call to arms or as a convincing analysis of our present
conjuncture. In practice, of course, it is true that neoliberalism has
not dissolved state power. But nor has the relation between state and
capital remained the same under neoliberalism, such that our analyses,
strategies, or rhetoric need not alter. The nature of this relationship
between state and capital will be examined in the next section.

### Perm

#### Perm solves- only working through jurisdiction solves decolonization

**Buchanan 17** (Brenton, Society and Space Organization,
"Lumpy Space, Colonial Place: Jurisdiction As Infrastructure And (Post)Colonial Place Making In The Marshall Islands",
https://www.societyandspace.org/articles/lumpy-space-colonial-place-jurisdiction-as-infrastructure-and-post-colonial-place-making-in-the-marshall-islands)

In their work, both Lauren Benton and Shiri Pasternak examine the
fluidity of legal relationships through conceptions of jurisdiction
which overlap, entangle, and shift over time. As Pasternak explains,
seeing "[jurisdiction as a spatial category... \[allows\] for the
examination of the production of colonial space through the work of
jurisdiction]{.underline}" (emphasis mine. 2014: 147) Pasternak's
geographic lens positions law and space as political, as contested
categories that come together in constituting colonial claims to
authority; to colonial jurisdiction over others. As a result, layers of
colonial and imperial authority "become thicker or thinner as peoples'
movements through space produce new arrangements and negotiations of
power," (Pasternak, 2014: 149) bringing with them further systems of
domination. As unevenly asserted and applied across space and time,
[jurisdiction-as-infrastructure opens up a refutation of the
completeness of the colonial project. Infrastructure,]{.underline} in
this sense, [is understood not only as a 'structure,' but also as
'process'; one that works to produce other systems and
relations]{.underline}. This perspective highlights the productive
aspects of jurisdiction, rather than accepting legal authority and law
as removed from the space they claim. Instead, when framed as
infrastructure, [jurisdiction is shown to be a process of "overlapping
authority claims between Indigenous, state, regional, and private
interests, and it can help parse the ways in which these jurisdictional
encounters produce colonial space]{.underline}" (Pasternak, 2014: 146).
The importance of this emphasis on process and production is that, even
as laws are instituted and legal systems established, jurisdiction forms
its necessary and underlying infrastructure; "the power to speak the
law" (Pasternak, 2014: 148). Jurisdiction-as-infrastructure highlights
this claim-making, opening up law and legal authority as a contested
category. Mentioned above[, this approach refuses an acceptance of "law"
as a pre-spatial category, positioning instead not only the content of
the law but its claim to applicability over a given space as something
that must be established, and therefore maintained.]{.underline} As
such, law is produced through claims to jurisdiction, and by situating
it as such in the colonial process reveals uneven and contested
geographies of power. Law, legal systems, and the authority to impose
them become highly historicized objects, ones that are spatially and
relationally contingent in their production, enactment, and
perpetuation. [Through examining jurisdiction as infrastructure then,
colonial and imperial authority not only become, but already are,
contested and contestable claims]{.underline}. By asserting that legal
authority is continually produced, the voices of Indigenous claims and
contestations become themselves jurisdictional "lumps that betray
patterns of partial and uneven state sovereignty" (Pasternak, 2014:
148). The singular authority that colonial powers claim is instead
unsettled and made to compete. This [framework importantly resists the
perspective of the fatal impact theory, wherein the colonial encounter
produces a terminal "historical descent into a state of nothingness and
hopelessness]{.underline}" (Smith, 1999: 88) [of Indigenous cultures and
peoples, as well as reduction of the colonized to "the concept of "bare
lives" ...]{.underline} \[withdrawing\] all form of agency from the
bodies targeted by this violence" (Lambert, 2017: 13). [Its spatial
qualities belie the finality of colonial authority, as the emphasis on
the power "to speak" the law, rather than the law itself, allows for
non-colonial and non-state forms of authority to be
recognized.]{.underline} Jurisdiction works as a process over time to
establish and claim authority over space. As necessarily contingent,
relational, and historical, for this short intervention an examination
of the long imperial/colonial history of the Marshall Islands reveals
some of the ways that jurisdiction takes on "a quality of lumpiness"
(Benton, 2005: 701). [At the same time the contemporary work of the
Nuclear Claims Tribunal (NCT), established under the Compact of Free
Association (COFA), opens up space to discuss both the possibilities of
resistance through jurisdictional claims and the incompleteness of the
postcolonial project.]{.underline} Moving from infrequent economic
exchange with Spain (established through the Treaty of Tordesillas,
1594), German interests in the islands were recognized in 1885. However,
their relationship with the islands was primarily established in 1878
through a treaty with one local chief, granting them exclusive use of a
Jaluit Atoll harbor and trading privileges. The combination of
inter-imperial and German-indigenous relations positions, even tacitly,
indigenous jurisdiction over access and use of island harbors and
resources on a relatively even plane with imperial claims. Yet, in 1914,
when the Japanese seized the Marshall Islands from Germany during WWI,
it was not a renegotiation of a treaty between the new imperial power
and local chiefs, but rather seizure of one empire's land and
transference of control to another. Viewed as a German protectorate, the
shifted context meant that since "a state of war existed between...
nations... therefore the takings were legal" (emphasis mine. Benton,
2005: 705). As inter-imperial conflict, the transfer from German to
Japanese possession overlapped with German-Indigenous treaties. As the
former did not require a reconsideration of the latter, it implicitly
arranges them in a hierarchical legal relationship. Centering
jurisdiction as infrastructure, Japanese claims over Germany's imperial
relation to the Marshall Islands is temporarily troubled. If this
"transfer" is something necessarily produced, then by what authority
does Japan claim possession of the Marshall Islands, especially
considering the German-Marshall relationship was negotiated directly
with local Islander authority? Rather, these transfers should be seen
less as a shifting of powers but a cementing of certain legal
relationships that works to produce a privileging of imperial and
colonial claims over those of indigenous peoples. This did not equate in
a complete erasure, as much as the imperial/colonial project might
desire, but rather a layering on of different dominating relations. This
fungibility of (imperial) authority shifted not necessarily under the
auspices of a single imperial power, but rather across powers through
imperial jurisdictional understandings and transitions through conquest.
In this way, "territory... was constructed not just for empire but also
in empire, and at its margins" (Benton, 2005: 701). Divesting the
Marshallese of authority was not a foregone conclusion, but one produced
out of the very practice of empire. When the United States defeated
Japan in the islands in 1944, assertion of authority over the Islands in
1945 was in this sense a claim less in relation to the Marshallese
peoples, but rather against the Japanese empire. Perhaps an irony of
this shifting web of jurisdiction between imperial powers is found in a
statement from the UN in 1947 (itself newly established and working to
assert its own claims to authority) made to declare the Marshalls a
trust territory of the U.S. Not only was this the only trusteeship
"designated as a "strategic" territory," granting greater latitude over
the securitization of the region, but the UN declared the responsibility
of the U.S. to "protect the inhabitants... against the loss of their
lands and resources" (emphasis mine. Barker, 2013: 22). This language
implies a form of ownership by the Marshallese over the islands, yet
positions it as a subordinate claim to the paternalistic oversight of
the U.S. This reflexive maneuvering of possession and authority
constitutes a "cynical grounds for recognition" that "also entrenched
the subordination of Indigenous societies" (Pasternak, 2014: 159).
Through representing Marshallese possession of their islands, U.S. (and
UN) authority is asserted, structured, and simultaneously folds
Marshallese claims under this oversight. Though a shifting terrain, this
post-World War II legal relationship is predicated on preceding imperial
ones, and their own claims to "speak the law" in Marshallese lands. The
infrastructure of inter-imperial jurisdiction becomes productive of US
claims to the islands, as seized from Imperial Japan, as well as the
UN's claim to be able to designate a certain kind of authority over
them. The long historical process started with infrequent Spanish
trading, when understood though conceptions of jurisdiction over the
islands reveals the long production of the islands as colonial space,
privileging (primarily) Western imperial authority over Indigenous
claims over their land. This imperial history of the Marshalls forms the
centuries long preamble and pretext that established a legal context
wherein the United States could be "granted" the Islands as a strategic
territory under their trusteeship; pursuing sixty-six nuclear tests
between 1946-1963 and ongoing ballistic missile testing in the islands.
As the Cold War continued, the Marshallese of various communities sent
petitions through both US and UN channels to protest and improve their
position under US "strategic" oversight. Understanding these within the
productive infrastructure of jurisdiction, American legal authority and
aspects of the colonial dynamic are brought into question through both
an invocation of UN authority, and the very voices of the Islanders who
petition, protest, and contest. Within a broader framework of Cold War
decolonial movements, the basis of and imperial power to "speak the law"
became increasingly troubled. In addition to gaining periodic
concessions, tensions between indigenous movements and continued US
investment in the Marshall Islands as a military (test) site culminated
in the 1980s with negotiations for the COFA. As a victory for indigenous
sovereignty this nominally recognizes Marshallese self-government even
as it simultaneously perpetuates US military and colonial interests.
Following jurisdiction through the COFA, the establishment of the NCT
was to provide "jurisdiction to render final determination upon all
claims past, present, and future" (Pevec, 2005) regarding the nuclear
testing program. Given \$150 million for these ends, Smith-Norris (2016:
40) notes how the "finality" of this agreement also resulted in the
dismissal of all claims pending in the United States, as courts in the
US were divested of jurisdictional authority over these matters.
Although woefully underfunded, and the possibility of pursuing legal
cases within US courts being denied, the findings of the NCT function as
an avenue for pressuring the United States for further redress for the
legacy of its testing program. It is noted (Smith-Norris, 2016: 41) that
having awarded \$341,049,311 in damages to the Enewetakese alone in
2000, the findings of the NCT are not immediately actionable (though
payments are made as much as is possible). Instead, assessment of
damages, processing of claims, and the power to speak the law in cases
of redress for nuclear testing, contamination, and devastation has
become a new lump in the US-Marshallese relationship. Though quickly
running up against a limited budget, this shifting jurisdictional
geography opens up a site of resistance as well as a look into the
incomplete nature of decolonization. After an independent review of the
NCT by former US Attorney General Richard Thornburgh in 2003 and a 2012
UN investigation into impacts of the testing program, the findings of
the NCT comprise a mechanism of knowledge production about the legacies
of nuclear contamination independent from US oversight. As the
Marshallese continue to argue for adequate compensation through the NCT,
examining jurisdiction as infrastructural process through which colonial
and imperial authority can be asserted, its "return" through
decolonization belies the uneven power dynamics and systems that
continue to pervade colonizer/colonized relations. However, through the
NCT and its claim to jurisdiction over damages due to the Marshallese
people as a result of the United States' nuclear testing and colonial
domination, these contestations might be seen as more than an uneven
power dynamic. These claims to authority by the NCT, and by extension
the Marshallese people, are not simply petitions to US or UN law. They
are themselves claims to sovereignty that are one part of a larger
decolonial struggle, where the NCT's jurisdiction produces a new vision
and future for the Republic of the Marshall Islands. [It seems true that
the "decolonization" promised through the COFA and the establishment of
the NCT is not a recognition of an originary, total jurisdiction, but a
modified and contingent one that maintains other structures of
domination. Just as jurisdiction opens a recognition of the process and
contested nature of coloniality, as part of the postcolonial project it
reveals its own incompleteness. The ability of the US to deny
responsibility for the ongoing impacts of its nuclear colonialism and
payment of damages concluded by the NCT makes clear that jurisdictional
authority is but one of the necessary components for a true
decolonization]{.underline} of the Marshall Islands. Yet employing it as
a point of intervention can help reveal the contours of domination that
make up the lumpiness of imperial and (post)colonial dynamics. For a
historical approach, consideration of jurisdiction as infrastructure can
help to make clear the long duration, and process, of imperial and
colonial imposition and assertions of authority. Important to this is
that jurisdiction as productive of the colonial context and relationship
helps to set the stage for other forms and systems of power;
jurisdiction does not travel alone. For the decolonizing process then,
understanding it as infrastructure can reveal other forms of colonial
persistence. Even as jurisdiction is "returned" or recognized in
purportedly (de)colonized peoples, unequal power dynamics and
neo-colonial systems persist through other forms. Being productive of
colonial and imperial claims to authority, a site of contestation that
"actively works to produce something" (Dorsett and McVeigh quoted in
Pasternak, 2014: 151) it is also a process of multiple "things" in the
making. Perhaps as an ethical statement, this framework also insists on
hopeful potential and possibilities for decolonial struggles, even as it
provides a valuable critical approach to understanding the complexities
of colonial domination. **[Centering debates and claims worked out
through jurisdiction can reveal both the production and persistence of
colonialism, but also competing systems and visions of post- or
de-colonial futures.]{.underline}**

Theorising Decolonisation For all its attached redemptive prospects and
radical possibilities, it is important to emphasise that the meanings of
decolonisation as both a concept and political project are not just
broad, but also multifaceted and highly contested. What it means to
'undo' colonialism is deeply contextual (Jansen and Osterhammel, 2017).
While colonialism can be defined broadly as a relationship of domination
in which a people or territory is politically and economically
subjugated to a foreign power, actual colonial situations vary quite
widely from each other, depending on, among others, the particular
political systems instituted to maintain control, types of exploitation
and expropriation (resources, labour, plantations), relationship between
the metropole and colony and patterns of migration they compel (slavery,
settlement). [Projects of decolonisation accordingly take different
forms even if they are united by the common concern of ending or
overturning structures of domination instituted by
colonialism]{.underline}, which has historically taken place mostly
through the withdrawal of colonial powers and achievement of
independence for the colonised (Buchanan, 2010). Decolonisation speaks
to the aspiration of self-rule and its concomitant critique of
colonialism as the 'systematic denial of freedom' (Kohn and McBride,
2011: 6) and is therefore entangled with a variety of concerns, namely,
self-determination, justice, equality, freedom and solidarity against
colonialism and imperialism. As Todd Shepherd (2006: 3--4) writes,
decolonisation is 'a much wider concept than the mere "winning of
Independence" or "transfer of power"... It entails the exploration of
dreams, the analysis of struggles, compromises, pledges and
achievements, and the rethinking of fundamentals'. Traditional
literature on decolonisation approached it in terms of the historical
process that began in the immediate aftermath of World War Two in which
countries previously under (typically European) foreign rule
transitioned to constitutional independence (Buchanan, 2010).
Decolonisation was one of the most significant developments of the
twentieth century, radically changing the face of the globe from one in
which a small number of empires had dominion over some 80% of the
earth's surface to an international order based on the principle of
self-determination and made up of ostensibly independent states
(Hopkins, 2008). Scholars in this tradition have done much to illuminate
the wide-reaching structural transformations that accompanied
decolonisation, including the emergence of anti-colonial and national
liberation struggles at the turn of the century, shifts in world economy
that made the maintenance of traditional forms of Empire increasingly
difficult, the development of a 'Third World' political project and the
institutionalisation of human and civic rights principles that rendered
systems based on ideas of racial and ethnic superiority less viable
(Hopkins, 2008: 216). Yet, [the focus on transition has been critiqued
for its narrowness insofar as it seems to take for granted the meanings
of self-determination and temporally restricts decolonisation to the
moment of national liberation.]{.underline} Postcolonial scholars, among
others, have been at the forefront of this charge, arguing that
[decolonisation did not produce a postcolonial world per se, but rather
one that continues to be shaped in significant ways by the legacies of
European colonialism]{.underline} (e.g. Spivak, 1999). As Ella Shohat
(1992) has argued, there is no way of turning back from the world
colonialism set in play nor did colonial modes of domination end with
the formal period of decolonisation. From this broadened perspective[,
[decolonisation is the difficult task]{.mark} of tracing the economic,
political, social, cultural, relational and linguistic consequences of
colonialism and is therefore also an ongoing imaginative project seeking
'a new form of consciousness and way of life']{.underline} (Pieterse and
Parekh, 1995: 3) beyond the coloniality of modern modes of culture,
identity and knowledge more generally. While the transitional focus of
conventional scholarship is quite illuminating in the contexts of Africa
and Asia, for example, it furthermore excludes a great many
decolonisation efforts that have taken place and continue to take place
in other regions. This includes countries that remained dependent or
only achieved semi-independence as dominions, decolonising projects
carried out in territories never formally under colonial rule (the
Iranian Revolution, for instance) and -- as is particularly important to
our discussion here -- settler colonies that only partially decolonised,
whether by way of loosening ties with the Motherland or achieving
independence, but which continue to dominate substantial indigenous
populations (Hopkins, 2008). There is a significant lacuna in the
decolonisation literature when it comes to settler colonialism, which
has increasingly been recognised as a distinct form of colonial practice
-- and one that is particularly resistant to decolonisation (Veracini,
2007). As the transfer of an exogenous population to a territory they
intend to claim as their permanent home, settler colonialism establishes
quite a different structural relationship to 'traditional' forms of
colonialism, especially when settler colonial projects succeed in
creating a state (Bateman and Pilkington, 2011). Rather than governing
native peoples in order to extract resources for economic gain, settler
colonisers instead aim to 'seize their land and push them beyond an
ever-expanding frontier of settlement' (Elkin and Pedersen, 2005: 2).
For Patrick Wolfe (2006), what distinguishes settler colonialism is thus
that it is guided by a logic of elimination as opposed to a logic of
exploitation, wherein the eradication of indigenous presence is
essential to the success of settler colonial projects. [The primacy of
national liberation in the literature makes it especially difficult to
imagine, let alone theorise, decolonisation in many settler colonial
contexts.]{.underline} Whereas some settler colonial projects like
Algeria and Kenya saw decolonisation by way of a mass settler exodus,
paving the way for the establishment of independent states, the more
successful ones established permanent settler communities (e.g. Northern
Ireland) or their own states (e.g. Australia, Canada, the United States)
which preclude a simple transition from foreign rule to sovereign status
(Veracini, 2007). This is of course not to say that self-determination
of the type aspired to by anti-colonial national movements was an easy
or even necessarily achievable task. As Kohn and McBride (2011) suggest,
[in pursuing the dream of self-rule, anti-colonial thinkers had to
reckon with the difficulties of articulating alternative political
foundations that would make for a genuinely self-determining polity, an
enormous task which **[demands decolonising of minds as much
institutions and territory]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Fanon,
2001\[1963\]). Decolonisation must pursue a convincing 'break' between a
colonial past and a postcolonial future 'through decisive action in the
present'; it must also 'seek to reinterpret the past in such a way that
it may help in the present and future struggle for self-rule' (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 19). While these pursuits are invariably contingent,
partial and commonly symbolic, national liberation struggles very often
provide the fodder for a reinterpreted past that is robustly positive
and the establishment of an independent state serves as that aspired for
'break'. Settler colonial contexts, especially those where indigenous
peoples live as minorities in settler states, make these types of
symbolic transitions challenging, as they do the imagining of
postcolonial alternatives. If the narrative structure of colonialism is
circular (leave, stay, return), making that symbolic break possible,
settler colonial narratives are linear insofar as the settler comes to
stay and the line continues on unbroken (Veracini, 2007). As Ann
Curthoys (1999: 288) writes, **[[settler colonial spaces are
simultaneously colonial and postcolonial]{.mark}, colonising and
decolonising, [which makes decolonisation]{.mark} temporally [ambivalent
at best]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Lorenzo Veracini (2007) suggests that
there are only two alternatives to settler evacuation for decolonising
settler colonial forms and [it is dubious whether one of these counts as
decolonisation at all: the [decolonisation]{.mark} of
relationships]{.underline} through 'the promotion of various processes
of Indigenous reconciliation' [or the]{.underline} maintenance of the
status quo 'with the [explicit rejection of the possibility of reforming
the settler body politic']{.underline}. Again, **[what the former might
mean [is often vague]{.mark}, and historically it is the decolonisation
of relationships that is hardest to come by considering the
psychological consequences of colonialism for coloniser and colonised
alike]{.underline}** (Memmi, 1965). Like traditional forms of
colonialism, settler colonialism was legitimated by a belief in the
colonised's racial and cultural inferiority. However, the specific
settler colonial pursuit of land seizure compels additional stereotypes
of native peoples or unique applications of existing colonial ones,
wherein their supposed inferiority makes them ill-equipped to develop
that land (pre-modern, nomadic, barbaric) or, alternatively, voids any
claims to ownership (terra nullius). In other words, settler colonialism
is as much premised on the denial of indigenous peoples as a political
constituency with rights to land as it is their purported inferiority,
which is typically enshrined in their status as second-class citizens
with all the economic, cultural and social disadvantage this entails
(Bateman and Pilkington, 2011: 3). [Given that settler societies are
marked by 'pervasive inequalities, usually codified in law, between
native and settler populations' which preserve]{.underline} political
and economic [privileges for the latter]{.underline} (Elkin and
Pedersen, 2005: 4), **[[decolonising relationships demands structural
changes that often encounter significant resistance from settler
constituencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Likewise, it requires a reckoning
with historical injustice -- specifically violence and conflict at the
colonial frontier -- that is challenging for settler states and
populations because it opens questions of settler identity, privileges,
legitimacy and reparations and expressly seeks to scrutinise disavowed
and long suppressed histories. [Settler colonial [decolonisation
is]{.mark} thus [complicated by a multitude of hurdles,]{.mark} which
bring the]{.underline} postcolonial caution of the [impossibility of a
'break' into stark relief.]{.underline} Kohn and McBride (2011) suggest
that [**[decisive action in the present is essential to
decolonisation]{.mark}**, but in settler colonial contexts **[this is
hindered by power discrepancies between settler and native
constituencies,]{.mark} a general [lack of settler political
will]{.mark}** to enter into difficult processes of historical
introspection **[as well as the constraining of Indigenous
claims]{.mark} within the settler state**.]{.underline} Indeed, even a
commitment to a postcolonial polity as expressed through processes of
historical reconciliation often encounters strong resistance when it
comes to judicial, constitutional or legislative change genuinely
decolonised relationships would demand. Nevertheless, even if it remains
difficult to comprehensively imagine the decolonisation of 'settler
societies vis-à-vis Indigenous constituencies' (Veracini, 2007), [[the
central question must be how to construct political foundations
which]{.mark} simultaneously [acknowledge]{.mark} 'the practices of
[racism, violence and subordination']{.mark}]{.underline} (Kohn and
McBride, 2011: 18) [that preceded them [while also **paving the way for
a postcolonial future in which natives and settlers are equal**]{.mark}
**parties [and share the right to narrate the
polity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Equality, freedom and justice may come
from legally enshrining Indigenous rights to self-determination or,
alternatively, doing away with the categories of 'settler' and 'native'
altogether (Mamdani, 2001). What shape such efforts are likely to take
depends, among others, on the 'size and tenacity' of Indigenous
populations as well as the power of the settler constituency (Elkin and
Pedersen, 2005: 3, 6). But we would suggest that the measure to which
they may be thought of as decolonising rests on the robustness of the
relationship they envision and the space they carve for equal membership
in and to a postcolonial polity.
