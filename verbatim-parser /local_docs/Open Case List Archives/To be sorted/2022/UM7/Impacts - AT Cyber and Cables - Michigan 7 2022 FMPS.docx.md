When Russian forces launched their invasion of Ukraine last month,
governments and [experts]{.underline} worldwide [warned about the danger
of catastrophic cyberattacks]{.underline}. Indeed, in the days leading
up to Moscow's invasion, hackers defaced Ukrainian websites, unleashed
malware on government systems, and targeted the country's banking
system---albeit with limited effect. [Although [no cyber-Armageddon has
materialized, officials]{.mark} increasingly [fear]{.mark} that [Russia
might]{.mark} eventually [step up]{.mark} its efforts]{.underline} and
even target the United States.

Russia's invasion is no doubt catastrophic. But in reacting to it and
preparing for what comes next[, [leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Washington and elsewhere [[should eschew the **alarmism** that]{.mark}
has long **[warped cybersecurity]{.mark}** policy.]{.underline} Mike
Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, claimed in 2011 that
"the single biggest existential threat out there, I think, is cyber."
The following year, his successor, Martin Dempsey, noted that "a
cyberattack could stop our society in its tracks." Former Defense
Secretary Leon Panetta sternly warned in 2012 of an impending "digital
Pearl Harbor." Nicole Perlroth, a cybersecurity reporter at The New York
Times, has routinely asked insiders when "a cyber-enabled cataclysmic
boom will take us down" and has always been told "18 to 24 months." She
began her survey well over 100 months ago.

This contemporary approach to cyberthreats resembles the aftermath of
9/11, when almost all experts believed an even larger terrorist attack
would soon take place. Then, as now, [[the threat is
overblown]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although occasionally dramatic[,
[cyberattacks have]{.mark} [turned out to be]{.mark} a comparatively
minor and [manageable]{.mark} threat. Far too much [discussion
around]{.mark} the issue focuses on [worst-case scenarios,]{.mark} fails
to contextualize the problem, and [neglects to weigh the costs of
cyberattacks]{.mark} against the enormous value of the Internet and
artificial intelligence. [Most]{.mark} commentary]{.underline},
moreover, [[does not]{.underline}]{.mark} fully [[appreciate the
ability]{.mark} of the business sector]{.underline}---by far the most
tempting of targets for malevolent hackers---[[to develop]{.mark}
effective [countermeasures]{.mark}]{.underline}.

CYBERWAR

Over the past decade, the global obsession with digital threats has
taken various forms, with a particular focus on the potential military
implications of emerging cyber-capabilities. To be sure, [[the military
needs to worry about]{.mark} keeping its [communications]{.mark} and
command and control operations secure from hostile attackers. [Any
disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [are [more likely to be
instrumental or tactical than strategic]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Despite statements to the contrary, the U.S. military itself seems to
have recognized this reality. When Panetta proclaimed in 2013 that cyber
was "without question, the battlefield for the future," political
scientist Micah Zenko observed at the time that the Pentagon was
spending less than one percent of its budget on cybersecurity, and an
assessment from 2019 suggests it may be more like one-tenth of one
percent. If those funds prove adequate for the challenge, it would be
something of a bargain.

Cyber also supposedly enhances a state's ability to carry out such
ancient endeavors as espionage, propaganda dissemination, and sabotage.
Analysts have even coined a new term, ["hybrid warfare,"]{.underline}
that usually includes these three enterprises---although, since the term
does not include direct armed conflict, it might [more plausibly be
called "denatured warfare." Cyber's contribution]{.underline} to these
three areas, however[, is relatively limited.]{.underline}

[[Should invading hackers engage in]{.mark} digital [espionage]{.mark}
against the United States]{.underline}, for instance, [[they are likely
to find that most of what they come across is already well
known]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that much of the rest is not worth
knowing in the first place. Wikileaks' 2010 publication of thousands of
classified U.S. government documents demonstrated the degree to which
governments worldwide have fallen victim to over-classification. When
Bill Keller, the editor in charge of poring over the documents at The
New York Times, was asked whether the reporting team found anything they
didn't already know, he responded "no" without hesitation.

Much the same holds for concerns over the theft of intellectual
property. Not only is this practice centuries old, but systematic
stealing has often proved unwise because it distracts governments from
homegrown innovation. [[Cyber-propaganda efforts]{.mark},]{.underline}
in turn, [[are more likely to increase the overall amount of available
info]{.mark}rmation and disinformation]{.underline}---an age-old problem
in warfare---than to provide a decisive advantage.

The achievements of cyber-sabotage have also been quite modest. The
United States and Israel famously used a computer virus known as Stuxnet
to hamper Iran's progress toward developing a nuclear weapon. Although
observers hailed the operation as a dangerous new development in modern
conflict, the damage proved temporary. Iran quickly rebuilt its
centrifuges, and the attack actually proved counterproductive, as it
encouraged Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program. There have also
been efforts by the United States to physically interfere with missile
development in North Korea. Yet, much like the Iranians, Pyongyang
eventually solved whatever the problem was, and the attacks had little
long-term effect on their program.

[Cyber-[alarmists have also warned about]{.mark} hackers disabling major
[infrastructure]{.mark} such as power grids]{.underline}---potentially
~~crippling~~ entire countries[[. Grids do go down]{.mark} occasionally,
[but the **culprits are typically squirrels**]{.mark} and
lightning]{.underline}. Regardless of the source, [[such
disruptions]{.mark} [are]{.mark} usually [brief]{.mark} and
bearable,]{.underline} and engineers are increasingly designing systems
that are resilient to such threats. Estonia, for instance, the victim of
a major and oft-discussed cyberattack in 2007, is now the home of NATO's
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence.

CYBERTERRORISM

[Fears that terrorist groups could inflict damage through
cyberspace]{.underline} have been around for many years. And although
cyber played no direct role in the execution of the 9/11 terrorist, the
event stirred anxiety about the issue. In 2002, for instance, The
Washington Post published a lengthy front-page article conveying the
views of "government experts" that "terrorists are at the threshold of
using the Internet as a direct instrument of bloodshed."

[To date]{.underline}, however, [[no terrorist group has launched a
successful cyberattack]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [[even if it becomes
possible for hackers to shed blood, shootings]{.mark} and bombings are
likely to [accomplish the same goal far more
reliably]{.mark}.]{.underline} Still, cyber has undoubtedly proved to be
a relatively convenient method for terrorist groups to recruit and
communicate. Rather than creating a paradigm shift, however, this
technique has simply replaced or embellished older methods. [[Even
comparatively savvy groups]{.mark} such as the Islamic
State]{.underline} (also known as ISIS) [[tend to comically fail when
using the Internet]{.mark} to stir up violence and instruct potential
sympathizers]{.underline}. In one case, [[an ISIS handler connected his
eager]{.mark} American [charge to a]{.mark}]{.underline} prospective
collaborator who happened to be [an [FBI operative.]{.underline}]{.mark}

For the most part, any virtual terrorist army in the United States has,
as terrorism expert Brian Jenkins puts it, remained exactly that:
virtual. "Talking about jihad, boasting of what one will do, and
offering diabolical schemes egging each other on is usually as far as it
goes," he noted. Indeed, [t[he foolish willingness of would-be
terrorists]{.mark} to describe their aspirations and often-childish
fantasies on the Internet has [often helped police seeking to track them
down]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

ELECTION MEDDLING

[Election interference also features prominently in alarmist discourse
on cyberthreats]{.underline}. During the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, for instance, the United States highlighted apparent attempts
by Russian hackers to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. Although
Clinton still handily won the popular vote, many analysts argued that
digital interlopers sought to undermine the integrity of U.S. elections
and perhaps democracy itself.

[These warnings are exaggerated and]{.underline}---coming from U.S.
policymakers---[arguably hypocritical]{.underline}. It is worth noting
that the United States has intervened in foreign elections for decades.
Moreover, [the idea that elections and voters are easily manipulated is
suspect]{.underline}. If extensive promotion could guarantee success,
Americans would all be driving Edsels and drinking New Coke---legendary
marketing failures in 1958 and 1985 by two of the most successful
businesses in history: the Ford Motor Company and Coca-Cola. [In any
capitalist society, people are regularly deluged by advertising and
marketing campaigns]{.underline}. In all cases[, those petitioned remain
free to ignore the ads]{.underline}, and most become quite good at it.
In fact, studies have shown that campaign information rarely changes
many votes. As political scientist Diana Mutz points out, [the impact of
campaign advertising "is marginal at most]{.underline}."

Political campaigns, as anyone who has suffered through one knows, are
also rife with falsehoods: incumbents strategically distort their
record, and challengers do the same in reverse. [The 2016 Russian
contribution to this flood of misinformation was tin]{.underline}y. On
Facebook, where most of the manipulation supposedly took place, Moscow's
intervention totaled perhaps a fraction one percent of the content on
the platform's news feed. [Much of this was also wasted because the
people who embraced it were already committed to a particular party or
lived in states that went solidly for one or the other
candidate.]{.underline} Russia's efforts, moreover, proved wildly
counterproductive. Instead of weakening U.S. policy, Moscow generated
bipartisan support for anti-Russian sanctions when the two U.S.
political parties could agree on little else.

CYBERCRIME

Despite the overheated rhetoric about war, terrorism, election
interference, and critical infrastructure, [[most cyberattacks target
the private sector]{.underline}]{.mark}, seeking to steal or extort
money from businesses and their customers. [[The record]{.mark}
here]{.underline}, however, [[is]{.mark} rather
[encouraging]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and it likely has broader
relevance. To be sure, cybercriminals have stolen and extorted billions
of dollars from businesses and individuals, but [firms]{.mark} [[have
done well at limiting the damage by closing software holes]{.mark},
maintaining backups, [and safeguarding sensitive
material.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A central issue for potential hackers is the profitability of their
enterprise. A report by the cybersecurity firm Symantec estimates that
978 million people were affected by cybercrime in 2017, losing \$172
billion in total. That number---regardless of how hackers divvy up the
profits---is actually remarkably small compared to losses from other
forms of illegal activity. Personal and property crimes in 2017, for
instance, cost Americans \$2.6 trillion.

[[Businesses are]{.mark} also [learning to adapt.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Andrew Odlyzko, former head of the University of Minnesota's Digital
Technology Center, points out that [[many]{.mark} firms have [realized
they can readily mitigate the most damaging effects of cybercrime
through minor]{.mark} and incremental [alterations]{.mark} to their
business practices.]{.underline} Banks, for instance, increasingly
require customers to verify large or suspicious transactions through
voice calls or texts. And even though criminals routinely capture
millions of credit card numbers through compromised databases, [[the
overall damage is limited]{.mark} and often dominated [by the cost of
providing replacement cards]{.mark}]{.underline}. Businesses have also
made it easy for consumers to recover from fraud.

RESILIENCE AND PEARL HARBOR

Despite Panetta's 2012 analogy, the value of adaptation and resilience
are illustrated, not shattered, by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.
From a strictly military standpoint, the assault proved to be more of an
inconvenience than a disaster. The U.S. Navy quickly made repairs and
the result was a loss of two aged ships. All the planes lost could be
replaced by new and better models within three days at eventual 1942
production rates. The loss of life was, of course, tragic, but the flood
of outraged men who deluged recruiting stations in the following days
almost instantly compensated for the casualties.

[The [Pearl Harbor]{.mark} experience, then, [does not support
alarmism]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, it shows [that [if a system is
resilient, even successful]{.underline}]{.mark}[, dramatic, and
dastardly surprise [attacks can be managed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

outlandish claims\

We are everywhere, and yet almost impossible to find. [There are other
events that have impacted critical infrastructure:]{.underline} a water
pump failure in Illinois, power outages in Brazil, a pipeline explosion
in Turkey, a cyberattack on a dam in New York; even a blast furnace in a
German steel plant was supposedly put into an uncontrolled shutdown from
a cyberattack[. In each case, the initial cause for the [failure was
blamed on cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline} --- but in each case, [once
the evidence was actually examined, [hackers were nowhere to be
found.]{.mark}]{.underline} Still, [[that]{.mark} lack of evidence
[hasn't stopped the cyberwar hawks]{.mark} from pointing to these analog
events as examples of the coming digital doom]{.underline}. When that
doesn't work, the threatmongers and profiteers point to previous
widespread blackouts, known as "black swan" events because of their
rarity, such as the Northeast blackout of 2003 or the Southwest blackout
of 2011. In both cases, a string of unlikely events occurred, including
human error, before the lights went out. In both cases, most of the
power was restored in just a few hours. [[There were no]{.mark} riots,
no financial [meltdowns]{.mark}, and democracy continued unabated. Then
there's what we affectionately call the "nine substation
problem]{.underline}." After a bunch of armed assailants opened fire on
a substation outside of Metcalf, California, in 2013, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission (FERC) conducted a study of the national power
grid and found that if just nine substations were attacked in a similar
manner as the one in Metcalf, the entire United States would be without
power for over 18 months. Are you freaked out yet? Good. But the problem
is: [This scenario is extremely unlikely.]{.underline} First, [that FERC
study only looked at physical damage to the transformers, which are
usually custom-built for each location, and are only manufactured by a
few companies]{.underline} --- [meaning a substation could take months
to replace]{.underline}. Second, [the study only looked at physical
damage, which in the event of a cyberattack is extremely
unlikely]{.underline}. But still, the prophets of doom ask, what if
hackers had guns? Didn't you see Skyfall?! No, we didn't. We're
squirrels. Look, [even for our billion-strong army]{.underline} of small
rodents --- in the United States alone --- [the "attack surface" for the
U.S. electric grid is absolutely huge.]{.underline} There are over 7,000
power plants in the United States run by over 3,000 companies. There are
over 55,000 substations and over 450,000 miles of high-voltage
transmission lines. We squirrels have a hard enough time trying to take
out small sections of it, let alone nine substations at once. Anyone
attempting to conduct a major coordinated effort to turn out power over
a large region for a long period of time is going to find it a rather
difficult task. Not that we're not trying. [As of July of this year we
[squirrels]{.mark}]{.underline} (and our fellow animal operatives)
[[have conducted over 1,400]{.mark} unclassified [operations that have
resulted in]{.mark} aggregate of more than [67 days without
powe]{.mark}r]{.underline}, affecting over 3.6 million people. [That
works out to the entire population of the state of Connecticut losing
electricity for more than two months.]{.underline} And remember: Our
unclassified ops are just a fraction of the total. On average, we cause
dozens of outages every day impacting about 5,000 people each for around
two hours. [[Compare]{.mark} that [with the number of outages caused by
cyberattack]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} in the United States [is exactly
zero]{.mark}.]{.underline} And yet we get no respect. [[We've hit the
NASDAQ]{.mark} stock exchange [twice,]{.mark} as well as the Large
Hadron Collider]{.underline} in Geneva. [We've hit]{.underline} 64
schools, 30 universities, 13 [[hospitals]{.underline}]{.mark}, six
government buildings, four [[airports, and]{.underline}]{.mark} even two
[[military bases]{.mark}.]{.underline} And yes[, our unclassified
operations have caused seven confirmed deaths]{.underline}. Despite that
carnage, [your policy officials still just worry about massive
cyberattacks directed by Beijing and Moscow]{.underline}. (Oh, don't
worry: We've got agents there too.) Look, [[cyberwar]{.mark} in one form
or another [has been prophesied for]{.mark} over [35 years.]{.mark}
B]{.underline}ut if things got so bad China and Russia were to
intentionally cause a widespread, long-term power outage, you've got to
believe the United States --- and the world --- would have much greater
things to worry about at that point. The ICBMs would already be flying.
[Minor threat actors such as North Korea, hacktivists, or the Islamic
State lack the time, money, and coordination to pull off a black swan
event.]{.underline} Not that they lack the skill, mind you. Let's face
it: The cybersecurity of the U.S. electrical grid is absolutely pitiful.
It wouldn't take a team of geniuses to cut off the power to any large
city. However, s[imply causing an electricity outage and keeping the
power offline are two different things.]{.underline} In Ukraine, for
example, linemen drove out to each substation and switched them back to
manual control; power was back on in just a few hours. Yes, [there is a
risk to the electric grid from a cyberattack, but that threat is nowhere
near the levels of fear, uncertainty, and doubt being peddled by
policymakers, threat reduction firms, and cyberwar hawks]{.underline}.
[[If you really want to stop the ongoing, constant attacks on the U.S.
electrical grid, there's an easy way: call Orkin]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Until then, we are anonymous, we are legion, we are your unfriendly
neighborhood squirrels.

#### Aldanova goes neg! Recut gives multiple reasons why cyberattacks are non-UQ, the squo solves, and why Russia will never attack

**1AC Aldanova 22** - *Master's Candidate at Georgetown University's

America?,"

Policy circles in Washington are now debating how Vladimir Putin might
respond to a major contraction of the Russian economy and clear signs
that Moscow is losing the war in Ukraine. Some posit that a cornered
president, furious and facing a near defeat, might indeed respond
brutally---moving the proxy confrontation of a new Cold War front to a
cyber battlefield, where Russia has a greater advantage, and launching a
massive cyberattack against the United States. However, several key
factors call this thesis into question.

Similar to Iran and North Korea, Russia is known to be responsible for
some of the most aggressive, large-scale cyberattacks. However, these
[[cyber tactics have played a]{.mark} rather [peripheral role]{.mark},
either in supporting conventional warfare or through disinformation
campaigns that serve to spread chaos and panic among targeted
societies.]{.underline} For the first time, a known state-backed attack
occurred in 2007 and lasted for twenty-two days when the Russian
military intelligence unit, the GRU, targeted Estonian commercial,
government, and Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and online banking
systems. The attacks fell under the Denial of Service (DoS) and
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) categories that include methods
such as ping flooding, spam distribution, botnets, and phishing emails.
In 2008, as a part of hybrid warfare amid the occupation of Abkhazia and
South Ossetia, Russia defaced Georgian state websites. In 2015,
following the annexation of Crimea and the occupation of eastern
Ukraine, a GRU proxy group named Sandworm attacked the Ukrainian power
grid and deprived more than 200,000 people of electricity for six hours.
In 2017, the NotPetya malware attack directed at Ukraine had an
unprecedented impact hitting major Western companies in Europe and the
United States such as Mondelez International and Maersk, and even
striking back at Russian oil company Rosneft. It paralyzed thousands of
networks. The global cost the malware had provoked reached \$10
billion---encapsulating the most consequential cyber attack in history.
In addition, [just a month ago, Russia [unsuccessfully attempted to
attack]{.mark} the [Ukrainian power grid]{.mark} with advanced malware
classified as a wiper]{.underline}. Overseas, a Russian group of hackers
called FancyBear meddled with the United States 2015 presidential
campaigns and 2016 federal elections at the county level. [To this
point, while the Russian cyber tactics are common and multifarious,
[they represent a secondary function in hybrid warfare]{.mark} that
Moscow conducts along with disinformation campaigns and conventional
military operations.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, cybersecurity experts speculate on a range of consequences
in a worst-case cyber scenario: Russia might attempt to attack U.S.
critical infrastructure, turn off the lights, target the operation of
ATMs and credit card systems, attack Amazon's cloud, disrupt the
transportation and supply of clean water, and target pharmaceuticals
companies' manufacturing facilities, power grids, and colonial
pipelines. But will such a threat manifest?

[Not only would [a cyberattack against]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [contradict]{.mark} [the historically peripheral nature
of Russian cyber warfare]{.mark}, but Russia's [cyber capacity would
be]{.mark} [insufficient]{.mark} for the task.]{.underline} For the past
several years, [the [West]{.underline}]{.mark} [has largely
[overestimated Russian military capabilities]{.mark} in conventional
warfare]{.underline}. U.S. intelligence agencies predicted the 2022 war
in Ukraine would be the most destructive the European continent has seen
since the end of World War II, expecting the fall of Kyiv to come within
days. However, the still ongoing, drawn-out war has revealed weaknesses
in the Russian armed forces, its military arsenal, and strategic
leadership. Russian officials, for their part, underestimated the
strength of the Ukrainian resistance and the united position of the
international community. Spending slightly more than 4 percent of the
country's GDP on the military, the Russian president mobilizes domestic
support for the military budget by articulating the external threat of
NATO. [In a relatively undigitized society like Russia, [lobbying to
spend more on]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} budget [would prove less
effective.]{.mark} Taking this into account, it seems possible the West
could be overestimating Russian cyber competence as well.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [Russia is [unlikely to wage a cyberattack on the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [due to fear of retali]{.mark}ation on
multiple fronts. Russian [society is already experiencing]{.mark} the
consequences that the war has wrought: an [economic crisis and]{.mark}
the [psychological pressure]{.mark} of being cast as a global
pariah.]{.underline} In case of a Russian cyberattack, the [consequences
of U.S. cyber retaliation would hit the public first.]{.underline} Given
current conditions, depriving people of water and electricity could
trigger public discontent on an unprecedented scale. Decades of
increasingly authoritarian leadership have undoubtedly engendered public
grievances hidden deep within society[. At some point, this simmering
[disgruntlement can boil over into outrage]{.mark}. Putin can ill afford
to front further domestic unrest now.]{.underline}

Current U[.S. [cyber capabilities could]{.mark} also [contribute to the
fear of retaliation]{.mark}. For the past few years, the United States
ha[s developed an]{.mark} impressive [cyberinfrastructure,]{.mark}
[restructured its system of governance]{.mark}, and [invested in cyber
training and education]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As Richard Clarke
and Robert Knake emphasize in their book, The Fifth Domain, following
the Cold War strategy of deterrence and containment, t[he United States
has largely [restrained itself from]{.mark} involvement in [cyber
counter activities]{.mark}. Although for a long time America has focused
on defensive cyber policy, today, the U.S. Cyber Command prioritizes
offensive measures]{.underline}. As such, in 2019, the United States
successfully targeted the Iranian intelligence service and missile
launch system as a response to an Iranian strike against an American
drone and U.S. oil tankers. Earlier in 2012, the Stuxnet computer worm,
designed in cooperation with Israel, successfully infiltrated nuclear
facilities in Iran.

[In addition to an offensive preference[, **a more consolidated system
of governance**]{.mark} **and a set of regulations [have advanced U.S.
cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A **clear [allocation of]{.mark}
[roles and responsibilities]{.mark}** [between the D]{.mark}epartment of

incidents and information sharing. It [facilitated communication within
federal agencies]{.mark} and between the government, the private sector,
[and the public.]{.mark}]{.underline} [U.S. private enterprises now
spend billions of dollars on cybersecurity, employee training, and
encrypted channels]{.underline}. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
also [takes a leading role in]{.mark} [collaborating with]{.mark}

[But as the invasion continues with few signs of any sophisticated cyber
conflict, it seems [less and]{.mark} [less likely]{.mark} that [Russia
has significant cyber capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} in reserve,
ready to deploy if needed. Instead, it begins to **[look like
[Russia's]{.mark} much [vaunted]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark} capabilities have
been [neglected in recent years]{.mark},]{.underline}** in favor of
developing less expensive, less effective cyber weapons that cause less
widespread damage and are considerably easier to contain and defend
against. For instance, [[many]{.mark} of the [cyberattacks]{.mark}
directed [at Ukraine]{.mark} in the past month have [been]{.mark}
relatively [basic]{.mark} distributed [denial-of-service
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}, in which hackers bombard
Ukrainian government websites and servers with so much online traffic
that those servers cannot respond to legitimate users and are forced
offline for some period of time. [Denial-of-service attacks can be
effective for short-term disruptions but they're **[hardly]{.mark} a

fact, they're what Russia used to target Estonia more than a decade ago
in 2007. Moreover, launching these types of attacks requires no
sophisticated technical capabilities or discovery of new
vulnerabilities, and they typically have fairly contained impacts on the
specific, targeted computers. Similarly, recent reports that Belarusian
hackers are trying to phish European officials using compromised
accounts belonging to Ukrainian armed services members suggests that not
only are these efforts relying on fairly basic tactics like phishing
emails, [they are not even being carried out by Russian military hackers
directly.]{.underline}

### AT: EMPs

#### EMP's unlikely -- too widescale and require untenable power

**Gault 19** -- *The National Interest is an extremely un-biased and
factual news source funded by an established think tank* (Matthew Gault,
11-10-2019, \"The World Won\'t End: The Danger of an EMP Attack Is More
Fantasy Than Fact,\" National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/world-wont-end-danger-emp-attack-more-fantasy-fact-94681)//KH

Key point: A nuclear war is scarier and besides it isn\'t so easy to
generate a really large EMP burst.

Few weapons are as scary as those that exist only in our minds.

A few years ago when the Republican Party released its platform to the
public in the run-up to its national convention at the tail end of a
section titled "America Resurgent," GOP leaders detailed what they felt
is a looming threat of America --- electromagnetic pulses.

"A single nuclear weapon detonated at high altitude over this country
would collapse our electrical grid and other critical infrastructures
and endanger the lives of millions," the platform stated. "With North
Korea in possession of nuclear missiles and Iran close to having them,
[an [EMP is]{.mark} [no longer a theoretical]{.mark} concern --- it is a
real threat."]{.underline}

**[[But it's not.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The problem with fear over electromagnetic weapons is that it forgets
two simple facts. [First, [generating enough juice]{.mark} to cause a
significant amount of damage [is really hard.]{.mark} Second, [a country
dealing with busted electronics]{.mark} after an EMP assault [is]{.mark}
a country [fighting a nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"EMP is the new test case of seriousness in national security," cyber
security expert Peter W. Singer tweeted after reading the platform. "But
not in the way advocates not in on the joke think."

I reached out to Singer and, after a brief pause to make sure I was
serious, he pounced. "[There's this irony of the people who think it's
serious not realizing that they're the joke," he explained. "When you
walk through the actual scenarios of use, [it doesn't pass the logic
test."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[An [e]{.mark}lectro[m]{.mark}agnetic [p]{.mark}ulse [following a
nuclear blast is]{.mark} a [real]{.mark} thing.]{.underline} The problem
is that the process of [[creating an EMP]{.mark} big enough [without the
devastation]{.mark} of a nuclear warhead [is expensive, absurd and not
worth the effort]{.mark}. That's [if it]{.mark} even
[works.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For that, we can't recommend enough a 2010 series of articles in The
Space Review by Yousaf M. Butt, a physicist currently serving as a
foreign affairs officer in the State Department's Space and Advanced
Technology office.

"For a large device (greater than 100 kilotons) .... the whole region on
the Earth's surface which is within line-of-sight to the high-altitude
explosion will experience the EMP pulse," he wrote.

Which sounds scary, but there are several important caveats. [The
[higher you detonate a nuclear device]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the greater
the blast radius. However, [the effect of the EMP will be less]{.mark}.
Likewise, the smaller the explosive yield, the smaller the EMP and the
closer the blast will need to be to the ground to be
effective.]{.underline}

Finding that detonation sweet-spot in the Earth's atmosphere will take
countless tests ... which no one has done.

[The blast Butt described above, [one that knocks out the entire
electrical system]{.mark} on roughly half the Earth's surface, [could
only come from]{.mark} a high-yield thermonuclear warhead attached to
[an ICBM.]{.mark} So, engaging in the fantasist view, [a nuke from
Russia or China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Setting aside the geopolitical gymnastics that must occur to lead to
that kind of exchange, [if a foreign power detonated a 100 or more
kiloton in an electromagnetic attack on America, then the world is at
war and there's [little strategic benefit for the aggressor]{.mark} to
not just go ahead and nuke a city.]{.underline}

"It doesn't mean it can't happen," Singer told me. "But [if the other
side is using EMPs we're moving into thermonuclear war."]{.underline}

"A weapon of mass destruction is preferable to a weapon of mass
disruption," Butt explained. "[A [state would be highly unlikely to
launch an EMP strike]{.mark} from their own territory [because the
rocket could be traced to the country of origin]{.mark} and would
probably result in nuclear or massive conventional retaliation by the
U.S."]{.underline}

Let's say the EMP does go off in space above North America. According to
the worst case scenario, the attack would fry the Pentagon's
electronics, leaving the U.S. military unable to retaliate.

However, [we don't know what the effects of an EMP might be. [Studies
conducted]{.mark} by both the Soviet Union and the United States during
the Cold War [produced dramatically different results every
time.]{.mark}]{.underline}

An electromagnetic pulse is a [highly unpredictable side
effect]{.underline} of a predictably horrifying weapon. "It's not a
weapon we've seen past use of. Ever. Literally ever. Nor tests of,"
Singer said.

Some countries have attempted to weaponize EMPs in fits and starts, but
it remains a byproduct of other weapons systems, including cruise
missiles as well as nukes. The idea of North Korea or Iran using a
small-yield nuclear device in low atmosphere fails for the same reasons.
North Korea can barely manage to cobble together a crude one-kiloton
bomb, let alone a device large enough to do significant damage to U.S.
infrastructure.

"Serious long-lasting consequences of a one-kiloton EMP strike would
likely be limited to a state-sized region of the country," Butt
explained.

"[Although grid outages in this region may have cascading knock-on
effects in more distant parts of the country, the electronic devices in
those further regions would not have suffered direct damage, and the
[associated power systems far from the EMP]{.mark} exposed region [could
be re-started]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

## AT: Undersea Cables

### 1NC/2AC

#### Redundancy solves

**Hinck 2018** - PhD Student @ Columbia Garrett, \"Evaluating the
Russian Threat to Undersea Cables,\" Mar 15,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/evaluating-russian-threat-undersea-cables

[[Hundreds of cables criss-cross the oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}. They
provide the connectivity that allows Microsoft to keep major data
centers in Ireland and to have that data nearly instantly accessible to
U.S. customers. [Although each undersea cable transmits huge quantities
of data, [the cable network has significant redundancy
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Rupturing one cable can cause
temporary disruptions but does not cut off service. [[When a major
cable]{.mark} to Vietnam [failed last year, customers]{.mark} in Ho Chi
Minh City [briefly lost connectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Because
internet routing protocols direct data around points of failure]{.mark},
traffic flows adjust to the lost connection and send data over other
cables to the same endpoint. Wayward anchors and storms regularly cause
cable faults, about 200 a year; repair ships are readily available to
mend broken lines[. [Cutting the United States off from the rest of the
world would require severing a large number of cables]{.mark}: at least
18 in the North Atlantic alone]{.underline}, according to
Telegeography's cable map, and many more connecting the U.S. to Latin
America and Asia.

#### Russia won't snip cables -- and they can be repaired quickly

**Matsakis 2018** - Louise, \"What Would Really Happen If Russia
Attacked Undersea Internet Cables,\" Jan 5,
https://www.wired.com/story/russia-undersea-internet-cables/

Because faults happen so frequently, [[cable repair ships patrol]{.mark}
nearly all of [the world's waters]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Even if Russia
did start snipping]{.mark}, [there are crews equipped to rapidly
repair]{.mark} them]{.underline}. Besides, [[Russia's]{.mark} epic
hypothetical cable [attack would primarily harm its own
people]{.mark}]{.underline}, as another Telegeography analyst pointed
out in a video. "It [would hurt the Russians perhaps even [more than it
would hurt \[Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}\]. [[They're far more
dependent on international networks]{.underline}]{.mark} than we are,
because so much of our content is stored locally" says senior analyst
Jonathan Hjembo.

#### Their impact is too old to assume Starlink -- it removes the need for cables

**Isberto 2020** - Michael, \"Why Internet Satellites Will Replace
Subsea Cable Technology,\" Mar 4,
https://www.colocationamerica.com/blog/internet-satellites-will-rebuild-the-internet

[There are]{.underline} some obvious [[disadvantages
to]{.underline}]{.mark} this old system of [submarine
[cables]{.mark}]{.underline}. The underwater cable installation is very
slow, tedious, and expensive. Underwater creatures including sharks have
been seen chewing on the cables. Underwater cables have vulnerabilities
including boat anchors, natural disasters, etc. Underwater cables are
also not easy to repair if repairs are needed. Some of these cables are
6,500 feet underwater making it difficult to reach. Lastly, underwater
cables have a life expectancy of 25 years, and then they will need to be
replaced. All of these disadvantages [are [pushing companies like SpaceX
to rebuild the internet.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Rebuilding the Internet in Space

[Underwater [cables seem]{.mark} like [outdated]{.mark}
technology.]{.underline} Many people think that we transfer data through
satellites, but this isn't the norm, at least not yet. Last year, Elon
[[Musk revealed]{.mark}]{.underline} his plan to surround the world with
low Earth orbit satellites. The project, [[Starlink, will bring]{.mark}
satellite broadband [internet]{.mark} service [to the
world]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} United States Federal Communications Commission
([FCC]{.underline}) has already [authorized SpaceX to fly
12,000]{.underline} [satellites, and eventually as many as
30,000]{.underline}. There are about 2,000 satellites currently in
orbit. It seems as though the FCC is on board with this new idea of
rebuilding the internet in space.

Starlink's first 60 satellites were launched on May 23, 2019, by
SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket. The way these satellites work is by beaming
information through the vacuum of space instead of sending the internet
signals through electric cables. Information traveling through
satellites is transmitted 47% faster than the standard fiber optic
cables.

Current satellite internet works using a large spacecraft that orbits
22,236 miles above the earth. Because it's orbiting a lot higher and is
only above a specific spot on earth, there are substantial time delays
from sending and receiving data. [[Starlink's network would cover the
entirety of Earth and would be orbiting a lot lower making it faster and
more reliable connection]{.underline}]{.mark}.

SpaceX has launched the second batch of satellites in November 2019, and
more recently the third batch this past January 2020. They expect to
begin broadband service by the end of 2020.

Multiple companies are looking into creating low Earth Orbit (LEO)
satellite services besides SpaceX. These competitors include OneWeb,
Telesat, and LeoSat. All are hoping to deliver services better than
existing fiber-optic connections. Although SpaceX is ahead of the
competition, OneWeb expects to have enough satellites in space for
testing sometime in 2020 with hopes to have global coverage by 2021.

Data Centers in Space Could be Reality

A network of data centers orbiting the earth sounds like a farfetched
idea---or is it? Data centers powered by the sun and cooled by the
-454.75-degree Fahrenheit temperature of outer space might be the
perfect scenario for data center operations. Last year, SpaceX launched
a Tesla Roadster into space to show the possibilities. But for this to
be a feasible idea, they will need to find a way to make it more
affordable.

Based on SpaceX's pricing of \$90 million per 8000kgs, it would cost
\$330 million to put a 30,000kg, 96kW, 12-rack container data center
(with IT) into orbit. If they could somehow make this idea more
affordable, the possibilities could be endless.

[[Several startup companies are looking into creating a business model
for]{.mark} why the next frontier for [data centers should be in
space]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Some of these companies include
ConnectX and Laser Light Communications.

Once one of these companies figures out a way to lower the cost of these
projects of sending a data center into space, many companies would most
likely be on board. Many companies including Apple, Amazon, Target,
Walmart, and Google are already looking to renewable energy data center
options, and one that is powered by the sun and cooled by the
temperatures of outer space is as renewable as it can get.

Conclusion

Technology is changing the world and making it smaller and more
connected[. [Rebuilding the internet]{.underline}]{.mark} [in space is
already happening and [will most likely be in use by the end of
2020]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Having data centers located in space
could be the next achievement for the industry. Not only will it improve
on old technology that started in the 1800s, but it could also perhaps
be the solution to renewable energy that the data center industry is
looking for. With all of the data the world is producing and sharing
currently, this is a much-needed upgrade.

### 1AR -- L/T

#### Focusing NATO's output on force plans and strategy best improves interoperability and cohesion\-\--otherwise, spending is meaningless.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, however, noted how all allies
have halted cuts to their defense budgets and have begun implementing
plans to
[increase](https://warontherocks.com/2017/05/clearing-the-air-on-transatlantic-burden-sharing-part-1-whats-going-on-here/)
their defense budgets to two percent of their respective GDPs, with a
majority planning to reach that goal by
[2024](https://www.rferl.org/a/fifteen-of-29-nato-members-meet-defense-spending-goal-2-percent-gdp-by-2024-stoltenberg-says-mattis-pressure-brussels-meeting/29038749.html).
While Stoltenberg credited President Trump with delivering a "clear
message" on burden sharing, this debate misses an important point.
[[Simply]{.mark} **[spending more]{.mark}** [does not]{.mark}
**[equate]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} actual **[burden]{.mark}
[sharing]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

According to NATO's [Strategic
Concept](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49137.htm),
collective defense, crisis management, and collective security are the
alliance's core tasks. These missions require capable, mobile, and
interoperable forces. Real burden sharing would require every ally to
contribute forces ready to deploy for such missions.  

[[Defense
expenditure](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2017_06/20170629_170629-pr2017-111-en.pdf)
alone fails to measure]{.underline} real military
[capability]{.underline}, [let alone its use on the alliance's
behalf.]{.underline} Take the cases of
[Denmark](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/10/benchmark-blinding-us-nato-members-contributions/141736/)
and Greece. In
[2017](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2017_06/20170629_170629-pr2017-111-en.pdf),
Greece spent 2.32 percent of its GDP on defense, while Denmark spent
only 1.17 percent. Using the 2 percent goal as a benchmark, one would,
therefore, conclude that Greece is a model NATO partner while Denmark is
a free rider "taking advantage of the United States." These numbers,
however, do not accurately illustrate how these two nations actually
share the burden.

From
[Mali](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/10/benchmark-blinding-us-nato-members-contributions/141736/)
to [Libya](http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/59767) and
Afghanistan to Iraq, the Danish military is actively deployed in support
of NATO's out-of-area missions. Although it spends more than 2 percent
of its GDP on defense, Greece contributed none of its 21,500 [deployable
troops](https://eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/eda-national-defence-data-2013-2014-(2015-est)5397973fa4d264cfa776ff000087ef0f.pdf)
to NATO missions ([according to 2014 European Defense Agency
data](https://eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/documents/eda-national-defence-data-2013-2014-(2015-est)5397973fa4d264cfa776ff000087ef0f.pdf)).

The Danish and Greek militaries are not outliers---additional
[data](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/10/benchmark-blinding-us-nato-members-contributions/141736/)
shows similar discrepancies among other nations as well. The point is,
[NATO's needs are not met by spending 2 percent of GDP
alone]{.underline}. Members' contributions to NATO missions of capable,
ready, and deployable forces are what actually matter.

This was made clear once again, when three Czech soldiers serving with
NATO\'s Resolute Support mission were killed in Afghanistan by a suicide
bomber. The Czech Republic had recently approved a
[plan](https://www.npr.org/2018/08/05/635741406/3-czech-nato-service-members-killed-in-afghanistan)
to deploy 390 soldiers in Afghanistan through 2020, up from the current
230. While the Czech Republic has not yet met the two percent of GDP
spending goal, it does participate in NATO missions fighting, dying and
[sharing](http://carnegieeurope.eu/strategiceurope/59767) the risk
alongside their deployed counterparts.

[While [allies]{.mark} should meet their two percent of GDP
commitment]{.underline}, [they [should]{.mark} also **[spend]{.mark}**
that **[money]{.mark}** more **wisely**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}

#### Arctic presence is counter-productive for NATO

\"NATO IN THE ARCTIC: KEEP ITS ROLE LIMITED, FOR NOW,\" Oct 12,
https://warontherocks.com/2020/10/nato-in-the-arctic-keep-its-role-limited-for-now/

[While NATO members are facing several challenges to their interests in
the Arctic, developing a common policy within the alliance on what to do
about this is incredibly difficult]{.underline}. [[NATO decisions depend
on consensus,]{.mark}]{.underline} or at least on members withholding a
veto of a pending initiative. [[Just because there are]{.mark} five NATO
[members in the Arctic does not mean that each supports a greater NATO
role in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada's Arctic and Northern
Policy Framework, for instance, repeatedly emphasizes "Canada's enduring
Arctic sovereignty," and the need to "enhance Canada's military
presence" and "Canada's domain awareness" (emphasis added), with some
references to bilateral security cooperation but no mention of NATO.
Canada is not the only country that might object to a stronger alliance
role in the Arctic. [[Alliance members in Southern and Eastern Europe
might see an increased Arctic focus as syphoning away NATO
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} from security challenges in the eastern
Mediterranean, the Balkans, Ukraine, or the Baltic Sea. In short[, [a

be [to strengthen international law around cables to make the act of
cutting them more transgressive in a non-wartime context]{.underline}.

**[They start cutting Roblin]{.underline}**

Generally speaking, fear of a massive cable attack is probably
over-hyped at least for a country with as may redundant cables as the
United States pitted against a limited number of Russian special
operations submarines. Furthermore, spying and attacks on cables have
abundant historical precedents.

Nonetheless, the extensive Russian military activity around the
submarine cables surely reveals that they are perceived as a valuable
avenue for asymmetric attack and intelligence gathering, and a capacity
to launch a more targeted attack against selected cables could cause
significant disruptions.

sea. [This [would act as an enabler for the Chinese to patrol]{.mark}

of this network by China would be a concern in the already troubled
waters.

**[Their card strats]{.underline}**

The submarine cables will play a great role as leverage to start or end
conflicts. With the fifth-generation warfare gaining more attention from
the world the road to supremacy in cyberspace will go through these
cables. Whichever country secures its cable interests will come out as a
major power, as continuity and normalcy of the world rely upon these
underwater networks. The potential in these cable networks to cripple
any given country's operational capability will naturally gain more
traction from its adversary. These assets naturally become strategic in
nature for all major powers thereby giving the cables a tag of
sovereignty.

[[Light moves through space 47% faster than fiber-optic]{.mark}

Even if fiber-optic cables were pervasive, light moves through them more
slowly than it does in the vacuum of space, so the new service would be
an improvement. [The bulky and costly infrastructure limits existing

No other internet-providing satellites can transmit that much data that
far at those speeds. Existing satellite internet service is reliable but
slow. Current satellites orbit at 22,236 miles above Earth, causing
transmissions to lag behind a half-second. It doesn't sound like much
time, but the time delay makes long-distance video conferencing
disjointed and annoying.

not only than DSL lines but also quicker than what many basic cable
packages are actually able to deliver]{.underline}. Certainly as the
only option for sparsely populated areas, Starlink could prove to be a
godsend, albeit an expensive one. The basic hardware package is \$499,
plus \$99 a month for service.(Shipping and taxes put the initial total
at \$581.94).

### 1AR -- AT: Military 

#### New suitcase internet set up solves

**McCaney** June 5, **2014** (Kevin; Army boosts bandwidth with new
suitcase-sized satellite terminals;
defensesystems.com/articles/2014/06/05/army-t2c2-high-bandwidth-satellite-terminals.aspx;
kdf)

[[Portable network access for soldiers in the field
is]{.underline}]{.mark} about to get [a lot [faster with the Army's
l]{.mark}atest]{.underline} satellite kit in a
[[suitcase.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Transportable Tactical Command
Communications, or T2C2, boosts the bandwidth for small detachments and
teams connecting to the Army's battlefield network, thus increasing the
situational awareness and functionality of early-entry teams and helping
to improve communications throughout the tactical edge, the Army said in
a release. T2T2 comes in two flavors[: a larger transportable dish that
serves company-level operations and the smaller T2C2 Lite, which the
Army said is about the size of carry-on luggage and which can be set up
and working in about 10 minutes.]{.underline} The small model is similar
to the Global Rapid Response Information Package, or GRRIP, which
soldiers have been using in Afghanistan, for example, as network
infrastructure leaves with the drawdown. But GRIPP uses only the L Band
in the satellite communications spectrum, limiting transmission to
kilobits per second. T2C2 Lite adds the Ka and X bands, boosting
performance to megabits per second and allowing soldiers to use advanced
applications. Last month, T2C2 was designated a program of record (GRRIP
is not), enabling the Army to institutionalize training on the system.
[[The equipment connects to the Army's battlefield
network]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Warfighter Information
Network-Tactical, via the military's Wideband Global SATCOM
constellation, [[and]{.mark} will work as a companion to the Enroute
Mission Command Capability]{.underline}, a WIN-T program [that [gives
rapid-response forces]{.mark} a view of their drop zones and allows for
mission planning while in flight. For the Army, the bigger
bandwidth]{.underline}, combined with T2C2's portability, [[advances the
cause of seamless, mobile battlefield
communications.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### 1AR -- No Internet Crash

#### No Internet collapse

**Dvorak 2007** (John; Will the Internet Collapse?; May 1;
www.pcmag.com/article2/0%2c2817%2c2124376%2c00.asp; kdf)

[**When is the Internet going to collapse?** The answer is
NEVER.]{.underline} The Internet is amazing for no other reason than
that it hasn\'t simply collapsed, never to be rebooted. Over a decade
ago, [many pundits were predicting an all-out catastrophic
failure,]{.underline} and back then the load was nothing compared with
what it is today. So how much more can this network take? Let\'s look at
the basic changes that have occurred since the Net became chat-worthy
around 1990. First of all, only a few people were on the Net back in
1990, since it was essentially a carrier for e-mail (spam free!),
newsgroups, gopher, and FTP. These capabilities remain. But the e-mail
load has grown to phenomenal proportions and become burdened with
megatons of spam. In one year, the amount of spam can exceed a decade\'s
worth, say 1990 to 2000, of all Internet traffic. It\'s actually the
astonishing overall growth of the Internet that is amazing. In 1990, the
total U.S. backbone throughput of the Internet was 1 terabyte, and in
1991 it doubled to 2TB. Throughput continued to double until 1996, when
it jumped to 1,500TB. After that huge jump, it returned to doubling,
reaching 80,000 to 140,000TB in 2002. This ridiculous growth rate has
continued as more and more services are added to the burden. The jump in
1996 is attributable to the one-two punch of the universal
popularization of the Web and the introduction of the MP3 standard and
subsequent music file sharing. More recently, the emergence of inane
video clips (YouTube and the rest) as universal entertainment has
continued to slam the Net with overhead, as has large video file sharing
via BitTorrent and other systems. Then VoIP came along, and IPTV is
next. All the while, e-mail numbers are in the trillions of messages,
and spam has never been more plentiful and bloated. Add blogging,
vlogging, and twittering and it just gets worse. According to some
expensive studies, the growth rate has begun to slow down to something
like 50 percent per year. But that\'s growth on top of huge numbers.
Petabytes. To date, we have to admit that the structure of the Net is
robust, to say the least. This is impressive, considering the fact that
experts were predicting a collapse in the 1990s. Robust or not, this
Internet is a transportation system. It transports data. All
transportation systems eventually need upgrading, repair, basic changes,
or reinvention. But what needs to be done here? This, to me, has come to
be the big question. Does anything at all need to be done, or do we run
it into the ground and then fix it later? Is this like a jalopy leaking
oil and water about to blow, or an organic perpetual-motion machine that
fixes itself somehow? [Many believe that the Net has never collapsed
because it does tend to fix itself. A decade ago we were going to run
out of IP addresses---remember?]{.underline} [It righted itself, with
rotating addresses and subnets. Many of the Net\'s improvements are
self-improvements. Only spam, viruses, and spyware represent incurable
diseases that could kill the organism.]{.underline} I have to conclude
that **[[the worst-case scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the Net [[is
an outage here or there,]{.mark} if anywhere.]{.underline} After all,
[the phone system, a more machine-intensive system, never really
imploded after years and years of growth,]{.underline} did it[? While it
has outages, [it\'s actually more reliable than the power grid it sits
on]{.mark}. [Why should the Internet be any different now that it is
essentially run by phone companies]{.mark} who know how to keep networks
up?]{.underline} And let\'s be real here[. The Net is being improved
daily, with newer routers and better gear being constantly hot-swapped
all over the world.]{.underline} This is not the same Internet we had in
1990, nor is it what we had in 2000. While phone companies seem to enjoy
nickel-and-diming their customers to death with various petty scams and
charges, they could easily charge one flat fee and spend their efforts
on quality-of-service issues and improving overall network speed and
throughput. That will never happen, and phone companies will forever be
loathed. But when all is said and done, [it\'s because of them [that the
Internet will never collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. That\'s the good
news. The bad news is they now own the Internet---literally---and
they\'ll continue to play the nickel-and-dime game with us.

### 1AR -- Eagleman

#### Eagleman's a hack and internet won't save civilization

**Mnookin 12**

Seth Mnookin teaches science writing at MIT and blogs at the Public
Library of Science, Download the Universe, March 23, 2012, \"The Frozen
Future of Nonfiction\",
http://www.downloadtheuniverse.com/dtu/2012/03/why-the-net-matters-how-the-internet-will-save-civilization-by-david-eagleman-canongate-books-2010-for-ipad-by-set.html

At least, that's what I assumed before I read Why The Net Matters,
[Eagleman's frustrating]{.underline} 2010 e-[book about]{.underline} how
and [why the Internet will save civilization]{.underline}. (I reviewed
the \$7.99 iPad version, which is the platform it was designed for; a
stripped-down, text-based version is available on the Kindle for the
portentous price of \$6.66.) The [problems start with Eagleman's
premise, which is so vague and broad as to be **practically
meaningless**.]{.underline} There are, [he writes]{.underline}, just "a
[handful of reasons"]{.underline} that [civilizations
collapse]{.underline}: "[disease, poor information flow, natural
disasters]{.underline}, political corruption, resource depletion and
economic meltdown." [Lucky for us]{.underline} (and Eagleman does offer
readers "\[c\]ongratulations on living in a fortuitous moment in
history"), the [tech]{.underline}nology [that created the web "obviates
many of the threats faced]{.underline} by our ancestors. In other
words\...\[t\]he advent of the internet represents a watershed moment in
history that just might rescue our future."

On the other hand, it just might not: In order [to make his point,
Eagleman **either ignores or doesn't bother to look** for any evidence
that might undercut it. The first of six "random access" chapters that
make up the bulk of Why The Net Matters is devoted to "Sidestepping
Epidemics," like the smallpox outbreak that helped bring down the Aztec
Empire]{.underline}. In the future, [Eagleman writes, the "protective
net," in the form of telemedicine]{.underline}, telepresence ("the
ability to work remotely via computer"), [and sophisticated information
tracking, will save us]{.underline} from these outbreaks. [That all
sounds lovely, but what of the fact that we're currently experiencing a
resurgence in vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles\...a
resurgence which is fueled in no small part by misinformation spread
over that very same "protective net"?]{.underline}

A few chapters later, in a section [celebrating]{.underline} the
[benefits of the hive mind, Eagleman invokes Soviet
pseudoscientist]{.underline} Trofim [Lysenko]{.underline}, a famed quack
[who took over the U.S.S.R.'s wheat production]{.underline} under
Stalin. Because the Soviet Union spanned 13 time zones, [Eagleman
writes, "central rule-setting was disastrous for wheat
production]{.underline}. ... Part of the downfall of the USSR can be
traced to this centralization of agricultural decisions." [That sounds
nice]{.underline}, and might even be true---[but it's not a point that's
supported by Lysenko, whose main shortcoming was not that he believed in
a one-size-fits-all approach]{.underline}; it was that he was a fraud.

[Moving to]{.underline} the [present day, Eagleman addresses wildfires
that swept]{.underline} through [Southern California]{.underline} in
2007, which, he writes, "brought into relief the relationship between
natural disasters and the internet."

At the beginning of the outbreak in October, Californians were glued to
their television screens, hoping to determine if their own homes were in
danger. But at some point they stopped watching the televisions and
turned to other sources. A common suspicion arose that the news stations
were most concerned with the fate of celebrity homes in Malibu and
Hollywood; mansions that were consumed by the flames took up airtime in
proportion to their square footage, which made for gripping video but a
poor information source about which areas were in danger next. So people
be­gan to post on Twitter, upload geotagged cell phone photos to Flickr,
and update Facebook.

I had been fairly obsessed with the wildfires, and since I didn't
remember this "common suspicion," [I decided to check the article
Eagleman cites as the source of this info]{.underline}, which was [a
Wired blog post]{.underline} titled "Firsthand Reports from California
Wildfires Pour Through Twitter." [It contained no references to a
celebrity-obsessed news media; instead, the piece described how "the
local media \[was\] overwhelmed."]{.underline} It also talked about a
San Diego resident who was "\[a\]cting as an ad hoc news aggregator of
sorts" by "watching broadcast television news, listening to local radio
reports and monitoring streaming video on the web" and then posting
information, along with info gleaned from IMs, text messages, and
e-mails, to his Twitter account.
