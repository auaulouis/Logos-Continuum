Behind the Success of the AKP

[[The AKP]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Justice and Development Party, is
undoubtedly on the demotic side. It originates from the Islamist
movement, the long-standing pet hate of the Kemalists and military
powers, and has long been ostracised from the legitimate political
field. It has [[always had a **clearly**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[stated]{.underline} **[[populist dimension]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Having gained power in 2002 in the wake of the severe economic crisis of
2001, the AKP benefited from the widespread rejection of the established
political classes and the establishment by large segments of society.
[[It targeted the]{.underline}]{.mark} republican, secular
[**[elite]{.underline}**, [accusing it of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**failing to represent** the people and **[holding democracy
hostage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It]{.underline}]{.mark} promised to
bring to power modest and conservative groups, which had long been
prevented from accessing positions of power, and [[**proclaimed**
itself]{.underline} [a **defender** of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**masses** and of **popular will**, and **therefore** of
**[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It built its mobilisation discourse
against westernised 'elites', along with their military and bureaucratic
'bastions', criticising them as limits to the popular opinions expressed
in the ballot box.

Recep Tayyip [[Erdoğan]{.underline}]{.mark}, originally from the
Islamist movement and one of the founders of the AKP,
**[[embodies]{.underline}]{.mark}** this [[populism]{.underline}]{.mark}
in several ways. He appears to be the first truly popular political
leader, in touch with the values and hopes of his people. He promotes
his modest social origins, even in his manner of speaking and body
language. [During his political ascension]{.underline}, and even upon
gaining power, [he **[accused]{.mark}** the [establishment of being
**authoritarian**]{.mark}]{.underline} and oppressive. Condemned and
imprisoned for a poem with Islamist intonations that he recited in 1998
as Mayor of Istanbul, [[Erdoğan acted on]{.underline}]{.mark} this
[[**martyr** status, oppressed by]{.mark} the [military]{.mark},
bureaucrats and Kemalists]{.underline} ... in fact [all [that is
'**anti-democratic'**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

With a solid electoral base since 2002, [representing between 40 and 50%
of votes]{.underline} expressed, [[Erdoğan has]{.mark} succeeded in
incarnating the [popular will]{.mark} with]{.underline} **[remarkable
longevity]{.underline}**. [[This]{.mark} massive
[support]{.mark}]{.underline}, resulting in repeated large parliamentary
majorities, [has enabled]{.underline} his party to make [substantial
modifications to the **institutional balance**]{.underline}. In
particular, [it [has **drastically** reduced]{.mark}]{.underline} the
army's [[institutional power]{.underline}]{.mark} over political
matters, all [[in the name of **democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark},

Growing Authoritarianism

In 2013, [two million]{.underline} Turkish [[citizens]{.mark} took to
the streets, **[protesting]{.mark}** in favour of]{.underline}
preserving Gezi Park and [inclusive]{.underline}, participative [urban
planning, and [against]{.mark} a [government]{.mark} they deemed
**intrusive**]{.underline} and business-oriented. Thanks to his
undeniable electoral popularity, [[Erdoğan]{.underline}]{.mark}, who was
then Prime Minister, [was [able to reject]{.mark} the demonstrators'
[claims, reasoning that in]{.mark}]{.underline} a representative
[**[democracy]{.underline}**, [the elected]{.underline} ]{.mark}[power
[cannot be called into question]{.mark} by demands]{.underline} from
people in the streets, however many they might be. The head of the
Turkish government thus opposed the authentic 'people', i.e. those who
expressed themselves via the ballot box, and the hordes of çapulcu, i.e.
looters who could make no claims of a representative or democratic
nature. However, [[this]{.mark} '**absolutism of national
will'**]{.underline}, to use the well-coined expression of political
scientist and editorial writer Ahmet Insel, [[is]{.mark} also
[what]{.mark} has enabled and]{.underline} even
**[[justified]{.underline}]{.mark}** the restrictions on pluralism, i.e.
[the [**regression** of]{.mark} public
**[liberties]{.mark}**,]{.underline} notably [with regards to opinion
and expression.]{.underline}

#### Turkey will use the counterplan's "tailored democratic reforms" to reinstate [populism]{.underline} and [authoritarianism]{.underline} through [appeals to democracy]{.underline}

St. Mark's, AshritM\]

[The [popularity behind Erdogan]{.mark} even though Turkey is no
longer]{.underline} considered [a free country]{.underline} according to
the Freedom House, [[is]{.mark} also at the [**core** of the **rise of
populism**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and **populist leaders**]{.underline}
such as Erdogan himself. The modern state of [Turkey was built
under]{.underline} leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who created [a secular
nation for the Muslim majority]{.underline}. [[Secularism]{.mark}
allowed Turkey to break from its]{.underline} [imperial past, creating a
new]{.underline} national [identity]{.underline} for Turkish citizens.
[This meant that Islam would no longer play a significant role
in]{.underline} the [policies and laws]{.underline} of the new modern
state. [While the goal]{.underline} of secularism
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} intended [[to **modernize**]{.mark} Turkey,
[it]{.mark} also [created]{.mark} a **[division]{.mark}** between
religious opposition within the population.]{.underline}

Then came [[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark}, a charismatic politician who
[[**appealed** to]{.mark} the conservative population of
Turkey]{.underline}. [Using the **deep [division]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} those who supported a **[secular]{.mark}** Turkey
[and]{.mark} those who supported an **[Islam
State]{.mark}**]{.underline}, liberalist and conservatives, and
different groups of nationalists, [[Erdogan]{.mark} was [able to
emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} himself [[as the "voice]{.underline}]{.mark}
and hope [[of the people."]{.underline}]{.mark} [He
**targeted**]{.underline} the secular [elites]{.underline} [and
**blamed** them for]{.underline} the [failures of the state]{.underline}
and for failing to represent the people. The economic boom during his
time in office has also greatly contributed to his popularity. As said
by Baris Unlu, a former political science professor, "Many people
supported the APK Party even though they weren't supporters per-se
because they were sick of pre-2002 Turkey."

[[In the 2016]{.underline}]{.mark} [attempted]{.underline}
[[coup]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Erdogan **strategically** used social
media to **appeal** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}. Appearing on people's FaceTime[,
[he]{.mark} [urged people to]{.mark} "take to the streets and **[defend
democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}." On Twitter, [[his staff
was]{.underline}]{.mark} putting out tweets on both his official account
and public account [[**calling** for]{.mark} the public to
**[rally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By using social media,
[[Erdogan]{.mark} successfully [manipulated the event to]{.mark} work in
his favor to **[delegitimize]{.mark}** his
[opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Images]{.underline}]{.mark} on his
Twitter [[showed]{.underline}]{.mark} pictures of the rally as [[people
**defending democracy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[rather than a
**revolt**]{.mark} against his regime.]{.underline}

on court rulings and criticism aimed at his government have fuelled
scepticism about his pledge.

Speaking via videolink at a ceremony in Ankara, [Erdogan [said]{.mark}
**20[21]{.mark}** [would be]{.mark} "the [year of
**democratic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and economic
[[reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}" and that [[efforts to]{.mark}

measures as soon as possible. By speeding up structural reforms, [[we

[Key **Developments [in]{.mark} 20[21]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In January, President [[Erdoğan appointed]{.mark} a political [ally as
the rector]{.mark} of]{.underline} Turkey's top-ranking [Boğaziçi
University, [prompting]{.mark}]{.underline} months-long
[**[protests]{.underline}** [by students]{.underline}]{.mark} [and

[on multiple occasions]{.underline}. [Erdoğan]{.underline} ultimately
[removed the rector]{.underline} in July, [only to **replace him** the
next month with a different political ally]{.underline}.

In June, [[the]{.mark} Constitutional [Court]{.mark} accepted a case to
**[shut down]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} country's
second-largest **[[opposition party]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the Peoples'
Democratic Party (HDP). The charges accuse the HDP of having links to
terrorism and threatening Turkey's territorial unity. Meanwhile, arrests
of HDP officials carried out during the year added to the thousands of
party members who have been detained since 2016.

In March, President [[Erdoğan]{.mark} unilaterally [withdrew Turkey
from]{.mark}]{.underline} the Istanbul Convention, [[a]{.mark}n
international [treaty to combat]{.mark} [gender-based
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [sparking **outrage** from]{.underline}
domestic and [international]{.underline} advocacy [groups and **foreign
governments**]{.underline}. Turkey's opposition parties and [most of the
population remain opposed]{.underline} to the move, and civil society
groups have attempted to appeal it as unconstitutional.

Osman Kavala, [[Turkey's]{.mark} most **prominent**]{.underline}
political [[prisoner]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[continued to have]{.mark}
his]{.underline} due process **[[rights denied]{.underline}]{.mark}**
throughout the year. In January, [an appeals [court **revoked**]{.mark}
his]{.underline} 2020 [[acquittal]{.underline}]{.mark}, ostensibly
because some evidence had been excluded from court. Authorities
rearrested him in February under newfound charges of allegedly aiding a
coup attempt and supporting terrorism. As of the end of 2021, Kavala
remained in detention, despite a 2019 order by the ECHR for his
immediate release.

### 2AC -- Say No -- General 

#### The CP [fails]{.underline} -- Turkey, Poland, and Hungary say no due to [structural factors]{.underline} and external pressure [isn't sufficient]{.underline}

St. Mark's, AshritM\]

Ferenc Laczo: While you underline in the book that tilting the playing
field was Erdogan's way of surviving and prospering in politics, you
also insist on [long-term **[structural]{.mark}** and **institutional**
[forces behind]{.mark}]{.underline} the rise of [competitive
[authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline} in Turkey. What would you say are
the [main [reasons behind]{.mark} the]{.underline} quite dramatic
[**[democratic decline]{.mark}** in the country]{.underline} leading to
the rise of competitive authoritarianism? [How]{.underline} special or
[different is the Turkish regime as compared to]{.underline} other
countries frequently cited these days when it comes to the subject of
democratic decline, such as Russia, **[Poland, Hungary]{.underline}**,
or Serbia, to take examples only from Central and Eastern Europe, but
you may, of course, wish to compare the country more globally too?

Dimitar Bechev: That's a great question and I could spend hours upon
hours delving into it. Turkey never had a perfect democracy. Even in the
best of days, there were [many [conflicts]{.mark} and
deficiencies]{.underline} that **[[tainted]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
image of [Turkish [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as
**[polarization]{.mark}**]{.underline} within society, the prevalence of
what Turks would call [[the **deep state**]{.underline}]{.mark} (even if
the term is contested), the **[[nationalist
undercurrents]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in Turkish politics]{.underline},
[the history of [violence]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [culture of **winner takes all**]{.mark},
which has been]{.underline} quite **[systematic]{.underline}**.

At a certain stage, [[it became a **matter of survival** for
Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark}. The conclusion he drew around 2007-08,
when AKP was threatened with closure, was that [to persist on top [he
needs to **defeat**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [opposition and **shoot
down**]{.underline} the [[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Power]{.mark} [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a coalition culture
[[was **never** in the cards]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The idea that there
is **no real exit** became a **self-fulfilling prophecy** and I think
[this **applies to this day.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Another factor beyond path-dependency and Erdogan's persona is the
weakening pull of the EU, which is something we could observe also
within the EU.

[[Even though the situation is]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[different in
**Poland and Hungary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [suffice to say that [once
you **become a member**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the **[external]{.mark}
[anchor]{.mark}** [doesn't have]{.mark} the same [impact on **domestic
affairs**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The **same thing** happened in
**Turkey**]{.underline} for a different set of reasons, [because the
prospect of **membership** weakened]{.underline} with the Cyprus issue
and especially after Nicolas Sarkozy came to power in France in 2007.
The [[**dismantling** of **checks**]{.mark} **and balances** and the
external anchor being dismantled]{.underline} partly because of the EU
itself [[led to the system we]{.mark} currently
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} in Turkey.

#### Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Greece, Portugal and the Baltic countries say no OR fail to implement democratic reforms

Paul **Poast**, Political Sciene @
UChicago, **and** Alexandra **Chinchilla**, Political Science @ UChicago
**20**, "Good for democracy? Evidence from the 2004 NATO," International
Politics, Volume 57, Issue 3.

NATO has a curious view of itself. The preamble of the North Atlantic
Treaty listed 'democracy' as a 'founding principle' even
though [Portugal, a founding member,]{.underline} [was
under]{.underline} [the authoritarian]{.underline} [Estado
Novo]{.underline} [regime when the treaty was
signed.]{.underline} [[Neither Turkey]{.mark}
[nor]{.mark}]{.underline}[ [Greece]{.underline}]{.mark}[, the frst two
countries to join NATO following its formation,]{.underline} [was
suspended]{.underline} from the alliance [during]{.underline} [periods
of]{.underline} [authoritarian backsliding]{.underline}. One might
assert that these seemingly hypocritical exceptions to the democratic
principle were driven by Cold War necessities. Indeed, compare the
language used in the 1968 NATO Strategic Concept---a periodically
revised document of NATO's strategic priorities---and the post-Cold War
1991 and 1999 Strategic Concepts. Whereas the 1968 document contains
zero uses of the word 'democracy' (or variations, such as 'democratic'),
it has 28 uses of the word 'deterrence.' In contrast, the 1991 document
contains 5 mentions of 'democracy' and just 6 of 'deterrence,' and the
1999 document contains 12 mentions of both terms. When NATO countries
agreed to expand the alliance, NATO's 1995 'Study on Enlargement' noted
'encouraging and supporting democratic reforms' as a core tenet of
expansion (NATO 1995). Hence, it appears that one of NATO's post-Cold
War strategies was to fnally take seriously its democratic principles
(NATO 2018).

Given that NATO documents clearly demonstrate that democratic
development became a core mission of NATO after the Cold War, how well
has it fulflled this mission? Although some key post-Cold War [expansion
members, notably]{.underline} [Poland and Hungary,
have]{.underline} [backslid on democratic reforms]{.underline}, has the
post-Cold War NATO expansion fostered democratic development more
broadly in Eastern Europe and the post-Soviet space? The existing
scholarship on this question offers mixed answers. Gibler and Sewell
(2006, 429) maintain that '[the]{.underline} expansion of NATO
eastward... aided the creation of a peaceful environment for democracy
to survive.' According to them, NATO reduced levels of external threat
and provided much-needed bargaining leverage with Russia to resolve
border issues and remove Russian troops from Eastern European states. In
contrast, Dan Reiter (2001) expressed skepticism nearly two decades
ago: ['NATO membership has not and]{.underline} [will not advance
democratization]{.underline} [in Europe]{.underline}....
\[[E\]nlargement did not contribute much to democratization in the three
East European states admitted in 1999, and the promise of NATO
membership is unlikely to speed democracy within any of the nine
countries currently awaiting a decision on their request for
membership]{.underline}.' Reiter then highlighted the 'risks of further
enlargement' vis-a-vis Russia as pointing toward holding of on further
expansion. [Mearsheimer]{.underline} (2014) [argues similarly that by
antagonizing Russia, NATO expansion threatened the prospects for
democratic development in Ukraine]{.underline}. Poast and Urpelainen
(2018) ofer a middle-of-the-road argument. Exploring the post-Cold War
experience of the Baltic states, they argue that these states' nascent
democratic regimes were underpinned by actions and efforts taken by the
states themselves, along with Nordic assistance, well before NATO
membership was even a possibility. NATO membership did not harm the
prospects of democratic development, but it also did not directly foster
the peaceful environment necessary for democracy to fourish. NATO's role
was, at best, indirect.

We seek to adjudicate among these three views on the NATO--democracy
relationship. [We]{.underline} do so
by [focus]{.underline}ing [on]{.underline} the 2004 NATO expansion that
brought in the [three]{.underline} [Baltic states of
Estonia,]{.underline} [Latvia, and Lithuania, as well as Bulgaria,
Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia]{.underline}. We focus on the [states
that joined NATO in 2004]{.underline} because they [represent
the]{.underline} **[ideal test]{.underline}** [of NATO's influence on
democracy. The states that joined NATO in 1999---]{.underline}the [Czech
Republic, Hungary, and Polan]{.underline}d---[could be hard
tests]{.underline} of the democratization theory, [given
that]{.underline} they were selected for membership ahead of their peers
partly because [they were more democratic and therefore more ready for
membership than other states]{.underline}. Reiter (2001) argued, for
example, that these three states democratized quickly well before the
prospect of NATO membership. The states that did not make the first cut
at NATO enlargement but were later brought into the alliance should be
where NATO would have the strongest effect on democracy in prospective
members. In addition, now is an ideal time to reevaluate these claims,
for two reasons related to data availability. First, [for the seven
states that joined NATO in 2004, more years have now passed since NATO
entry than]{.underline} [passed between their]{.underline} [regime
transition and NATO entry]{.underline}.
Second, [the]{.underline} [Varieties of
Democracy]{.underline} (V-Dem) [Project
is]{.underline} [now]{.underline} [producing measures of regime
type]{.underline} [that not only well capture the core components of
democratic systems,]{.underline} [but]{.underline} [also offer a measure
that is]{.underline} **[more
refined]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} [the commonly
applied]{.underline} [Polity]{.underline} [Project data]{.underline}. We
leverage these two data advancements to consider a tricky empirical
counterfactual: [Was NATO expansion critical to the development and
survival of democracy in the 2004 expansion states?]{.underline}1 This
is an enormous question with too many angles to be fully explored in a
brief article. But we can show how the available data ofer insights into
it.

We begin by reviewing the process of post-Cold War NATO expansion, and
the way in which it relates to democratic development, by reviewing the
main arguments for NATO infuence on democratization drawn from the
literature. Throughout this section, we refer to examples from the
experience of new NATO member states, with a lengthier example drawn
from the Baltic states' experience of gaining NATO membership. Reviewing
the Baltic states' experience introduces terms and concepts, such as the
Membership Action Plan (MAP), that will be used in our main
analysis. [The Baltics are also representative cases of how NATO's
security guarantee provided a powerful incentive for new regimes to seek
membership]{.underline} in NATO. The next section presents our analysis
of how NATO membership infuenced democratic development within the 2004
expansion states. We begin by explaining why we use the Liberal
Democracy Index score from the V-Dem Project to capture the state of
democratic development within a country. [We]{.underline} then [present
regression analysis suggesting that gaining]{.underline} [NATO
membership had]{.underline} **[little influence]{.underline}** [on a
country acquiring or keeping democratic institutions]{.underline}.
Instead, [we find the anticipation of]{.underline} **[European
Union]{.underline}** ([EU]{.underline}) [membership, not NATO
membership, had the largest influence]{.underline} [on democratic
development]{.underline}.

### 1AR -- Say No -- Hungary

#### Vague conditions ensure Hungary says no or circumvents---they'd used democratic tools to consolidate power and undermine the alliance

**Nietsche 19** \[Carisa; research assistant in the Transatlantic
Security Program at the Center for a New American Security; "How
Hungary's Orban Puts Democratic Tools to Authoritarian Use"; 06-10-19;
World Politics Review;
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/27928/how-hungary-s-orban-puts-democratic-tools-to-authoritarian-use\]

In his visit to the White House last month, [Hungarian Prime Minister
Viktor]{.underline} [Orban, who proudly]{.underline} [describes himself
as an]{.underline} [**illiberal democrat**, did what every good populist
does:]{.underline} [He explained that he had a mandate from the
people.]{.underline} ["From the people, by the people, for the people.
That is the basis for the Hungarian government," he
said]{.underline} [when asked about]{.underline} [democratic
backsliding]{.underline} [in his country.]{.underline}

Like other populist leaders, Orban uses a number of tactics to back up
his claims: sidelining the media to quell critics, whipping up perceived
threats from migrants, refugees and others from abroad, and, like other
euroskeptics, casting the European Union as a bogeyman[. One
less-documented item in]{.underline} [Orban's]{.underline} [toolkit,
which is cast in a seemingly democratic sheen, is his use
of]{.underline} [national consultations---soliciting citizen feedback on
government policies or regulations through surveys and opinion
polls.]{.underline}

In the past five years, [Orban has launched several of them, all
designed to consolidate his political position and justify his illiberal
agenda. A national consultation in 2015 focused on the supposed linkages
between immigration and terrorism. Another one, in 2017, fixated on the
so-called "Soros Plan," which claimed that billionaire philanthropist
George Soros was behind the European migration crisis]{.underline} in an
attempt to destabilize Hungary and weaken its Christian culture. [Last
year, Orban launched a national consultation on measures designed to
promote and protect families and children, one of many efforts by Orban
to build an "old-school Christian democracy" in
Hungary.]{.underline} The consultation pits the Orban government's
efforts to deal with Hungary's demographic decline, as birthrates
continue to fall, by supporting families---against the solution of
"Brussels bureaucrats" to reverse the shrinking population through
increased immigration.

At first glance, [national]{.underline} [consultations appear
democratic. On]{.underline} closer inspection, however, [Orban's methods
of collecting direct public feedback about government policy are far
from it.]{.underline} Their methodologies defy all of the best practices
of survey design. In the 2015 consultation on immigration and
terrorism, [respondents were given three choices---two of which
represented agreement with the government and a third which represented
disagreement]{.underline}---thereby giving the Hungarian government a
two-out-of-three chance that the respondents would rubberstamp their
proposed action. For instance, they pose questions like, "Would You
support the Hungarian government if, contrary to the permissive policy
of Brussels, it introduced stricter regulation of immigration?" In the
family law consultation, respondents were given a "yes" or "no" choice
to answer a series of questions addressing how Hungary should address
demographic decline, without an opportunity to expound on their
position.

In addition to the methodology, [respondents]{.underline} [are
often]{.underline} [primed to agree with the
government]{.underline} [position.]{.underline} Accompanying the "Soros
Plan" consultation, [Orban included a fear-mongering letter that cited
the impetus for the consultation.]{.underline} "In Brussels, plans are
being made on our future which involve major threats," it stated
ominously. In last year's family law consultation, the government
included a paragraph before each question that stated its position on
the proposed solutions to demographic decline, including increasing
support for mothers with three or more children. The paragraphs provide
essentially a form of leading the witness to the conclusion of
supporting the government's line.

[As more democracies risk sliding toward autocracy
under]{.underline} [populist leaders, more of them
will]{.underline} [rely on]{.underline} **[seemingly democratic
tools]{.underline}** [to consolidate their rule.]{.underline}

[Recent consultations also suffer from a troubling lack of
transparency.]{.underline} After the 2017 national consultation on Soros
and immigration, [the government reported that the survey received 2.2
million responses. Yet there was no public release or verification of
the results from an independent and objective
body.]{.underline} Instead, Minister of State for Government
Communication Bence Tuzson held a press conference trumpeting the
outcome. "Based on the results so far," he stated, "practically every
respondent said no to the fact that 1 million immigrants should be
resettled in Europe as part of the 'Soros Plan.'" It was a convenient
conclusion, of course, and one that gave Orban public support for his
plan to make George Soros an enemy of the government and bolster support
for Orban's reelection.

[Rather than actually gauge public
opinion,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [primary]{.underline} [purpose
of these consultations is]{.underline} [to enable Orban]{.underline} [to
claim a democratic justification]{.underline} [for enacting his
"illiberal" agenda. Research shows that]{.underline} [legitimacy is an
important factor in stabilizing an authoritarian regime]{.underline} due
to the public's direct role in empowering the rise of the autocrat. [A
supposedly democratic mandate from the people allows Orban to bypass
institutions that could potentially constrain him, like
parliament.]{.underline} The unmediated access established through a
national consultation often serves as a pressure release valve for the
wider populace and creates the perception of a direct dialogue between
the government---and the leader, in Orban's case---and the people, which
research shows can build loyalty to the regime.

[The national consultations further consolidate Orban's power by
providing him with campaign insights and enabling him to identify
opponents. The information collected from national consultations allows
Orban to notice weaknesses in his electoral strategy.]{.underline} In
conjunction with the "Soros Plan" consultation, Orban and his Fidesz
party launched a large-scale media campaign laced with scare tactics and
bolstering the government position---which also served as a reelection
platform for Orban and Fidesz, paid for by taxpayer dollars. The
potential campaigning power of national consultations goes a step
further. In the 2015 national consultation on migration, NGO
representatives and think tank experts suspect that Fidesz used the
collected information to illegally build a database of potential Fidesz
voters. Reports suggest that the national consultation allowed the
government to monitor the perspective of voters region-by-region, as
well as identify which voters potentially disagreed with the
government's stance due to a lack of a response. These measures blur the
lines between campaigning and governing at the expense of Hungary's
taxpayers.

[Orban's]{.underline} [growing use of national consultations suggests he
could be]{.underline} [learning from authoritarian
leaders]{.underline} [like
China's]{.underline} [Xi]{.underline} [Jinping]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Russia's
Vladimir]{.underline} [Putin.]{.underline} Over the past few
years, [China has launched a national consultation roughly every two
weeks, for everything from a Chinese Medicine Ordinance to a review of
electoral arrangements.]{.underline} However, reports show that 15 of 25
consultations yielded no more than 100 responses; some only yielded a
handful of responses. [Despite]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [paltry
response rate, the]{.underline} [Chinese
government]{.underline} [often]{.underline} [utilized]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [results
as a justification for official government policies.]{.underline}

The ability to identify challenges to a regime is an added benefit of
national consultations and potentially a lesson Orban learned from
Russia. [Putin has utilized a public discussion page on his website, a
telethon and even an online petition platform known as the Russian
Public Initiative, which crowd-sources federal, regional and municipal
level policy changes from citizens across Russia.]{.underline} In most
cases, [these tools have given Putin's government insight into potential
critics and opponents, or about issues that could lead to social
instability and anti-government protests.]{.underline}

When used in bad faith and for undemocratic ends, national consultations
can guide countries down the path to autocracy by stabilizing the regime
in power, providing the cover of a democratic mandate, and bypassing the
institutions that are supposed to act as checks and balances. It is
likely that other populist leaders will learn from Orban's tactics, just
as [he seems to have learned from Xi and Putin]{.underline}. As more
democracies risk sliding toward autocracy under populist leaders who
nevertheless came to power through democratic means, [more of them will
rely on seemingly democratic tools to consolidate their
rule.]{.underline} The old tactics of regime survival are evolving, from
Beijing to Budapest. [Dressed up as democracy, measures like national
consultations are in fact undermining it.]{.underline}

[As if European Union leaders didn't know what has been taking place in
Hungary]{.underline} **[over the past decade.]{.underline}**

Since his election as prime minister back in 2010,
Viktor [Orbán]{.underline} [has]{.underline} **[systematically]{.underline}** [undermined
the rule of law, weakened the judiciary, grabbed
control]{.underline} [of large parts]{.underline} [of the media, and
curbed]{.underline} [independent]{.underline} [academic institutions,
such as the Central European University.]{.underline}

As if that was not enough, [he has]{.underline} [demonized refugees,
built a barbed-wire fence]{.underline} [to keep them from crossing into
the country, and denied nongovernmental organizations and human rights
activists access to any detained refugees or migrants]{.underline}, for
example to help them file asylum requests.

**[All these actions are being taken by a country that is a member of
the EU and NATO.]{.underline}** Both organizations are supposed to be
based on upholding freedom and fundamental rights, although [NATO's
non-record on]{.underline} [speaking out about]{.underline} [Turkey's
erosion of democracy is]{.underline} [next
to]{.underline} [shameful.]{.underline}

[Orbán]{.underline}, a dissident during the communist
era, [has]{.underline} [railed]{.underline} [**against the
EU**,]{.underline} in particular its commitment to democratic values.
For him, [his]{.underline} **[political ideology]{.underline}** [is
about creating an]{.underline} **["illiberal"
democracy]{.underline}** [based on nationalism]{.underline} and a
conservatism based on select Christian values. Forget the fact that an
illiberal democracy is a contradiction in terms. Forget too that
defending national sovereignty doesn't have to mean weakening the rule
of law.

[\[EMORY'S CARD BEGINS HERE\]]{.underline}

[Not content with]{.underline} [chiseling
away]{.underline} [at]{.underline} [Hungary's democratic
institutions]{.underline}---and knowing that the EU and even the
European People's Party (EPP), the European Parliament group that
represents conservative parties throughout the EU, were too weak or
cowardly to rein in his ambitions---[Orbán

Politics and Governance, School of Law, University of Nicosia, Cyprus,
CYPRUS AND THE GREAT POWERS AN EVALUATION OF RUSSIAN-CYPRIOT RELATIONS
IN THE NEW EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN ENVIRONMENT\]

The study of contemporary Eastern Mediterranean and the broader Middle
East verifies, to a large degree, the validity of these theoretical
assumptions. The structure of the international system is changing due
to uneven growth dynamics, which cause respective adaptions at the level
of perceptions and prestige. In that sense, US overexpansion and its
consequences forced Washington to a strategic withdrawal from the Middle
East, which, subsequently, changed the way others saw the US and
transformed its prestige accordingly. Consequently, Russia exploited
this situation in order to establish its presence and increase its
influence in the region, which led to a redistribution of power and
triggered a struggle for the formation of a new regional balance of
power. In this framework, realignment of interests and reconfiguration
of bilateral and multilateral relations was a natural outcome of the
changing power distribution and perceptions. If we focus our microscope
on bilateral and multilateral relations between the US, Russia, Turkey
and Cyprus we may observe two independent variables, which define the
direction of the overall set of relationships, which are mutually
reinforcing: Turkey's post-Kemalist foreign policy and the degree of
tensions between Russia and the US/NATO. It seems that **[the more
Turkey
distances]{.underline}** [itself]{.underline} [from]{.underline} its [Western
allies]{.underline} [the
more]{.underline} **[impetus]{.underline}** [its]{.underline} **[relations]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** may [gain]{.underline}.
On the other hand, [the more US-Russian
relations]{.underline} [**worsen**, the
more]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[motivated]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[embrace

#### Turkey responds to US pressure by [breaking off completely]{.underline}---Erdogan perceives it as US attempts to plot a coup AND he's able to withstand pressure AND thinks he has leverage

[**Turkey has long felt underappreciated** and **disrespected in
NATO**]{.underline}. 

Although the country almost always contributes manpower to NATO missions
--- in Afghanistan and elsewhere --- its most important resource, as far
as the West is concerned, is not economic or military might but its
strategic location.

"[We look at Turkey as the cork in the bottle of the Black
Sea]{.underline}. **[They don't think of themselves like that at
all]{.underline}**," [said Ben **Hodges**]{.underline}, a [former
commanding general of U.S. Army Europe]{.underline}. "I can remember
years ago the **[Turks saying]{.underline}**, '[**You** guys **don't
appreciate us**]{.underline}. [**You don't respect us**. You only come
to us when you need something]{.underline}.'"

As President Donald Trump heads to London this week for a NATO summit,
the [relationship between Turkey and]{.underline} its Western [allies is
in a particularly rocky moment.]{.underline} Washington and Ankara
remain in a standoff over the latter's purchase of a Russian air-defense
system that
could [compromise](https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2019/07/why-s-400-and-f-35-cant-get-along/158504/) the
stealthy F-35 flown by several NATO partners. In October, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent forces into Syria to attack Kurds
whom the United States considers partners in the fight against ISIS.
That has incensed Congress and touched off a spat with France.

How the West should navigate the moment is dividing policymakers in
Washington, and raising the question: **[Could a [rocky moment become a
permanent break]{.mark}? ]{.underline}**

"**[[Turkey does what's good for Turkey, period. Full
stop]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [[said]{.mark} a U.S. official with
**[s]{.mark}ubject [m]{.mark}atter [e]{.mark}xpertise**]{.underline}.
For the United States, that official said, [the
**question**]{.underline} might [**become** **not** only "**Can we live
with a rogue Turkey?"** but "**Do we have a choice?"**]{.underline}

The debate in Washington

On the Hill, frustration is rising. Lawmakers recently voted
to [recognize the Armenian
genocide](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/29/us-house-overwhelmingly-votes-to-recognize-armenian-genocide),
a long-discussed move long opposed by Turkey. They are pushing to
sanction Ankara over its Syrian incursion. A [handful of
lawmakers]{.underline}
on [both](https://www.businessinsider.com/lindsey-graham-warns-turkey-nato-suspension-sanctions-if-kurds-attacked-2019-10) [sides](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/465847-democratic-lawmaker-expelling-turkey-from-nato-should-be-on-the-table) of
the aisle have even [suggested that Turkey could be suspended or kicked
out of NATO. ]{.underline}

"I think that we shouldn't underestimate in this town, in Washington,
how people's long-term perceptions of a country affects their
policymaking," said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., a former senior
defense official in the Obama administration. "The Armenian genocide
resolution has been a topic of conversation on Capitol Hill for thirty
years. And it passed this year."

But inside the executive branch, officials are keenly aware of [the
**[cost of a deeper]{.mark} [split]{.mark} with Turkey**,]{.underline}
according to a half-dozen U.S. officials who spoke anonymously
to Defense One about sensitive U.S.-Turkey relations that they were not
authorized to discuss publicly. The [**[stakes include
access]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[several [key]{.mark}
U.S. and NATO [sites]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [**[Incirlik]{.mark}** Air
Base hosts American B-61 **nuclear gravity bombs**]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} is a friendly **[jumping-off point]{.mark} in[to]{.mark}
the [M]{.mark}iddle [E]{.mark}ast**.]{.underline} [Turkey also controls
the Bosporus]{.underline}, which under a 1936 agreement means it
controls naval access to and from the Black Sea. 

For many Turkey hands in the U.S. government, [what's new is not the
friction in the U.S.-Turkish relationship]{.underline} [but Turkey's
increasingly autocratic president.]{.underline} Erdogan has effectively
ruled Turkey since becoming prime minister in 2003, assuming the
presidency in 2014 and centralizing his power through a series of
reforms. A "master politician and a master strategist," said the U.S.
official, "This is a man who should never, ever be underestimated." 

Under Erdogan, Turkey has exploited the power it derives from its
critical geography better than it has under any other leader in recent
memory, the official with subject matter expertise said.
**[[Erdogan's]{.mark}]{.underline}** recent Oval Office visit --- which
came after his incursion into Syria --- and his **[[ability to withstand
pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the Russian anti-aircraft S-400
system [[is]{.mark} "**[next-level stuff]{.mark}**]{.underline}," that
official said. 

**[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [[**enjoys new leverage**
because]{.underline}]{.mark} Donald [**[Trump]{.mark}** has **[taken a
personal liking]{.mark}** to Erdogan]{.underline}, inviting him to the
White House over the howls of U.S. lawmakers. (Trump also faced fierce
bipartisan fire for pulling American forces out of the way of the
Turkish incursion, which critics say "green-lighted" attacks on a U.S.
partner.)

"There is great frustration at Erdogan personally" within government,
said another senior government official in an email. "President likes
him, but rest of government sees him as a wild card, acting in highly
risky ways." 

"Everyone I know beneath POTUS believes Turkey's actions in Syria has
fundamentally changed the relationship," said a second senior
administration official.

**[[What is Turkey's plan?]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Some analysts and lawmakers have argued that Turkey's purchase of the
S-400 shows it is moving away from the U.S. and the rest of NATO, and
towards Russia --- or, relatedly, that Russia is using existing fissures
in the relationship to try to cleave Turkey away from NATO. 

"Biggest problem right now in the relationship is F-35/S-400," the first
senior government official said. "[**[Neither]{.mark} side [willing to
back down]{.mark}** despite high level efforts for
compromise]{.underline}."

But some Turkey specialists within government see that assessment as
reductive. [The U.S. official with Turkey expertise]{.underline} [argued
that Ankara has "always" made tactical and strategic decisions based on
what it considered its best interests]{.underline}. In this case,
several officials said, [**[Erdogan's belief]{.mark}** that [**the
U.S**. **had**]{.mark} a **[role in]{.mark}** an unsuccessful
2016]{.underline} **[[coup attempt]{.underline}]{.mark}** may [have
**[made him]{.mark} [more leery]{.mark}** of]{.underline} an
[America]{.underline}n-made anti-aircraft system. 

As for the Syria incursion, several outside analysts as well as the U.S.
Turkey specialist suggested that policymakers underestimated the degree
to which Erdogan considered the U.S.-backed Kurds on his southern border
an existential threat. "It's an area where Turkey is willing to accept
the most risk," the official said. Russia tacitly supported the move and
helped to broker a broader ceasefire deal that solidified Turkish gains
into northeastern Syria.

Some analysts pin Turkey's tactical friendliness with Russia on
uncertainty in Washington. Trump has at times [publicly
questioned](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/18/world/europe/trump-nato-self-defense-montenegro.html) core
principles of NATO and demanded that other countries pay more towards
their own defense.

"I think that Turkey is doing what a lot of countries are doing right
now, which is hedging their bets: diversifying their relationships,
their policy, because they're not sure about the future relationship
with the U.S.," said Slotkin, who just returned from a trip to Turkey
intended both to press Ankara on the S-400 and to "reassure" it of U.S.
support.

Broadly, [analysts say]{.underline}, [**Erdogan is seeking to broaden
Turkey's** **international clout** as an independent power, and he is
**willing to pique NATO** to do so]{.underline}.

#### Turkey [won't back down]{.underline} to US pressure---[empirics]{.underline} prove they'll [fight]{.underline} NOT rollover

It remains to be seen **[[how]{.mark} the [Turkish

[**[Erdogan]{.mark}** has **[shown]{.mark}** himself]{.underline}
[[**repeatedly willing** to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[ignore U.S.

Kurds]{.underline} [as an existential threat.]{.underline} "Like the
United States, Turkey does not go abroad in search of monsters to
destroy," Turkey's communications director Fahrettin Altun wrote in an
op-ed for The Post. "But when monsters attempt to knock down our doors
and harm our citizens, we have to respond." Though
**[Trump]{.underline}** prefers to use economic
**[[pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}** rather than military strength or
diplomatic negotiations, it **[[often fails to produce]{.mark} the
[desired effect]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [It is **[not clear why
Turkey]{.mark}** would **[back down]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the
face]{.underline} [of U.S.]{.underline} sanctions [**[when]{.mark}**
countries such as [**Iran,** **North Korea**,
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[and Venezuela have
not]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday
afternoon, Trump suggested that it would ultimately be Erdogan's
decision. "I've gotten him to stop for virtually from the first day that
I was in office," Trump said at the White House. "But [**[they've wanted
to fight]{.mark}** and **that's the way it is** and **[they've done it
for so long]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

#### Erdogan is all in on authoritarianism and would never say yes---institutions are too sticky to go back

[Turkey's]{.underline} political trajectory
is [an]{.underline} **[exemplary]{.underline}** [case of a
country]{.underline} **[permanently rolling
back]{.underline}** [democratizing reforms]{.underline}, but it's not
the only one. Husngary's Viktor Orban and Jaroslaw Kaczynski's Law and
Justice party in Poland are undermining the rule of law, democratic
values, and human rights in the service of what they define as
authenticity and security. These are developments that predate the
migrant crisis that is buffeting Europe, though the large number of
people from Africa and the Middle East seeking refuge in the European
Union has made Orban's and Kaczynski's message more politically potent,
and thus the undoing of democratic institutions and liberal values
politically acceptable, for large numbers of Hungarians and
Poles. [Observers often describe]{.underline} the way these leaders ---
including [Erdogan]{.underline} --- have [forged]{.underline} illiberal
democracies, or in Turkey's case, an [elected autocracy]{.underline}, as
demonstrations of power politics. But [these pejoratives are
meaningless]{.underline} outside the imprecisions of newspaper
editorials. Orban, Kaczynski, and Erdogan have articulated a vision of
the future of their societies that appeals to and makes sense for large
numbers of people. The Hungarian and Polish leadership have done so
basically in opposition to the liberal principles upon which the EU was
built. In the Turkish case, [the AKP's program can best be summed up as
piety, prosperity, and power]{.underline}. Voters in all three countries
have justly rewarded these leaders. Yet for all their apparent success,
the Turkish, Hungarian, and Polish leaders have opposition. Over the
last 15 years, about half of Turkey's electorate has consistently
opposed the AKP and Erdogan. In 2016, Orban staged a referendum aimed at
preventing migrants from entering Hungary. The proposed measure received
98 percent support of the people who voted, but in a political blow, it
fell well short of the 50 percent voter turnout needed to become
binding. In Poland, the Law and Justice party's turn away from the West
produced the Committee for the Defense of Democracy that has been able
to bring large numbers of people into the streets at various times to
protest Kaczynski's worldview. But [what's]{.underline} [important is
how,]{.underline} [in response to opposition]{.underline}, leaders
in [Turkey]{.underline}, Hungary, and Poland
have [established]{.underline} [new]{.underline} [institutions,]{.underline} [manipulated]{.underline} [existing
ones, and]{.underline} [hollowed out]{.underline} [others to confront
political challenges or to close off their possibility]{.underline}.
Formal institutions come in the form of laws, rules, regulations, and
decrees; their origins are found in political contestation and often
reflect the interests of the winners in those conflicts. [Informal
institutions are uncodified, but
that]{.underline} [doesn't]{.underline} [mean they are less powerful
than formal institutions]{.underline}. Sometimes these norms, which are
based on the way things have long been done, are more powerful than
written rules. The old boys' network that has sustained elite, white,
male privilege in the United States has often trumped legislative and
administrative measures created to level the playing field for women and
minorities. One of the best examples of institutional manipulation is
the way in which [Turkey's AKP used its majority in the Grand National
Assembly to]{.underline} [whitewash a 2014 parliamentary
investigation]{.underline} into corruption charges against four
government ministers [that threatened]{.underline} [to
ensnare]{.underline} [Erdogan]{.underline} [and his
family]{.underline}. [The
process]{.underline} [rendered]{.underline} [the idea
of]{.underline} [parliamentary
oversight]{.underline} [essentially]{.underline} **[meaningless]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [gave]{.underline} [the
Turkish leader an]{.underline} [opportunity to
argue]{.underline} --- [credibly for his
constituents]{.underline} [---]{.underline} [that
the]{.underline} [original]{.underline} [allegations were an
attempted]{.underline} [coup.]{.underline} Since the corruption
allegation, [Erdogan]{.underline} [has]{.underline} [manipulated
institutions to]{.underline} **[reverse the outcome of
an]{.underline}** **[election]{.underline}** [he did not like in
2015,]{.underline} [tried his opponents in]{.underline} [**courts packed
with his supporters**,
and]{.underline} [debased]{.underline} [Turkey's]{.underline} [electoral
laws to ensure]{.underline} [the passage of]{.underline} [a
referendum]{.underline} [on constitutional
amendments]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [grant
the presidency extraordinary powers. The AKP has used the legal system
to]{.underline} [jail journalists]{.underline} --- most often [on
spurious terrorism]{.underline}-related [charges]{.underline} ---
and [force ownership changes
in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [media]{.underline} [industry]{.underline}.
These [attacks on the press]{.underline}, along with the [transformation
of]{.underline} the state-owned broadcaster and [state-run
news]{.underline} service [into an arm of the AKP,
have]{.underline} [crowded out independent
newsgathering.]{.underline} In the recent elections, the state-owned
Anadolu Agency called the presidential election for Erdogan well before
the Supreme Electoral Council --- made up of AKP appointees --- could
count the vast majority of ballot boxes. This prompted Erdogan to appear
on television graciously accepting another presidential term, making it
impossible for the election board to contradict Anadolu's projection and
thus rendering the board a mere prop in AKP's electoral
theater. [The]{.underline} [institutional
manipulations]{.underline} [and innovations]{.underline} during the AKP
era that have been [employed to serve Erdogan's goals]{.underline} [will
endure]{.underline} [after he is gone]{.underline}. This is
because **[institutions tend to be sticky]{.underline}** --- [they
remain long after]{.underline} the moment when they are needed, [often
leveraged by a new cohort of politicians]{.underline} to advance their
agendas. This does not imply that institutional change is impossible. It
is just [that]{.underline} [revisions take place in the context of
existing institutions]{.underline} [and previous
innovations]{.underline}. For example, [the origins of Egypt's current
repressive laws concerning the press and civil society organizations can
be traced back through]{.underline} any number of revisions to [the
1950s]{.underline} and 1960s. In this way, [authoritarianism tends to
build on itself]{.underline}. It may eventually give out, but [short of
a revolution]{.underline} that undermines a mutually reinforcing
political and social order, [institutions will have a lasting impact on
society]{.underline}. Despite all the apparent change in Egypt since
early 2011, the country's politics still revolve around a system that
Gamal Abdel Nasser and the Free Officers founded in the 1950s.
The [data]{.underline} [social scientists have
generated]{.underline} [indicate]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [transitions
to democracy often fail:]{.underline} Some countries lose their
democracy, and those that do only get it back in rare and very specific
circumstances. France became democratic again after the defeat of the
Vichy government and Nazi Germany. Hungary and Poland were supposed to
be shining examples of transitions to democracy. Those countries may yet
live up to democratic ideals that as EU members they ostensibly share
with other democracies, but because of what Orban and Kaczynski have
done, the path to that goal will be long and hard. As for Turkey, no
doubt the military will outlast Erdogan, but it is unclear if it will
outlast Erdoganism.

#### Turkey says no---deep anti-American sentiment, lack of credibility, and Erdogan wants to look strong for elections

[As [Turkey is reaching a crossroads]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} its
[Western [allies need to act responsibly]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[refrain]{.mark}ing [from]{.mark} any discourse or [action that may
trigger]{.mark} an opportunity for the incumbents to increase their
approval ratings through [a 'rally round the flag']{.mark}
[effect]{.mark}.]{.underline}21 Previous research has shown that the
rally round the flag phenomenon [[creates incentives for political
leaders]{.mark} who face domestic discontent [to engage in]{.mark}
diversionary and [risky]{.mark} foreign policy [moves]{.mark}, sometimes
even **[initiat]{.mark}ing** [**wars** to solidify]{.mark} public
[support]{.mark} prior to elections.]{.underline} More common than
diversionary wars are invocations of diversionary threat and
scapegoating --- rhetorical emphasis on risks to the nation which divert
citizen focus from more serious and credible domestic concerns.22 Under
these conditions, a sound and responsible policy is needed to keep
anti-Americanism and possible foreign policy adventurism in check.

Where to Now?

First, the [**[Biden]{.mark}** administration [should **use**
**caution** **when** **applying**]{.mark} **sanctions**, **embargoes**,
or **isolation** [**mechanisms** to Turkey if it]{.mark} really [wants
to retain]{.mark} its Western orientation and electoral
[demo]{.mark}cracy. History indicates that these [methods often prove
counterproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}. The CAATSA sanctions announced
by the United States on Turkey on 14 December, 2020, for its purchase of
Russian S-400 missile system, may strengthen Turkey's quest for
strategic autonomy in national arms production as has been the case back
in the 1974 US arms embargo over Cyprus, or what worse [may also [push
Turkey **back** **to** **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a preferred
and reliable source of weapons[,]{.underline} enhancing rather than
eroding Russia's defense industry. Moreover, requiring the removal of
S-400s from the Turkish territory to lift the sanctions would also be
very costly, especially given the [[deep anti-American sentiment in the
country]{.mark}, often fuelled by incumbents and pro-government
media.]{.underline}

The ongoing legal proceedings undertaken by the U.S. District Court in
New York against Turkish state bank, Halkbank, for an alleged plot to
evade Iran sanctions continue to hang over Turkish economy creating
another element of uncertainty to already troubled bilateral
relationship. A conviction of Halkbank may lead to Turkey's already
struggling financial industry collapsing, raising unpredictable domestic
political consequences. The [financial hardships may, undermine
incumbents' political prospects or on the contrary might only boost
incumbents' popularity at the ballot box by fueling rampant
anti-Americanism and nativism.]{.underline}

The second message [for the [Biden]{.mark} administration in all of this
is that, if it really wants to restore America's lost soft power, it
[should think twice about]{.mark} its [enthusiasm]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
an **"[alliance of democracies]{.mark}"** as an instrument to advance
its own interests. [Global]{.mark} public goods [problems **cannot**
**be** **resolved** **without**]{.mark} the active participation of the
major [**non**-**democracies**]{.mark} and neither [Turkey nor any
other]{.mark} swing [state wants to be forced to make **win**-**lose**
**choices** between]{.mark} the [US and]{.mark} its
[rivals]{.mark}.]{.underline} A reconsideration of an "alliance of
democracies" is also imperative not least because there is a justified
degree of skepticism about the quality of America's own democracy at
home but also democracy promotion abroad. The [[promotion of]{.mark} a
liberal [democratic]{.mark} rule-based world [order]{.mark} [requires
**consistent**]{.mark} and principled [action]{.mark}.
Instrumentalization of liberal democratic norms for strategic ends,
inconsistency or selectiveness in democracy or human rights promotion,
perceived [hypocrisy]{.mark} or double standards [create]{.mark} high
[reputational cost]{.mark} for any major normative power.]{.underline}
For a rule-based system to work "[rules must be visibly observed by
their principal and most powerful advocates"]{.underline} tells a 2015
Chatham House paper. [[Rule breaking actions, such as]{.mark} the
**[invasion]{.mark}** [**of** **Iraq**]{.mark} without UN authorization;
the failure to close the [**Guantanamo** **Bay**]{.mark} detention
facility,]{.underline} the presidential ['[**war** **on**
**terror**]{.mark}**ism'**]{.underline} directives ordering [lethal
**[drone]{.mark}** **[strikes]{.mark}** on adversaries **in** the
**Middle** **East** and Pakistan; Edward **[Snowd]{.mark}e**n's
revelations of illegal NSA surveillance activities "open the door for
others to pursue a '**might** **is** **right'**
approach."23]{.underline} [Inconsistency or selectiveness in democracy
or human rights promotion, such as the U.S. [**disavowal** **of**
**Hamas**]{.mark} after it won the free and fair Palestinian elections,
its **refusal** **to** **use** the **word** "**coup**" after the
military coup in Egypt due to the financial aid implications; its
ongoing close relationship with theocratic dictatorships and [reluctance
to]{.mark} [sanction **Saudi**]{.mark} Arabia's Crown Prince
[over]{.mark} the [**killing** **of** **journalist**]{.mark} Jamal
Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul [cast a long shadow over
America]{.mark}'s claim to be the principal democracy and human rights
promoter.]{.underline}

#### Turkey says no to [every]{.underline} democratic reform -- new [crackdowns]{.underline}, financial [crises]{.underline}, and [power-grabs]{.underline} 

**Goodman '18** \[Peter S. Goodman, 8-18-2018, \"The West Hoped for
Democracy in Turkey. Erdogan Had Other Ideas. (Published 2018),\"
NYTimes,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/business/west-democracy-turkey-erdogan-financial-crisis.html>,
St. Mark's, AshritM\]

In Western capitals a decade ago, [Turkey's]{.underline} now-paramount
[leader]{.underline}, Recep Tayyip **[[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[held promise [as a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[potential
beacon]{.underline}** [of democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} [for a region
rife with]{.underline} religious [conflict]{.underline}.

[Turkey was a]{.underline} stalwart [NATO ally bridging Europe and
the]{.underline} volatile [Middle East]{.underline}. As Mr. [Erdogan
sought to secure a place]{.underline} for his country [in
the]{.underline} ranks of the [**E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}, [he
[presented]{.mark} himself [as]{.mark} a
**[moderate]{.mark}**]{.underline} and modernizing Muslim
[leader]{.underline} for the post-9/11 age. [He [**catered** to
**perceptions**]{.mark} that Turkey was becoming a **liberal society**
governed by **tolerance** and the **rule of law**.]{.underline}

But [that was **[before]{.mark}**]{.underline} Mr. [[Erdogan began
**amassing**]{.mark} **supreme [powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [before his **brutal
[crackdown]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on dissent]{.mark} following an
attempted coup]{.underline} two years ago. [It was **[before]{.mark}**
Turkey descended into [a **financial crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[delivered]{.underline}]{.mark} in no small measure [[by]{.mark}
his]{.underline} **[[authoritarian]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[proclivities]{.underline}]{.mark} and unorthodox stewardship of the
economy. [Whatever was left of the [notion that]{.mark}]{.underline} Mr.
[[Erdogan was]{.mark} a [liberalizing]{.mark} force [has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} **[wholly
[extinguished]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

For the West, Mr. [Erdogan has devolved from a **righteous
hope**]{.underline} --- would-be proof that Islam and democracy can
peacefully coexist --- [into another autocrat whose
**populism**]{.underline}, bombast and contempt for the ledger books
[have yielded calamity]{.underline}.

Regional [experts contend that [visions of]{.mark}]{.underline} Turkey's
leader as an agent of [[**liberal progress** were]{.underline}]{.mark}
always **[[fantastical]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Mr.
[[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark} --- who served as Turkey's prime minister
for 11 years before becoming its president in 2014 --- forged his
political career as an Islamist intent on challenging the strictures of
Turkey's state-imposed secularism. His [[early]{.mark} democratic
[reforms]{.mark} and assertion of civilian control]{.underline} over the
military [[were]{.mark} largely [about **winning**]{.mark}]{.underline}
the welcome of [[the **European bloc**]{.mark}]{.underline} while
enabling Turkey's Muslim populace to practice its religion free of state
interference.

"For us, [democracy is a **means to an end**]{.underline}," Mr.
[Erdogan]{.underline} once **[declared]{.underline}**.

[History is full of examples of]{.underline} Western nations ---
especially [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} ---
**[[projecting]{.underline}]{.mark}** [their aspirations and [**values**
onto foreign]{.mark} [leaders]{.mark} with their **own
objectives**.]{.underline}

In its effort to prevent China from falling under the control of
Communists, Washington backed the Chinese Nationalist general Chiang
Kai-shek, celebrating him as a courageous hero even as he brutalized
opponents and profited on the spoils of American support. In Vietnam,
Afghanistan and elsewhere, the United States cast flawed figures as
veritable George Washingtons before writing them off as corrupt tyrants.

"[As much as we might [**fantasize** about]{.mark} things **changing**
and]{.underline} there being **[[liberal
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [we]{.underline} probably [[got]{.mark}
overly [**carried away** with]{.mark}]{.underline} those sorts of
[visions for [Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Philip Robins, a
professor of Middle East politics at the University of Oxford.
