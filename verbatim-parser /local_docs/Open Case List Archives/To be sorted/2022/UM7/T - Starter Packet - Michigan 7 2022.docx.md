## The United States Federal Government

### USFG\-\--Singular Whole\-\--1NC

#### "United States" is a [singular]{.underline} noun referring to the whole

Dr. James R. **Hurford 94**, General Linguistics Professor at the
University of Edinburgh, Grammar: A Student's Guide, p. 224

Singular

Explanation

[A **singular** noun]{.underline} or pronoun in a language [typically
refers to **just one** thing]{.underline} or person, or to a mass of
stuff, [rather than to a **collection** of things]{.underline} or
people. Other nouns which occur in the same grammatical patterns as
typical singular nouns may be classified as grammatically singular.

Examples

Some singular nouns in English are waiter, inability, objection, cat,
frostbite, garlic, refusal, gatepost, liair and region.

The English personal pronouns I, he. she and it are singular.

Contrasts

Singular contrasts with plural. A word cannot simultaneously be both
singular and plural.

Relationships Singular and plural in a language belong to its system of
number. It is common in languages for singular to be the unmarked member
of the system, and for plural nouns to have some special marker, such as
a suffix; this is true of English, where, for instance, the noun dog is
singular, and its plural is formed by adding an \~s. The singular is
rarely formed by adding something in this way.

The basic parts of speech to which singular applies are nouns and
pronouns; other parts of speech or word-classes may be marked as
singular by agreement with a singular noun or pronoun. In English, only
verbs and demonstratives show this agreement; this and that are singular
demonstratives, and is and was are forms of the verb be which show
singular agreement.

Among the nouns, mass nouns are always singular. So we may say *This
stuff is sticky* and *That wine tastes of bananas*. Count nouns show the
distinction between singular and plural. Thus we have singular/plural
pairs such as *tree/trees*, *diagram/diagrams* and *burial/burials*.
Proper names are almost always singular. [Even proper names formed from
plural common nouns, **such as *the United States***, tend to be
singular]{.underline}, as in *The United States is ready to defend its
vital interests*.

University. Summer 1986. "Congress, the Constitution, and First Use of
Nuclear Weapons." Review of Politics. Vol. 48, No. 3.

Three other points merit mention in this discussion of collective
decision-making. First, both the formal and the secret constitutions
allocate power over foreign relations and defense to the central
government, to, that is, the United States of America visualized as a
single entity. [What]{.underline}, however, [is \"the\"
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[?]{.underline} The question has
never been definitively answered; and indeed has seldom been asked in
judicial opinion or scholarly discourse.42 Asked another way, the
question is this: Where does sovereignty lie in the American polity? The
formal constitution is supposedly based on popular sovereignty, with
ultimate power resting in the people. That, however, is far from
accurate. Proof positive that sovereignty lies in the \"state\" came
when General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox: \"the people\" of
the South were not to be permitted to exercise their \"sovereignty.\"
The powers of the national government are supposedly only those
delegated to it, either expressly or impliedly. But that is scarcely
accurate, as 200 years of constitutional development attest. The Framers
of the formal constitution established a governmental system that, as
Justice Robert Jackson commented, would ensure that the dispersed powers
of the federal government would be integrated into a workable
government. \"Separateness but interdependence, autonomy but
reciprocity\" was the constitutional command.43 [The meaning is
unmistakable: \"the\" U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is a
**single**]{.underline} metaphysical [**entity**,
encompassing]{.underline} state, society, and [government in one
artificial being]{.underline}. These terms are not synonymous. The state
is the fundamental entity; government its apparatus; and society is
composed of the individuals and groups governed. Much like the business
corporation, the state-\"the\" United States-is an artificial construct,
more a method than a thing. It exists in constitutional theory-in, for
example, the state secrets privilege in litigation-even though judges
and commentators alike often confuse the term with government and with
society. A legal fiction that by itself can do no act, speak no work,
and think no thought, the state (like the corporation) has \"no
anatomical parts to be kicked or consigned to the calaboose; no soul for
whose salvation the parson may struggle; no body to be roasted in hell
or purged for celestial enjoyment.\" 44 [Despite loose language to the
contrary]{.underline} from executive branch lawyers and even the Supreme
Court, \"the\" state or [\"the\" government-or \"the\"
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates-[is **not to be equated
with**]{.underline} the executive branch. Nor with **[any one
branch]{.underline}**, for that matter; [each branch is part of an
**indivisible** whole]{.underline}.

#### "Government" is a [collective]{.underline} noun, meaning the [whole]{.underline} body

Dr. Loreto **Todd 5**, Professor and Reader in International English at
the University of Leeds & Author of More Than 20 Books on Linguistics &
English Usage, International English Usage, Ed. Hancock and Todd, p. 133

[The]{.underline} term [***collective noun*** refers to a **singular
noun** that has a plural implication (e.g. \[for example,\]
***government***) and is used when the **whole body (and not the
constituent members)** is being considered]{.underline}. The category
*collective nouns* is not discrete, and it can be argued that some
usages are midway between collective and mass nouns. For example, *team*
is clearly a collective noun and *butter* is clearly a mass noun but it
is not so easy to decide the status of such nouns as: hair linen
royalty.

## Should

### Should\-\--Certain\-\--1NC

#### "Should" is [mandatory]{.underline}.

**Keller '32** \[W.H.; July 14; Judge on the Superior Court of
Pennsylvania; Westlaw, "Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co.," 106 Pa.Super. 307\]

[As regards **the mandatory character** of the rule, the word "should"
is **not only an auxiliary verb**, it is also **the preterite of the
verb, "shall,"** and has]{.underline} for one of [its
meanings]{.underline}, as defined in the Century Dictionary: ["Obliged
or compelled (to); would have (to); must; ought (to); used with an
infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express **obligation**,
**necessity** or **duty** in connection with some act **yet to be
carried out**." We think it **clear**]{.underline} that [it is in that
sense]{.underline} that [the word "should" is used]{.underline} in this
rule, [not **merely advisory**]{.underline}. When the judge in charging
a jury tells them that, unless they find from all the evidence, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the defendant is guilty of the offense charged,
they should acquit, [the word "should" is **not used** in **an advisory
sense**, but has **the force or meaning** of "must," or "ought to," and
carries with it the]{.underline} sense of \*313 [**obligation and duty**
equivalent to **compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy
for a few unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing
something in direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to
fritter away, or nullify, provisions which have been enacted to
safeguard and protect the welfare of thousands who are engaged in the
hazardous occupation of mining.

### Should\-\--Certain\-\--2NC

#### "Should" is obligatory, [NOT]{.underline} advisory.

**Riddle '14** \[Finis E; December 22; Justice on the Supreme Court of
Oklahoma; Westlaw, "St. Louis & S. F. R. Co. v. Brown," 45 Okla. 143\]

[The]{.underline} specific grounds of [objection]{.underline} are that
the court should have used the word "shall" instead of "should," that
[the word "should" is **merely advisory**]{.underline}, and that the
jury was left at its discretion in the matter of reduction of the
damages. It has been said that [the word "should" is **the past tense**
of the word "shall,"]{.underline} and we think, in the connection in
which it was used, the jury understood that it meant **[more than simply
advisory]{.underline}**.

In the case of Smith v. State, 142 Ind. 288, 41 N. E. 595, the Supreme
Court of Indiana held that [it was **more imperative** than the word
"may."]{.underline}

In the case of Lynch v. Bates, 139 Ind. 206, 38 N. E. 806, where the
court charged the jury that in passing upon the weight of the evidence,
etc., they "should" take into consideration \*1081 the interest of the
witness, etc., the court reversed the case, holding that [the word
"should"]{.underline} there [was]{.underline} too
**[imperative]{.underline}**.

In the case of Durand\'s Adm\'r v. N. Y. & L. B. R. Co., 65 N. J. Law,
656, 48 Atl. 1013, the court held that [the word "should"
implies]{.underline} the performance of some **[obligation or
duty]{.underline}**. Often the word "shall" is used to mean "may." So,
it will be seen that either of the terms cannot be considered
abstractly, but must be considered in connection with the subject-matter
and sense in which it is used.

#### "Should" means "must."

**Stroud '2k** \[John F Jr; July 7; Judge on the Court of Appeals of
Arkansas; Westlaw, "Guest v. San Pedro," 70 Ark. App. 389\]

[The interpretation]{.underline} of this section, which appears to be a
question of first impression, [turns upon **the meaning** of the word
"**should**"]{.underline} in the phrase "\[a\]ny partial abatement or
reduction of child support should not exceed 50% of the child-support
obligation during the extended visitation period." In Little v. State,
261 Ark. 859, 554 S.W.2d 312 (1977), the supreme court ruled that the
trial court, giving an instruction on circumstantial evidence, had not
misled the jury by using the word "should" instead of "must" in stating
that circumstances should point to and be consistent with guilt but
should be inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis.
[The]{.underline} Little [court opined]{.underline} that use of the word
"must" would have been preferable to the use of "should," but the court
noted that [the]{.underline} \*396 [words are]{.underline} often
**[synonymous]{.underline}**. 261 Ark. at 884, 554 S.W.2d at 324, citing
Rodale, The Synonym Finder 780 (Special Deluxe Ed.).

Similarly, [we hold]{.underline} that [the word "**should**" is
equivalent to the word "**must**"]{.underline} as used in the phrase
"any partial abatement or reduction of child support should not exceed
50% of the child-support obligation during the extended visitation
period." We hold that the 50% limitation in Administrative Order No. 10
is mandatory: abatement or reduction of child support during an extended
visitation period cannot exceed 50% of the child-support obligation
during the extended visitation period.

### Should\-\--AT: Certain\-\--2AC

#### "Should" is [advisory]{.underline}, not certain. It also [equals]{.underline} "ought."

**Richman '16** \[James; August 17; Judge on the Second Circuit,
California's Court of Appeals; Westlaw, "Marin Assn. of Pub. Emps. v.
Marin Cty. Employees\' Ret. Assn.," 2 Cal. App. 5th 674\]

There is, of course, no bar to the Supreme Court adopting a Court of
Appeal\'s reasoning as its own. Yet there is legitimate reason to
question whether that was what the Supreme Court intended in 1983.
First, as just shown, [**only the least authoritative** of the three
sources]{.underline} cited \*\*385 [**actually supports** the word
"must,"]{.underline} while [the]{.underline} two [Supreme Court
decisions employ "**should**."]{.underline} Second, barely a month
later, the Supreme Court---speaking though the same justice---filed
another decision which used the "should" formulation from the 1955 Allen
decision as quoted in Abbott.20 Third, the 1983 Allen decision involved
retirees (and Flournoy the widow of a retiree), who historically receive
a heightened degree of judicial protection. (See fn. 19, ante.) Fourth,
and most significantly, [the "must" formulation has never been
reiterated by the Supreme Court, which has **instead uniformly
employed** the "should"]{.underline} \*699 [language]{.underline} from
the 1955 Allen decision. (Olson v. Cory, supra, 27 Cal.3d 532, 541, 178
Cal.Rptr. 568, 636 P.2d 532 \["Although an employee does not obtain any
'absolute right to fixed or specific benefits \... there \[are\] strict
limitation\[s\] on the conditions which may modify the pension system in
effect during employment.' \[Citation.\] Such modifications must be
reasonable and any ' "changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages" ' "\]; Legislature v. Eu (1991) 54 Cal.3d 492, 529--530, 286
Cal.Rptr. 283, 816 P.2d 1309 \[quoting Olson\]; City of Huntington Beach
v. Board of Administration (1992) 4 Cal.4th 462, 472, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d
514, 841 P.2d 1034 \["changes in a pension plan which result in
disadvantage to employees should be accompanied by comparable new
advantages," citing Allen v. City of Long Beach, supra, 45 Cal.2d 128,
131, 287 P.2d 765\].)

It thus appears unlikely that the Supreme Court\'s use of "must" in the
1983 Allen decision was intended to herald a fundamental doctrinal
shift. ["Should," not "must," remains the **court\'s preferred
expression**]{.underline}. And ["should" does not convey **imperative
obligation**, **no more compulsion** than "ought."]{.underline} (Lashley
v. Koerber (1945) 26 Cal.2d 83, 90, 156 P.2d 441; see People v. Webb
(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 401, 409, fn. 2, 230 Cal.Rptr. 755 \[["the word
'should' is **advisory only**]{.underline} [and not
mandatory"]{.underline}\].) [In **plain effect**, "should" is "**a
recommendation**, not \... **a mandate**."]{.underline} (Cuevas v.
Superior Court (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 406, 409, 130 Cal.Rptr. 238.)

### Should\-\--AT: Certain\-\--1AR

#### "Should" is not certain.

**White '26** \[Warren L; January 8; Judge on the Springfield Court of
Appeals of Missouri; Westlaw, "Hubbard v. Turner Department Store Co.,"
220 Mo.App. 95\]

3 [The verb "should" has **various shades of meaning**. In **its
ordinary meaning** it does not express **certainty** as the word "will"
**sometimes does**]{.underline}. In the telegram under consideration it
seems to be used in the sense that, from the anticipated profits,
plaintiff might receive a bonus of \$25 to \$50 per month. It is nothing
more than an expression of opinion, with no definite assurance that such
would be the result. The expression, "twenty--five to fifty dollars per
month extra," adds nothing to the certainty or definiteness of the
proposal but is merely suggestive. The whole expression, "a part of
profits that should mean from twenty--five to fifty dollars per month
extra, to our minds cannot possibly be construed as guaranty or an
unconditional promise to pay a minimum of \$25 per month or a maximum of
\$50 per month out of the profits, in addition to the agreed salary. It
is merely suggestive. Moreover, no method is provided for determining
what the share of plaintiff in the profits might be; no per cent. is
named. Whether net or gross profits or whether profits from the whole
store or only the furniture department, were to be the basis of
settlement, is all left to conjecture. There is no stipulation as to
when settlements were to be made, which, obviously, might be either
weekly, monthly, annually, or whenever the employment should cease. The
expression in the telegram, "if you want to come and work hard, we will
take care of you in good shape," avails plaintiff nothing from the
standpoint of law. The whole telegram is one well calculated to mislead,
whether deliberate or not. Morally, defendant was under some obligation
to increase plaintiff\'s salary in the event the concern prospered and
plaintiff worked hard; but, legally, we are confronted with an
insurmountable obstacle in so far as affording relief to plaintiff is
concerned. It is an elemental and fundamental rule of law that a
contract, to be valid, "must be certain and unequivocal in its essential
terms, either within itself or by reference to some other agreement or
matter." 6 R. C. L. 644; 9 Cyc. 245; 18 R. C. L. 494; Burks v. Stam, 65

[The **threshold determination**]{.underline} to be made [is
whether]{.underline} §271(f)(2)'s [requirement of "a **substantial**
portion" of]{.underline} the [components]{.underline} of a patented
invention [refers to a **quantitative** or **qualitative**
measurement]{.underline}. Life Technologies and the United States argue
that the text of §271(f)(1) establishes a quantitative threshold, and
that the threshold must be greater than one. Promega defends the Federal
Circuit's reading of the statute, arguing that [a ["substantial]{.mark}
portion"]{.underline} of the components [[**includes** a **single**
component if]{.mark} that component is **[sufficiently
important]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the invention.

We look first to the text of the statute. Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U. S.

(Fed.Cir.1996) (construing "substantially the entire height" as "nearly
the entire height"). [**The adverb** "substantially" is **typically
defined** to mean "to **a great or significant extent**,"]{.underline}
or "for the most part; essentially."4 The adjective "flat" is typically
defined to mean "smooth and even; without marked lumps to indentations"
or "having a broad level surface."5 These ordinary definitions are
generally consistent with the patent specification discussed at length
above, which depicts and describes seat-to-bed systems with constituent
surfaces that are close to, though not entirely, flat. (See ′861 patent,
col. 9--10; col. 13 (describing multiple embodiments with "substantially
flat" passenger-bearing surfaces that are composed of "substantially
coplanar\[ \] and contiguous" surfaces)6 As such, although the patent
specification and claims lead to the inescapable conclusion that the
claimed "substantially flat bed" must consist of surfaces that are flat
to a great extent, those surfaces need not be precisely so. (See, e.g.,
id., col. 33:12--17; 36:32--33; 43:7--8; 46:54--56).

[Our consideration]{.underline} of this issue [is **guided first and

[definition itself. "**\[S\]ubstantially**"]{.underline} in the phrase
"substantially limits" [suggests "considerable" or "to **a large

**Arkush '2** \[David; January 1; J.D. Candidate at Harvard Law School;

\"Catalyst\" Attorneys\' Fees Under the Freedom of Information Act in
the Wake of Buckhannon Board and Care Home v. West Virginia Department
of Health and Human Resources," vol. 37, p. 151\]

Since the Supreme Court appears to have emphasized the classification in
Buckhannon,(FN96) plaintiffs may find it useful or necessary to discuss
whether \"substantially prevail\" is a legal term of art. [**The only
clear consequence** of classification as a \"legal term of art\"
is]{.underline} that [courts may be **more likely** to consult Black\'s
Law Dictionary to define such words]{.underline}. The Buckhannon Court
declared \"prevailing party\" a term of art and seems to have relied
heavily on the 1997 edition of Black\'s, which defined the phrase as a
\"party in whose favor judgment is rendered.\"(FN97) Justice Scalia\'s
concurrence similarly emphasized the special status of the term
\"prevailing party,\" writing, \"\[w\]ords that have acquired a
specialized meaning in the legal context must be accorded their legal
meaning.\"(FN98)

Plaintiffs should argue that [the term]{.underline}
\"**[substantially]{.underline}** prevail\" [is **not a term of
art**]{.underline} because if considered a term of art, resort to
Black\'s 7th produces a definition of \"prevail\" that could be
interpreted adversely to plaintiffs.(FN99) [It is **commonly accepted**
that words that are **not legal terms of art** should be accorded
**their ordinary, not their legal, meaning**]{.underline},(FN100) and

### Substantially\-\--AT: Not Covert\-\--2AC

#### Contextually, action in defense alliances like NATO can be [secret]{.underline}.

**Rapp-Hooper 15** -- Mira Rapp-Hooper, Political Science PhD at
Columbia University (earned by submitting this paper), Political Science
MPhil at Columbia University. \[Absolute Alliances: Extended Deterrence
in International Politics, PhD thesis at Columbia University,
https://doi.org/10.7916/D85Q4TWX\]//BPS

Defense pacts may be symmetric or asymmetric, both in terms of the
capabilities of member states and in terms of treaty obligations. They
may form between major and minor powers, or between equals, and the
treaty obligations may vary between partners or may be identical. If
defense pacts specify an alliance duration when they enter into force,
the mean specified length is seven and one-half years. In actuality, a
typical defense pact lasts for about 20 years.36 [[Most]{.mark} defense
[pacts are **public**]{.mark}, but **occasionally [states]{.mark}**
[sign]{.mark} defensive [alliances in which **part**]{.mark} or **all of
the treaty** [is]{.mark} **kept [secret]{.mark}**]{.underline}.37
Moreover, many defense pacts are quite specific---approximately half of
non-security guarantee defense pacts specify an adversary, theater,
alliance, or particular military contingency as the target of the
pact.38

Footnote 37 begins:

37 [Approximately **[12% of all]{.mark} non-security guarantee defense
[pacts]{.mark}** [have **secret clauses**]{.mark} or are **secret in

#### Private talks can limit a public treaty.

https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.polisci.3.1.63

Signaling could also occur within alliances. Secret alliances pose a
particular problem for this argument; how can something private signal
information (Ritter 2000)? Often, there may be a problem of uncertainty
between possible allies. They may not know the extent of one another\'s
commitment. [[**Private talks** that limit]{.mark} the [applicability of
the alliance]{.mark} address]{.underline} some of the [problems of
entrapment and abandonment by **[allow]{.mark}**ing [each ally to
declare what]{.mark} interests [it is willing to fight for]{.mark},
allowing the other to adjust its actions accordingly. [Secrecy]{.mark}
would be a benefit because the allies might not wish to communicate the
limits of their commitment to states outside the alliance.
This]{.underline} concern [[could lead to **secret provisions appended
to a public treaty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### U.S. law treats MOUs as [binding treaty obligations]{.underline} concluded by the executive 

**Barrett '20** \[Jill; 2020; Visiting Reader in the School of Law at
Queen Mary University of London; and Robert Beckman, Emeritus Professor
of Law at the National University of Singapore; Handbook on Good Treaty
Practice, p. 105\]

[The [Name of the Document Does Not Determine]{.mark} its [Legal
Status]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[A document which meets]{.mark} the legal [criteria for]{.mark} being
[a treaty is a treaty]{.mark}, whatever its particular designation.
**[No matter how non-binding the title sounds]{.mark}**, if the content
and context make clear]{.underline} that [it is governed by
international law, it may be a treaty]{.underline}. Conversely, a
document could be entitled 'treaty' or 'agreement', but if it is evident
from its contents or context that it is not governed by international
law, it is not a treaty. This can make the task of distinguishing
treaties from non-binding international instruments difficult. The
document signed by the Foreign Minister of Bahrain which was interpreted
by the ICJ as a binding agreement to take the dispute with Qatar to the
ICJ, was called 'Minutes'. Minutes of meetings do not usually have
treaty status, but if an internationally binding agreement is entered
into at the meeting, the record of the meeting could bind the parties.

The title 'MOU' is particularly apt to cause confusion. In the practice
of many States, this title is used only for instruments which they
consider to be political rather than legal. The practice of some States
on this point is so consistent that the use of the title MOU may be
taken as an indication of their intention that the instrument not be
governed by international law. For example, Australia, Canada, New
Zealand and the UK and many other States follow the same practice in
this regard. However, [[in]{.mark} the practice of
[some]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[States]{.mark}, the title [MOU is
used for agreements which **are treaties under i**]{.mark}nternational
[**law**, but]{.mark} which are [classified for domestic]{.mark} law
[purposes as executive agreements (meaning]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
[**[approval of]{.mark} the [legislature is not required]{.mark}**[).
The **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
for example, [[follows this]{.mark} practice]{.underline}. When States
with different practices conclude an MOU, it may be a treaty or it may
not. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, some States appear to have no consistent
practice, using the term MOU without regard to whether or not the
document is intended to be a treaty. Some, such as New Zealand, seek to
avoid using the title MOU at all because of the confusion it has
generated.64

### Substantially\-\--Not Numerical\-\--1AR

#### Throw out cutoffs.

**Prost '4** \[Sharon; June 18; Federal Court of Appeals Judge on the
Federal Circuit; Westlaw, "Comm. for Fairly Traded Venezuelan Cement v.
United States," 372 F.3d 1284\]

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of §
1677(4)(C). In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach.
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that \*1290 no "precise
mathematical formula" or " 'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a
dumping concentration analysis. SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also
Venez. Cement, 279 F.Supp.2d at 1329--30. Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis." SAA at 860. Finally, [**the definition of the
word** "substantial" **undercuts** the]{.underline} CFTVC\'s [argument.
The word "substantial" **generally means** "considerable in amount,
value or worth." Webster\'s Third]{.underline} New International
Dictionary 2280 (1993). [It does **not** imply **a specific number or
cut-off**. What may be **substantial** in **one situation** may not be
in another situation. **The very breadth** of the **term** "substantial"
undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC\'s [argument]{.underline} that Congress
spoke clearly in establishing a standard for the Commission\'s regional
antidumping and countervailing duty analyses. It therefore supports the
conclusion that the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation
of "substantial proportion." The Commission clearly embarked on its
analysis having been given considerable leeway to interpret a
particularly broad term.

#### Percentages are [arbitrary]{.underline}. 

**Viscasillas '4** \[Pilar; October 24; Professor at the Universidad
Carlos III de Madrid; CISG Advisory Council Opinion, "Contracts for the
Sale of Goods to Be Manufactured or Produced and Mixed Contracts
(Article 3 CISG),"
<http://cisgac.com/default.php?ipkCat=128&ifkCat=146&sid=146>\]

2.8. Legal writers who follow the economic value criterion have
generally quantified the term \"substantial part\" by comparing Article
3(1) CISG (substantial) with Article 3(2) CISG (preponderant):
substantial being less than preponderant. In this way, [legal writers
have used the **following percentages** to quantify substantial:
15%]{.underline},\[14\] [between 40% and 50%]{.underline},\[15\]
[or]{.underline} more [generally 50%]{.underline}.\[16\] [At the **same
time**, **other authors**]{.underline}, although they have not fixed any
numbers in regard to the quantification of the term \"substantial\" have
[declared]{.underline} that \"preponderant\" means [\"considerably more
than 50%]{.underline} of the price\" [or]{.underline} \"clearly [in
excess of 50%\"]{.underline}.\[17\] Thus [it seems that for the latter
authors, the **quantification** of]{.underline} the term
[\"substantial\" is placed above the 50% figure]{.underline}. Also, some
Courts have followed this approach.\[18\]

2.9. [To consider a **fixed percentage** might be
**arbitrary**]{.underline} due to the fact that [the **particularities**
of **each case** ought to be taken into account]{.underline}; that the
[scholars are in **disagreement**; and]{.underline} that [the **origin**
of]{.underline} those [figures is **not clear**]{.underline}.\[19\]

Therefore, [it does not seem]{.underline} to be [advisable to
**quantify** the word \"**substantial**\" a priori **in percentages**. A
**case-by-case** analysis is **preferable** and]{.underline} thus it
[should be determined on the basis of an **overall
assessment**]{.underline}.

***intransitive* verb** "increase" is "**to become** greater in size,

Contest Statement - [is "to ***cause*** to become greater in size,
amount, degree, etc.; ***add to***; ***augment***."]{.underline} Id.

Medicare spending to become greater in size in the period from 1995 to
2002, or that the Bill would have added to or augmented Medicare
spending in those years.

In determining the plain meaning of the phrase "increases the obligor\'s
insolvency," the Court initially notes that this phrase makes no
reference whatsoever to a "reasonably equivalent value" test26 or even
to the "fair consideration" test of the Section 3 of the UFCA.27
Instead, Article 2036 of the Civil Code merely uses the word
"increases," and the absence of "reasonably equivalent value" language
or "fair consideration" language rings loudly in the Court\'s judicial
ear. Accordingly, [the Court will focus on **the plain meaning** of the
term "**increases**." Taking note from **one of the dictionaries of
choice** of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[Supreme

\*270 \[T\]o become progressively greater (as in size, amount, number,
or intensity) \.... [to make **greater**]{.underline}: AUGMENT \....
INCREASE, ENLARGE, AUGMENT, MULTIPLY mean to make or become greater.

Specifically, EPA claims that, even when a change causes emissions to

"increase\[\]" them. EPA Br. 69-71, 86. According to EPA\'s untenable
argument, Congress did not specify how an increase is to be measured,
and thus left EPA free to interpret "increases" as it wishes. Id.

**McGuffey '20** \[Carroll; Summer; partner at Troutman Pepper Hamilton
Sanders LLP; Natural Resources & Environment, "Reforming New Source
Review: What Project Emissions Accounting Really Means, and Why It
Should Survive," p. 37\]

The debate over how to count changes in emissions when determining NSR
applicability is as old as the program itself. [The CAA]{.underline}
requires permitting for any "increase" in emissions, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7411,
7475, 7479, but it [does not define the word "**increase**," leaving
room for interpretation. Such ambiguity leaves **EPA** in charge of
deciding how]{.underline} sources must determine whether [an
"**increase**" will occur]{.underline}. New York, 413 F.3d at 22-24. In
fact, a different dispute over the ambiguities in the very same
statutory provision resulted in the Supreme Court\'s now famous (or
infamous) Chevron decision on agency deference. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.
Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837, 865 (1984) (concluding that the
EPA\'s method of calculating emissions is a reasonable policy choice).

In an attempt [to define]{.underline} the ambiguous word ["increase,"
EPA]{.underline} has adopted increasingly complex
[regulations]{.underline}, but those rules have consistently maintained
that source owners [must]{.underline} be allowed to [consider
the]{.underline} overall ["**net effect**"]{.underline} of a project [on
the]{.underline} stationary source as a **[whole]{.underline}**. This
idea has taken on many names and forms over time\--referred to variously
as the "bubble concept," "contemporaneous netting," "project netting,"
and now "Project Emissions Accounting." The only debate has been in
deciding what rules are needed to right-size the NSR permitting program
so that permits are required only for those projects that truly warrant
such review.

No one can predict with any certainty how the D.C. Circuit will receive
PEA. However, the D.C. Circuit already decided long ago that the CAA
allows EPA significant discretion in deciding how sources should
calculate emissions increases and decreases in applying NSR permitting
requirements.

The issue of whether and how to count multiple changes in emissions
under NSR arose in the context of legal challenges to EPA\'s 1978 NSR
rules. Alabama Power Co. v. Costle, 636 F.2d 323, 399-403 (D.C. Cir.
1980). In that lengthy opinion, specifically the portion authored by
[Judge Wilkey]{.underline}, the court [recognized]{.underline} that
[there were]{.underline} two [**logical ways** to interpret the word
"**increase**" in the statute]{.underline}\--a source must either
determine the "net effect" or count only increases and ignore decreases.

[The court **resoundingly rejected** the idea that decreases should be
**ignored**]{.underline}, calling the idea "unreasonable and contrary to
the expressed purposes of the \[Act\]." Instead, the court decided that
the statute requires EPA to "look at any change proposed for a plant,
and decide whether the net effect of all the steps involved in that
change is to increase the emission of any air pollutant \[;\] this is
commonly termed the 'bubble' concept." Id. at 401 (emphasis added). To
explain its reasoning, the court noted that "\[t\]he bubble concept is
precisely suited to preserve air quality within a framework that allows
cost-efficient, flexible planning for industrial expansion and
improvement." Id. at 402.

### Increase\-\--Preexistence\-\--1NC

#### To "increase" means expanding [already-existing cooperation]{.underline}.

**Buckley '6** \[Jeremiah S, Joseph M. Kolar; November 13; partners at
Buckley Kolar LLP; Westlaw, Brief of Amici Curiae for "Mortgage
Insurance Companies of America and Consumer Mortgage Coalition," WL
3309503\]

First, [t]{.underline}he court said that the ordinary meaning of the
word "increase" is "to make something greater," which it believed should
not "be limited to cases in which a company raises the rate that an
individual has previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet [**the
definition** offered by the Ninth Circuit compels **the opposite
conclusion**. Because "increase" means "to make **something greater**,"
there must necessarily have been **an existing**]{.underline} premium,
[to]{.underline} which Edo\'s actual premium may [**be compared**, to
determine whether an]{.underline} \*26 ["increase" **occurred**.
Congress]{.underline} could have provided that "adverse action" in the
insurance context means charging an amount greater than the optimal
premium, but instead **[chose]{.underline}** to define adverse action in
terms of an ["increase." That definitional choice must be **respected,
not ignored**]{.underline}. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379,
392-93 n.10 (1979) ("\[a\] definition which declares what a term
'means\' ... excludes any meaning that is not stated").

Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because the Insurance Prong
includes the words "existing or applied for," Congress intended that an
"increase in any charge" for insurance must "apply to all insurance
transactions - from an initial policy of insurance to a renewal of a
long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This interpretation reads the words
"existing or applied for" in isolation. Other types of adverse action
described in the Insurance Prong apply only to situations where a
consumer had an existing policy of insurance, such as a "cancellation,"
"reduction," or "change" in insurance. [Each]{.underline} of these forms
of adverse action [**presupposes an already-existing policy**, and under
**usual canons of statutory construction** the term "increase" also
should be **construed** to apply to **increases** of **an
already-existing policy**]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88,
101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it")
(citation omitted).

### Increase\-\--Preexistence\-\--2NC

#### [Plain language]{.underline} agrees.

**Brown '3** \[Anna J; July 17; Federal District Court Judge in Oregon;
Westlaw, Mark v. Valley Insurance Company, 275 F. Supp. 2d 1307\]

[FCRA does not **define** the term "increase." **The plain and ordinary
meaning** of **the verb** "to increase" is to make]{.underline}
something **[greater or larger]{.underline}**.4 [Merriam--Webster\'s
Collegiate Dictionary]{.underline} 589 (10th ed.1998). The "something"
that is increased in the statute is the "charge for any insurance." The
plain and common meaning of the noun "charge" is "the price demanded for
something." Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer takes
adverse action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the price
demanded for insurance.

[An insurer cannot "**make greater**" something that did not **exist
previously**]{.underline}. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance coverage at a lower price.

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that
the agreement (contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement
(contract) between Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other
words, to accept AT&T's argument the Commission must conclude that two
separate contracts, i.e. the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Sprint Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between
Cricket and AT&T in Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and
the same. Upon this unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that
"***the ICA*** was already extended"; id. at 14, and "***the ICA***
Cricket seeks to extend was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and,
finally, "Cricket cannot extend ***the same ICA*** a second time . . .
." Id. (emphasis added in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the
AT&T brief (and elsewhere) [AT&T uses vague and imprecise
language]{.underline} when referring to either the Sprint Kentucky
Agreement, or the Cricket Kentucky Agreement, i[n hopes that the
Commission will treat the two contracts as]{.underline} one and [the
same]{.underline}. But it would be a mistake to do so. The contract
governing AT&T's duties and obligations with Sprint is a legally
distinct and separate contract from that which governs AT&T's duties
with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky Agreement was approved by the
Commission in September of 2001 in Case Number 2000-00480. The Cricket
Kentucky Agreement was approved by the Commission in September of 2008
in Case Number 2008-033 1. [AT&T ignores]{.underline} the fact [that
these are two separate and distinct contracts because it knows that the
merger commitments apply to ***each*** agreement]{.underline} that an
individual telecommunications carrier has with AT&T. Notably, Merger
Commitment 7.4 states that "AT&T/BellSouth ILECs shall permit ***a
requesting telecommunications carrier*** to extend ***its*** current
interconnection agreement . . . . As written, [the commitment allows any
carrier to extend "***its***" agreement]{.underline}. Clearly, the use
of the pronoun ["[its]{.mark}"]{.underline} in this context [[is
possessive]{.underline}]{.mark}, such that [the term "its" [means -
***that*** particular]{.mark} carrier's [agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}
with AT&T **[([and not any]{.mark} other carrier's
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}**). Thus, the merger commitment applies
to each agreement that an individual carrier may have with AT&T. It
necessarily follows then, that Cricket's right to extend its agreement
under Merger Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right from another
carrier's right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or whether such
agreement has been extended).

#### Its is [possessive]{.underline} and refers to the party preceding its use 

**US District Court 7** (United States District Court for the District

In support of this contention appellant again argues that when any
ambiguity exists in a will it is the duty of the court to construe the
will under guidance of the presumption that the testatrix intended her
property to go to her next of kin, unless there is a strong intention to
the contrary. Again we say, there is intrinsic proof of a  \[\*1074\] 
strong intention to the contrary. In the first place, testatrix only
named two of her blood relatives in the will and had she
desired \[\*\*\*37\]  them to take the residuary estate she doubtless
would have mentioned them by name in the residuary clause. In the second
place, if she used the word \"heirs\" in the sense of blood relatives
she certainly would have dispelled all ambiguity by stating whose blood
relatives were intended. Not only had  \[\*\*53\]  she taken pains in
the will to identify her own two blood relatives but she had also
identified certain blood relatives of her deceased husband. [[Had it
been her intention to vest the residuary estate in her blood relatives
**solely**]{.mark}, she [would certainly]{.mark} have [use]{.mark}d the
**[possessive pronoun]{.mark}** \"my\" instead of the indefinite article
\"the\"]{.underline} in the clause, \"the above heirs.\"its is

600; 44 Oil & Gas Rep. 214, Lexis)

On its face, the written instrument granting easement rights in this
case is ambiguous. The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a
14 inch pipeline (singular) has a later reference to \"said lines\"
(plural). The use of the plural \"lines\" makes no sense because the
only previous reference has been to a \"line\" (singular). [The writing
is]{.underline} additionally [ambiguous because]{.underline} other key
words which are \"also may change the size of its pipes\" are dangling
in that [the possessive [pronoun \"its]{.mark}\"]{.underline} before the
word \"pipes\" [[does not have any subject preceding]{.mark}, to which
the possessive pronoun refers]{.underline}. The dangling phrase is the
beginning of a sentence, the first word of which does not begin with a
capital letter as is customary in normal English \[\*\*\*10\]  usage.
Immediately preceding the \"sentence\" which does not begin with a
capital letter, there appears a dangling  \[\*236\]  semicolon which
makes no sense at the beginning of a sentence and can hardly relate to
the preceding sentence which is already properly punctuated by a closing
period. [The above deviations from accepted grammatical usage

## Security Cooperation\-\--Requires DOD

### SC\-\--DOD\-\--1NC

#### "Security cooperation" requires the DOD.

States Army; the Military Law Review, "Other Security Forces Too:
Traditional Combatant Commander Activities Between U.S. Special
Operations Forces and Foreign Non-Military Forces," vol. 227\]

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition,130 encompasses DoS programs, but not DoD
or other executive agency programs.131 In addition,
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[**defined** "security
coop]{.mark}eration" [as **DoD specific**]{.mark}]{.underline},132 [[but
it has **not** defined "security assistance]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[[The DoD]{.underline}]{.mark} adheres to the presidential policy
definition and [[**further defines** "security coop]{.mark}eration[" as
**all its relationship building** and **foreign partner development
activities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including "security assistance,"
which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation that is funded
and authorized by the DoS]{.underline} and administered by the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency.133 The DoS, on the other hand, uses the
term "security assistance" in a manner that contradicts the DoD\'s
definition, employing it to describe any DoS or DoD assistance to
foreign military or other security forces.134

#### The Greenbook defines "security cooperation" much the same.

**DSCU '21** \[Defense Security Cooperation University; last updated May
2021; University created by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency,
which is part of the Department of Defense; Greenbook, "Introduction to
Security Cooperation," Ch. 1,
https://www.dscu.edu/documents/publications/greenbook/01_Chapter.pdf?id=1\]

[The **term** security cooperation was]{.underline} first
[introduced]{.underline} in 1997 [by the Defense Reform
Initiative]{.underline} (DRI). At that time, the Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day-to-day management
responsibilities of many security assistance programs authorized by the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export Control Act (AECA).
The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain Department of Defense
(DoD)-funded international programs along with their personnel and
associated resources. In order for U.S. government (USG) agencies, the
private sector, and foreign governments to better understand DSAA's
enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security assistance (SA),
DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs while also leading the wider USG security
cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation programs
continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs), or the military
departments (MILDEPs). Further complicating the management of security
cooperation was the in-country point of contact between the USG and the
host nation. This point of contact was either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA)- sponsored Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or the
DSCA-sponsored Security Cooperation Office (SCO). These two spigots of
securiy cooperation within a country required a broad knowledge and
skill baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD, its agencies and the
MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of incountry
security cooperation were generally resolved with the establishment of
the Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) having oversight
over both the SCO and DAO organizations.

On 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **formal**]{.underline}, yet still
very broad, [**definition** of security cooperation in Joint Pub
1-02:]{.underline}

> [**All DoD interactions** with **foreign defense establishments** to
> build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with]{.underline} peacetime and contingency [access to a]{.underline}
> host [nation]{.underline}.

DODD 5132.03, [DoD Policy]{.underline} and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation, 29 December 2016, [**further defines** security
cooperation with **assigned responsibilities**:]{.underline}

> [**All DoD interactions** with **foreign defense establishments** to
> build defense relationships that promote **specific U.S. security
> interests**, develop allied and partner]{.underline} nation military
> and security [capabilities]{.underline} for self-defense and
> multinational operations, [and provide]{.underline} U.S. [forces
> with]{.underline} peacetime and contingency [access to allied and
> partner nations.]{.underline} This includes DoD-administered security
> assistance programs.

[According to Title 10]{.underline} U.S. Code Section 301, [the
term]{.underline} "**[security cooperation]{.underline}** programs and
activities of the Department of Defense" [means **any program,
activity**]{.underline} (including an exercise), [**or interaction** of
the DoD with the **security establishment** of a foreign country to
achieve a purpose as follows: (A) To build]{.underline} and develop
[allied and friendly]{.underline} security [capabilities]{.underline}
for self-defense and multinational operations. [(B) To provide the armed
forces with access]{.underline} to the foreign country during peacetime
or a contingency operation. [(C) To build relationships]{.underline}
that promote specific United States security interests. Other DoD policy
statements identify DoD-managed or administered security assistance
programs as components of security cooperation.

#### "Security cooperation" is by the DOD.

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 President's Budget: Security Cooperation
Consolidated Budget Display outlines seven categories of security
cooperation activity, including military-to-military engagements,
support to operations, and humanitarian and assistance activities, among
others.6 The security cooperation framework traditionally includes
security assistance (SA), security force assistance (SFA), and some
aspects of foreign internal defense (FID).7 In the context of this
article, [the **term** security cooperation **refers primarily** to
military-to-military engagements]{.underline}, where the U.S. military
engages in training partner forces [under]{.underline} the auspices of
[Title 10 and Title 22 authorities]{.underline}.

#### "Security cooperation" [requires]{.underline} the Department of Defense.

**Defense '16** \[Department of Defense; February 15; Joint Publication
1-02, "Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated
Terms," https://irp.fas.org/doddir/dod/jp1_02.pdf\]

[security cooperation --- **All Department of Defense interactions**
with **foreign defense establishments** to build defense

Director of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency; Senior Fellow and
Director of Research, Foreign Policy, Brookings; "How Security
Cooperation Advances U.S. Interests," Brookings Institute Foreign Policy
Studies Program event\]

Well, thank you, Mike, and thanks very much for having me. And good
morning, everybody. I am the director of the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency and it\'s the agency that does more and is known by
less people than anybody else in Washington, so I always welcome the
opportunity to tell everybody about it.

**[[The D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ecurity
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ooperation **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**gency
[[is mandated by Congress to **execute all security
cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[some on
behalf]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[State]{.underline}]{.mark} Department, [[much on behalf of the
**D**]{.underline}]{.mark}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense, **[[writ large and
worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It is most known for being the
executive agent for foreign military sales]{.underline}, and that\'s
what most people know about us. [But we\'re also responsible for excess
defense articles. We are the executive agent for all five Department of
Defense regional centers]{.underline}, so the Marshall Center in
Germany; the Inouye Center, Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, in
Hawaii.

**[[We\'re also responsible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and we\'ll talk a
little bit about this later, **[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** what I call
**[[institutional capacity-building]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[That is
the complement]{.underline}]{.mark} to foreign military sales [[that
ensures that our partners have the]{.underline}]{.mark} human resources
and the **[[defense institutional development t]{.underline}]{.mark}**o
properly utilize the equipment we buy for them in the interest of
national security.

Our headquarters is here in Crystal City, in Washington.
[[We]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[work with the **Security Cooperation\'s
officers**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[We
work with the COCOMs. And we\'re under actually]{.underline}]{.mark},
and this is unique for the United States, we work for
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Under Secretary of Defense for
Policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. So we work for Mr. John Rood. And the
reason I say that is in many countries, the acquisitions and the arms
sales come under the acquisitions or the logistics directorates or work
directly in some of our competitors, for those companies, those
state-owned companies. But **[[here in the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[security
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} and arms sales [[is a policy tool and
not a tool for anything else]{.underline}]{.mark}. So that\'s basically
kind of a snapshot of what DSCA does.

MR. O\'HANLON: So, great. That\'s very helpful. And let me ask a couple
more follow-up questions just to continue to refine our understanding.

So a command like Africa Command, where you spent three years, which
does a lot of training in the field, is all of that training essentially
under your purview? Or the parts that do not involve U.S. weapons
transfers or sales, are they potentially separate and you coordinate,
but you\'re not in charge of that? Is that correct?

GENERAL HOOPER: Well, that\'s a very good question. [[The geographic
combatant commands still have the responsibility for executing security
cooperation in their respective commands. We work by, with, and through
those commands]{.underline}]{.mark}. The weapons sales portion of it, or
the defense articles and services portion of it, comes directly under
DSCA\'s supervision. **[[Some of the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[training
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}** and other things [[we work
collaboratively]{.underline}]{.mark} with the combatant commands. And
then in some cases, [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} example, in
[[institutional capacity-building, we work]{.underline}]{.mark} together
[[in a synergistic fashion to effect that security
coop]{.underline}]{.mark}eration.

So it\'s equal parts. Some things we\'re principally responsible for,
some things the combatant commands are responsible for, and some things
we work jointly together.

MR. O\'HANLON: And as we start to paint this picture of your
responsibilities and how you work with others, I also wanted to bring in
foreign military assistance and financing. And my understanding is that
there are parts of foreign military assistance of various types that we
give through the State Department and other types we give through DOD.
It depends a little bit on the recipient and the nature of the aid.
Could you help us understand that a little bit, too? Because I\'m sure
some of that money is what\'s being used to buy the weapons that you\'re
overseeing the transfer of.

GENERAL HOOPER: Absolutely. And that\'s also a very good question. So
let\'s start on what we call the Title 22 on the State Department side.

We are the executive agent. The **[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Department [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} [[responsibility for foreign
military sales and we are]{.underline}]{.mark}, in effect, the executive
agent for the State Department in foreign military sales. Now, **[[there
are two real big components of security
cooperation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[One is what we call Title
22]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is the State Department supervised
element for which we are the executive agent. [[The other half of it is
the Title 10 piece.]{.underline}]{.mark}

So, for example, as a result of the Fiscal Year \'17 NDAA, we had
several different authorities and a disparate group of authorities that
were all consolidated into one, the majority into one authority, 333,
Section 333, that many of you may be familiar with. And this constitutes
the Title 10 security cooperation piece.

The biggest way to distinguish between the two is our
**[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}** Department [[responsibilities are
principally focused to a great extent on defense **articles and
services**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[whereas]{.underline}]{.mark} our
**[[Title 10]{.underline}]{.mark}** responsibilities
[[fall]{.underline}]{.mark}, in many cases, more
[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} the realm of [[institutional
capacity-building, exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and other types of
things like that.]{.underline}

MR. O\'HANLON: That\'s interesting. So you could think of it the
[[hardware]{.underline}]{.mark}, sort of the
[[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, the hardcore stuff,
[[that\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} through **[[State]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The [[people]{.underline}]{.mark} side, [[the softer
side]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the software side is through
DOD.]{.underline}]{.mark}

GENERAL HOOPER: Right.

MR. O\'HANLON: It\'s almost the opposite of what some people might
guess.

GENERAL HOOPER: Right. And **[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in many
respects, **[[serve as a catalyst]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[bring all
of that together at the national level.]{.underline}]{.mark}

5\. Security Cooperation Roles and Responsibilities

[SC involves]{.underline} planning and [**interagency coordination** by
a **myriad** of organizational entities]{.underline} from the
departmental level down to the SCO in an HN, as well as participating US
military units. [The following have]{.underline} significant roles and
[responsibilities for SC activities:]{.underline}

a\. [DOD]{.underline}. The USD(P) oversees, integrates, and coordinates
DOD policies and plans for coordination of SC policies, goals, and
priorities for SecDef with MILDEPs, DOS, and other interagency partners
to enable greater unity of effort in activities that support national
security objectives. DODD 5132.03, DOD Policy and Responsibilities
Relating to Security Cooperation, details USD(P) responsibilities for
SC. USD(P) and DOS counterparts are responsible for the approvals, the
funding, and other authorities required by CCDRs and the Services for
planning and executing SC activities in support of PN requirements and
US security objectives. USD(P) typically designates/delegates certain
responsibilities for SC to assistant or deputy assistant secretariat
levels. USD(P) also oversees the development of policy governing the use
of the G-TSCMIS to support the resourcing, assessment, planning, and
monitoring of SC activities.

\(1\) DSCA. DSCA is a separate agency of DOD under the direction,
authority, and control of USD(P). DSCA represents the interests of
SecDef and USD(P) in SC matters and is charged to direct, administer,
and provide DOD-wide guidance to DOD components and representatives to
execute DSCA-managed SC programs. DSCA serves as the resource sponsor
for G-TSCMIS and oversees the development and continued sustainment of
the enterprise system. DSCA conducts SC and sales negotiations with
foreign countries in accordance with USD(P) and DOS guidance and
negotiates and concludes SC-related international programs. DSCA
delegates the administration of SC programs, as appropriate, to either
the MILDEPs, CCMDs, DOD agencies, or DOD field activities. DSCA
establishes appropriate agreements and procedures with CCMDs and the
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for the respective SDOs/DATTs, to
provide guidance and oversight of SC programs for which DSCA is
responsible. DSCA advises the Defense Technology Security Administration
(DTSA) of proposed transfers of significant new technologies and/or
weapons systems and determinations of whether significant items or
specific sales must be sold exclusively through FMS.

\(2\) DTSA. DTSA is a DOD field activity under the authority, direction,
and control of the USD(P) that serves as the point of contact for
development and implementation of DOD policy concerning technology
security, export controls, and certain non-proliferation for military
and dual-use items. DTSA identifies and mitigates national security
risks associated with the international transfer of advanced technology
and critical information. DTSA provides new and emerging partners with
technological awareness via bilateral and multilateral engagements and
negotiations, thereby ensuring applicable PNs have the agreements and
security mechanisms in place to properly protect US technology. This
assistance facilitates DOD objectives to build partnership capacity and
capability and enhance interoperability. Additionally, DTSA
responsibilities include managing the Space Launch Monitoring Program;
DOD's patent security review process; the development of DOD policy on
technology security and foreign disclosure processes; and advising DOD
leadership on the development of policy and procedures governing the
disclosure and protection of classified military, and controlled
unclassified information, to international partners.

\(3\) Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and
Logistics (USD\[AT&L\]) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
policies for the effective development of international acquisition,
technology, and logistics programs, including international armaments
cooperation (e.g., science and technology collaboration, logistics
support), to support SC priorities. In coordination with USD(P),
USD(AT&L) supports the development of policies and procedures for
foreign transfer of defense-related articles, services, and
technologies. In coordination with USD(P) and DOS, USD(AT&L) identifies,
prioritizes, and pursues defense agreements required to facilitate the
transfer of defense-related articles, services, and technologies to
partners.

\(4\) In coordination with USD(P), the Under Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence (USD\[I\]) provides guidance for and oversight of
intelligence-related SC, including programs and resources, to build PN
intelligence capabilities in support of SC priorities. USD(I) also
ensures defense intelligence collection and analysis is sufficient to
support SC planning, execution, and assessment, monitoring, and
evaluation efforts.

\(5\) JS. The JS assists the CJCS regarding statutory responsibilities
for the unified strategic direction of the US Armed Forces. However, the
JS exercises no executive authority. The JS represents CJCS's
implementation guidance for military plans and programs and provides the
CJCS with military advice concerning SC. In conjunction with USD(P), the
JS reviews the SC activities included in CCMD campaign plans to ensure
the planning guidance has been met. The JS also reviews allocation
recommendations prior to SecDef approval of forces and other resources
for the execution of military activities in campaign plans and operation
orders. The JS produces the annual DOD campaign plan assessment template
in consultation with USD(P) to integrate and coordinate Service support
of CCMD campaign plans, as required. The JS recommends force and
activity designators for priorities in the distribution of defense
articles, defense services, and military education and training between
and among PNs, organizations, and the US Armed Forces and recommends
priorities for allocation of materiel and equipment for PNs when
competing needs cannot be resolved by Director, DSCA. The JS collects
and reviews the CCDRs' campaign plans and the CCDRs' assessments and
evaluations, and advises the CJCS on the effectiveness of DOD SC
efforts.

\(6\) CCMDs. Geographic CCMDs are the primary organizations for SC
planning and integrating SC activities into their TCPs. Functional CCMDs
prepare campaign plans that integrate their forces, resources, and
funding for SC activities in coordination with the geographic CCMDs,
their Service components, international organizations and, when
appropriate, the affected SCOs. United States Special Operations Command
(USSOCOM) coordinates SC activities to be executed by SOF with the
geographic CCMDs through their theater special operations commands
(TSOCs), including the deployment of special operations liaison
officers, as well as SOF Service components. US Transportation Command
coordinates movement within the Defense Transportation System, including
integration of DOD and PN cargo distribution into existing force flow
and global synchronization activities, as well as TDPs. CCMD planners
should coordinate with COMs, through the SDO/DATTs, during the
development of ICSs. These ICSs should, in turn, inform CCMD SC planners
in the development of their required CSCSs/country plans. SC planning is
typically led by the plans directorate of a joint staff (J-5) and
supported by the other directorates (e.g., logistics directorate of a
joint staff \[J-4\] for building PN logistic capacity). CCMD desk
officers often lead country planning and work directly with the
SDO/DATTs in their AORs and their counterparts in the Service component
commands to develop country-level plans and identify forces and resource
requirements. These desk officers are also the principal link between
DOD-level staffs (OSD and JS) and the SDO/DATTs and their applicable
country teams. CCMDs review their campaign plans by objectively and
subjectively assessing, monitoring, and evaluating the effects of their
SC activities in achieving desired objectives relative to attaining the
intended end state. CCDRs must prioritize and approve the SC
requirements of PNs established through coordination by the SDO/DATTs
(as DOD members of COMs' country teams) and Service component commands.
CCMDs integrate SC activities into their CSCSs/country plans and
campaign plans as necessary.

\(7\) TSOC. TSOCs are subordinate unified commands established by
USSOCOM to plan, coordinate, conduct, and support joint special
operations. These commands, and SOF, are under the combatant command
(command authority) of USSOCOM, and under the operational control of the
GCCs. Normally, GCCs exercise operational control of SOF through the
TSOCs when operating within their AORs. TSOCs coordinate SOF integration
and Service component support of SOF for FID, SFA, COIN, CT, FHA,
unconventional warfare, and other special operations core activities in
all campaigns and operations. TSOCs support SOF conducting SFA
activities and other SC activities in support of the GCCs' TCPs.

\(8\) MILDEPs, Services, and Service Component Commands. MILDEPs and
Services support CCDR campaign plans and simultaneously pursue
Service-specific SC objectives consistent with national and theater
strategic objectives. MILDEPs, Services, and USSOCOM, in its
Service-related responsibilities, support the CCMDs in shaping of the
strategic security environment by enabling security conditions favorable
to US objectives and interests. The Services may prepare Service CSPs at
the discretion of the Service chief. Service CSPs integrate Title 10,
USC, programs to support CCMD campaign and Service institutional
objectives. If developed, and when appropriate, Services may synchronize
CSPs with CCMD campaign plans through their respective component
commands. The US Marine Corps and the US Navy each submit independent
Service CSPs via the Department of the Navy. The US Army and the US Air
Force submit their CSPs via their respective MILDEPs. Services are also
responsible for executing sales made through SA. The Service component
commands prepare supporting objectives and plans at the discretion of
the component commander, CCDR, or Service chief to satisfy the requests
or requirements of the supported commander's plan. Supporting plans
should be coordinated with the MILDEPs and may include organize, train,
and equip responsibilities such as exercises, readiness,
interoperability, augmentation, joint enablers, and capabilities
development. Service components should also coordinate with SDO/DATTs on
the country teams to determine potential military capabilities that
could be made available to PNs through SC.

\(9\) SCO. This organization includes all DOD elements located in a
foreign country with assigned responsibilities for carrying out SA/SC
management functions. An SCO works under the authority of the COM. SCOs
may be referred to as military assistance advisory groups, military
missions and groups, offices of defense and military cooperation,
liaison groups, and defense attaché personnel who have been designated
to perform SA/SC functions. Military units conducting SC activities in
an HN normally work closely with and coordinate with the SCO, but their
lines of authority are through their Service components and the
supported CCDR, not through the SDO/DATT to the COM. The SCO is
responsible for assessing whether a PN can build and sustain capacity
and has the greatest visibility over the execution of SC activities.
Generally, the SCO is responsible for evaluating the results of SC
activities and investments for the COM and GCC. Title 22, USC, Section
2321i (FAA) outlines the seven legislated SCO SA functions as follows:

\(a\) Equipment and services case management (i.e., FMS case
management).

\(b\) Training management.

\(c\) Program monitoring.

\(d\) Evaluation and planning of the host government's military
capabilities and requirements.

\(e\) Administrative support.

\(f\) Promoting rationalization, standardization, interoperability, and
other defense cooperation measures.

\(g\) Liaison functions exclusive of advisory and training assistance.

\(10\) SDO/DATT. The SDO/DATT serves as the diplomatically accredited
defense attaché and chief of the SCO (if an SCO is present). As the
COM's principal military advisor on defense and national security issues
and the senior DOD military officer assigned to a US diplomatic mission,
the SDO/DATT serves as the single point of contact for all DOD matters
involving the US mission or DOD elements assigned to or working from the
US mission. All DOD elements under COM authority are within the
coordinating authority of the SDO/DATT, except for the Marine security
guard detachment and naval support units. The SDO/DATT operates under
the authority of the COM and is the key figure within the US mission for
establishing and fostering an SC relationship with the HN. The SDO/DATT,
in collaboration with the GCC and other DOD components, provides DOD
input to the ICS. The SDO/DATT, or a designated member of the SCO, is
the point of contact for SC planning and development of the country plan
with the GCC planners. Subject to COM approval, the SDO/DATT is the lead
integrator for SC activities with the PN. For SC purposes, the SDO/DATT
normally maintains coordination with Service/SOF components and their
SMEs when assessing the HN for building partner capacity. The SDO/DATT,
in coordination with the supported GCC, serves under the joint oversight
and administrative management of the USD(P) and USD(I) through the
Directors of DSCA and the DIA.

\(11\) The National Guard may appoint an officer to serve at the US
mission under the SDO/DATT as the State Partnership Program (SPP)
liaison for the partner state's National Guard with the GCC and HN. The
National Guard officer is nominated by the partner state's adjutant
general, approved by the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and accepted by
the supported GCC. The National Guard officer coordinates all SPP events
and activities among the NGB, US partner state, the specific country
team, and the HN to facilitate the supported GCC SC policies, plans, and
objectives. Also, the National Guard officer may assist in coordinating
required support for bilateral and/or multilateral military engagements
between the US and the HN, including activities not under SPP.

b\. [DOS]{.underline}. DOS maintains bureaus and offices (e.g., Office
of US Foreign Assistance Resources, Bureau of East Asia and Pacific
Affairs) functionally and/or geographically aligned with interagency
partners (especially DOD), international organizations, and foreign
nations to coordinate effective execution of the diplomacy, development,
and defense aspects of US foreign policy. DOS analyzes the requirements
for security-related assistance as part of USG foreign assistance. [DOS
maintains **interagency coordination** with]{.underline} respective
counterparts in DOD concerning future SA programs and SC activities with
PNs.

\(1\) COM. The COM, typically the US ambassador, is the principal
officer in charge of a US diplomatic facility abroad. The COM is the
personal representative of the President to the country of
accreditation, and is responsible to the Secretary of State (SECSTATE)
for the direction, coordination, and supervision of all USG executive
branch employees in that country (except those under the command of a US
area military commander). As statutorily mandated, the COM directs and
supervises all activities in country and coordinates the resources and
programs of the USG through the country team. COMs approve the ICSs
developed through their country teams in coordination within DOS and
through interagency coordination with DOD and other interagency partners
at the national level. COMs, through the SDO/DATTs on their country
teams, coordinate on the CCDRs' CSCSs/country plans that will become
part of the campaign plans. COMs facilitate the coordination of PN
security-related requirements that become part of the specific SA
programs and SC activities conducted by US military with those PNs.

\(2\) Country Team. The country team is the senior USG coordinating and
supervising body in a foreign country. Headed by the COM, it includes
the SDO/DATT, heads of all US embassy sections, and the senior member of
each of the other represented USG departments or agencies, as desired by
the COM. The country team issues directives to consulates, tasks action
items for DOS offices and bureaus, and works to deconflict/balance all
agency programs and priorities within the context of the COM's ICS for
that country. Depending on the size of a US embassy and the nature of US
interests in a country, each country team may be configured
differently---and some may include more than 40 interagency
representatives, in addition to section chiefs and the head of the local
USAID mission. With guidance from DOS and the COM, the country team
develops the ICS regarding the PN, which influences the CCDR's
development of a CSCS/country plan for that PN.

\(3\) Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM). PM is DOS's principal
link to DOD. PM provides policy direction in the areas of international
security, SA, and defense trade. PM's primary counterpart in DOD is the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans, and
Capabilities. Joint force and Service planners may coordinate with PM
through OSD and the JS.

fall under security cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [as
well.]{.underline} We use the term security sector assistance for
simplicity, and distinguish where these additional security cooperation
activities are relevant. The U.S. government does not typically define
Foreign Military Sales as assistance, but we believe it should, and that
it ought to factor Direct Commercial Sales into its assistance planning
as well. Both types of sales can lead to sustained U.S. engagement with
a partner in the form of training, maintenance, and sustainment for the
purchased items.

Over the last several years, the national security enterprise has, with
a great many fits and starts, endeavored to shift its broader focus ---
from weapons systems to diplomacy --- away from counter-terrorism and
toward strategic competition with state actors. As part of this shift,
policymakers have attempted to realign security assistance to contribute
more directly to strategic competition, primarily by creating new
resources for security assistance in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
The European Deterrence Initiative, launched in 2014, has allocated
around \$6 billion annually to enhance America's deterrent posture
vis-à-vis Russia. It has been supplemented by the Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative, authorized by Congress in Fiscal Year 2016 to
provide \$250 million in security assistance to bolster Ukraine's
security. Congress also created the Southeast Asia Maritime Security
Initiative in 2014, later re-designated as the Indo-Pacific Maritime
Security Initiative, and funded it as a five-year, \$425 million
security assistance effort, which it has since extended through FY2025.
This program is intended to improve the ability of Southeast and East
Asian nations to address growing Chinese assertiveness in the South
China Sea. In the FY2021 defense bill currently being finalized,
Congress is set to authorize a Pacific Deterrence Initiative, modeled on
the European Deterrence Initiative, with as much as \$6 billion annually
to improve U.S. posture in the Asia-Pacific region, reportedly with a
significant security assistance component.

These efforts have been laudable, but far from sufficient. The European
Deterrence Initiative has largely been used to shift enduring costs for
U.S. military presence in Europe into the Overseas Contingency
Operations portion of the defense budget. It has also dedicated the vast
majority of funds to posture and equipment pre-positioning, with little
attention to security assistance beyond combined exercises --- a
significant missed opportunity. The Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative has been managed insularly by the U.S. Europe Command, which
has bypassed synchronization with other Defense Department and U.S.
government stakeholders, leading to a focus on the provision of
"training and equipment at the expense of developing a long-term
strategic vision and implementation of meaningful defense reform." In
the Asia-Pacific, the Maritime Security Initiative has shown promise,
but its relatively limited funding has failed to significantly
contribute to a rebalance of assistance toward the region, and it has
largely funded projects with little deterrent value. Incoming U.S.
Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. Philip Davidson declared, "China is now
capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios short of war
with the United States." Moreover, none of these initiatives have
prioritized partner security sector governance --- a vital element of
any strategy that seeks to shape the behavior of U.S. allies and
partners. As Congress considers the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, it is
essential that these mistakes --- failure to integrate security
assistance with other instruments of national power, overemphasis on
posture at the expense of cooperation, and too little ambition for
assistance initiatives --- are not repeated. Even avoiding them,
however, will go only so far in terms of optimizing security sector
assistance for the challenges ahead. The U.S. government should also
address broader challenges with the way security sector assistance is
prioritized and executed.

Still an Outmoded Instrument

To increase the effectiveness of security sector assistance for
strategic competition, the United States should address deficiencies
related to where and how it uses this assistance. Currently, assistance
is focused on the wrong countries and being used to build the wrong
capabilities. Assistance remains over-directed toward countries in the
Middle East, Africa, and South and Central Asia, rather than to those in
Europe and Southeast Asia where the main competition with Russia and
China occurs. There are several reasons for this disparity.

First, annual commitments to Israel and Egypt --- totaling \$3.3 billion
and \$1.3 billion, respectively --- eat up a large portion of the
Foreign Military Financing budget. The origins of U.S. munificence to
both countries is linked to the "payoff for peace," that is, the U.S.
commitment to Israel and Egypt after they signed the 1979 Camp David
Accords. Distinct from the Foreign Military Sales program, through which
the State Department brokers purchases of U.S.-made defense articles and
defense services by foreign partners, the Foreign Military Financing
program provides grants and loans to help partners, generally
lower-income countries, purchase those articles and services. It is
intended to be the premier program for building the capabilities of
frontline allies and partners. Given its purpose, one would think that
the United States would be steering more Foreign Military Financing
toward Europe and Asia.

Second, the 9/11 attacks brought new requirements: promoting
counter-terrorism cooperation and rapidly building the capacity of local
part­ner forces, especially the creation or enhancement of tactical
units, to address "urgent and emergent threats." This naturally led to a
focus on countries where terrorists operated or might take root, which
reinforced the geographic focus on the Middle East, and expanded it to
include countries in Central and South Asia. This focus was especially
marked at the Defense Department. The amount of assistance it
administers climbed significantly since 9/11, and totaled just over
\$7.5 billion in the FY2021 budget request. Approximately \$6.5 billion
comes from contingency funds for capacity building in Afghanistan, Iraq,
and other conflict zones. Supporting these conflicts created additional
security assistance cost centers among partners that played critical
roles supporting counter-terrorism operations and U.S. logistics
footprints. For example, Pakistan received over \$23 billion in security
assistance and military reimbursements as a result of its importance to
the United States as a counter-terrorism partner after 9/11. Jordan has
also experienced a marked increase in assistance over the same period,
receiving close to \$10 billion.

Overall, the United States spends about \$20 billion annually on
security sector assistance, of which only approximately 8 percent is
allotted to Europe, East Asia, and the Pacific, according to Security
Assistance Monitor. Addressing this imbalance will require the
departments of State and Defense to reprioritize their budget requests,
and Congress to cease earmarking security sector assistance dollars
based on outmoded objectives.

The overriding focus on counter-terrorism in U.S. security sector
assistance programs and national security strategy more broadly over the
past two decades has not only contributed to its orientation toward the
Middle East, Africa, and South and Central Asia. It also compounded
challenges related to how the United States uses assistance,
specifically America's emphasis on countering urgent threats and on
capacity building for counter-terrorism or special operations units.
Where the State Department provides assistance to civilian security
sector forces and institutions in other countries, it overemphasizes
building tactical capabilities for law enforcement (that is, training
small operational units on narrow capabilities like interdicting
narcotraffickers or conducting counterterrorism raids) at the expense of
the administrative capacity and professionalism of these forces and
institutions. Defense Department assistance has similarly focused on
building the tactical capabilities of partner militaries. Such tactical
assistance --- which often includes status-signaling weapons systems and
resources to supplement partner personnel training budgets --- is often
prioritized by partners as well, particularly in the absence of
effective U.S. messaging on the importance of broader reforms.

The U.S. emphasis on counter-terrorism led to a buildup of Special
Operations Command and the services' special operations forces
components as well, and a commensurate focus on building the capacity of
their special operations counterparts in other countries. Although the
services dispense assistance, they don't invest much in terms of the
planning necessary to tie the execution of this assistance to either
specific objectives or longer-term engagements. Other than the Army's
Security Force Assistance Brigades, the services don't organize for the
security sector assistance mission. Even in the Asia-Pacific, the main
focus of assistance prior to the Maritime Security Initiative was the
special operations forces capacity-building mission in the Philippines.
This focus on special operations force has left the services, and U.S.
partners' conventional forces, out of the equation in many places. Iraq
and Afghanistan are a notable exception, but even in these countries the
United States has focused on building specific types of military units
with a heavy emphasis on partner special operations capacity.

While the United States has directed security sector assistance toward
the Middle East and South and Central Asia, and focused more on building
partners' tactical capacity for counter-terrorism, Russia and China are
using aggressive military pressure to coerce neighbors and compete in
new domains, such as cyber and space. They are also using instruments of
statecraft outside the traditional security arena, such as economic
pressure, lawfare, and even technical standards-setting. For example,
China has used commercially flagged fishing vessels to perform
militia-like functions in support of its activities around South China
Sea features. Russia has used its cyber capabilities to disrupt critical
infrastructure, interfere in elections, undermine political leaders, and
spread disinformation throughout NATO-aligned Eastern Europe. The United
States has failed to keep pace --- either on its own in terms of its use
of all instruments of national power, or in terms of the security
assistance it provides partners to enhance their capabilities to mount
effective responses and build resilience.

Optimizing Security Sector Assistance

If security assistance is to be an effective tool in strategic
competition, then the U.S. government needs to step up its game.
Washington should develop a sophisticated, integrated planning process
at the State Department and Department of Defense for security
assistance; significantly increase the Foreign Military Financing
budget, or redirect spending from the Middle East and North Africa to
Asia and Eastern Europe; use security assistance to convey strategic
messages to both rivals and partners; and feature human rights
considerations more prominently when engaging in arms sales. This would
require the United States to address underlying deficiencies in
planning, prioritization, and execution in ways that account for the
unique challenges that Russian and Chinese approaches to competition
bring: the use of disinformation, private security contractors, cyber
tools, and civilian and commercial actors such as commercial fishing
fleets. This is not to suggest that Washington should look to security
sector assistance as the solution to all of its national security
challenges --- far from it. Rather, assistance should be better
integrated with other instruments of national power. The following
recommendations are intended to close the gap between where the United
States currently is regarding its use of security sector assistance and
where it needs to be to compete effectively. Some of these
recommendations are focused more squarely on China and Russia, whereas
others relate to broader reforms to the security sector assistance
enterprise.

First, it is essential to create coordinated, department-wide planning
processes at the departments of State and Defense. The U.S. government
is hamstrung by inefficient and incoherent planning and coordination
processes that do not allocate assistance based on U.S. foreign policy
priorities, country prioritization, availability of resources, and
regional and country-specific assumptions. Congressional earmarks make
prioritization more difficult, but getting rid of them won't solve the
problem. Policymakers should recognize the fundamentally
interdisciplinary nature of many aspects of strategic competition and
begin to break down stovepipes both within and between key agencies
involved in the planning and execution of security assistance.
Interagency coordination should move beyond mere deconfliction and
concurrence toward a truly collaborative real-time planning and
response. Lack of coordination also exists within departments, which
should reform their assistance planning processes. Of equal importance,
security sector assistance planning and prioritization should account
for the fact that China and Russia are mounting sustained challenges to
governance and rule of law at the regional, national, and multinational
levels. Advancing governance and rule of law therefore should be a key
aim of assistance.

**[The [State]{.mark} Department [has a wider mandate for security
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [encompassing both military aid and
assistance for civilians. It is also supposed to use security assistance
[to advance broader,]{.mark} more long-term [objectives like trade and
investment]{.mark}, efforts to help allies and partners develop an
[innovation]{.mark} base, [and]{.mark} major [diplomatic
initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. To fulfill this mission, the State
Department should develop a planning process that elevates common
interagency objectives for assistance, deconflicts competing objectives
where necessary, identifies security assistance resources projected to
be available for the period of time necessary to achieve such
objectives, and recommends the allocation of assistance based on U.S.
foreign policy priorities. Those priorities should be derived from the
next administration's national security strategy and informed by the
availability of resources, and regional and country-specific
assumptions. State also needs to create a framework to guide the use of
assistance as dictated by the above planning process in alignment with
other instruments of national power, and a framework for factoring in
how arms sales --- both Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial
Sales --- might affect U.S. security assistance planning and broader
U.S. foreign policy objectives. Last year, the House of Representatives
passed a State Authorization Act that required these and other reforms,
but it has languished in the Senate since then.

Defense Department assistance should focus narrowly on four inherently
military objectives: supporting State Department-coordinated efforts to
build long-term capacity so that an ally or partner can manage its own
security challenges; achieving a fundamental improvement in U.S. posture
to prevail (including via coalitions) in a potential contingency, for
example by assisting a partner to build a deep-water port or develop the
capability to contribute in a specific role to potential coalition
operations; generating short-term capacity when deemed necessary to
achieve strategic objectives or improving interoperability for a
specific goal; and responding to real-time developments, such as
deterrent signaling, personnel recovery, or humanitarian response.
Defense Department planners should be required to identify the
objective(s) they're serving and justify their plans on that basis. They
also should be conducting a rigorous analysis to identify gaps in
Pentagon plans for contingency scenarios involving near-peer competitors
or other real-time developments that could impact U.S. interests, and
basing priorities for security assistance on those gaps. Stronger links
between contingency planning and security cooperation will help focus
Defense Department security assistance and advance strategic
competition.

Second, a more sophisticated and coordinated planning process should
lead the United States to redirect security assistance to U.S. allies
and partners in Asia and Eastern Europe, and expand the nature of
assistance provided. The U.S. government has begun shifting some
assistance, such as Section 333 capacity building administered by the
Pentagon, away from U.S. Central Command countries to countries in the
U.S. European Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command regions. The State
and Defense departments need to accelerate this shift to compete more
effectively with Russia and China. The United States should be using
Foreign Military Financing, as well as Maritime Security Initiative
funding and other programs, to help regional states in Asia develop
anti-access/area denial systems to challenge Chinese power-projection
operations. The departments of State, Defense, and Homeland Security
should also be coordinating to increase support for U.S. Coast Guard
cooperation with allies and partners to challenge China's white hull
strategy.

Realizing a significant reallocation of security assistance in support
of strategic competition will require increasing the overall budget for
Foreign Military Financing. These budgets have declined from a peak of
\$9.4 billion in FY2015 to the current year's \$7.5 billion, while the
importance placed on security cooperation with allies and partners and
the variety of threats they face have increased. The amount of such an
increase will depend on the needs of key allies and partners, and
whether Congress is willing to reduce Foreign Military Financing to
Israel and Egypt, which in some years accounts for nearly two-thirds of
the program's budget. Unquestionably, the State Department can improve
its prioritization of the remaining amount, which is spread across more
than 100 partners globally, but those limited resources go only so far.

In our experience, selling Congress on an injection of resources or on
reductions to Israel and Egypt will require considerable effort. The
State Department would need not only to provide a compelling strategy
for how resources that can be freed up by reducing commitments to Israel
and Egypt will be used to improve America's national security posture.
It also will need to provide a convincing assessment that such
reductions will not infringe on Israel's qualitative military edge in
the region or lead to a breakdown in the peace treaties between Israel
and Egypt. We believe these crucial U.S. interests --- Israel's security
and regional stability --- can be maintained at lower aid levels.
However, we are also realistic about the political challenges that make
such a shift so difficult regardless of what any policy analysis
suggests. For this reason, although we typically would recommend
starting with a reallocation of existing resources before increasing the
overall budget, in this instance we recognize that directing more money
to the problem might be the least-worst option. A compelling case can be
made for new resources and authorities to expand the types of aid
provided under Foreign Military Financing --- including to address the
gaps identified above, **[[such as cyber security and law
enforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The argument will be strongest if it
is articulated within broader strategies for competing with China and
Russia.

[[In addition to Foreign Military Financing]{.underline}]{.mark}, there
are a mix of [[other programs]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States
could use [[to increase the capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} and
capabilities [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} key Eastern European [[NATO
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Max Bergmann observed on these pages a
few years ago, Congress is likely to be unwilling to provide much
assistance funding through traditional grant methods, especially as
Eastern European countries are wealthier than typical grant assistance
recipients. This approach is deeply flawed: Many of Eastern Europe's
governments lack the economic wherewithal to engage in the types of
military development necessary to compete with Russia. Moreover, the
United States has clear and urgent goals in the region that should not
be left dependent on the vicissitudes of partners' budget politics. At
the same time, we agree with Bergmann that the United States cannot and
should not shoulder too much of the responsibility for these countries,
which should demonstrate a commitment to acquisitions. One of the
problems with Foreign Military Sales, though, is that U.S. weapons
systems that Eastern European militaries would need to compete with
Russia are top-of-the-line and likely unaffordable for midtier
countries. Providing excess defense articles is one workaround, but this
puts recipients at the mercy of what is available. Bergmann's
recommendation that the United States provide a mix of [[grants and
loans to help NATO countries make acquisitions]{.underline}]{.mark}
themselves is a fine one, and we would offer complementary or
alternative approaches as well. The U.S. government could consider [[a
lend-lease program]{.underline}]{.mark} in which equipment itself is
provided via a loan or low-cost lease for a period of time to be used in
an agreed-upon manner, after which the recipient could purchase the
equipment at a reduced cost. [[Pooled sales and multilateral cooperative
platforms]{.underline}]{.mark} modeled on the Movement Coordination
Center Europe are other promising solutions. Any one of these models
would be an improvement on the current approach.

As China, Russia, and others compete across a range of [[domains
stretching beyond traditional military strength]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[cyber security, law enforcement, and
disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the U.S. government should
enhance its ability to provide timely, relevant assistance in these
areas. In our experience in government, American allies and partners
routinely ask for this assistance. Yet, U.S. capacity building in each
of these areas is immature. [[Cyber security assistance]{.mark} is
meagerly resourced and often]{.underline} ad hoc, with limited
assistance programs spread incoherently across government agencies.
Likewise, [[intelligence and law enforcement capacity **building are
limited**]{.underline}]{.mark} and often plagued by turf battles.
Enabling allies and partners to counter disinformation represents an
emerging area of focus, and Washington should rise to the occasion. In
many of these areas, effective governance is often one of the most
crucial gaps America's allies and partners confront. To meet these
challenges, the United States should reimagine security sector
assistance, factor in its impact on governance and rule of law, and
increase the involvement of the departments of Homeland Security,
Justice, and Treasury.

#### To "increase" means expanding [already-existing cooperation]{.underline}.

**Buckley '6** \[Jeremiah S, Joseph M. Kolar; November 13; partners at
Buckley Kolar LLP; Westlaw, Brief of Amici Curiae for "Mortgage
Insurance Companies of America and Consumer Mortgage Coalition," WL
3309503\]

First, [t]{.underline}he court said that the ordinary meaning of the
word "increase" is "to make something greater," which it believed should
not "be limited to cases in which a company raises the rate that an
individual has previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet [**the
definition** offered by the Ninth Circuit compels **the opposite
conclusion**. Because "increase" means "to make **something greater**,"
there must necessarily have been **an existing**]{.underline} premium,
[to]{.underline} which Edo\'s actual premium may [**be compared**, to
determine whether an]{.underline} \*26 ["increase" **occurred**.
Congress]{.underline} could have provided that "adverse action" in the
insurance context means charging an amount greater than the optimal
premium, but instead **[chose]{.underline}** to define adverse action in
terms of an ["increase." That definitional choice must be **respected,
not ignored**]{.underline}. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379,
392-93 n.10 (1979) ("\[a\] definition which declares what a term
'means\' ... excludes any meaning that is not stated").

Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that because the Insurance Prong
includes the words "existing or applied for," Congress intended that an
"increase in any charge" for insurance must "apply to all insurance
transactions - from an initial policy of insurance to a renewal of a
long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This interpretation reads the words
"existing or applied for" in isolation. Other types of adverse action
described in the Insurance Prong apply only to situations where a
consumer had an existing policy of insurance, such as a "cancellation,"
"reduction," or "change" in insurance. [Each]{.underline} of these forms
of adverse action [**presupposes an already-existing policy**, and under
**usual canons of statutory construction** the term "increase" also
should be **construed** to apply to **increases** of **an
already-existing policy**]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88,
101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it")

studies highlighted and synthesized here were sponsored by the U.S.

<https://www.rand.org/ard/topics/security-cooperation.html>\]

The term **[[security coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [[refers to the
broad category of activities undertaken by the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Department of Defense (**[[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) \"[to [develop
partnerships that encourage and enable partner nations
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[act in support of US strategic
objectives\"]{.mark} A variety of other programs and
activities]{.underline} (and associated terms) [spanning the strategic,
operational, and tactical levels fall under the umbrella of security
cooperation]{.underline}. [[These include efforts to build partner
capacity]{.mark}, [security force assistance, and defense institution
building.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Security cooperation activities range
from]{.mark} the expensive and visible---[training]{.mark}, [equipping,
and exercising together---to]{.mark} low-key but valuable [bilateral
talks, workshops, personnel exchanges, professional military education,
and efforts to achieve interoperability]{.mark} with partners in terms
of processes and equipment]{.underline}.

[**Security coop**eration is an **important** and **expanding**
instrument of U.S. foreign policy that is **employed widely to
accomplish a diverse set of objectives**]{.underline}. Security
cooperation goals vary depending on current U.S. strategic and
operational objectives and the partner nation that is being engaged.
Goals can include building the capacity of partner security forces to
improve the security environment, strengthening relationships with
foreign militaries and governments, and securing access for U.S.
military forces so they can more effectively operate abroad.

[The type of security cooperation that DoD deploys depends on the
objective at hand and capabilities of the partner nation]{.underline}.
DoD tends to deploy building partner capacity programs and security
force assistance to less developed partner nations in an effort to
improve their tactical and operational capabilities, while defense
institution building initiatives are used in similar contexts to
strengthen ministries of defense at the strategic level. On the other
hand, programs aimed at interoperability tend to be targeted at
more-developed allies. DoD conducts about 3,000 to 4,000 security
cooperation events each year in more than 130 countries, while total
U.S. assistance to foreign militaries and police forces runs from \$15
billion to \$20 billion per year. Security cooperation activities touch
tens of thousands of foreign security forces around the world every
year. What do we know about security cooperation? Are the strategic and
operational goals of the enterprise being met? Does security cooperation
\"work\"? If so, under what conditions?

The **[[RAND]{.underline}]{.mark}** Corporation [[has
studied]{.underline}]{.mark} the field of [**[security
cooperation]{.underline}** **[extensively]{.underline}**]{.mark} [over
the past two decades.]{.underline} By pulling together RAND\'s security
cooperation research in one collection and highlighting what we have
learned about the enterprise in this document, we seek to help answer
these questions. The bulk of the works in this summary focus on DoD
security cooperation, although a few studies also look at the security
sector assistance activities of other agencies and departments,
including the U.S. Department of State. Notably, in recent years,
resources and authorities for security cooperation have shifted toward
DoD and away from other agencies. The large number of security
cooperation actors, programs, and activities across departments and
agencies presents a number of challenges, particularly in measuring the
effects of a specific program that is part of a broader U.S. engagement
strategy.

This brief introduction discusses the main findings from RAND research
in the main areas of security cooperation. The first section addresses
the \< href=\"#authorities-and-planning\"\>literature on security
cooperation authorities and planning. The second section focuses on
security cooperation activities aimed at building partner capacity,
security force assistance, and defense institution building, while the
third distills the findings from research on security cooperation
activities aimed at enhancing interoperability. The fourth section
discusses RAND work on the relatively new area of assessing, monitoring,
and evaluating security cooperation activities. In conclusion, the final
section highlights lessons learned and best practices in security
cooperation.

Security Cooperation Authorities and Planning

One thread of RAND research has focused on how to improve security
cooperation authorities, prioritization, and planning. Although
sometimes overlooked, the issue of authorities is essential to the
execution of security cooperation activities and one that continues to
create challenges. There are a large set of potentially overlapping
authorities that security cooperation planners need to navigate.

[[A 2016 study]{.underline}]{.mark} entitled From Patchwork to
Framework: A Review of Title 10 Authorities for Security Cooperation
[[analyzed legislative authorities for security cooperation and found
160 total authorities, 123 of which are under Title
10]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The report identified [106 \"**core**\"
**statutes**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that **[directly authorize
activities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and 17 supporting ones that
legislate the transfer of funds or mandate reports to
Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Dozens of interviews and focus group
sessions revealed frustration and confusion about perceived gaps,
overlaps, and ambiguities surrounding these authorities, **a need for
greater flexibility in addressing multifaceted or emerging
threats**]{.underline}, and a desire to improve on this patchwork that
has developed over many years.

[The study created a framework to organize authorities]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} several [categories]{.underline}: authorities
[focused on particular activities]{.underline} (e.g., exercises),
particular [missions]{.underline} (e.g., counterterrorism),
[and]{.underline} particular [partners]{.underline} (e.g., Pakistan).
The study also identified opportunities for consolidating and revising
existing authorities, starting by reducing the 106 core authorities to
91. Although the U.S. government has made recent progress in clarifying
and reducing security cooperation authorities, [much still needs to be
done to better integrate Title 10 and Title 22 authorities, assess the
effect of appropriations on security cooperation, and align notification
and reporting requirements.]{.underline}

#### Security cooperation excludes security assistance programs

The What, Why, and How of Security Assistance

"[[**Security assistance**" refers to a specific set of programs
authorized by the **F**]{.mark}oreign **[A]{.mark}**ssistance
**[A]{.mark}**ct [and Arms Export Control Act. These]{.mark} programs
[are overseen by]{.mark} the [State]{.mark} Department in cooperation
with the Department of Defense]{.underline}. "[**[Security
cooperation]{.underline}**" [describes]{.underline} **[separately
authorized Defense]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**Department**-[led
activities such as "**global train and equip**"
programs]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative, which has provided military aid to that country since 2016,
is one such example of these programs run by the Pentagon. I will use
the more common term here, security assistance, in reference to either
type. When security assistance works well, it gives partner nations the
tools to address internal instability and deter and defend against
external adversaries, reducing the likelihood that direct U.S.
intervention will be called for in the future. It also helps to ensure
that the United States maintains access, basing, and overflight
privileges, strengthens interoperability, and accrues the less tangible
benefit of military-to-military personal relationships.

#### The DOD defines security coop as the authorities governed by Title 10 of US Code

https://www.csis.org/analysis/shifting-burden-responsibly-oversight-and-accountability-us-security-sector-assistance-0\]

JAMES ANDERSON: Good afternoon. I want to start by thanking Melissa
Dalton for the invitation to speak here today. I have had the pleasure
of working with Melissa and am very appreciative of her research efforts
and her team regarding security cooperation. It is an honor to speak
here at CSIS where many of my current and former colleagues have come
from.

This report could not be more timely. I have been briefed on the
report's main findings, and I appreciate the thorough CSIS review of
oversight and accountability in the U.S. security sector assistance.
This report reminds me of the important role that our friends in the
think tank community play, especially when the department is embracing a
new approach to the topic.

I've had the pleasure to serve in my current capacity as assistant
secretary of defense for strategy, plans and capabilities since last
fall. Our SPC office casts a wide net to include policy oversight of
security cooperation, our National Defense Strategy, the plans necessary
to implement the strategy, as well as nuclear deterrence and missile
defense.

[Security sector assistance is a **vast enterprise**]{.underline}, and
it one of the U.S. governments most effective tools in shaping U.S.
foreign policy outcomes. [[At DOD we]{.mark} represent a key component
of that effort that we [call **security cooperation**: the authorities
governed by Title 10]{.mark} of the U.S. Code, [which relate to
**engaging with allied and partner militaries** to **affect
outcomes**]{.mark} **[related to our mutual
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

I want to focus my remarks here today on how we are reforming security
cooperation within the department and creating a more holistic,
strategic security -- (audio break) -- major lines of efforts for DOD as
we implement our National Defense Strategy. The security interests of
the United States and allies are best addressed together cooperatively.
The United States has a critical leadership role in encouraging allies
to be more militarily capable, interoperable, and lethal.

With these principles in mind, I'd like to proceed along the following
path. I'd like to talk about where we are coming from and how **[the FY
'17 reforms]{.underline}**, the security cooperation, and the National
Defense Strategy are changing the way we are doing business. I would
also like to talk about some of the gaps in our execution and highlight
with some examples some places where we are successfully executing our
mission and creating security through cooperation.

The United States has realized that the primary security challenge of
our generation -- great power competition -- requires a strong network
of allies and partners. At the same time, this administration feels
strongly that allies and partners need to contribute their fair share
towards common security interests.

Security cooperation is one of the best tools for our growing ally and
partner capacity to contribute more militarily. With smart, limited
investments in our partners, we can amplify military effects to deter
aggression.

Today the United States is an exporter of security cooperation. However,
as a young republic -- or even before we became a republic, we were the
recipient of security cooperation. For all the noble ideas the United
States was founded upon, ideas cannot hope to make up for a shortage of
gunpowder. The first thing that might be considered a foreign military
sale the United States conducted was an important purchase: gunpowder
covertly supplied by our friends, the French. And that arms transfer
made a difference. Our first act of foreign military sale helped to win
-- helped us to win at Saratoga and turn the tide of the Revolutionary
War.

Clearly things have changed greatly in the post-Cold-War environment.
The reality is today that we are confronted by an array of emerging
requirements and ever-present risks. Because of this, operating by,
with, and through allies is not simply a goal; it is a necessity. It is
the only path to sustainable progress in combating terrorism or
countering any other international security threat including the
reemergence of great power competition.

The release of the National Defense Strategy in 2018 marked a turning
point for the whole of DOD. We live in an increasingly complex global
security environment and, after many years without an update to our
fundamental strategic guidance, the time had come to acknowledge changes
in the international security environment and the priorities for the
Department of Defense. The NDS emphasizes the need to shift the weight
of our security cooperation resources from countering terrorism, which
has of course been the primary focus of the department's efforts over
the past -- nearly the past two decades to a renewed focus on deterring
and potentially responding to threats from near-peer competitors.

[Security cooperation relates to all three lines of effort in the
National Defense Strategy]{.underline}. One, building lethality[.
Security cooperation allows us to **improve our effectiveness in
coalition efforts**]{.underline}, **[to cover down on gaps in our
posture]{.underline}**, and to ensure that our partners pack a punch in
the first few hours of conflict, or days of conflict, if it comes to
that.

Two, **[strengthening U.S. alliances and partnerships]{.underline}**.
[Security cooperation is the primary tool for ensuring our alliances and
partnerships are **fruitful**]{.underline},
**[meaningful]{.underline}**, [and that our **relationships are a net
security contributor**]{.underline}, not a detractor.

Three, [reforming how the department does business]{.underline}.
[Security cooperation is evolving with the department to become more
strategic, more efficient, and more effective]{.underline}. In FY '19,
we dedicated the greatest amount of funding -- nearly 25 percent of the
total funding in the security cooperation account -- to challenges in
the Indo-Pacific area of responsibility -- nearly \$260 million. This is
an increase of nearly 75 percent over what we notified in the year
prior, and this does not include regional initiatives such as the
Maritime Security Initiative, which I will say more about in a few
minutes. Consistent with the NDS, we also increased EUCOM's allocation
by nearly 25 percent from FY '18 to approximately 250 million (dollars).

While CENTCOM continues to rely on separate authorities, in particular
the Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund and the Afghan Security Forces
Fund, we reduced its FY '19 Section 333 allocation by 30 percent from
the FY '18 Level. AFRICOM, NORTHCOM, and SOUTHCOM, for their part,
combined received about 30 percent of the total funding.

The NDS specifies clear priorities, and our security cooperation
resource allocations reflect and will continue to reflect those
priorities. All that said, I'd like to note at this point that Title 2
funding is still providing robust tools for engagement and financing of
our partner militaries, even in those regions that are not prioritized
in the NDS.

With all the changes in the last few years, the question arises, [how do
we explain **[security cooperation? How do we define
it]{.mark}**?]{.underline} I think [a good way to look at security
cooperation in terms of where we are going is to **[consider all
activities conducted by the Department of]{.mark} [Defense aimed at
enhancing the capability and willingness of U.S. partners and allies to
operate in coalition with]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- or in lieu of [--
**[U.S. forces]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**in response to shared security
challenges**. [This]{.mark} formulation [is]{.mark} largely [consistent
with how we think Congress]{.mark} [envisions our future role in
security sector assistance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

DOD has always had a robust role in security sector assistance
enterprise, but until FY '17 reforms, it was spread across the
department. There were many purse holders, many different executors, and
dozens of legal authorities scattered in a patchwork-like fashion across
the U.S. Code that overlapped, sometimes acted independently, and
weren't looked at holistically.

Sometime security cooperation doesn't get a lot of attention. Luckily,
CSIS has some of the finest minds in the security cooperation business
at work here, and I'm most grateful for the work of Melissa, Kath,
Tommy, and others for their efforts on this topic.

Security cooperation is often behind the news we read at night but
rarely the frontline story. Luckily we're also blessed with another
influential group that cares deeply about security cooperation -- the
Congress. In FY '17 Congress undertook the largest, most sweeping, and
most substantial reforms to security cooperation in our nation's
history. The FY '17 NDAA consolidated dozens of authorities into a
narrow band of activities in Chapter 16. It set up requirements for
human rights vetting, institutional capacity building, and assessment
monitoring and evaluation.

With lots of work in the trenches by both DOD and Congress, this all hit
at once, and it was welcome. Implementing an ambitious vision remains a
challenge, particularly for those activities that were funded out of
service accounts or regional initiatives. Many security cooperation
activities were not being looked at holistically across the spectrum.
Programs were siloed and oversight sometimes limited.

Congress believed that the entire system needed oversight from a single
executor with visibility across all the authorities and all the
different pots of money. [This is how we got the Title 10, Chapter 16,
Section 382 in the U.S. Code. The notion that the secretary's designee,
the undersecretary of defense for policy]{.underline} -- my immediate
boss -- [shall have]{.underline}, quote, "[the responsibility for the
oversight of strategic policy guidance and the responsibility of overall
resource allocation for security cooperation programs and activities of
the Department of Defense]{.underline}." End quote.

[This is where we are trying to go with **[security
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}[: [a holistic
**DOD**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[-wide [enterprise]{.mark} with visibility
[across the spectrum]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of security
coop]{.mark}eration activities, administered with policy oversight, and
**[aligned tightly to strategy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[**[How we define security cooperation is changing]{.mark}** as well.
[At one point security cooperation meant -- basically meant train and
equip programs.]{.mark}]{.underline} We're moving away from that.
[[Security cooperation enterprise now encompasses everything from
equipment, to training, to conventional arms sales, to **exercises**
with **both high-end and developing partners**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Meanwhile, **[we are prioritizing interoperability]{.underline}** and
making arms sales quicker and more efficient. In the last 10 years the
department has reduced the average time to process foreign military
sales by 30 percent. And I know our colleagues at DSCA are working hard
to streamline things even more.

We are also trying to move off of year-to-year planning. My office has
been involved in a push over the last two years to align security
cooperation planning with planning, programming, budgeting, and
execution cycle as well as the global force management cycle, planning
two years out from the current fiscal year.

[**Terminology**:]{.underline} Security Assistance and [Security
Cooperation]{.underline}

"Security assistance" and ["security cooperation"]{.underline} are two
terms that [refer to **U.S. activities** to]{.underline} train, equip,
and otherwise [**assist** foreign partners. The term **security
assistance** is a **generic term** used throughout the U.S.
government]{.underline} to describe assistance provided to foreign
military and security forces, [**regardless** of the **agency**
providing that assistance]{.underline}. However, DOD uses the term
security assistance to refer specifically to assistance provided under
Title 22 authority, funded with monies appropriated to the State
Department and managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), an agency under the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Policy.3

[DOD **defines** "security cooperation" as a **broad set of activities**
undertaken by DOD to **encourage and enable** international partners to
work with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to achieve
**strategic objectives**. Included]{.underline} in the definition [are
DOD interactions with]{.underline} both [foreign defense
**and**]{.underline} foreign [nonmilitary]{.underline} security
[establishments. Security cooperation includes **all DOD-administered
security assistance programs** that (1) build]{.underline} defense and
security [relationships that promote **specific U.S. security
interests**, including]{.underline} all [international
arm]{.underline}ament[s cooperation]{.underline} activities and security
assistance activities; [(2) develop allied and friendly military
capabilities]{.underline} for self-defense and multinational operations;
[and (3) provide U.S. forces with]{.underline} peacetime and contingency
[access]{.underline} to host nations.4 According to DOD, [security
assistance is a **subset** of]{.underline} DOD's [security
cooperation]{.underline} portfolio.

[**Authority** for DOD to conduct **security cooperation**]{.underline}
activities [is enacted in]{.underline} two primary places: **[Title
10]{.underline}** (Armed Forces) U.S.C. [and **N**]{.underline}ational
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[A]{.underline}**uthorization

Background and Need for the Study

[The **precise use** of words]{.underline} by Department of Defense
officials [is **critical**]{.underline} to formulating and executing
military strategy.11 When developing a plan of action, **[loosely
defined military terms]{.underline}** can [affect]{.underline} planners'
[abilities to **properly understand** the **actual
capabilities**]{.underline} resident [in a]{.underline} proposed [course
of action]{.underline}.12 [In Afghanistan, the **misapplication** of the
**military term security cooperation**]{.underline} fostered a climate
that [caused]{.underline} the Department of [Defense and State to
**underestimate** the significant role of SC]{.underline} in fostering
the diplomatic relationships that contribute to international peace and
stability.

As a major in the Marine Corps, I planned and participated in a security
cooperation exercise with Estonia. It was important to the United States
European combatant commander and the commanding general Estonian Self
Defense Force that communication with the media specifically addressed
our operation as a security cooperation exercise. Eighteen countries
participated in the exercise, to include the United States and Estonia,
and sixteen other countries that are part of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO). However, this exercise, named BALTIC OPERATIONS,
was not officially a NATO exercise.

[This **distinction** between security cooperation]{.underline} exercise
[**and** NATO exercise may seem like **nothing more than semantics**.
However a **misunderstanding** of the **semantic nuances**
had]{.underline} potential **[negative strategic
consequences]{.underline}**. Estonia shares a border with Russia and
former Soviet military forces occupied Estonia prior to the 1991 Singing
Revolution. Diplomatic tensions between Estonia and Russia remain tense
and Estonia is constantly defending its territorial waters in the Baltic
Sea against Russian naval vessels. During the exercise a Russian frigate
and a Russian submarine attempted to violate Estonia's territorial
water. In response, Estonia deployed a small portion of its Navy to
block the Russian vessels and force a return to internationally
recognized neutral waters shared by countries bordering the Baltic Sea.
This level of international tension between Estonia and Russia is
constant. [If]{.underline} the [participants of a **security cooperation
exercise** were to describe the event as a NATO exercise, it would be
interpreted by Russia as a **signal**]{.underline} that [NATO
forces]{.underline}, led by the United States, [were
rehearsing]{.underline} air, land, and sea [strategies]{.underline} in
the Baltic Sea [that would]{.underline} support an amphibious
**[assault]{.underline}** against the Russian city of [St.
Petersburg]{.underline}. This instance and many others like it
demonstrate that the [**improper use of military terminology** can have
**unintended negative consequences**]{.underline}.

According to the authors of a paper written for USAID, the
reconstruction strategy in Afghanistan, is often mislabeled as security
cooperation, and designed to support the withdraw of United States
military forces from Afghanistan.13 This example demonstrates the
tendency to confuse Afghan reconstruction with SC. [SC is a
**prehostilities strategy** to **effectively and peacefully resolve**
emerging problems **prior** to the eruption of violence and the need to
commit U.S. forces to a contingency operation]{.underline}.14 [This is
**contrasted** with reconstruction, a term that describes **aid**
provided during and after military conflict]{.underline}. This contrast
highlights the need to protect the integrity of the SC and the
importance of identifying operations where SC is confused. Indeed one of
the basic assumptions under which I will proceed with this thesis is
that SC, properly defined, occupies a critical role in the overall
strategy to prevent the United States from entering into armed conflict
rather than a strategy employed after hostilities have commenced.

**[Military doctrine]{.underline}**, national strategy, [and
**specialized dictionaries**]{.underline} for military professionals and
government policy makers, [present a **precise definition**
of]{.underline} and specific criteria for the strategic application of
[security cooperation]{.underline}.15 [Yet]{.underline} a review of case
studies by organizations like the United States Agency for International
Development and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs that focus on Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Afghanistan,
demonstrates that [the **current application** of security cooperation
is **inconsistent** with its **doctrinal definition**]{.underline}.16
Moreover, my professional military experience with the doctrinal
application of security cooperation and Provincial Reconstruction Teams
provides a first hand account that reinforces the observation that
doctrinal definition and contemporary practical application of Security
cooperation are inconsistent.

IV\. Current U.S. Contributions to NATO

Despite bipartisan criticism of the perceived lack of funding from other
NATO members, the United States still recognizes that its leadership in
the Alliance is vital to its own national security. 78 There are clear
benefits to combined defense in terms of national security, foreign
relations, and the economy, 79 placing U.S. funding of NATO at the
intersection of foreign and domestic policy. While the President has
constitutional authority in defense, as the Commander-in-Chief, and to
enter into agreements with foreign states, 80 Congress can affect both
defense and foreign affairs through its power of the purse. 81
Accordingly, this section analyzes the reflection of U.S. foreign and
defense policies through Congressional authorizations and appropriations
that affect the implementation of Operation Atlantic Resolve\'s lines of
operation, particularly in increasing interoperability and improving the
defense capacity of the Baltic States. 82

A. Congress\'s Role in Funding NATO Operations

[Congress\'s power to authorize expenditures through legislation is
instrumental]{.underline} in national security and foreign relations, as
it determines the amount and purpose for which expenditures are
authorized. 83 Because military activities and foreign assistance
require expenditures of funds, the United States cannot implement its
strategic goals in Eastern Europe without fiscal authority. 84 [The
constitutionally provided power of the purse therefore places Congress
as the **cornerstone** of the United States\' participation in NATO
operations. While U.S. funding for deterring Russian aggression is
complex and lacks clarity, sources of funding generally fall within
three categories: service component funds, the European
Reassurance/Deterrence Initiative, and **security
cooperation**]{.underline}.

B. Building Better Allies through Funding Resources

1\. Service Operations & Maintenance Funds

As the Unified Combatant Command with an area of responsibility covering
Europe and Russia[, EUCOM is tasked with managing theater requirements,
to include supporting NATO operations and meeting U.S. national security
objectives]{.underline}. 85 [While EUCOM has authority over the conduct
of operations within this region]{.underline}, it is the military
services that receive [direct funding from Congress through]{.underline}
Operations and Maintenance (**[O&M]{.underline}**)
**[funds]{.underline}**. 86 Like all Unified Combatant Commands during
the budget planning phase, [EUCOM is limited to providing inputs to
influence the armed services]{.underline}, and sets priorities for
funding, but Congress may appropriate different amounts and purposes
than requested by the combatant commander. 87

To the extent an expense is necessary, fits within EUCOM\'s mission, and
funds are authorized and appropriated, O&M funds are available for the
expenditure, 88 unless the expense is covered by a more specific
appropriation. 89 Another caveat is that the expenditure of funds must
be for the primary benefit of the United States. 90 [These two
limitations to the use of service O&M funds obfuscate the analysis of
how to fund operations in support of the NATO mission
properly]{.underline}. First, it is unclear which agency\'s funds can be
used. Under the Foreign Assistance Act, the Department of State (DoS) is
the agency responsible for coordinating all foreign development
activities. 91 An exception to the Foreign Assistance Act is when
[Congress specifically authorizes the Department of Defense]{.underline}
(**[DoD]{.underline}**) [to obligate defense funding for
the]{.underline} [benefit of a foreign state, military or population, or
if the funding is for \"little t\" training]{.underline}. 92 [Because
\"**little t\" training**]{.underline}, [which **protects**]{.underline}
[U.S. forces by promoting safety, **familiarization**, and
**interoperability with foreign forces**]{.underline}, **[does not
constitute security cooperation]{.underline}**, [such activities are
funded by O&M.]{.underline} However, a second issue arises because [most
efforts to build NATO ally and partner capacity]{.underline} likely
[will exceed the]{.underline} [parameters of \"**little t**\"
**training** and will fall under the umbrella of foreign
assistance.]{.underline} Accordingly, funding for such security
cooperation programs will come from more specific appropriations, as
described below.

Defined,"

Purpose of the Study

[Words have **meaning**]{.underline} and [the **unique
ideas**]{.underline} that are [transmitted through the use of **military
vocabulary** demand]{.underline} that the author and [the orator
**communicate** with **specificity and clarity**. In the case of
security cooperation]{.underline}, my [research indicates]{.underline}
that [military professionals, government officials, **and** academics
appear]{.underline} to be equally [**guilty** of failing to **limit**
their use of the term to its **correct context**]{.underline}. Most
egregiously, the term is being improperly used as an important element
that describes the United States exit strategy from Afghanistan.21 An
example of the recent comments made by the Secretary of State as she
described the current state of affairs in Washington, D.C. and
Afghanistan, that the State Department convened an interagency team,
including DOD, USAID, and the NSC and held discussions that resulted in
an agreement that included strong commitments on economic/social
development, democratic institution-building, human rights,
anticorruption, and other important long-term reforms. Mrs. Secretary
follows up on this statement by saying; "Ambassador Crocker and General
Allen are still working through some of the security cooperation issues
with President Karzai".22 To place these comments into context, the
Honorable Mrs. Clinton was incorrectly describing the peace process in
Afghanistan and the withdraw of U.S. forces as security cooperation.

[**Doctrinally**, **security cooperation** is **unrelated** to a
**military withdraw** from a country]{.underline} at the conclusion of
armed conflict.23 I was caught by surprise; therefore, to discover that
despite the efforts of the Department of Defense to accurately
articulate its professional lexicon via a dictionary of military terms
and doctrine, basic concepts and their associated framework of action
were being misused. 24 Initially I thought that I was encountering
isolated instances of misuse, but further [reading led me to
believe]{.underline} that the [**misapplication** of this particular
term was **wide spread**]{.underline}.25

### SC\-\--9 Budget Categories\-\--1NC

#### "Security cooperation" [currently]{.underline} only fits into 9 categories.

**Defense '21** \[Office of the Secretary of Defense; May 2021; "Fiscal
Year (FY) 2022 President's Budget: Justification for Security
Cooperation Program and Activity Funding,"
https://open.defense.gov/Portals/23/Documents/Security_Cooperation/Budget_Justification_FY2022.pdf\]

Title 10, Chapter 16, Section 301 of [the U.S. code **defines** security
cooperation as "**any program**, **activity**]{.underline} (including an
exercise), [or **interaction** of the Department of Defense with the
**security establishment** of a **foreign country**]{.underline} to
achieve a purpose as follows:

[• To build]{.underline} and develop [allied and friendly]{.underline}
security [capabilities]{.underline} for self-defense and multinational
operations

[• To provide]{.underline} the armed [forces with access to
the]{.underline} foreign [country]{.underline} during peacetime or a
contingency operation.

[• To build relationships that promote **specific** U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [security interests]{.underline}.

The Department has made significant reforms to align strategic guidance
with resource allocation; establish an assessment, monitoring, and
evaluation (AM&E) program; and create a comprehensive, common picture of
the Department's budget for security cooperation activities as well as
related programs that engage foreign partners. This budget display is
representative of the Department's progress to date in achieving
security cooperation reform and realizing congressional intent in Title
10, Chapter 16 security cooperation.

Section 381(a) of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires a consolidated budget of
security cooperation programs and activities be included annually along
with the President's Budget request to Congress. The consolidated budget
display is intended to enhance planning and oversight of security
cooperation programs and related activities across the DoD. This fourth
annual budget display demonstrates how DoD plans, programs, and budgets
for programs and activities to align with the Department's strategic
objectives.

This budget display includes the \$6.5 billion requested by the
Department for FY 2022 to conduct security cooperation programs and
activities. It focuses primarily on the funding requested for programs
and activities that will be executed under the authorities in Chapter 16
of Title 10, U.S. Code. It also includes funding requests for
non-Chapter 16 programs and activities that include some elements or
activities that are consistent with the security cooperation definition,
including the Coalition Support Funds, the DoD Cooperative Threat
Reduction (CTR) Program, Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI),
Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF), and the CounterIslamic State of
Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund (CTEF). This display excludes
classified programs, such as programs authorized under Section 127e of
Title 10, U.S. Code, "support of special operations to combat
terrorism." The budget display also excludes Drug Interdiction and
Counter-Drug activities authorized under Section 284(c) of Title 10,
U.S. Code, "Support for counterdrug activities and activities to counter
transnational organized crime."

In identifying the specific funds allocated to security cooperation, the
Department focused on costs that could be directly tied to security
cooperation or similar activities. Many DoD activities, especially in
the Military Services, could be viewed as security cooperation. However,
for the purposes of this display, the Department focused on the
situations where a security cooperation program is expected to incur an
additional cost above and beyond what the Department would already be
doing. For example, if U.S. forces are planning to conduct a training
event and two observers from a partner nation are expected to attend,
the Department would not reflect the costs of that exercise in this
budget display. However, if DoD paid for the travel, lodging and
subsistence of those observers to support attendance, then those costs
would be captured in this display.

Changes from FY 2021 Justification for Security Cooperation Program and
Activity Funding book include:

> • Realigned the Defense Institute for International Legal Studies
> (DIILS) and Institute for Security Governance (ISG) from Category 4,
> Capacity Building, to Category 6, Management, Infrastructure and
> Workforce development to better align these Program / Activities with
> the category objectives.
>
> • Realigned Border Security from Category 4, Capacity Building, to
> Category 3, Support to Operations, to better align with this Program /
> Activity with the category objectives.
>
> • Added the Regional Defense Fellowship Program (RDFP) to Category 5,
> Educational and Training Activities. Consistent with the FY 2021
> defense appropriations bill, RDFP has been realigned as a standalone
> program.
>
> • Created Category 9, Cooperative Threat Reduction, and realigned the
> DoD Cooperative Threat Reduction Program from Category 4, Capacity
> Building, to the new category to reflect the program's distinct
> authorities and mission.

Categories of Security Cooperation Programs and Activities

This budget display groups security cooperation programs and related
activities and the respective authorities through which they are
executed into nine (9) categories. Categories 1-5 mirror the subchapters
in Chapter 16 of Title 10. The budget display also includes Categories
6-9 as follows: requests that fund the reforms to management and

Congressional Role

[Congress provides the authority and funding for SC
programs]{.underline}. Title 10 SC activities fall under the
jurisdiction of the armed services committees, while Title 22 (DOS) SA
activities are under the jurisdiction of the Senate Foreign Relations
and House Foreign Affairs committees. [Although the armed services
committees are responsible for the authorizing legislation for Title 10
SC programs, both committees exercise oversight of SC activities and the
management of SC policy, including the level of coordination between DOD
and DOS.]{.underline} Funding for Title 10 SC programs and activities is
provided through annual appropriations bills, which originates in the
appropriations committees, specifically the defense subcommittees.

Primarily (but not solely) through these six committees,

[Congress plays critical roles in the design and oversight of SC
programs and in ensuring that **SC activities are aligned with and
meeting U.S. national security and foreign policy
objectives**]{.underline}. Pursuant to statutory authorities, the
executive branch must notify relevant committees on a regular basis
about some, but not all, SC activities. [Congress can exercise oversight
roles in numerous ways, including determining how the executive branch
makes decisions]{.underline} for the export of military and dual-use
items, [using annual authorizing legislation to establish temporary
authorities or modify the U.S. Code on an enduring basis,]{.underline}
[reviewing proposed arms transfers and planned SC/SA activities and
funding obligations, mandating reports, and holding relevant
hearings]{.underline}. The Senate also influences SC through its advice
and consent to the ratification of relevant treaties. DOD's FY2021 SC
Budget Request,

Authorizations, and Appropriations

The final FY2021 NDAA (P.L. 116-283) mostly maintained funding levels
from DSCA's FY2021 SC budget request, although some provisions identify
SC priority areas. In establishing the Pacific Deterrence Initiative
(PDI), the NDAA requires DOD activities, including SC, to prioritize the
Indo-Pacific region. The creation of PDI also indicates that the
Indo-Pacific will remain a priority for years to come. Other NDAA
provisions include a requirement for DOD to identify ways to enhance SC
in African countries, as well as amplify SC requirements from the Women,
Peace, and Security Act of 2017. The bill also amended DOD's main train
and equip program (10 U.S.C. §333) to add "air domain awareness
operations" and "**[cyberspace]{.underline}** security and defensive
cyberspace **[operations]{.underline}**" [as authorized areas for
support]{.underline}.

The final FY2021 Defense Appropriations bill (P.L. 116- 260) increased
funds for DSCA's base budget and slightly decreased its Overseas
Contingency Operations budget. The bill provides significant increases
for SC in both Africa Command's and Southern Command's areas of
responsibility (funds for both have declined since FY2017) and cuts
funding to both CTEF and ASFF (see Table 1).

2\. **[Use the Power of the Purse]{.underline}**

Congress can use the power of the purse to place restrictions on the
accounts it funds and may fund certain accounts while defunding others.

[Place Conditions and/or Restrictions on Security]{.underline}
Assistance: [Congress can restrict or place conditions on how U.S.
security assistance is used by allies and security partners. **Such
conditions can discourage allies or security partners from pursuing
certain policies**.]{.underline}

Defund the Authorizations for the Use of Force (AUMFs): Congress has the
discretion to appropriate funding for deployments related to AUMFs.
Congress has appropriated more than \$2 trillion in funding for
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as other operations related
to the Global War on Terror (GWOT) through emergency supplemental bills
since 9/11, namely the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) fund, which
is operated jointly by the DoD and State Department on top of their
annually appropriated base budgets.9

Increase Funding for End-Use Monitoring Programs: Recipients of U.S.
defense articles and services must agree to use them only for their
intended purposes, to not transfer the title without the written consent
of the U.S. government, to provide the same degree of physical security
to the articles as the U.S. government does, and to allow U.S. officials
to verify compliance with these terms. Congress appropriates funding for
end-use monitoring programs to ensure that U.S. defense articles are
used according to the terms of the transfer agreement. Congress can
increase funding for end-use monitoring programs to monitor whether
weapons are used for agreed-upon purposes or are transferred to
unauthorized actors.

Condition Future Arms Sales on Past Behavior: Congress could informally
commit to condition future arms sales on the past behavior of recipient
countries. For example, Congress could block sales to regimes that have
been credibly found to commit violations of international humanitarian
law or of end-use agreements. A robust end-use monitoring system could
also expose violations of transfer agreements, providing Congress with
leverage to hold security partners to the terms of end-use monitoring
agreements and to potentially limit or block future arms sales.

Shift Focus from Equipment to Training: While building partner capacity
is a primary goal of U.S. security assistance, U.S. policy tends to
emphasize arms sales and the provision of materiel over training.
Training may be relatively more effective in professionalizing partner
militaries and ensuring that they actually have the technical capability
to use the weapons they acquire effectively, as well as discouraging
human rights violations. In order to shift emphasis towards training,
Congress can appropriate more funding to International Military
Education and Training (IMET) rather than Foreign Military Financing
(FMF), and can include line-items in appropriations bills requiring
assistance to be non-lethal or focused on training.

### SC\-\--Includes Security Assistance\-\--2AC

#### Security coop entails transferring defense articles, mil-to-mil exercises, military education, and building partner capacity. Both DOD-implemented Title 22 and DOD-administered Title 10 programs are topical.

Security Cooperation (SC) Overview

The Department of Defense (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [uses]{.underline} the
term **[security cooperation]{.underline}** (SC) [to refer **broadly**
to DOD interactions with foreign security establishments. SC activities
include]{.underline}

• the [transfer of defense articles and services]{.underline};

• **[military-to-military exercises]{.underline}**;

• [military education, training, and advising; and]{.underline}

• [capacity building of partner security forces.]{.underline}

[SC programs are intended to encourage and enable partner
nations]{.underline} (PNs) **[to work with the U]{.underline}**nited
[**S**tates to achieve strategic objectives]{.underline}. They are
considered a key tool for achieving U.S. national security and foreign
policy objectives. [These activities are executed through **both**
**DOD**-administered **SC programs**]{.underline} (authorized **[under
Title 10]{.underline}**, U.S.C.) **[and DOD]{.underline}**-implemented
State Department (**[DOS]{.underline}**) **[security
assistance]{.underline}** (SA) [programs]{.underline} (authorized
[under]{.underline} **[Title 22]{.underline}**, U.S.C). Beyond
grant-based programs, SC encompasses the Foreign Military Sales program
[and]{.underline} [enables U.S. and PN collaboration on defense
articles]{.underline}. The following sections focus on DOD "Title 10"
activities.

SC: Policy and Objectives

SC activities aim to achieve particular objectives in support of U.S.
national security and defense strategies. Specifically, SC may build
defense relationships that promote U.S. security interests, enhance
military capabilities of U.S. allies and partners, and provide the
United States with access to PNs. Under the overarching goal of
furthering U.S. national security and foreign policy interests, SC
emphasizes partnerships, aiming to be mutually beneficial for the United
States and its partners. SC activities aim to develop and strengthen a
PN's ability to provide internal security, contribute to regional
security efforts, combat shared threats, and increase military
interoperability with the United States.

The 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS) signaled the Trump
Administration's intention to shift SC activities from nearly two
decades of prioritizing counterterrorism toward "great power
competition" (GPC) with Russia and China. The shift raised questions as
to how SC should be realigned to meet this objective and what the
implications could be for scaling down counterterrorism-focused SC
activities in Africa and the Middle East, especially as Russia and China
increase their influence. Some DOD officials and defense analysts have
suggested that rather than a shift, counterterrorism, as well as
irregular warfare, should remain priorities within GPC. The Biden
Administration has yet to release a new NDS; however, its Interim
National Security Strategic Guidance broadly identifies authoritarianism
and strategic competition as priority threats that require coordination
and cooperation with allies and partners.

SC: Roles and Responsibilities

[Many SC activities require DOD to coordinate with multiple DOD
components]{.underline} and other federal departments, primarily DOS.
Some DOD SC activities require varying levels of coordination with DOS.
Within DOD, the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy (USD\[P\])
exercises overall direction, authority, and control over SC matters.

[The]{.underline} Defense Security Cooperation Agency
([DSCA]{.underline}) [represents the interests of the Secretary of
Defense and]{.underline} USD(P) in SC matters and [is tasked with
directing, administering, and executing many SC programs,]{.underline}
developing SC policy, and providing DOD-wide SC guidance. DSCA is also
DOD's main interlocutor between the PNs, implementing agencies, and the
defense industry. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special
Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict (ASD-SO/LIC) oversees and approves
some SC training activities that are managed by DSCA. U.S. Special
Operations Command (SOCOM) coordinates those SC activities executed by
special operations forces (SOF). DOS leads U.S. foreign aid and has
final say on SA. DOS's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) is the
principal link to DOD and ensures that SA is integrated with other U.S.
policies and activities at the country, regional, and global levels. PM
also determines PN eligibility, appropriate SA programs, and which
defense articles and equipment are permitted for transfer.

Title 10 SC Reforms from the FY2017 NDAA

The post-9/11 period saw the rapid and piecemeal expansion of DOD SC
activities, mainly as temporary authorities that required annual renewal
in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The FY2017 NDAA (P.L.
114-328) consolidated and codified existing Title 10 SC authorities into
10 U.S.C. §§301-386. Other provisions aimed to make improvements to the
SC programs and themselves, as well as improvements in the management
and oversight of those programs. Key reforms from the FY2017 NDAA
included requirements for the following:

• [A consolidated DOD budget request for Title 10 SC programs and
activities]{.underline} (10 U.S.C. §381); the first was released for
FY2019.

• [Harmonized congressional notification requirements for most DOD train
and equip programs]{.underline} (10 U.S.C. §333).

• Institutional capacity building programs to strengthen partner defense
institutions (10 U.S.C. §332).

• A DOD SC Workforce Development Program to manage a professional
workforce in support of SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §384).

• A program of assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) to be
informed and supported by strategic evaluations on initial PN
assessments, monitoring of implementation, and the efficiency and
effectiveness of SC programs and activities (10 U.S.C. §383).

**[Until 2018]{.underline}**, [a significant shortfall in the Army's
international engagement strategy was a self-imposed division of labor
between]{.underline} conventional forces' **[exercise-centric security
cooperation]{.underline}** [and the **materiel-focused security
assistance** enterprise]{.underline}, [which resulted in less than
optimal outcomes.]{.underline} [Congress helped the U.S. Army **rethink
this synergy of effort**]{.underline} [by issuing new guidance via
the]{.underline} Fiscal Year [2017]{.underline} [N]{.underline}ational
[D]{.underline}efense [A]{.underline}uthorization [A]{.underline}ct,
which promises to result in better designed capability that meets U.S.
and partner shared security goals.

DIVISION OF LABOR

[The Army's operational forces conducted security cooperation through
troop exercises, information sharing and key leader engagements for
decades]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the Army security assistance
enterprise worked out of the limelight, remaining mostly
materiel-focused and tethered to the State Department's 22 U.S.
Code,]{.underline} Subchapter II---Foreign Military Sales
[authorizations]{.underline}. The bifurcated foreign engagement
activities infrequently overlapped, missing the Army's true potential
for helping prepare foreign partners to defend themselves as well as
strengthen U.S. Army units for coalition operations and reach the
aspirational outcome of robust interoperability---a stretch goal for
Army commanders and our best foreign partners.

The Army's division of security cooperation labor is the result of a
decision made decades ago to split into two international engagement
entities previously housed under the deputy undersecretary of the Army
for international affairs.

The first entity in this division of labor is the Army secretariat
represented by the deputy assistant secretary of the Army for defense
export and cooperation (DASA (DE&C)) under the authority of the
assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and
technology. DASA (DE&C) oversees the transfer of materiel, engineering
activities and related training for foreign partners such as servicing
foreign military sales cases and armaments cooperation agreements to
leverage foreign technologies and capabilities that support Army
readiness, modernization and interoperability goals.

The balance of international engagement activities was assumed by the
Army's chief of operations, the assistant chief of staff G-3/5/7, which
oversees the day-to-day maneuver-related engagements with foreign
partners. That partition of effort can result in conflicting messages to
foreign partners and less than optimal outcomes for the Army's
contribution to DOD's strategic goals of building partner capabilities
and preparing for global coalition operations.

REDEFINING EFFORTS

Fortunately, [those too often disjointed outcomes are now collapsing
into a far more synergistic endeavor thanks to the National Defense
Authorization Act of 2017, and in particular the **codification** of
**Title 10, Chapter 16, Security Cooperation.**]{.underline}

[Congress redefined **nearly everything DOD does** with a foreign
partner as "**security cooperation**."]{.underline} [That definition
includes not just exercises and information sharing]{.underline}---which
is the traditional forte of operational forces---[but the Army's support
of State Department-approved foreign military sales cases, direct
commercial sales, the training provided to foreign partners]{.underline}
at our schoolhouses [and other programs as defined by Title 22 Security
Assistance, a State Department authority executed by DOD]{.underline}.

PART II: **[DEFINING SECURITY ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION]{.underline}**

Security assistance and cooperation activities

encompass a range of different U.S. efforts in disparate countries.
These activities differ in terms of how they are deployed and why, what
types of local partners participate, [how they are authorized legally
and legislatively, their geographic scope, who is responsible for their
budgets and implementation]{.underline}, and their relative importance
to critical U.S. national security goals. Over the past decade,
[Congress has approved]{.underline} **[myriad new
authorities]{.underline}**, [such as Building Capacity]{.underline} [of
Foreign Security Forces]{.underline} (Section 2282) [and the Global
Security Contingency Fund]{.underline} (GSCF), without a consonant
overall reorganization or strategy regarding how to deploy the growing
toolkit. As a result, there is some confusion about the purposes and
types of programs that exist.

• **[Security assistance]{.underline}** [refers to programs
through]{.underline} [which the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [provides defense articles, military training,
defense institution-building efforts, and other defense-related services
by grant, loan, credit, cash sales, or lease, in furtherance of U.S.
policies and objectives]{.underline}. Security [assistance programs
include]{.underline} Foreign Military Financing (**[FMF]{.underline}**),
Foreign Military Sales (**[FMS]{.underline}**), International Military
Education and Training (**[IMET]{.underline}**), [Global Peace
Operations Initiative, and the Excess Defense Articles]{.underline}
(**[EDA]{.underline}**) program. The [State]{.underline} Department [has
**overall responsibility**]{.underline} for [many of these programs,
including FMF, FMS, and IMET, but they are primarily implemented by
the]{.underline} Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(**[DSCA]{.underline}**) at DoD. [DoD has responsibility for other
security assistance programs.]{.underline}

• **[Security cooperation]{.underline}** [encompasses **all DoD
interactions**]{.underline} [with foreign defense establishments to
build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests]{.underline}, **[develop allied and friendly military
capabilities]{.underline}** [for self-defense and multinational
operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency
access to a host nation]{.underline}. (Access is the U.S. military's
term for the willingness of a host nation to allow U.S. forces on its
ground and in its airspace.6 ) [Security cooperation includes
DoD-administered security assistance. Additional security cooperation
programs include joint military exercises such as Operation Bright
Star]{.underline}, normally held every two years with Egypt; training,
[counterproliferation, and nonproliferation programs]{.underline};
defense [institution-building]{.underline}; **[defense and military
contacts]{.underline}**; **[information-sharing and intelligence
cooperation]{.underline}**; and logistics support. **[Security
cooperation programs are budgeted and implemented directly by
DoD.]{.underline}**

• Security sector assistance, as defined by Presidential Policy
Directive 23, refers to policies, programs, and activities used to
engage with foreign partners and help shape their policies and actions
in the security sector -- both civilian and military institutions. PPD
23 outlined the need for a coordinated effort synchronizing programs
across U.S. government agencies -- including State, DoD, the Department
of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) -- to help foreign partners build and sustain the capacity and
the effectiveness of civilian and military institutions to provide
security, safety, and justice for the civilian population.7 Many of
these programs are significant; for example, the Obama administration
included over \$2.1 billion in its Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 budget request
for two foreign assistance funds that primarily work with civilian
security institutions: the international narcotics control and law
enforcement (INCLE) and the nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, demining,
and related (NADR) funds.8 (To avoid confusion, unless referring to it
specifically, this report nests security sector assistance within the
broader rubric of security assistance and cooperation.)

#### Security cooperation includes both Title 10 and Title 22 programs

Army under Contract No. W748H-06-C-0001, "Security cooperation
organizations in the country team: options for success," ISBN
978-0-8330-4911-7\]

**[Security assistance]{.underline}**, as it is currently in law and
practice, [reflects an approach that is adequate in a]{.underline}
[stable environment]{.underline} in which efforts can be planned,
resourced, and executed without major changes, but not sufficiently
agile for a world in which challenges are more dynamic and flexibility
is essential for success. To address this issue, [the]{.underline} U.S.
Army asked RAND to do a \"quick turn\" assessment of security assistance
and propose alternatives for improving it. This technical report is the
result of that project.

This research considers the missions and structure of security
assistance organizations in U.S. Missions around the world and presents
three options for improving the functionality of security assistance
organizations based on best practices and what is known about the tasks
they are likely to take on. This project was undertaken as a
quick-turnaround study for the Army\'s Office of the Deputy Chief of
Staff for Operations and Plans. The research took place from February to
April 2008, with some adjustments based on input from Headquarters,
Department of the Army, and from reviewers after this period ended.

Summary

**[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [conducts a wide
range of **security coop**eration missions and initiatives that can
serve as key enablers of U.S. foreign policy efforts to assist and
influence other countries]{.underline}. For a relatively small
investment, security cooperation programs can play an important role by
shaping the security environment and laying the groundwork for future
stability operations with allies and partners.

**[Security coop]{.underline}**eration, [in the form of noncombat
military-to-military activities, includes \"normal\" peacetime
activities]{.underline}, [such as **building** the long**-term
institutional and operational capabilities and capacity of key partners
and allies**]{.underline}, **[establishing and deepening relationships
between the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**partner militaries**]{.underline}, and securing access to critical
areas overseas. **[Security cooperation]{.underline}** also [can include
conducting]{.underline} **[quasi-operational efforts]{.underline}**,
**[such as helping U.S. partners and allies manage their own internal
defense]{.underline}**.

However, current national security challenges both create significant
demands for U.S. security cooperation programs and deplete the resources
needed to carry out these missions. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are
occupying the regular, reserve, National Guard, and Special Forces
trainers and advisors who would normally be called on to train and
advise mili-tary counterparts. Furthermore, U.S. allies, who often
complement the efforts of U.S. advisors and trainers, are also stretched
thin by their own deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.

**[In an effort to find ways to improve security
coop]{.underline}**eration planning, coordination, and execution, the
U.S. Army\'s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and
Plans asked RAND Arroyo Center to conduct an assessment of key facets of
U.S. security cooperation---specifically, the missions, capabilities,
and structure needed in the security assistance organizations (SAOs)2
that coordinate the military aspects of U.S. foreign relations,
including security cooperation activities, at U.S. Missions around the
world.

In its assessment, the RAND research team identified three levels of
players that plan, coordi-nate, execute, and oversee U.S. security
cooperation efforts. However, a number of challenges exist at each level
that can inhibit the effectiveness of SAO efforts. 

Washington, D.C., Level

At the federal government level in Washington, D.C., anywhere from
thousands to billions of dollars are allocated for security cooperation
efforts in a given country through various pro-grams. Executive Branch
agencies, particularly the departments of Defense and State, work
together to ensure that funds are allocated according to the wishes of
Congress and the Presi-dent. At the same time, Congress plays a pivotal
role in these processes through its annual authorizations and
appropriations bills, as well as its oversight and approval of the
statutory framework that governs security cooperation.

At this level, [two main funding authorities govern security
cooperation]{.underline}:

• **[Title 22 funds]{.underline}** [are appropriated to]{.underline} the
**[State]{.underline}** Department, [which]{.underline} often
**[transfers them to DoD]{.underline}**, [which in turn manages and
executes most security assistance programs. **Title 22 includes Foreign
Military Sales programs**]{.underline}. Title 22 is less flexible in
some ways, mainly because Congress authorizes and appropriates these
funds on a by-country and by- program basis, and requires congressional
notification and permission to move funds from one effort to another.

• [Title 10 funds are appropriated to DoD and are intended for
operations and maintenance of the U.S. military. These funds are often
used to fund international participation in U.S. joint exercises,
military personnel exchanges, or military-to-military contacts as a way
to enhance the relationships between partner militaries and U.S.
forces.]{.underline}

Because of the differences in funding authorities for Title 10 and Title
22, there is a general separation between the two, resulting in distinct

Security Assistance and Cooperation: A Brief Overview

[Security cooperation and security assistance are terms often used
without always being defined]{.underline} --- or sometimes even
understood --- by the people writing about them. Without getting too in
the weeds, it's helpful to briefly describe these concepts and delineate
where they come from.

Security assistance refers to programs through which the United States
provides arms and other defense materials, military training, defense
institution-building efforts, and other defense-related services. The
[State]{.underline} Department [has overall responsibility for many of
the largest and longest-standing of these programs, which fall under
Title 22 authority, including foreign military financing]{.underline},
**[f]{.underline}**oreign **[m]{.underline}**ilitary
**[s]{.underline}**ales, [and]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[m]{.underline}**ilitary
**[e]{.underline}**ducation and **[t]{.underline}**raining. However, [it
is **the** **D**epartment **o**f **D**efense that actually implements
many of them. It also administers the Section 333 authority, which
consolidated many of the Title 10 capacity-building
authorities]{.underline} created since 9/11 into one.

[Because of its focus on allied and partner militaries]{.underline},
[security assistance is largely synonymous with military
assistance.]{.underline} Indeed, the two are often used interchangeably.
However, the United States also provides security sector assistance to
civilian institutions through programs such as the International
Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement.3 For our purposes, [it is helpful
to nest security sector assistance within the broader rubric of security
assistance.]{.underline}

[Security **coop**eration **encompasses all D**]{.underline}epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [interactions with
**foreign defense** **establishments**. **This includes all Defense
Department-administered security assistance**]{.underline}, as [well as
joint military exercises, defense institution-building, defense and
military contacts, info]{.underline}rmation-[sharing]{.underline} and
[intel]{.underline}ligence [coop]{.underline}eration, **[and logistics
support]{.underline}**. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates currently [engages in **security cooperation**
with **224 countries and international organizations** around the
world]{.underline}.4

[The United States spends billions on security assistance and
cooperation to achieve various objectives. The most obvious goal is to
build the capacity of partners' military and police forces]{.underline},
as well as their defense and law enforcement institutions [so they can
**confront shared security threats** and contribute to international
missions]{.underline}. Many of the new security assistance and
cooperation authorities created after 9/11 have focused on capacity
building specifically for counterterrorism purposes. **[Capacity
building]{.underline}** and joint exercises also **[increase the
interoperability of partner forces with the U.S.
military]{.underline}**. [Although capacity building generally focuses
on operational and tactical capabilities, it also may]{.underline} (and
should) [include professionalization of partner forces and
institutions.]{.underline}

Another aim is to build or maintain relationships with partner countries
in order to secure access --- to bases or transit routes --- and
increase U.S. influence with the host nation government. [That influence
may be used to yield specific outcomes]{.underline}, such as encouraging
recipients to buy arms from the United States as opposed to a competitor
or to contribute to an international coalition. In other cases, the
purposes of gaining influence are fuzzier, and may include balancing
against a regional competitor, or simply generating goodwill.
Critically, whether for access or influence, security assistance and
cooperation are being used as incentives, which may lead to them being
deployed in ways that are inconsistent with capacity-building needs in a
given country.

However, [funding non-Article 5 activities contingent upon the
demonstrated commitment to defense]{.underline} [spending and collective
security can promote NATO member spending and influence increased
defense spending across the Alliance]{.underline}. 208 [Such conditions
would demonstrate the **prioritization of collective
defense**]{.underline}. Conditioning foreign assistance on matters
unrelated to defense capabilities can encourage allies to increase their
own defense spending in order to maintain or improve their status with
the United States. While maintaining the paramount importance of
deterrence strategy through collective defense in NATO, the United
States should tie some of its foreign assistance spending in Europe for
non-Article 5 activities to a country\'s defense spending. Examples of
such activities include counterterrorism training, refugee support, or
even trade incentives.

Congress already places conditions on the appropriation of authorized
funds on foreign assistance; however, it has not utilized this powerful
foreign policy tool to influence NATO member defense spending. When
drafting future conditional authorizations, Congress should look to its
own example in the FY17 NDAA, for its specific and technical conditions
imposed on Ukraine in the Extension and Enhancement of Ukraine Security
Assistance Initiative. 209 While \$ 350 million was authorized to be
appropriated in Fiscal Year 2017, Congress made available not more than
\$ 175 million in funds to be used for the authorized purposes. The
Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Secretary of State,
certified that Ukraine \"ha\[d\] taken substantial actions to make
defense institutional reforms, in such areas as civilian control of the
military\"; increased transparency and accountability in defense
procurement; improved transparency to decrease corruption; and sustained
improvements of combat capability, among other requirements. 210 By
limiting the amount of assistance, and placing measurable requirements
on the beneficiary as a condition to receiving a portion of the funding,
Congress is able to maintain some control over the purpose and amount of
spending that, absent such conditions, are within the exclusive purview
of the recipient.

[Congress can use similar conditions on future authorizations towards
NATO members to influence the amount and purpose of ally defense
expenditures. One possibility is to **condition some or all Title 10 and
Title 22 funding going to each NATO member on**]{.underline} their
[certification, through its annual **reporting
requirements**]{.underline} [to the NATO Secretary General, that they
have increased their defense spending]{.underline}, or met both defense
spending and spending on military equipment targets. Absent
certification, the Secretary of Defense can waive the conditions based
on his determination that such waiver is in the best interest of the
national security of the United States. 211 [Another possibility is to
focus conditions on the NATO members\']{.underline} [commitment to
improving combat capability through its spending on research and
development or even]{.underline} [buying specific weapon systems that
promote interoperability with other members of the
Alliance]{.underline}, **[such as cyber defense or
intelligence]{.underline}**, **[reconnaissance]{.underline}**, **[and
surveillance platforms that are important in countering Russia\'s hybrid
warfare]{.underline}** capabilities.

Conditional authorizations for funding foreign aid recognize the reality
that there are many other issues, both internal and external, impacting
NATO members. The refugee crisis, incidents of terrorism, and
nationalism erode the foundations of the European Union. This could lead
to decreased military spending and lack of political will to spend
precious resources to come to the aid of another NATO member, placing
the principles of Article 5, and indeed the very purpose of the
Alliance, in question. 212 Fairly leveraging those threats is a prudent
course of action that Congress can take to offer support to U.S. allies,
albeit with strings attached, in order to refocus NATO on Article 5
deterrence and boost defense spending. Certain NATO members may see less
of a need to meet the NATO defense spending targets, particularly those
in the south or the west that have less to fear from Russian aggression
than the Baltic States or Poland. Those members would face receiving
little to no support from the United States in their respective efforts
to manage an influx of refugees from the Syrian conflict or train
counterterrorism security forces. 213 By using a carrot to entice
additional defense spending throughout the Alliance, Congress can
reinforce a diplomatic truism: that supporting causes, such as the
defense of the Baltic States\' sovereignty from Russian aggression will
earn goodwill from the rest of the Alliance\--or more simply, supporting
NATO results in NATO support. 214

In the FY17 NDAA, Congress hinted that it may consider individual NATO
member contributions in future foreign assistance authorizations. It
decided against expressing the sense of Congress that NATO allies\'
investments in developing and employing security capabilities should
\"meet or exceed U.S. efforts in this regard.\" Instead, Congress
directed the Secretary of Defense to present to the armed services and
foreign relations committees an accounting of European investment in
security capabilities and efforts to contribute to global security
outcomes. 215 This requirement, along with the reforms to the security
cooperation framework that also require country-specific reporting, 216
indicates Congress may consider implementing conditional funding for
NATO members, as they did with Ukraine.

[Conditional spending provisions]{.underline} from Congress could also
create secondary effects that positively impact the amount of defense
spending throughout NATO. It is reasonably foreseeable that the European
community could exert its own diplomatic pressure on an ally failing to
meet the Wales Summit targets, especially if the loss of U.S. dollars
consequently causes a state to struggle to contain their non-Article 5
security threats within their borders. This would serve as a secondary
line of influence towards increasing defense spending. For example, if
the Czech Republic, a NATO member that consistently spends less than one
percent of its GDP on its defense, 217 were to lose the millions of
dollars it receives from the United States in foreign assistance, 218
and fail to effectively manage internal security threats, neighboring
NATO members, such as Germany or Poland, may exert their own diplomatic
pressures on the Czech Republic to increase defense spending.

The United States\' national security interest is better served when its
NATO allies focus on discrete capabilities to defend and deter Russian
aggression than if it were to encourage each of the Baltic States to be
independently capable of defending against Russia. Given their size and
resources, it is impossible to expect any of the Baltic States to match
the strength of the Russian forces aligned on their eastern borders on
their own. By influencing their defense spending, Congress can better
ensure that the Baltic States\' forces provide complementary and
integrated capabilities, rather than incompatible or duplicative ones.
219 [By avoiding the duplication of systems and capabilities between
multiple allies, limited resources are better managed. **Thoughtfully
crafted conditions** on **security cooperation authorities**
can]{.underline} also **[leverage existing capabilities]{.underline}**,
[such as encouraging Estonia to build upon their already
sophisticated]{.underline} [cyber defense capabilities.]{.underline}

As a result, Estonia focused considerable efforts towards cyber defense

[Carefully drafting funding authorizations to **maximize U.S.
influence** in improving **NATO\'s defense capability**]{.underline},
through conditional foreign aid and other economic incentives, [will
encourage defense spending and **strengthen individual NATO member
ties** to the United States]{.underline}. 221 The resulting increase in
ownership of collective security by the European contingent of NATO
should improve individual defense capabilities. However, to create a
meaningful deterrent to Russia and effectively counter its A2/AD
capabilities in Eastern Europe, the whole of the Alliance must be
greater than the sum of its parts. [By focusing on improving NATO member
forces, networks, and weapon systems, **Congress can positively**

Merge "Civil-Military Operations" and "Security Cooperation" Into
"Security Partner Engagement"

**[[Civil-military operations and security cooperation are
similar]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [but each term contains ambiguity that
prevents non-practitioners from fully understanding how they fit in
competition]{.underline}. For example, "civil-military operations" risks
confusion with "civil-military relations," the study of the dynamic
between the military and civil society writ large. As a term,
"[**[security coop]{.mark}eration**" [is **broad enough** to **encompass
virtually anything involving a partner**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Both activities specifically emphasize the use of military forces to
establish, maintain, influence, and leverage security
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} through increased defense
interactions. Recent history exemplified the importance of non-standard
(i.e., non-military) security partners to consolidate strategic gains,
and the ability to manage complex and non-traditional security
relationships could yield even greater impact in great-power
competition. [[Concerted security engagements before conflict help align
U.S. efforts with allies and partners,]{.mark} provide invaluable access
and placement in event of crisis, and facilitate U.S. campaign and
contingency plans. Both conventional forces and special operators are
capable of engaging partners and allies to not only increase
interoperability, but also enhance U.S. influence, as a low-cost
contribution in competition below armed conflict.]{.underline}

"Security partner engagement" acknowledges the importance of security
partnerships and ensuring that regular engagements will secure U.S.
influence and preserve the United States as the preferred partner of
choice. [[This terminology adapts U.S. Cyber Command's concept of
"persistent engagement," where regular engagement helps to get ahead of
problems and forestall opponents' abilities to gain
advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} Applying this logic to civil-military
security engagements acknowledges that the influence and advantages
afforded by a deep network of security partners are neither
predetermined nor indefinite, and require concerted effort to deter
opponents that seek to make headway or generate fissures among partners
and allies. Reshaping "security partner engagement" in this fashion
could account for one way that the department operationalizes its
Guidance for Development of Alliances and Partnerships, which looks to
maintain and sustain this asymmetric advantage in all stages of
competition.

The lack of clarity for EDI authorities notwithstanding, [efforts to

overhaul of the security cooperation regime]{.underline} in the FY17
NDAA. [In an attempt to **simplify the quagmire** that security
cooperation authorities had become over the past fifteen
years,]{.underline} [Congress streamlined the dozens of various
temporary and permanent sources of authority and codified]{.underline}
[them under one chapter in Title 10 of the U.S. Code]{.underline}. 125
[Congress noted the increasingly more important role **security
cooperation** plays in **DoD operations**]{.underline}, 126 and the
below discussion of how [EUCOM can leverage these new authorities to
**augment EDI demonstrates**]{.underline} [the potential utility such
activities can have within NATO\'s deterrence strategy.]{.underline}

3\. Defense Security Cooperation and the Baltic States

[Since]{.underline} the terrorist attacks of 11 September
[2001]{.underline}, [Congress granted more authority to the DoD to
engage in security cooperation with foreign militaries]{.underline}, [a
mission originally conducted by the DoS. Over that time, security
cooperation became an integral part of the DoD\'s mission and is
considered an important tool for executing its national security
responsibilities]{.underline}. 127 The FY17 NDAA overhauled the
previously unwieldy patchwork of authorities that made up the security
cooperation regime and provides authority for the DoD to enhance
interoperability and increase defense capability of friendly foreign
militaries. [As building partner capacity with newer NATO members is one
of the five lines of effort under EDI]{.underline}, 128 [these new
authorities should be leveraged to the maximum extent
possible]{.underline} by EUCOM in the Baltic States [to ensure
sufficient capability exists in that vulnerable region to **deter Russia
aggression**]{.underline}. However, as discussed below, the source of
funding for these authorities and whether they can be used in
conjunction with EDI funds remains ambiguous.

a\. Building Defense Capacity

Key among the changes is the replacement of 10 U.S.C. § 2282 on
\"Authority to Build the Capacity of Foreign Security Forces\" with a
new permanent authority that widens the scope of security cooperation
the DoD can provide. 129 While the scope of Section 2282 was limited
primarily to counterterrorism and stability operations, 130 broadens the
scope of authorized foreign capacity building to include, among other
purposes, training, and equipping for border security and operations or
activities that contribute to an international coalition operation that
is in the national interest of the United States. 131 Moreover, 10
U.S.C. § 333, Section 2282\'s replacement, will permit the DoD to
provide lethal equipment on a global scale, which it was unable to do
under Section 2282. 132 Finally, Section 333 allows the DoD to support
the sustainment of previously provided equipment to foreign partners,
whereas such sustainment was previously under the exclusive purview of
the DoS through its Foreign Military Financing account. 133 This
bureaucratic anachronism resulted in equipment at risk of disrepair,
misuse, and inoperability by the foreign recipient. 134

Under the definitions section of the Security Cooperation chapter,
[security cooperation programs]{.underline}, such as those authorized by
Section 333, [include building and developing allied security
capabilities for **self-defense and building relationships** that
promote specific U.S. security interests]{.underline}. 135 The DoD
should utilize these new authorities to build capacity in the security
forces of the Baltic States in a way that it was unable to do so under
the previous law. However, because Section 333 did not become law until
the final days of Fiscal Year 2017 when it replaces Section 2282, 136
the utility of this new authority was largely unknown in FY17 and
remains little used due to the complexity of funding Section 333
activities. Section 333 provides the sole source of funding shall come
out of amounts authorized and appropriated for such fiscal year for O&M,
Defense-wide, and available for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency.
137 However, Section 1241 of the FY17 NDAA adds additional sources of
funding for Fiscal Year 2017 relevant to the Baltic States, including
O&M Defense-wide, available for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
as specified in the funding table in Section 4301 of the FY17 NDAA, 138
as well as for the same line of items in the OCO O&M funding table in
Section 4302. 139 The dual funding sources, O&M and OCO O&M, highlight
the potential overlap between Section 333 capacity building, which are
funded by O&M, and EDI capacity building, which is funded by OCO O&M. To
avoid obligating funds from the wrong account, commanders must know
whether the activity falls under EDI, and whether security cooperation
funds can be used in addition to EDI or exclusively. Clarifying
legislation can help resolve this confusion. 140

b\. Operational Support to Foreign Forces

In addition to the replacement of Section 2282, the FY17 NDAA greatly
expands the authority to provide support for conduct of operations to
friendly foreign countries, replacing Section 1207 from the Fiscal Year
2016 NDAA, which was limited to providing support to African countries
conducting counterterrorism activities. 141 Section 1245 of the FY17
NDAA, codified at 10 U.S.C. § 331, greatly expands the scope of the
previous authority by eliminating geographic limitations. 142 This new
authority provides funding of logistic support, supplies, and services
to security forces in a friendly country, as well as small-scale
construction projects to facilitate friendly country participation in
U.S.-supported operations. 143

One provision that, if utilized by EUCOM, could meaningfully assist
improving the defense capability in the Baltic States is the special
procurement authority that allows the DoD to procure equipment \"for the
purpose of the loan of such equipment to the military forces of a
friendly foreign country participating in a U.S.-supported coalition or
combined operation.\" 144 This is \"to enhance capabilities or to
increase interoperability with \[U.S. forces\] and other coalition
partners.\" 145 Because the intent of the authority is that the friendly
country will reimburse the United States for the procurement, or the
U.S. forces can to reuse the equipment, there is no limitation on the
value of the procurement. 146

[The DoD should utilize this authorization to procure an excess quantity
of U.S.-used systems to ensure friendly forces use and train on the same
equipment as U.S. forces.]{.underline} Use of equipment, coupled with
training and exercises will increase familiarity and interoperability
with U.S. forces and provide friendly foreign forces with confidence in
operating weapon systems alongside the United States. A successful loan
may influence the friendly force\'s procurement decisions, leading to
more effective use of defense spending by the friendly force at no real
cost to the United States, as the equipment is returned at the end of
the loan period. However, [it remains unclear as to what limitations on
the type of procurement there are, if any]{.underline}. For example, the
law is silent as to whether this section authorizes procurement for
loaning weapon systems. 147 Nor does it provide the maximum duration of
any loan. Nonetheless, the DoD should leverage the seemingly broad
authority granted by Congress to procure equipment for the purpose of
loaning such equipment to its allies to improve interoperability and
bolster the defense capability of its allies in Eastern Europe.

c\. Training and Exercises

Finally, perhaps [the best way the DoD can maximize the operational
readiness of its NATO partners is through **extensive training and
exercises**]{.underline}. 148 Training of NATO members near Russia is
essential to ensure those members, such as the Baltic States and Poland,
can cope with hybrid warfare that may not trigger Article 5. 149
Moreover, frequent military exercises with U.S. forces can enhance those
armed forces\' capabilities. Wide-scale multinational exercises on
NATO\'s eastern flank would also serve a dual purpose of reassuring
allies and warning foes. 150 Recognizing the importance of multinational
training and exercises, Congress sought to provide broader authority for
commanders of combatant commands and service secretaries to authorize
payment of certain expenses for friendly foreign countries resulting
from participating in training and exercises with U.S. general forces.
151 This expands the previous authority, which was limited to payment of
only incremental expenses to developing countries when authorized by the
Secretary of Defense. This was only after a determination that \"the
participation by such country is necessary to the achievement of the
fundamental objectives of the exercise and that those objectives cannot
be achieved unless the United States provides the incremental expenses
incurred by such country.\" 152 The new authority requires only the
determination by the Secretary of Defense that support of the friendly
foreign force is in the national security interest of the United States
to do so, and expands the scope and type of payment for training and
exercise expenses. 153 It allows a commander of a combatant command to
authorize payment for expenses associated with training, exercises,
deployment to such events, incremental expenses, and small-scale
construction directly related to the effective accomplishment of such
events, with the prior approval of the Secretary of Defense. 154

Beyond the benefit of paying for expenses to attract participation by
other countries, [this authority also appears to permit foreign forces
to develop new capacity by allowing for training to improve the capacity
of foreign forces beyond minimal level necessary to achieve
**interoperability**]{.underline}, safety, or familiarization with U.S.
forces in preparing for combined military operations.\" 155 While the
new law states that the primary purpose of the training and exercises is
to train U.S. forces, 156 there is no limiting language, such as
restricting the training of foreign forces to only safety and
interoperability. Thus, [so long as U.S. forces are receiving the
benefit of the training and exercises, the participation by other
friendly forces and use of this authority for funding is
permitted.]{.underline} Granting the DoD this authority allows it to
better program more robust exercises and training focused on capacity
building of the Baltic States\' forces.

[Consistent with the intent of EDI and RAP, **EUCOM should use this
authority to the fullest extent practicable to integrate multinational
forces**]{.underline}, [particularly in command]{.underline} and
control, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, **[and cyber
defense]{.underline}**, [where **interoperability**]{.underline} is
[critical to defending against **Russian aggression.**]{.underline} 157
Moreover, this authority\'s provision for small-scale construction
permits to building necessary infrastructure within Eastern Europe that
would otherwise be challenging for approval. Provided the project does
not represent a foreign assistance program, structures built in support
of U.S. military personnel participating in overseas training and
exercises need not be temporary structures. 158 The explicit limitation
on such military construction is that no one project may exceed \$
750,000 in costs, 159 and the implicit limitation comes from the absence
of any authority for the maintenance of such construction projects after
the completion of the exercise. Nonetheless, this authority appears to
permit the United States to fund and build in a friendly foreign
country, and the beneficiary can then decide to keep and maintain the
project for its own future use. The resulting infrastructure will
provide training and exercise opportunities where there may have been
none absent this authority.

[Today's security environment demands that the]{.underline} Department
of Defense (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [employ a robust strategy and
assortment of capabilities across the entire range of military
operations and in support of America's national security interests. A
preponderance of these activities falls under the **umbrella of security
cooperation**]{.underline} (SC) in which few, if any, U.S. forces
participate directly in combat operations. As DOD continues to develop
the "four plus one" threat baseline described by the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Joint Force Development Directorate has taken
steps to better align joint doctrine with the National Military Strategy
as part of an approach that emphasizes the need for adaptive doctrine.1
Within this effort, the need to synergize U.S. capacity and capabilities
with those of its partners remains paramount.2

To this end, ongoing efforts to adapt the disparate entities and
authorities associated with SC into a unified strategy serve as an
important next step. In 2008, DOD published a directive that elevated
the requirement for DOD expertise for SC activities to the same level as
other "integral \[conventional\] DOD activities."3 To achieve parity,
the Joint Doctrine Development Community (JDDC) identified the need to
incorporate the topic of SC into the joint publication library as Joint
Publication (JP) 3-20, Security Cooperation. The approval of JP 3-20 is
a major step toward the joint force recognizing SC as a way to apply the
military instrument of national power in support of partner nations
(PNs) around the globe to achieve strategic objectives and to help shape
the operational environment for current and future operations. This
article outlines the continued adaptation of SC and the inextricable
doctrinal security force assistance (SFA) principles discussed in JP
3-20 that are applicable to the joint force.

[JP 3-20 defines security cooperation as "all DOD interactions with
foreign security establishments to build]{.underline} [security
relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests, develop
allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations]{.underline}, [and provide U.S. forces with
peacetime and contingency access to a partner nation."]{.underline}4
[These]{.underline} three categories, however, [only hint at the **true
breadth and complexity of activities**]{.underline} [that make up the
**universe of security cooperation**]{.underline}. [Some SC activities
are simple engagements between U.S. and PN defense
officials]{.underline}, [while others are complex and may include
multibillion-dollar arms negotiations brokered at the highest levels of
government through DOD]{.underline}-administered [and Department of
State--led]{.underline} security assistance (**[SA]{.underline}**)
[programs under U.S. Code Title 22]{.underline} authority. [These
examples bracket the more common theater security cooperation exercises
routinely conducted]{.underline} within each geographic combatant
command's area of responsibility. While the recent and formal
incorporation of SC into joint doctrine may appear new, the United
States has used various adaptations of SC to protect and advance its
vital interests abroad for decades.

Historical Overview

[In 1971, the Secretary of Defense established the]{.underline} Defense
Security Assistance Agency (**[DSAA]{.underline}**) to [direct,
administer, and supervise the execution of approved SA plans and
programs, such as military assistance, international military education
and training, and foreign military sales]{.underline}.5 [In]{.underline}
November 19[97, the Defense Reform Initiative transferred additional
responsibility for program management of humanitarian assistance and
demining, armaments cooperation, export loan guarantees, and foreign
comparative testing functions, along with their associated personnel and
resources, to DSAA]{.underline}. [In October 1998, SC officially entered
the DOD lexicon, accommodating the scope of these additional functions
beyond DSAA's traditional SA missions. This expansion of mission
necessitated a name change, hence DSAA's redesignation as the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency]{.underline}.6 T[his consolidation of
similar programs from five dissonant agencies into one stand-alone
entity reflected efforts to improve efficiency]{.underline} and reduce
administrative redundancy.

However, **[SC]{.underline}** [did not appear in mainstream joint
doctrine until manifested in a 2004 revision]{.underline} of JP 3-07.1,
Joint Tactics, Techniques and Procedures for Foreign Internal Defense
(FID). As the JDDC struggled to refine doctrinal treatment of SC,
amended versions of then--JP 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of
Military and Associated Terms, revealed continuing efforts to clarify
myriad SC activities. Though not retained in the current JP 1-02, the
meaning behind the original definition of SC activity prevails:

[Military activity that involves other nations and is intended to shape
the operational environment in peacetime. Activities include programs
and exercises that the U.S. military conducts with other nations to
improve mutual understanding and improve interoperability with treaty
partners]{.underline}. They are designed to support a combatant
commander's theater strategy as articulated in the theater security
cooperation plan.7

[Today, SC more broadly supports the combatant command's entire theater
campaign plan.]{.underline}

[Subsequent developments in SC further expanded its scope by **adding
authorities from U.S. Code Title 10** for programs such as multinational
exercises---a move designed to gain synergy by coordinating peacetime
Title 10 activities with Title 22 activities]{.underline}. Amended in
the reformative aftermath of the Vietnam War, these Title 22 programs
specifically precluded the United States from employing its forces in
harm's way using SA funds. [This contributed to a **misunderstanding**
of both SA and SC as **exclusively peacetime** activities]{.underline}.
[This inaccurate conclusion led to confusion regarding when and how SA
and SC authorities and programs could and should be used.]{.underline}
Originally designed to limit American participation in conflict, modern
versions of the vintage U.S. Lend-Lease program, as the precursor to
what we now know as SA, continue to evolve, but still contribute to the
development of our foreign partners' security force capacities and
capabilities across the entire range of military operations.

The term [security force assistance entered the DOD lexicon to provide
greater depth to the SC pillar of developing PN
capabilities.]{.underline} SFA was coined (after early efforts in Iraq
failed to create a viable security force) to provide U.S. forces with
applicable means for developing the capacity and capabilities of PN
forces and their supporting institutions. The training of foreign
security forces is a primary role of U.S. special operations forces.
However, special operations forces were stretched to their limits
conducting counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations throughout
the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of operation and elsewhere. In
response, significant numbers of conventional forces were indoctrinated
to conduct SFA activities and further doctrine was developed. The
initial incorporation of SFA into the 2010 replacement for JP 3-07.1,
known after as JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense, defined it as DOD
"activities that contribute to unified action by the U.S. Government to
support the development of the capacity and capability of foreign
security forces and their supporting institutions." Essential to SC,
this streamlined definition established the enduring relevance of SFA,
and subsequently SC, in all circumstances where U.S. military forces
must develop foreign security force (FSF) capabilities.

SC and SFA in the Current and Future Operating Environment

[While SC and SFA remain important to steady-state operations, they are
equally valuable in **support of major combat operations**]{.underline}
because they can facilitate operational access and improved military
relations and interoperability. **[Whether considering their preemptive
use]{.underline}** [to shape the operational environment, provide
trained and ready forces to participate in operations, or
create]{.underline} a postconflict application to lay the foundations
for lasting peace and regional stability, SC and SFA present
irreplaceable mechanisms for achieving conditions conducive to U.S.
national interests.

### SC\-\--AT: Excludes NATO\-\--2AC

#### Security coop entails all DOD interactions with foreign security establishments, including NATO 

**Davids '19** \[Douglas; December; Center for Army Lessons Learned;
News from the Front, "The Front of Military Education and Security
Cooperation: Defense Security Cooperation University,"
https://usacac.army.mil/sites/default/files/publications/17981.pdf\]

[Security cooperation is defined as \"**all Department of
Defense**]{.underline} (DOD) i**[nteractions with foreign security
establishments to build security relationships that promote specific
U.S. security interests]{.underline}**, [**develop allied and
partner-nation military** and security **capabilities** for self-defense
and **multinational operations**]{.underline}, and provide U.S. forces
with peacetime and contingency access to allied and partner nations.\"1
[Security cooperation is a multifaceted effort that requires more than
just planning]{.underline} to develop the skills of a foreign security
force. In 2017, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) created
the DOD Security Cooperation Workforce Development Program (SCWDP) to
develop and manage supporting security programs, improve the quality of
the security cooperation workforce, and ensure personnel have the
appropriate level of expertise and experience to perform their
missions.2

The 2017 NDAA directed the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to
manage the SCWDP\'s training and education standards, as well as
identify and define training and certification requirements.
Specifically, DSCA was required to \"establish and maintain a school to
train, educate, and certify the security cooperation workforce \... .\"
To meet this obligation, DSCA established the Defense Security
Cooperation University (DSCU) in September 2019, to educate and certify
20,000 U.S. government employees\' security cooperation and standardize
their training.

Purpose

This article provides a brief description of the threat environment
security cooperation must work within, an overview of the new DSCU, a
discussion of the legal requirements emplaced on the DSCU, and an
example course from DSCU and how this course meets the legal
requirements.

The Threat and Environment

The threats the U.S. faces worldwide are vast and at times,
overwhelming. They include both irregular and major power threats. Prior
to 11 September 2001, irregular threats such as terrorist activities,
piracy, trafficking of illegal drugs and illegal arms, and human
smuggling already endangered U.S. and international security. However,
today these entities are major nonstate actors that can threaten free
societies across entire regions and even present transcontinental
threats. Irregular forces do not have borders, uniforms, or rules, and
will take advantage of any weakness found in the global system. The 2018
National Military Strategy states that \"transnational threat groups,
from jihadist terrorists to transnational criminal organizations, are
actively trying to harm Americans.\"3 However, these numerous irregular
threats are too vast for the U.S. to handle alone and require the help
of allies and partners.

The reemergence of a great power competition with Russia and China has
also added to the need for effective security cooperation, and, as
stated in the 2018 National Military Strategy, \"represents the most
difficult challenges facing the Joint Force.\"4

The hard reality is that major powers like Russia and China are very
much involved in the effort to gain greater influence around the world
while diminishing the U.S.\'s position. The 2017 National Security
Strategy states that \"China and Russia challenge American power,
influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and
prosperity.\"5 Threats like the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be taken
lightly either, and the situation with North Korea, despite peace talks,
is still unpredictable. Both are \"determined to destabilize regions,
threaten Americans and our allies, and brutalize their own people.\"6
Major powers are trying to secure alliances, minerals, or bases of
support with neutral territories in order to diminish U.S. influence in
the region. Without robust security cooperation efforts to unify U.S.
efforts with those of its allies and partners, adversaries could gain a
position of relative advantage.

\" \... by strengthening the militaries of our allies and partners, you
actually strengthen your own security.\"

[Security cooperation builds the capacity of foreign security forces to
meet today\'s challenges, supporting and advancing the interests of the
U.S. and partner nations]{.underline}. Aside from long-term allies and
cohorts, [the U.S. has new partners in the global security system, many
of which need assistance]{.underline}. [Not only is Eastern Europe no
longer a satellite of the old Soviet Union]{.underline} power, [but many
of its nations are now **members of**]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**). This has tipped the
balance of power away from Russia. Russia has executed actions, such as
in Ukraine and the Black Sea, to regain its position of power. In Asia,
the U.S. has incorporated former adversaries, such as Vietnam, as part
of the U.S.\'s security cooperation efforts to keep China\'s aggressive
expansion at bay. Security cooperation is a growing industry in the
strategic efforts of the U.S., and this is not likely to change in the
near future. Security cooperation is a necessary activity that helps the
U.S. respond to irregular and conventional threats.

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 The OSD SCG directs
that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with other elements of
national power...in order to achieve national security, defense, and
foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation, while helpful, obscures
two key facts. First, Security Cooperation includes activities that by
their very nature involve the simultaneous application of more than one
element of national power. [Security Cooperation]{.underline} at a
minimum [**requires** the combination of diplomatic relations, military
assistance, military-to-military contacts, and public
diplomacy]{.underline}. In other words, Security Cooperation is itself
an application of at least three of the classic elements of national
power.36 Second, [DOD is **not the only entity** in the USG that
interacts with foreign governments to achieve]{.underline} the **[stated
objectives]{.underline}**: relationships, capabilities, information and
intelligence, and access. [The Department of State, the Intelligence
Community, **and**]{.underline} to a lesser extent, [other departments
and agencies, conduct activities aimed at]{.underline} the
accomplishment of [these objectives]{.underline}, broadly understood.
[There is]{.underline}, however, **[no common USG, or interagency,
definition]{.underline}** or concept [of Security
Cooperation]{.underline}.37 We will return to this issue in the final
section of this paper. For the purposes of the present discussion, [this
paper offers the]{.underline} following working [**definition** of
Security Cooperation:]{.underline}

Footnote 37.

37 [**Even within** DOD there are programs]{.underline}, notably
directed against WMD proliferation, [that are **not covered** under the
rubric of Security Cooperation]{.underline}. See the discussion of the
WMD Proliferation Prevention Initiative, below.

Footnote 37 ends. The article continues.

> [Security Cooperation refers to **all USG assistance** provided to
> **foreign law enforcement**, **security**, and **defense
> establishments** in support of national defense, security, and foreign
> policy objectives]{.underline}.38

Footnote 38.

38 [The **application** of]{.underline} the [Security
Cooperation]{.underline} paradigm [to the **entire USG** requires a
**precise definition of security**. Defined **too broadly**, Security
Cooperation would **simply** be a **surrogate** for foreign policy.
**Limiting** the objectives to specific **enumerated defense and
security objectives and assistance** to foreign establishments playing a
role in national security or defense is necessary to **circumscribe**
the issue adequately]{.underline}.

Footnote 38 ends. The article continues.

[This **expanded definition** of Security Cooperation]{.underline} will
[help us to see how the USG may **leverage** its programs]{.underline}
and activities to fight terrorism and related non-state threats.

The role of Security Cooperation in countering non-state threats is
clearly reflected in U.S. strategy. The NSS states that the U.S. will
cooperate with nations to counter terrorism and WMD proliferation,
assisting those that are willing but unable, and persuading those that
are able but not willing.39 The National Military Strategy (NMS)
develops the concept of forward defense, or "Countering Threats Close to
Their Source."40 This is the recognition that the United States' first
line of defense is abroad, and that it is necessary to "patrol strategic
approaches" and extend U.S. defensive capabilities beyond our borders to
create an active "defense in depth."41 In this context, Security
Cooperation is best understood as a set of tools that can shape the
strategic battlespace by creating the conditions necessary to accomplish
U.S. security and defense objectives.42 As the NMS's focus on forward
defense indicates, these activities are by their nature anticipatory,
preparatory, and defensive.43 They are best used as part of a long-term
comprehensive strategy to put in place the relationships, capabilities,
information and intelligence, and access to facilitate future offensive
and defensive actions to counter non-state, as well as more traditional,
threats.

Security Cooperation Goals

Before turning to a detailed discussion of the contribution that
Security Cooperation can make to fighting non-state threats,
[let's]{.underline} briefly [examine the **four main goals** of security
cooperation in that context]{.underline}.

[Relationships]{.underline}

Fighting strategic criminals will require the cooperation of a variety
of governments, including those outside our established alliance
relationships. We are not capable of compelling the kind of "willing and
competent cooperation" that we need.44 Security cooperation provides
powerful tools to persuade foreign governments to work with the U.S. in
support of common objectives. Senior U.S. commanders, notably current
and former Geographic Combatant Commanders, regularly stress the
critical contribution that Security Cooperation activities make to
building the kinds of relationships with foreign leaders that set the
stage for successful U.S. operations. The example most often cited is
the role that US Central Command (CENTCOM) Security Cooperation
activities played in persuading Central Asian leaders, notably in
Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, to support U.S. military operations in
Afghanistan by granting access to bases and overflight rights.45 In
addition to granting access, good relationships aid in building a common
threat perception, which is a necessary precondition for any substantial
cooperation. Relationships with foreign defense leaders can also provide
the U.S. with influence over the policy direction of key partner states,
including efforts at defense reform and the shape of force structure
changes. Finally, good relationships make it more likely that foreign
governments will share information with the U.S., including, in the
extreme case, early warning of potential attack.46

[Intelligence and Information Sharing]{.underline}

Relationships built on trust and mutual interests are also necessary to
obtain cooperation from foreign governments in the area of Intelligence
and Information. It is useful to separate the distinct, but related,
issues of Intelligence Sharing and Intelligence Security Cooperation.
Intelligence Sharing is a critical element in the fight against
non-state threats, or strategic crime. By its nature, however, such
sharing involves sensitive sources, methods and arrangements, normally
in the context of a bilateral relationship. Its sensitivity requires
delicate handling in highly restrictive channels. Intelligence sharing,
in practice, falls outside the scope of Security Cooperation.
Intelligence Security Cooperation, on the other hand, involves the
development of interoperable and cooperative intelligence systems and
processes designed to enhance the ability of one partner to work with
one or several other partners. The core activities in Intelligence
Security Cooperation are analytical and expertise exchanges,
familiarization, training, and traditional Security Assistance. Both
Intelligence Sharing and Intelligence Security Cooperation are mutually
supporting. It is clear that the quality and reliability of intelligence
we get from our partners depends on the competence, capability,
professionalism, and trustworthiness of their national intelligence
services and how compatible their operations are with ours. Intelligence
Security Cooperation provides the tools to develop long-range
relationships with foreign partners to improve both the quality of the
intelligence we share and our ability to work together.

[Access]{.underline}

The National Defense Strategy stresses the requirement to secure
strategic access and retain global freedom of action for U.S. forces.47
This includes obtaining permanent and deployment basing and overflight.
Security Cooperation directly supports access by developing
relationships with foreign partners based on trust and mutual interests.
Senior officer and other official visits contribute to this by
demonstrating U.S. commitment to a defense relationship and staying
abreast of host nation priorities, concerns, and requirements. Some
Security Cooperation activities directly support access by improving
host nation infrastructure, notably airbases, ports, and troop
facilities, to support U.S. forces during operational and training
deployments. Other activities improve host nation capabilities through
training, equipping, and exercises. The NMS recognizes that access has
an informational dimension that goes beyond the purely physical access
to a partner's territory, facilities or airspace:

"...theater security activities with multinational partners provide
access to information and intelligence critical to anticipating and
understanding new threats."48

This insight is important in determining the contribution Security
Cooperation can make to countering non-state threats. While DOD and the
military services remain understandably focused on the physical
dimension of access and its support to current and future operations,
the fight against strategic criminals requires that we pay greater
attention to securing strategic access to information and information
networks controlled by our partners, allies, and adversaries. In some
cases "virtual access" to databases, data flows, raw and finished
intelligence, sensor data, and other forms of information may be more
critical to the success of military operations than the ability to
access an airfield, port or overflight corridor. Security Cooperation
tools can also support the attainment of this non-traditional form of
access.

### SC\-\--AT: Only DOD\-\--1AR

#### The DOD definition is bad.

**Lenze '17** \[Major Anthony Lenze; 2017; Judge Advocate in the United
States Army; Military Law Review, "Traditional Combatant Commander
Activities: Acknowledging and Analyzing Combatant Commanders\' Authority
to Interact with Foreign Militaries," vol. 225\]

Security cooperation is now a term that encompasses "any program,
activity (including an exercise), or interaction of the \[DoD\] with the
security establishment of a foreign country to achieve a \[strategic\]
purpose \... \[.\]"85 The DoD assigns such strategic importance to
security cooperation that, with the help of Congress, it created the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to direct and guide the
execution of all DoD security cooperation programs.86 The DSCA helps
administer security cooperation, now a multi-billion dollar industry
within the annual Defense appropriation.87 [With **all the money** and
**strategic brainpower** pouring into **security cooperation**,
newcomers]{.underline} to the field [may presume **fully-vetted**,
**standardized terms and definitions**. **However**, this could not be
**further**]{.underline} \*656 **[from reality]{.underline}**.

Members of [the DoD **frequently mischaracterize** security cooperation
or **outright disagree** with]{.underline} respect to [its **doctrinal
definition**]{.underline}.88 For example, the 2010 National Security
Strategy (NSS) used the term security cooperation to include rebuilding
damaged infrastructure and establishing conditions necessary to end
military operations in Afghanistan.89 With the exception of combat
operations, it would seem that almost any military action could fit
under the 2010 NSS\'s version of security cooperation.90 Nevertheless,
if security cooperation is in fact an evolving term in the DoD, making
sense of the authorities under which the military executes security
cooperation events is even more troublesome.91 This is especially true
when authorities are based upon a set of specific terms. Hence, with
[doctrine **lagging behind**]{.underline} and accompanied by [undefined
terminology, **no authority**]{.underline} in the realm of security
cooperation [is **more ambiguous**]{.underline} than the authority for
military-to-military contacts.92 With ambiguity surrounding
military-to-military contacts, planners and lawyers should defer to
commanders to decide the best way to employ these strategic interaction
events. The fate of 10 U.S.C. §168 and its ultimate repeal is
illustrative of this point.

#### The 2NC cited the definition [FROM]{.underline} the Department of Defense, which doesn't define the word [broadly]{.underline}.

Lack of Doctrine

Part III of [this paper offered a **definition** of Security Cooperation
that could be common to the **entire USG**, **not just** the Department
of Defense. The USG interagency has **no such common definition**
because it lacks a **common conceptual understanding**]{.underline} of
how to translate higher level strategic guidance into specific programs
designed to accomplish strategic objectives.

[The Department of Defense]{.underline}, despite its size, its
diversity, and the scope of its Security Cooperation activities,
[has]{.underline} such [a common understanding. DOD's process is **not
without its flaws**]{.underline}.113 During the late 1990s and the early
21st century, however, the department has successfully established a
rational set of procedures for translating the strategic guidance in the
National Security, Military, and, now, Defense Strategies, into specific
programs executed by the military commands, services, and defense
agencies.114 This process promotes discipline by forcing subordinate
organizations to demonstrate that their Security Cooperation activities
directly support specific objectives in the higher-level strategies.
Efforts are under way to discipline the process further by establishing
an assessment mechanism to provide feedback on the effectiveness of
programs and activities.115 One reason for the success of the DOD
program is OSD's publication of periodic Security Cooperation Guidance.
This document, in addition to providing authority for subordinate
organizations' Security Cooperation activities (see more below), serves
the purpose of an informal doctrine, stipulating not only the "what,"
but the "how" and the "why" of Security Cooperation.116

Footnote 113.

coordinate and inadequate integration [among DOD managed
programs]{.underline}. Amy Chou, OSD Strategy Office, interview by the
author, 14 Jan 05.

Footnote 113 ends. The article continues.

In order for the USG interagency to plan and execute Security
Cooperation programs and activities in an integrated and synergistic
manner, a doctrine, or common conceptual framework, for Security
Cooperation is necessary. Such a doctrine would have to define what
Security Cooperation is, and, what it is not.117 It would have to define
precisely which departmental and agency programs qualify as Security
Cooperation and outline a procedure for combined interagency planning,
programming, and execution. Armed with such a common conceptual
framework, executive branch officials and program managers will be
better equipped to engage in integrated planning and program execution.
True success in this effort, however, will depend on the resolution of
the other problems of authority, funding, and process and organization.

Footnote 117.

117 As has been suggested here, [activities to improve **foreign
partners' security capabilities** conducted by **any department or
agency** would qualify as **Security Cooperation**. In contrast,
**general foreign development assistance**, although **related** to
security and part of **broader U.S. foreign policy**, would]{.underline}
probably [not. Even **within** DOD, this is **not totally clear**.
Officials]{.underline} in OSD's Counter-proliferation Policy office
[refused to admit]{.underline} that [activities]{.underline} intended
[to improve]{.underline} the maritime [security]{.underline}
capabilities [of Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan]{.underline} in support of
counter-proliferation [would be **included** under the definition of
Security Cooperation and **declined** to integrate their
program]{.underline} formally [with]{.underline} other [DOD]{.underline}
Security Cooperation [efforts]{.underline}.

Footnote 117 ends. The article continues.

Unclear Authority

[The USG lacks a **clear authoritative basis** for]{.underline} guidance
of [Security Cooperation]{.underline} programs and activities. [This is
rooted in]{.underline} the lack of overall strategic planning in the USG
and [the **ad hoc and department-specific nature**]{.underline} of the
planning that does occur. 118 There is no equivalent of the OSD Security
Cooperation Guidance for the interagency to guide the programmatic
activities of executive branch departments and agencies. The strategy
documents, such as the NSS or National Strategy for Combating Terrorism,
provide overall strategic intent, goals, and objectives, and suggest
broad means for accomplishing them. The strategies successfully link the
various non-state threats by cross-referencing them and demonstrating
the interconnected nature of terrorism, WMD proliferation, narcotics
trafficking, and transnational organized crime. This high-level
strategic guidance does not result in integrated strategies, however,
because the goals and objectives are too broad to drive implementation
at the program level and because there is no requirement for departments
and agencies to develop integrated plans.

#### DOD has a [history]{.underline} of security cooperation, but "security cooperation" as an [overarching term]{.underline} depends on its content.

contacts and exchanges, security assistance, medical and engineering
team engagements, cooperative development, acquisition and technical
interchanges, and scientific and technology collaboration. The
Department of [Defense]{.underline} (DoD) [has a long history of
conducting SC activities with partner countries]{.underline} for a
variety of purposes, including building partner capacity (BPC), which is
a primary focus of this report.

#### Cooperation is coordinated action of two or more States under a legal regime

Edward McWhinney observes that [[as a **term of art**]{.mark} **of
international law**, '[cooperation']{.mark} emerged after World War
II]{.underline}.2 No treaty or international decision defines the notion
or the term 'cooperation', though. Wolfrum [**[defines]{.mark}**
cooperation as '[the voluntary coordinated action of two or more
States]{.mark}]{.underline} which takes place [[under a]{.mark} **[legal
regime]{.mark}**]{.underline} and serves a specific objective' and to
'this extent marks the effort of States to accomplish an object by joint
action, where the activity of a single State cannot achieve the same
result' or mutual benefit.3 What follows is that the duty to cooperate
would lead to an obligation to enter into such an action to achieve a
specific goal. In terms of substance, cooperation per se has no
independent content;4 it must be tied to a specific area to acquire a
specific meaning.

#### "With" indicates [who]{.underline} the cooperation is with.

in this context, all correspondence either from Garrett to Ms. Spoo

In its holding, the Viramontes court announced that the holding (or
restraining) was unlawful because it was "for" the purpose of
abandonment. This shift grammatically conflates the legality of the
holding with the legality of the proscribed purpose. However, the
Arizona kidnapping statute, like the South Dakota kidnapping statute,
uses the preposition "with." [**Prepositions**, though **often short
words**, are **very powerful**. Take **for example** the following: "My
mother is **at** the hospital" and "My mother is **in**]{.underline}
[the hospital.]{.underline}" The shift in language by the court above
was an even larger shift than the preceding example. Both words have
multiple definitions, each dependent upon context. The Merriam-Webster
dictionary provides several distinct uses of both "with" and "for."
[Concerning "with" the dictionary has]{.underline}, in part, [this to

(http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/with) This is the same use of
"with" that both the Arizona and South Dakota kidnapping statutes use.

proscribed purpose. Concerning "for" the dictionary has, in part, this
to say: "'for' 1

The second and third alternatives also include [the preposition
"with."]{.underline} In this instance, [the preposition **modifies** a
noun and expresses a relationship. "With" **indicates
accompaniment**]{.underline}. See WEBSTER\'S 2626. Therefore, in order
to receive a 100% schedular rating based on the second alternative, a
veteran must show that cardiac involvement is accompanied by congestive
heart failure. To receive a 100% schedular rating based on the third
alternative, the alternative at issue in Ms. Smith\'s case, she must
demonstrate that she has progressive pulmonary disease, and that the
disease is accompanied by fever, night sweats, and weight loss despite
treatment.

The panel opinion suggests that the text of the Commerce Clause
indicates that power under the Foreign Commerce Clause exceeds that
under the Interstate Commerce Clause. See Maj. Op. at 1201--02. [It
notes]{.underline} that [the Clause speaks of commerce "with foreign
Nations" but "among the several States." **But** the **difference** in
prepositions indicates the opposite. If the Clause permitted regulation
of commerce "**among** foreign nations"]{.underline}---so that the two
clauses used the same preposition---[then Congress would be empowered to
regulate commerce **among** France, England, and Italy, **even if** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were **not** involved at
all]{.underline}. Thus, [use of the preposition with instead of the
preposition among **obviously limits** the]{.underline} extent of the
Foreign Commerce [Clause]{.underline}. See Colangelo supra at 970--71
(explaining the difference between the uses of the two prepositions in
the Commerce Clause).7

### With\-\--Involves NATO\-\--2AC

#### 'With' requires [involving NATO]{.underline} in the [creation of the plan]{.underline}

**Colangelo '10** \[Anthony; September; Assistant Professor of Law, SMU
Dedman School of Law; "ARTICLE: THE FOREIGN COMMERCE CLAUSE," Virginia
Law Review, 96 Va. L. Rev. 949\]

It was precisely this general, national regulatory power that saved
application of the federal Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\") to
homegrown medical-use marijuana in the Court\'s 2005 decision Gonzales
v. Raich, 128 and that has constitutionally justified numerous federal
laws designed to prevent various races to the bottom \"among\" the
states. 129 The Foreign Commerce Clause contains no equivalent,
globally-encompassing authority to regulate \"among\" foreign nations,
only the power to regulate commerce \"with\" them. 130 The difference
between the power to regulate among members of the domestic system, but
only with members of the international system, suggests that Congress
has no more power to regulate inside foreign nations than it has inside
the several states.131 Indeed, as Section B explains in more depth - and
\[\*974\] contrary to leading lower-court decisions - this textual
difference actually deprives Congress of some of the more sweeping
regulatory powers abroad that it enjoys at home.132 To preview the
argument, Congress cannot independently create comprehensive global
regulatory schemes over international markets or prevent races to the
bottom among the world\'s nations the same way it can create
comprehensive national regulatory schemes over domestic markets and
prevent races to the bottom among the states. Because Congress lacks
primary authority to create such global schemes, it cannot claim a
derivative authority under the Necessary and Proper Clause to reach
local foreign conduct that threatens to undercut those schemes the same
way it can reach local intrastate conduct to \[\*975\] effectuate
regulation \"among the several States.\"133 Rather, [[for Congress to
regulate]{.mark} local [foreign conduct]{.mark} pursuant to a
comprehensive international regulatory scheme, [that scheme must be
created \"**with foreign Nations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"134 In this
sense, [[the word \"with\" contemplates]{.underline}]{.mark} agreement
or [[cooperation with foreign nations **in establishing the
scheme**]{.underline}]{.mark}, without which Congress cannot extend U.S.
law over local foreign conduct to effectuate that scheme.

Saying this upsets many of my Georgian and Ukrainian friends, but there

DEFINITION

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.underline}**) [is an
alliance of 30 countries that border the North Atlantic Ocean. The
Alliance includes the United States, most European Union members, the
United Kingdom, Canada, and Turkey.]{.underline}

[Definition of NATO]{.underline}

[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a national security alliance
among the U.S., Canada, and their European allies. It was formed in the
wake of World War II to keep the peace and encourage political and
economic cooperation]{.underline} on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.1

Acronym: NATO

While [NATO is primarily a national security alliance]{.underline}, it
does include an Economics Committee that seeks to provide a forum to
discuss economics among members and to monitor economies within and
outside of the Alliance. More broadly, NATO has been a stabilizing
influence in Europe and North America, allowing the economies of its
members to develop and flourish.2

Member Countries

[NATO\'s 30 members are Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, the
Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the
U.S]{.underline}.3

Each member designates an ambassador to NATO as well as officials to
serve on NATO committees and discuss NATO business. These designees
could include a country's president, prime minister, foreign affairs
minister, or head of a defense department.

On December 1, 2015, NATO announced its first expansion since 2009,
offering membership to Montenegro. Russia responded by calling the move
a strategic threat to its national security. Russia is worried by the
number of Balkan countries along its border that have joined NATO.

How Does NATO Work?

[NATO\'s mission is to protect the freedom of its members and the
stability of their regions.]{.underline} [Its targets include weapons of
mass destruction, terrorism, and cyber-attacks.]{.underline}

[One key aspect of NATO is Article 5, which states that \"an armed
attack against one Ally is considered an attack against all
Allies.\"]{.underline}4 In other words, an attack one NATO nation will
cause all NATO nations to retaliate.

NATO has invoked Article 5 just once in its history, following the 9/11
terrorist attacks on the U.S.

[NATO\'s protection does not extend to members\' civil wars or internal
coups]{.underline}. During a 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, for example,
NATO did not intervene on either side of the conflict.5 As a NATO
member, Turkey would receive its allies\' support in the case of an
attack, but not in case of a coup.

#### NATO is fundamentally a military alliance, organized around mutual defense and military consultation

Also known as the "Rio Treaty," this [1947

a total of [18 nations, the newest being the Bahamas]{.underline} which
became a signatory in 1982. The pact stipulates that an attack against

A year after Donald Trump's election to the presidency, the furor around
his approach to transatlantic security has predictably calmed. Part of
the reason is saturation. Like antibiotics, provocation of one's allies
loses its potency when used excessively. Part of the reason is that the
president has found a more willing and compelling foil, in the form of
Kim Jong Un, than those buttoned-up European leaders he accuses of
freeloading. Certainly, part of the reason includes the administration's
Russia-related scandals and Robert Mueller's investigation. The
president's hostility toward NATO has always felt more like a sop to
Moscow than a matter of principle and thus not a good look with
indictments swirling.

But much of it has to do with the nature of the alliance itself.
**[NATO's bread and butter is cooperation on]{.underline}** activities
like **[planning]{.underline}**, **[doctrine]{.underline}**,
**[interoperability, and logistics]{.underline}** --- things which are
uninteresting to the general public discourse and largely resistant to
the rhetorical or policy whims of even the president of the United
States. [Cooperation in these areas]{.underline}, while camouflaged to
all but the most intense NATO watchers, [can **move the needle** to the
benefit of the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [in
concrete and practical ways]{.underline}. As Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis heads to Brussels for his third meeting of NATO defense ministers
in ten months, it is precisely to ensure such work continues.

Perception Is Not Policy

If it is fair to stipulate, without a hint of irony or partisanship,
that the president makes decisions based on a rather shallow
understanding of the pertinent facts, then his initial posture towards
NATO and Russia makes sense. In fact, as someone who watched an episode
or two of The Apprentice, Trump's embrace of Russia was predictable.
Equipped with a disposition that necessarily invites competition between
opposing factions, nerdy NATO with its committees and communiques never
had a chance against a tiger-hunting former KGB agent who invades
countries with impunity and without a shirt. Putin is ready-made
television.

Yet, as others have ably pointed out, viewed through the lens of genuine
policy, Trump's complaints about European security and its key players
have some basis in fact. And while it is tempting for policy
professionals like me to seek some novel, far-reaching meaning from the
impolitic veneer of his tweets and applause lines, the most remarkable
thing about Trump's censure of NATO is how quotidian it is as a matter
of policy. Questions about NATO's obsolescence date from at least the
1960s and have been a proverbial albatross for the alliance since the
end of the Cold War. That the United States is over-invested in NATO
relative to the Europeans and Canada is an acknowledged fact by nearly
everyone working transatlantic issues. And while I grimaced at the
graceless pluck of invoicing Angela Merkel for Germany's pedestrian
defense spending, if true, it was a gambit rooted in cause.

Even in tone, Trump's complaints alternately echo Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld's grouchy demonization of "Old Europe" in 2003 and Secretary
Robert Gates' headmasterly admonition of European defense spending in
2011. Similarly, Trump's flattery of Putin shares policy fingerprints
with both President George W. Bush's plumbing of the Russian leader's
soul and President Barack Obama's unfulfilling reset, even if the "Pale
Moth's" growing rap sheet since those halcyon times makes the recent
spectacle hard to stomach.

What is unique about the Trump era is the juxtaposition of his views on
the allies and Russia. The natural correlation is something akin to the
Cold War and Obama's second term: The United States is harmonious with
NATO and frosty with Moscow. Disagreements with France and Germany about
the 2003 invasion of Iraq occasioned another possibility whereby the
United States is at cross-purposes with both sides. Obama's first term
was characterized by a Medvedev-inspired bonhomie with Moscow that was
palatable as long as relations with the allies were equally durable.
Trump has introduced the final option: threatening estrangement with
traditional allies while currying favor with a Russia clearly hostile to
U.S. interests. It is this dynamic, among others, that is most
responsible for the disconsolation of America's foreign policy elite.

Yet this unusual state of affairs is more histrionics than a deliberate
policy course correction. Even holding out the quixotic possibility that
Putin is willing and able to support some of Trump's foreign policy
goals (or, heaven forbid, electoral aspirations), there is no reason
this should come at the expense of cordial relations with the Europeans.
Unless, the logic goes, that is the price of Russia's help, or more
sinisterly, that Putin can otherwise manipulate Trump's actions. The
former requires malice aforethought inconsistent with most evidence
about how the president operates. The chances of the latter, however
implausible, are non-zero, and should Mueller find hard evidence to
suggest anything of the sort, we would find ourselves in a scandal so
serious as to make these matters quaint. In any case, the Congress, a
substantial portion of American public, and Trump's post-Flynn national
security officials have all resisted any quid pro quo with Moscow that
undercuts our allies. Which leads me to the conclusion that Trump's
enigmatic stance toward NATO and Russia is unlikely to change
unqualified American support for the alliance, even when his public
actions suggest otherwise. That Mattis and Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson have attended regular ministerial meetings, that NATO's
secretary general has visited the White House, and that Trump himself
has shuffled off to Brussels like his predecessors before him lends
credence to the theory that practical cooperation with the alliance
continues apace --- in ways often directly in conflict with Russian
interests.

Vapid, Vexing, Valuable

As a young Pentagon staffer, I was seconded to Brussels for a few months
in 2003 to work at the U.S. Mission to NATO. Naturally excited and
looking to make a positive impression, I rushed to backbench a NATO
committee meeting at the first opportunity. The topic, I vaguely recall,
was related to NATO capability development. I remember the imposing
conference room, the translation booths, the flags, and the bevy of
well-tailored colleagues from around Europe. I can still conjure the
anxious pride of sitting behind the placard stamped "United States" for
the first time. This was a dream. About 20 minutes later, it literally
became one. I had to repeatedly stab myself in the leg with a pen in
order to prod my jet-lagged body into consciousness. I could not have
imagined, until that moment, how detailed and dull the daily discourse
of NATO often is. And lest you are unconvinced by this reminiscence, I
highlight a former secretary of defense's habit of doing crossword
puzzles during NATO meetings or the Weekend at Bernie's jokes, prominent
among senior Obama officials in the Pentagon intended as a metaphor for
an alliance seen as moribund.

Moreover, NATO, like any large institution (hello Pentagon!), is raft
with dysfunction and internal contradictions. My particular hobby horse
is NATO's requirement for defense spending. Not that, infamously, only a
handful of members will ever meet the 2 percent of GDP target, but that
in spite of this obvious reality, NATO continues to promote the 2
percent goal as one of its core principles. In high school, I worked
summers at a drugstore where the staff would take turns getting lunch
for the group. One weekend, I arrived at the chosen spot, order in hand,
to be told that because of a delivery issue, the establishment was not
serving beef. Incredulous, I proclaimed, "but you're Burger King." I
likewise imagine a generation of earnest transatlantic scholars staring
at their textbooks, perplexed and mumbling, "but you're the 2 percent
people." To brand your organization with a characteristic that it will
never realize takes a chutzpah that Trump can appreciate, but is
nonetheless marketing malpractice of the first order. Compounding this
folly, Greece, whose military is antiquated, bloated, and oriented
toward conflict with another NATO ally, is championed alongside the
formidable militaries of the United States and the United Kingdom
because it meets the 2 percent threshold. NATO crediting Greece for its
military spending is tantamount to House Stark thanking House Frey for
hosting the Red Wedding. There are better ideas out there.

Nevertheless, I come here to praise NATO, not to bury it. I detail the
aforementioned grievances to assure anyone reading this that those of us
experienced in the alliance's mysterious arts are not ignorant of its
problems. Much of our work, over many years, has been dedicated to
fixing or mitigating them. And that same experience allows us to
appreciate the benefits that NATO membership accrues to the United
States. The cynical nature of our times and politics makes it easy to
criticize an organization like NATO, whose day-to-day work does not
translate readily to the masses. Even so, to have well-founded
frustrations with an elaborate and esoteric bureaucracy is one thing. To
conclude such an organization is unworthy of American participation or
investment is another. Such a posture is at best impetuous and at worst
antithetical to the cause of "America First" that NATO naysayers are
intent on restoring.

At its core, [NATO is a culture of **intensive**, **banal
cooperation**]{.underline}. It is a swanky headquarters building with
Euro-looking conference rooms and passable coffee where mundane meeting
after mundane meeting takes place on logistics, standardization, and
capability development. It is command centers and watch floors and
training areas where alliance militaries practice the monotonous
regimens so critical to the science of arms. [It is the Alliance Command
Transformation]{.underline} --- A.K.A. the really boring part of NATO
--- **[where the agonizing particulars of interoperability and doctrine
are worked out]{.underline}**. [It is the operational realization of the
inane political aspiration to cram soldiers from **14 different nations
into a single brigade.**]{.underline} It is a collection of customs and
habits that dictate how decisions will be made when the balloon goes up.
It prescribes where to meet and the rules for discussion. **[It ensures
that you can trust the colleague next to you]{.underline}** because
you've worked with her in such a setting a hundred times before. [It
structures discourse and operations such that, by ritualizing behaviors
and in making a thousand minor decisions]{.underline}, **[you build the
blocks of strategic dexterity that NATO sometimes
demonstrates]{.underline}**.

[The most poignant example I can point to of NATO's potential is its
mission in Afghanistan.]{.underline} Over 15 years, and two distinct
American administrations, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [through]{.underline} this tool called
**[NATO]{.underline}**, [coaxed more than a quarter of the world's
countries to participate in a]{.underline} [far-flung]{.underline} and
elusive [mission that had nearly nothing to do with their own national
interests]{.underline}. That political feat, however, is rivaled by the
operational one, where NATO allies and partners sustained overlapping
security, capacity-building, and counter-insurgency missions across an
enormous geographical expanse for nearly a decade and a half. The
complexity of military operations is often undersold to the public in
popular characterizations of war, not to say anything about war by a
coalition of militaries measurably different in size, capability, and
aptitude. That something the scope, scale, and duration of the
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was ever realized is
rather breathtaking. We could, and should, argue about the strategic
success of ISAF, and the costs, and whether it would have been easier
operationally had United States gone it alone, but those are different
debates. To appreciate ISAF is to recognize the nameless technocrats and
servicemen who, through muted craftsmanship, navigated cranky
parliaments and inordinate logistical puzzles to achieve a political and
operational tour de force. This NATO --- obscured to the public and the
politicians that charge it with obsolescence --- substantiates a faith
in the power of process that would make Sam Hinkie smile.

Fashionably Old-Fashioned

Ask some Middle East or Asian security experts about NATO and they
inevitably roll their eyes. That old thing. But have a deeper
conversation about how they are going about defense cooperation in their
regions and you quickly recognize what they want, however impractical,
is NATO in all its blessed, bureaucratic glory. Like vegetables to a
child, [NATO is never what you want, but usually what you
need.]{.underline} If you are a purveyor of soft power, NATO should be
your thing. [Where else can you **force common purpose and consensus on
scores of dissimilar nations by wont of incessant
badgering**]{.underline} (i.e., [pretty much the job of American
officials at NATO]{.underline})? [If you are a hard-power type, I remind
you again of ISAF and the fact of 52 militaries operating with
solidarity to impose their martial will]{.underline}. [In either case,
you begin to understand Vladimir Putin's hostility toward the
alliance]{.underline} --- of what it is and what it could be should it
ever have occasion to turn its withering gaze to Moscow. Is Putin's
disdain not proof itself of NATO's indomitable relevance and potency?

Ultimately, I suspect Putin's paranoia is both about the methodical
reach of alliance hard power into his perceived sphere of influence as
well as the fact that that alliance nations, on the whole, aspire to
live in a world defined by classic liberal values. Putin begrudges not
only NATO's endurance and adaptability, but the goody-two-shoes Western
order it represents. He certainly delights in Trump's anti-liberal
tendencies and hopes they will weaken NATO, but recognizes they are
unlikely to change its deep-rooted puritan culture. To wit, consider
again the 2 percent issue. In a world obsessed with image and status,
any number of European defense officials fight to maintain the target
because it is useful for keeping pressure on their own parliaments and
politicians for increased defense spending. That is, the alliance
chooses to look impotent in an attempt to do the right thing rather than
revise its blueprint to look better. NATO, bless its heart.

**[NATO is both a political and a military Alliance]{.underline}** [that

**both** political]{.underline} [and military means]{.underline}.
Politically[, NATO seeks to promote democratic values and empower member
states to **consult and collaborate on both security and defense-related
issues to solve problems, build trust, and prevent conflict in the long
run**]{.underline} (What is NATO, n.d.). [Militarily, NATO is committed
to peacefully resolving disputes. If diplomacy fails, NATO has the
military power to commence crisis management procedures. These can be
carried out under a United Nations mandate or Article 5]{.underline},
which is the collective defense clause of NATO\'s founding treaty.
**[Military operations can be conducted alone or with other countries
and international organizations]{.underline}** (What is NATO, n.d.).

2.3 MISSION

**[NATO is an Alliance of countries]{.underline}** from North America
and Europe [that serves as a link between the two
continents]{.underline}. This enables cooperation and consultation in
the areas of defense and security, and it has the ability to conduct
multinational crisis management operations (What is NATO, n.d.).

2.3.1 North Atlantic Council (NAC)

[NATO\'s]{.underline} North Atlantic Council ([NAC]{.underline}) [is the
epicenter of the Alliance\'s decision-making body]{.underline} (NAC,
n.d.). It is also responsible for helping to create strategic guidance
in an imperfect world (Dorff 2014). Accordingly, the NAC unites
representatives of each Alliance nation to discuss policy or operational
questions that require collective decisions, to foster a forum for full
range consultation among members on all issues that affect their peace
and security (NAC, n.d.). As a political organization, NATO develops
policy to respond to changing conditions in the political-military
domains under political guidance (AJP-01 2017,1-1). Accordingly, policy
is seen as prescriptive and can better assign or direct tasks and
capabilities (AJP-01 2017, 1-1). Moreover, the Alliance\'s strategic
framework helps link national power to the political system of
international actors (under NATO), to support collective interests
(AJP-01 2017, 1-3). It often does so through the application of the
instruments of national power (diplomatic, information, military, and
economic or D.I.M.E.) (AJP-01 2017, 1-3-1-4; M0ller 2014; Nissen
2014,159; Weaver 2018a; b; Weaver 2019; Weaver 2020a, b; Weaver and
Johnson 2020).

Under D.I.M.E., diplomatic efforts look at the engagement of political
entities and how effective they are at brokering agreements and
negoti-ating terms with other countries (AJP-01 2017, 1-3). The
information instrument is paramount for the decision-maker to have the
facts and data necessary to make timely decisions and the
synchronization of messaging is critical for the Alliance\'s legitimacy
(AJP-01 2017, 1-3). The military instrument looks to the availability of
armed forces of different nations (air, ground, sea, space, and Special
Forces), to project power as necessary (AJP-01 2017, 1-4). Finally, the
economic instrument turns to capital and trade to exercise monetary
influence over state and non-state actors alike (AJP-01 2017, 1-4).

It is the ultimate authority that heads a network of committees and its
discussions and decisions cover a host of NATO activities and are often
based on recommendations and reports developed by subordinate
committees, at the NAC\'s request (NAC, n.d.). Policies that are decided
in the NAC represent the collective will of all member countries from
within NATO because those decisions are made based on unanimity and
common accord. Likewise, the Secretary General chairs the NAC;
deci-sions taken by it have the same status and validity at whatever
level it meets (NAC, n.d.). Most importantly, the NAC was the only body
estab-lished by Article 9 of the North Atlantic Treaty and remains the
only one with the authority to set up subsidiary bodies (NAC, n.d.).

2.3.2 Nuclear Planning Group (NPG)

Many of the nations in NATO possess nuclear weapons (France, United
Kingdom, and the United States). This group is charged with discussing a
specified policy that gravitates around nuclear forces in a changing
world and serves as the senior body on nukes for the Alliance; specific
emphasis is on arms control and nuclear proliferation and has existed
since 1966 (NPG, n.d.). Though all NATO members are de facto members of
the NPG, France has opted not to participate. The senior component
charged with nuclear issues is the NPG High Level Group (HLG) and it is
chaired by the United States. The HLG tends to the issues of NATO\'s
nuclear policy, planning and force posture, as well as the security,
safety, and the monitoring of the effectiveness of NATO\'s nuclear
deterrence (NPG, n.d.).

2.4 NATO MILITARY ORGANIZATION AND STRUCTURE

[NATO will always look for political solutions first]{.underline}.
However, when NATO\'s execution of political decisions has military
implications, there are several key actors. This includes its Military
Committee (Johnston 2017, 60-61). This is comprised of the Chiefs of
Defense of NATO member countries. It also includes the International
Military Staff, and NATO\'s Military Committee\'s executive body (What
is NATO, n.d.). Finally, the military command structure is made up of
Allied Command Operations (ACO) and Allied Command Transformation (ACT).
Accord-ingly, NATO can turn to the military structure to influence
political outcomes (Hudson 2009).

It is important to note that NATO has very few permanent forces of its
own (several of these will be covered in subsequent chapters). At such
times when the NAC agrees to launch an operation, member nations
voluntarily contribute military forces. These forces are then returned
to their nations upon mission completion (What is NATO, n.d.).

2.5 NATO ACTIVITIES

**[The Alliance can be seen as a significant enabler]{.underline}**
(Jakobsen 2014). **[NATO is engaged in four basic
activities]{.underline}**. These include (1) **[decisions and
consultations]{.underline}**, (2**[) operations and
missions]{.underline}**, (3) developing **[partnerships]{.underline}**,
and (4) **[developing the means to respond to threats]{.underline}**
(What is NATO, n.d.). It is incumbent upon the political leaders to
craft strategic narratives to come up with a shared meaning of politics
to more aptly shape beliefs, perceptions, and behavior (Miskimmon et al.
2011).

The first of these is decisions and consultation. What is important to
understand is that a decision by NATO is taken by consensus. Moreover,
daily, member nations consult with one another and take decisions on
issues of security on a wide mix of issues (What is NATO, n.d.).

[NATO is involved in multiple missions and operations the
world]{.underline} over. More pointedly, these include recent operations
in Afghanistan and Kosovo (Shea 2014), [air policing,]{.underline}
[humanitarian relief operations, pandemic supp]{.underline}ort
(COVID-19), [its interest in securing the Mediter-ranean, and NATO\'s
support to the African Union]{.underline} (Operations and Missions,
n.d.; What is NATO, n.d.). Accordingly, it leads as a contrib-utor to
peace and security on multiple continents. [The Alliance is a crisis
management organization with an ability to handle full spectrum
opera-tions]{.underline} (Johnston 2017, 139; Operations and Missions,
n.d.). These have increased substantially since the 1990s (Operations
and Missions, n.d.).

**[NATO is engaged in building partnerships]{.underline}** (What is
NATO, n.d[.). In addition to the 30 member nations, 40 others
collaborate with the Alliance on a wide range of security and political
issues and this has led to many non-NATO members contributing resources
and troops to Alliance operations in many countries.]{.underline}

Finally, NATO is involved in developing capabilities to respond to
threats (What is NATO, n.d.). Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and
the subsequent end of the Cold War, it has turned to innovation and
adapted to emerging conditions and subsequent threats. [These include
the likes of special operations, intelligence,]{.underline}
**[cyber]{.underline}**, [and contingency contracting in recent
years.]{.underline} Under the NATO Crisis Management Process (NCMP),
NATO personnel staff and committees put together options for the NAC
(AJP-01 2017, 3-5).

#### NATO is both a collective defense AND a collective security organization.

Collective Defense and Collective Security

[[A formal]{.mark} military [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} usually
[[has]{.mark} the purpose of **[collective defense]{.mark}**, which
means]{.underline} that its [members pool]{.underline} their
[capabilities and]{.underline} attempt to [make a **collective effort**
[to **protect**]{.mark} **one another** [against]{.mark}]{.underline}
possible [military aggression by [a]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly
[**[specified adversary]{.mark}** outside the alliance]{.underline}.
Very **[often]{.underline}**, however, [an alliance offers not only
collective defense but also serves the function of collective
security.]{.underline} [Under collective security, allies protect one
another against possible military aggression by any one potential
adversary within the same alliance]{.underline}. [[The differentiation
between **collective defense and collective security may be illustrated
by**]{.underline}]{.mark} the example of
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During the Cold War, NATO was mostly
associated with **[[collective defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** against
possible military aggression led by the Soviet Union, a clearly
specified adversary outside the North Atlantic alliance. It should also
be noted, though, that **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[also
provided]{.underline}]{.mark}, and still provides,
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} [[security against possible military
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} by any one potential adversary among its
signatories. Given that German armed aggression has culminated in two
world wars, NATO has played a critical role in protecting its
signatories against the possibility of renewed German militarism while
at the same protecting the security interests of its member Germany.

University of Cambridge, UK; "Informal cooperation beyond the alliance,"
in NATO's Post-Cold War Politics, Palgrave Macmillan, London\]

A large literature charts NATO\'s post-Cold War transformation from a
close-knit, defensive alliance to a more versatile, multifaceted
security organization. This literature focuses mainly on changes to the
formal institutional makeup of the Alliance, such as the adoption of new
Strategic Concepts, inclusion of new member states, and reform of
command and decision procedures. Less analytical attention has been paid
to changing patterns of informal cooperation within and around the
Alliance. Indeed, while scholars have identified a growing tendency to
supplement formal NATO cooperation with ad hoc, flexible forms of
collaboration this tendency is often cited as a sign of disintegration
of the Alliance (for example, Noetzel and Schreer 2009) rather than an
integral part of NATO\'s post-bipolar institutional practice, which is
conducive to the continued functioning of the Alliance.

This chapter focuses explicitly on forms of informal cooperation
involving NATO members, but occurring beyond the official institutional
boundaries of the Alliance. Perhaps the most visible instantiation of ad
hoc, informal cooperation are the short-term \'coalitions-of-the-
willing\' that have brought together NATO and non-NATO countries to
intervene militarily in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq. However,
\'extramural\' security cooperation also takes other, less visible
forms, including Anglo-American special intelligence-sharing, the G8\'s
informal Counter-terrorism Action Group or the US-led Proliferation
Security Initiative (PSI). What characterises these initiatives is that
they bring together prominent NATO members (often in concert with
powerful third-party states) in order to address issues that fall
generally within the institutional scope and mandate of NATO but that
are nonetheless pursued outside the formal institutional boundaries of
the Alliance.

In what follows, I adopt a broadly rational institutionalist approach to
explore [factors]{.underline} that [may encourage greater reliance on
informal cooperation among NATO members]{.underline}. Assuming that
shifts in institutional design and practice are primarily explained by
reference to the changing incentives of dominant member states, [I focus
mainly on the role of the **US** in **initiating informal
cooperation**.]{.underline}

I advance three arguments. Firstly, [growing reliance on **ad hoc
cooperation** is **driven** by **systemic changes in** the post-bipolar
strategic environment]{.underline}, which place more diverse and less
predictable demands on military resources - especially those of the US -
than was the case during bipolarity. These changes have generated demand
for flexible forms of cooperation, which allow allies to enlist the
capabilities and expertise of third-party states on a case-by-case
basis. Secondly, **[a new strategic focus]{.underline}**, combined with
a rapid expansion of membership, has [resulted in a **broadening of
NATO\'s institutional scope**]{.underline} [and mandate and in enhanced
**centralization of decision-making**]{.underline}. [This process of
\'internationalization\']{.underline} and \'institutionalization\'
[has]{.underline} in turn [served to **push** some **issues outside
the**]{.underline} **[formal boundaries of the Alliance]{.underline}**
[where institutional constraints on decision-making remain
low]{.underline}. Thirdly, the end of bipolar- ity has shifted the
balance of power among NATO members further in favour of the US, thereby
reducing Washington\'s incentives to provide institutionalized voice
opportunities or assurances to European allies. This has reinforced the
inclination by the US to evade NATO\'s formal institutional constraints.

To focus my analysis, I examine cooperation on non-proliferation as a
lens through which to illuminate broader changes in cooperation within
the Alliance. Non-proliferation is a central component of America\'s
post- Cold War security strategy. Yet, Washington has shown considerable
reluctance in channelling core aspects of its global non-proliferation
policy through NATO. Instead, ad hoc initiatives such as the PSI and the
Cooperative Threat Reduction Program have been focal points for
cooperation between the America and its NATO allies. The rest of this
chapter seeks to illuminate why this has been the case.

Formal and informal institutions in international relations

[Although informal institutions have attracted growing attention from IR
scholars, there is little agreement on what separates informal from
formal structures]{.underline}. [Often, informal institutions are
defined simply as agreements that lack binding force]{.underline} (that
is, \'soft law\') or more broadly as agreements enforced by unwritten
conventions or norms of behaviour (see Brie and Stolting 2011: 19-20).
By contrast, formal institutions are generally characterized by being to
some degree legalized. International lawyers define legalization in
terms of \'obligation\' (implying that actors are bound by a rule or
commitment under international law), \'precision\' (implying that rules
are detailed and precise), and \'delegation\' (meaning that third
parties are granted authority to implement, interpret, and apply the
rules of agreements as well as to resolve disputes) (Abbott et al.
2000). In practice, of course, few international agreements impose
detailed legal obligations on states or delegate significant authority
to institutional agents to implement agreements or adjudicate disputes.
However, we may think of formal institutions as agreements and practices
that are instituted according to rules and procedures, which are
recognized as legal in clearly defined contexts (Brie and Stolting 2011:
19). Such agreements tend to be written down in detailed documents
specifying the precise obligations of state parties.

[Informal institutions or agreements]{.underline}, conversely, [exhibit
low levels of legalization]{.underline}. They are typically not
constituted by treaty or executive degree, and the rules that govern
interaction are neither legally nor pro- cedurally binding on states.
Informal agreements may be unwritten. Even when written, rules and
objectives tend to be stated in vague, general terms that make them open
to broad interpretation. A further difference pertains to the mode of
decision-making. While formal institutions are often configured as
representative organizations where official votes are taken and majority
rule may apply, informal institutions tend to rely purely on
deliberation and consensus-seeking without formal voting taking place.

When conceptualizing informal cooperation, [it is helpful to distinguish
two views of informal institutions]{.underline} according to how they
emerge and what their relationship is to formal institutions. The [first
describes informal institutions as indigenous to formal
institutions]{.underline}. On this view, informal institutions comprise
social interactions that occur \'alongside formalized interactions in
international organizations\' (Brie and Stolting 2011: 20; Helmke and
Levitsky 2004: 726). [These informal institutions
(conventions]{.underline}, [norms]{.underline} of behaviour, [stable
expectations]{.underline}) **[are not consciously shaped and controlled
by actors]{.underline}** [but arise endogenously from exchanges within
formal frameworks]{.underline} (Helmke and Levitsky 2004: 730). They
tend to complement zand strengthen formal institutions by creating
incentives to comply with formal rules.

[The second]{.underline} conceptualization [views informal institutions
as exogenous to formal]{.underline} institutions. On this view,
[informal institutions comprise **explicit** rules, norms, and
**decision-making procedures**]{.underline} (written or unwritten) [that
arise outside officially authorized channels.]{.underline} In contrast
to indigenous informal institutions, this second kind of informal
institution is **[deliberately created and maintained by actors for the
purpose of achieving joint political objectives.]{.underline}**

In this chapter, I am interested in the second kind. Thus, [I define
informal institutions as **explicit** and **purposefully created
frameworks for deliberation, exchange, and joint action**]{.underline}.
Such informal institutions may stand in different relationships to
formal international organizations. Sometimes, informal institutions may
arise alongside the official decision-making bodies of IOs in order to
improve their functioning. An example is the exclusive \'negotiating
clubs\' that operate within many IOs, where powerful member states
debate issues informally before they are considered jointly with other
members (Conzelmann 2011: 221-222). Gegout (2002) describes how a
\'Quint\' consisting of the US, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy
conduct unofficial negotiations on EU foreign policy issues before they
are placed before the Council. Elsewhere in this volume, Mayer and
Theiler draw attention to informal aspects of NATO cooperation, which
include regular lunches dur-ing which national representatives conduct
off-the-record discussions. Such \'negotiating clubs\' are mostly
complementary to official decision- making structures. Although they
operate without a formal institutional mandate, and although they favour
representation from larger states, informal negotiation clubs are a
prerequisite for consensus-building and effective implementation in many
large IOs. They provide the \'oil\', so to speak, that makes the heavy
machinery of formal organizations turn.

Informal institutions may also operate independently and partly in
contradiction of existing IOs. In this case, rather than complementing
formal frameworks for decision-making and implementation, informal
frameworks may emerge with the explicit purpose of sidestepping or
subverting formal decision processes. The coalitions of the willing that
fought in Iraq and Afghanistan provide an example. Military action by
these coalitions was not ancillary or complementary to official
deliberation and action by NATO. Rather, [these **coalitions** presented
**alternative sites for cooperation that bypassed NATO
altogether**.]{.underline}

II\. NATO Legal Authority

[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization is a **creation of international
agreement**. A mosaic of international agreements establishes the NATO
Alliance, states its mission, and grants privileges and immunities to
its subordinate elements]{.underline}. The next section provides an
overview of some of these key agreements.

A. North Atlantic Treaty of 1949

[The North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}, also known as the Washington
Treaty, [establishes **NATO legal authority**]{.underline},
[**organization**, and **function**]{.underline}. 11 NATO is both a
political entity and a military entity. NATO\'s political leader is the
Secretary General (currently Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, a Danish
citizen), while its military leader is the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe (SACEUR) (currently U.S. Air Force General Philip M. Breedlove).
The treaty establishes both a political and military role for the
organization.

1\. Core Mission and Article 5

**[Article 5 of the treaty states the core mission of
NATO]{.underline}**. 12 This mission is based upon article 51 of the UN
Charter, which provides for **[collective self-defense.]{.underline}**
Article 5 states as follows:

[The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
self-defense recognized by article 51]{.underline} of the Charter of the
United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. 13

[NATO invoked the provisions of article 5]{.underline} to the treaty for
the first time in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the
United States. 14 NATO Operation Active Endeavor (naval operations in
support of 9/11 counterterrorism missions in the Mediterranean) was one
of the first NATO operations authorized under article 5. 15

2**[. Non-Article 5 Activity]{.underline}**

[**Not all NATO military activity** can be justified under article 5 to
the treaty]{.underline}. [NATO member states]{.underline} 16 [have an
obligation to **train** and **prepare for their defense**]{.underline}.
**[This is articulated in article 3 to the treaty]{.underline}**. 17
[The political aspect of NATO is reflected in the **article 4
requirement**]{.underline} [that parties **consult one
another**]{.underline} to resolve disputes or identify potential threats
to the alliance. 18 These authorities have been interpreted to give NATO
its own engagement activity (mirroring the activity of a U.S. combatant
command), such as the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean
Dialogue. 19 While article 5 is a good start point in articulating the
legal basis for traditional NATO operations, the LEGAL) may also refer
to underlying United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR) giving
authority to engage in armed conflict under Chapter VII of the UN
Charter. 20 In this light, [NATO doctrine provides for operational
responses beyond article 5 self-defense.]{.underline}

To address the multitude of security scenarios facing the alliance,
**[NATO]{.underline}** [doctrine recognizes a category of activity known
**as Non-Article 5 Crisis Response Operations**]{.underline} (NA5CRO).
21 [Non-Article 5 operations cover contingencies that do not amount to a
response to an armed attack on alliance territory]{.underline}. 22 The
earliest example of this type of operation includes the NATO-lead of the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 23 The doctrine
states as follows:

[NA5CRO range from support operations primarily associated with civil
agencies through operations in support of peace]{.underline},
**[countering irregular threat activities]{.underline}**, to combat . .
. this could include, but is not limited to, extraction operations,
[tasks in support of disaster relief and humanitarian operations, search
and rescue]{.underline} (SAR) or support to non-combatant evacuation
operations (NEOs), [freedom of navigation and overflight
enforcement]{.underline}, sanction and embargo enforcement, support to
stabilization and reconstruction activities, peace enforcement (PE), and
counterinsurgency (COIN). 24

3\. Organizational Authority Under Article 9

The North Atlantic Treaty establishes the North Atlantic Council (NAC).
25 [All NATO entities owe their base authority to some action taken by
the NAC]{.underline}. As part of NATO\'s basic functions, [the NAC
establishes subsidiary bodies which include political, military, and
other organizational entities within NATO.]{.underline} On the military
side, the NAC established the Military Committee (MC), which provides
direction and guidance on military policy and strategy. 26 [The MC is
supported by its International Military Staff (IMS). Among other things,
the NAC approves rules of engagement (ROE) and target lists for
specified NATO operations]{.underline}. 27

The NAC is chaired by the Secretary General of NATO (Mr. Anders Fogh
Rasmussen), who builds consensus within this political and military
body. The Secretary General is supported by the International Staff (IS)
who works NATO\'s political agenda.

[The NAC is also empowered to establish a form of subsidiary body that
is now known as a NATO Agency]{.underline}. 28 NATO Agencies are the
executive body within a subsidiary body. 29 NATO agencies include such
entities as the NATO Standardization Agency (NSA), NATO Mamtenance and
Supply Agency (NAMSA), and the NATO Communications and Information
System Services Agency (NCSA). 30 Soldiers who eat at a NATO dining
facility on the NATO-operated part of Kabul International Airport (KAIA)
eat meals that were contracted and paid for by a NAMSA.

#### "Defense-only" interps badly misunderstand NATO's evolution over time\-\--Article 5 is irrelevant\-\--US coop with NATO on emerging tech is necessarily political, not military

**Weaver '21** \[John Michael; 2021; Associate Professor of Intelligence
Analysis at York College of Pennsylvania (USA), a retired DOD civilian
from the United States\' Intelligence Community, and has served as an
officer in the US Army (retiring at the rank of lieutenant colonel);
*NATO in Contemporary Times: Purpose, Relevance, Future*, Palgrave
Macmillan\]

The political aspects that the NATO diplomats bring is essential for the
success of the Alliance; diplomacy itself is an instrument of power and
one that is critical as a \"soft\" component to bring about influence in
the world (Weaver 2018a; Weaver 2018b; Weaver 2020; Weaver and Pomeroy
2018; Weaver and Pomeroy 2019, 2020; Weaver and Johnson 2020). To be
effective and to remain relevant, it must look to clearly articulate
objectives to NATO commanders at all levels (Kruger-Klausen and Odgaard
2014). **[The Alliance also helps enable nations like the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to leverage others to
minimize the burden of being the sole bearer of the problem while adding
legitimacy to the mission]{.underline} (Jakobsen 2014, 5). What\'s more,
is that NATO can bring together a variegated mix of capabilities that
single nations might lack (Jakobsen 2014, 60).

Similar to the United Nations, it is frequently quite challenging to
come to commonly acceptable terms due to the disparate mix of nations
each with their own agendas to help maintain their relevancy and
position on the global stage (Geoana 2020). It is not easy to realize
consensus and when looking at divides between individual nations, like
the United States and France (cultural differences), Greece, and Turkey
(a history of hostility), and divisions between larger members like the
United States and the European Union, the United Kingdom and the
European Union (over Brexit), and many NATO nations and Turkey (due to
Turkey\'s move towards a closer relationship with Russia), and one can
quickly see how challenges abound for the political leaders of the
Alliance.

That stated, diversity is often a good thing. It brings in new
experiences, leads to better problem-solving, and offers additional
perspectives. 

Working in diverse environments also promotes creativity and opens up
the dialogue to innovative ideas. Looking at problems through different
cultural lenses can add value, might assist in conflict avoidance, and
even lead to greater legitimacy especially if there is a move afoot to
gravitate toward the direction of armed conflict or intervention. The
addition of more members and the collaboration of countries in recent
years and into the future will further increase NATO\'s diversity, give
NATO leaders more cultural lenses to look through, and help avoid
groupthink.

**[Because NATO is a political organization first and
foremost]{.underline}**, [the civilians that serve as the head of this
Alliance are probably going]{.underline} [to be more inclined to look to
**diplomatic efforts**]{.underline} [to help **avoid the employment of
military forces.**]{.underline} NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea
Geoana (2020) underscored the importance of NATO\'s political influence
in a panel discussion when he underscored the necessity of NATO to
expand its political influence while trying to limit formal expansion to
leverage (1) that no other alliance has a greater sharing of values than
NATO, that (2) NATO countries possess 50% of the world\'s Gross Domestic
Product (GDP), and that **[the Alliance holds over 50% of the world\'s
military power.]{.underline}** This is important because
**[NATO]{.underline}** (the NATO Command Structure or NCS) [has few
permanent military forces itself and this is a weakness]{.underline}.
NATO depends on member countries to contribute military forces, if and
when needed. While NATO does maintain some military equipment, most
equipment is contributed by member nations to support their military
personnel (NATO Troop Contributions 2018). This can directly correlate
into issue resolution for NATO as a whole and reduce the costs
associated with member nation contributions of troops at the individual
nation level.

Another weakness is that NATO heavily relies on member contributions for
funding, and it is not entirely balanced. Additionally, NATO provides
political and financial oversight for any jointly funded projects among
member nations. Some countries have to spend more in order to develop
additional capabilities for which the Alliance asks (cyber,
communications, stand-off weapons, etc.) (NATO Funding, n.d.). NATO also
relies on the United States for some essential operations, such as
ballistic missile defense, airborne electronic warfare, and air-to-air
refueling. However, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany contribute
more than 50 percent of the non-defense spending (NATO Funding, n.d.).

That stated, each country will probably not see the solution that they
would like brought to fruition that they would prefer. Consensus is
rarely possible when multiple parties from diverse backgrounds are
involved. [Compromise will likely occur with each NATO member advocating
for their preferred course of action, and the actual decision becoming
\"watered down\" because not all nations will agree with individual
member recommendations. The ability of NATO members to keep an open
mind, work together, and **compromise** is vital for NATO\'s
success.]{.underline}

[NATO leaders will have to continue to adapt to a quickly changing
world.]{.underline} Having **[strong allies outside of NATO aids in
foreign policy negotiations and helps reduce the risk of military
conflict]{.underline}** and this is an opportunity. The member nations
will have to ensure they can form agreements within NATO and with its
partners. For NATO to remain relevant, especially in the context of its
burgeoning 30 member states, Alliance members will have to put aside
differences and look to a utilitarian approach to solving problems at
the top for this supranational organization to remain relevant in the
future.

There are threats. When turning to cyber, [issues regarding cyber
network operations are burgeoning and becoming more
problematic]{.underline} (Weaver and Johnson 2020). [Cyberspace has been
designated as its own military domain, separate from land, air, sea, and
space]{.underline} (NATO 2020). The Deputy Secretary General stated
[that NATO agreed to create a Cyberspace Operations Center in the
military command structure]{.underline} (NATO 2020); what is needed is a
clear understanding of the effects that the NATO SECGEN wants to achieve
so that it can be task organized accordingly. It has also been noted
that some actors have been exploiting the COVID-19 crisis, and there has
been an increase in malevolent cyber activity since it began (NATO
2020). [NATO will have to explore its interpretation of whether or not
cyber attacks constitute an Article 5 attack.]{.underline} Geoana
(2020), also [underscored the challenges confronting the expansion of
cyber]{.underline} to [include **artificial intelligence**]{.underline}
and quantum computing in the years ahead. Moreover, NATO will have to
come to understand advanced persistent threats (APTs), the Internet of
Things (IOT), [the use of \"deep fakes\" and more when looking at the
topic of cyber]{.underline} (Weaver and Johnson 2020).

To achieve success will require partnerships and synchronization to
remain relevant. More pointedly, NATO political leaders will have to
work with military planners (Kruger-Klausen and Odgaard 2014). **[The
threats facing the Alliance members have drastically changed since it
was founded]{.underline}**. A military attack from a hostile actor is
less likely to occur now than during the Cold War, but Russia still is a
concern (Geoana 2020). Other challenges are more in the realms of
terrorism, and nuclear proliferation (Geoana 2020). NATO leaders will
have to form a clear vision and a formidable strategy to remain relevant
to survive (Shea 2014, 41).

Moving forward, NATO will have many challenges. More to the point, NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has underscored three points. These
include (1) remaining strong as an Alliance to remain formidable and
keep its edge, (2) looking at how NATO can enhance its political
influence even though there will be disagreement at times among NATO
member nations, and (3) looking to how NATO becomes even more relevant
globally without expanding its formal membership (Geoana 2020).
Direction and guidance must be clear. The Alliance must also come to
terms with the political realities of what is truly possible and knowing
what exceeds the political will of member countries. Once this is
understood, **[NATO as a political entity]{.underline}**, [can move
forward with identifying the ways, means, and ends necessary to achieve
what the Alliance wants to accomplish.]{.underline} Finally, NATO should
turn to its Emerging Security Challenges Division (ESCD) to look at
future threats to the Alliance and determine the best way forward to
address these (ESCD, n.d.).

#### Article 5 situations are incredibly rare\-\--most NATO coop occurs under Article 4 and requires building effective partnerships with non-NATO allies 

**Matlary '14** \[Janne Haaland; 2014; Professor of International
Politics at the University of Oslo and at the Norwegian Defence
University College, Norway; "Partners versus Members? NATO as an Arena
for Coalitions," in NATO's Post-Cold War Politics, Palgrave Macmillan,
London\]

If this is so, then [NATO is important as an arena]{.underline} and
increasingly so. But **[the main political dynamic is between the
US]{.underline}**, on the one **[hand, and remaining NATO members and
partners]{.underline}**, on the other. Moreover, **[if Article 5
contingencies remain unlikely]{.underline}** [as during the past two
decades, then the **boundary** between members and partners will remain
rather **fuzzy**]{.underline}. Even the [border violations]{.underline}
from June to November 2012 ([of Turkey by Syria]{.underline}) [have not
resulted in Article 5 invocations by the former]{.underline}, which have
twice called for consultations under Article 4. This was also the case
when the Turkish border was violated in the \'spillovers\' in the run-up
to the Iraq war in 2003. At that time, the Turks asked for NATO
assistance under Article 4, something which severely split the Alliance.
Hence, **[Article 5 situations are very rare]{.underline}**,
[with]{.underline} [September 11]{.underline}, 2001 [being an exception
when the]{.underline} North Atlantic Council (**[NAC]{.underline}**)
[declared it]{.underline} an Article 5 [but was rebuffed by the US which
wanted full control of its response.]{.underline}

[My point is simply that absent the threat of inter-state war in the
Euro-Atlantic area,]{.underline} **[most NATO cases will be under
Article 4]{.underline}**, [and thus voluntary]{.underline}. This makes
for a political dynamic where [those who fight together, stay
together]{.underline}. Moreover, the fact that both members and partners
find it useful and perhaps necessary to contribute begs the question of
why contribute.

The importance of partner contributions

Once, when a small NATO member repeatedly voiced criticism at the NAC,
the US ambassador bent over and asked his British counter-part: \'So
what do they contribute?\'2 In the Alliance, the burden-sharing debate
around risk-willingness is the key one after the Cold War, and influence
is gained on a one-to-one basis: those that contribute, gain influence,
hopefully in Washington, but certainly in a given operation. They may
gain security through this, or prestige, or meet national interest
needs. Like the partnership policy of the US is a key to American global
politics, the same partner concept seems now to develop at NATO. It can
be argued that the partners contribute, in order to gain military
interoperability, political influence in NATO and political influence in
Washington. One may add that this is also why members contribute
(Matlary and Petersson 2013).

NATO after Afghanistan is an alliance where the fundamental security
contract, [Article 5, still underpins the alliance and keeps it
together, but where the political dynamics of the alliance have changed
in major ways]{.underline}. [The realities of coalition warfare have
become very clear in terms of the demands for risk-willing, significant
military capacities]{.underline}. Some European allies participate in
ISAF despite high costs in terms of life and treasure, but many more
offer only token participation. States that want closeness to the US
must contribute risk-willing, relevant military capacities to global
operations. These states are part of the first tier of NATO, the inner
circle. As stated, in NATO, states will first and foremost seek
closeness to the US. Some states achieve this through their
contributions to current operations. Others do not, who then are
relegated to the second tier (hence the characterization of NATO as a
\'two-tier\' alliance).

### NATO\-\--Includes Partners\-\--2AC

#### Predictability\-\--NATO literally defines partnership objectives as a part of 'NATO'\-\--all other interps are contrived and normative 

**NATO '21** \[North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Aug 25;
"Partnerships: projecting stability through cooperation,"
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_84336.htm?\]

A flexible network of partnerships with non-member countries

Dialogue and cooperation with partners can make a concrete contribution
to enhance international security, to defend the values on which the
Alliance is based, to NATO's operations, and to prepare interested
nations for membership.

In both regional frameworks and on a bilateral level, NATO develops
relations based on common values, reciprocity, mutual benefit and mutual
respect.

In the Euro-Atlantic area, the 30 Allies engage in relations with 20
partner countries through the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council and the
Partnership for Peace -- a major programme of bilateral cooperation with
individual Euro-Atlantic partners. Among these partners, NATO has
developed specific structures for its relationships with Russia1,
Ukraine and Georgia.

[NATO is developing relations with the seven countries on the southern
Mediterranean rim through the Mediterranean Dialogue, as well as with
four countries from the Gulf region through the Istanbul Cooperation
Initiative.]{.underline}

[NATO also cooperates with a range of countries which are not part of
these regional partnership frameworks]{.underline}. [Referred to as
"partners across the globe", they include Afghanistan, Australia,
Colombia, Iraq, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand and
Pakistan.]{.underline}

[NATO has also developed flexible means of cooperation with partners,
across different regions. NATO can work with so-called "30+n" groups
of]{.underline} partners, where partners are chosen based on a common
interest or theme. At the 2014 Wales Summit, NATO introduced the
possibility of "enhanced opportunities" for certain partners to build a
deeper, more tailor-made bilateral relationship with NATO. At the same
time, Allied leaders launched the "Interoperability Platform", a
permanent format for cooperation with partners on the interoperability
needed for future crisis management and operations.

In April 2014, NATO foreign ministers decided to suspend all practical
civilian and military cooperation with Russia but to maintain political
contacts at the level of ambassadors and above.

Key objectives of NATO's partnerships

Under NATO's partnership policies, the strategic objectives of NATO\'s
partner relations are to:

Enhance Euro-Atlantic and international security, peace and stability;

Promote regional security and cooperation;

Facilitate mutually beneficial cooperation on issues of common interest,
including international efforts to meet emerging security challenges;

Prepare interested eligible nations for NATO membership;

Promote democratic values and institutional reforms, especially in the
defence and security sector;

Enhance support for NATO-led operations and missions;

Enhance awareness of security developments including through early
warning, with a view to preventing crises;

Build confidence and achieve better mutual understanding, including
about NATO\'s role and activities, in particular through enhanced public
diplomacy.

That said, [each partner determines -- **with NATO**]{.underline} --
[the **pace**, **scope**, **intensity** and **focus of their partnership
with NATO, as well as individual objectives**]{.underline}. This is
often captured in a document setting goals for the relationship, which
is to be regularly reviewed. However, many of NATO's partnership
activities involve more than one partner at a time.

Partnership in practice: how NATO works with partners

In practice, [NATO's partnership objectives are taken forward through a
broad variety of means]{.underline}. [Broadly speaking, NATO opens up
parts]{.underline} of [its processes, procedures and structures to the
participation of partners, allowing partners to make concrete
contributions through these]{.underline}. In some cases, special
programmes have been created to assist and engage partners on their
specific needs. Key areas for cooperation are set out below:

[Consultation is key to the work of NATO as an alliance and is central
to partnerships]{.underline}. Political consultations can help
understand security developments, including regional issues, and shape
common approaches to preventing crises or tackling a security challenge.
NATO's many committees and bodies often meet in formations with partners
to shape cooperation in specific areas. NATO Allies meet with partners
(individually or in groups) on a broad variety of subjects and at a
variety of levels every day.

**[Interoperability]{.underline}** [is the ability to operate together
using harmonized standards, doctrines, procedures and equipment. It is
essential to the work of an alliance of multiple countries with national
defence forces]{.underline}, and is equally important for working
together with partners that wish to contribute in supporting the
Alliance in achieving its tactical, operational and strategic
objectives. Much of day-to-day cooperation in NATO -- including with
partners -- is focused on achieving this interoperability. In 2014,
recognising the importance of maintaining interoperability with partners
for future crisis management, NATO launched the Partnership
Interoperability Initiative, which inter alia launched mechanisms for
enhanced cooperation with nations that wished to maintain deeper
interoperability with NATO.

[Partners contribute to **NATO-led operations and
missions**]{.underline}, [whether through supporting peace by **training
security forces in the Western Balkans**]{.underline} [or monitoring
maritime activity in the Mediterranean Sea or off the Horn of
Africa.]{.underline} As contributors to those missions, **[partners are
invited to shape policy and decisions that affect those
missions]{.underline}**, alongside Allies. A number of tools have been
created to assist partners in developing their ability to participate in
NATO-led operations, and be interoperable with Allies' forces.

For many years, [NATO has worked with partners on defence reform,
institution and **capacity-building**]{.underline}. As part of its work
to project stability, NATO Allies have agreed that long-term and lasting
stability is linked to improved governance of defence and security
sector and institutions. Viable, effective and resilient defence
institutions are essential to the long-term success of efforts to
strengthen partner capacity. In 2004, NATO Allies and partners adopted
the Partnership Action Plan on Defence Institution Building, setting
basic benchmarks for defence institutions. [In a NATO context, such work
can go from strategic objective setting and joint reviews, to expert
assistance and advice, as well as targeted education and
training]{.underline}. Defence advice and reform is provided through
bilateral partnership cooperation programmes, as well as through expert
advisory programmes targeting specific aspects of Defence Institution
Building, like the Defence Education Enhancement Programme or Building
Integrity. In 2014, at the Wales Summit, NATO adopted the Defence and
Related Security Capacity Building Initiative (see more below). The
Initiative builds on NATO's extensive track record and expertise in
supporting, advising, assisting, training and mentoring countries
requiring capacity-building support of the Alliance, and allows for the
development of targeted, tailor-made packages of defence
capacity-building support for countries, upon request and with Allied
consent.

NATO also engages with partners in a broad variety of other areas where
it has developed expertise and programmes. These include:

[Counter-terrorism;]{.underline}

[Counter-proliferation]{.underline} of weapons of mass destruction and
their means of delivery;

[Emerging security challenges]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those
related to [**cyber defence**, energy security and maritime security,
including counter-piracy;]{.underline}

Civil emergency planning.

### NATO\-\--Includes Partners\-\--1AR

#### NATO partnerships are a core part of NATO\-\--that enables broad mechanism diversity 

**NATO '21** \[North Atlantic Treaty Organization; Aug 25;
"Partnerships: projecting stability through cooperation,"
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_84336.htm?\]

The Allies seek to contribute to the efforts of the international
community in projecting stability and strengthening security outside
NATO territory. One of the means to do so is through cooperation and
partnerships. [Over more than 25 years, the Alliance has developed a
network of partnerships with **non-member countries from the
Euro-Atlantic area**]{.underline}, [the Mediterranean and the Gulf
region, and other partners across the globe. NATO pursues dialogue and
practical cooperation with these nations on a **wide range of political
and security-related issues**]{.underline}. [NATO's partnerships are
beneficial to all involved and contribute to improved security for the
broader international community.]{.underline}

[Partners are part of **many of NATO's core activities**]{.underline},
[from **shaping policy**]{.underline} [to building defence capacity,
developing **interoperability**]{.underline} **[and managing
crises.]{.underline}**

NATO's programmes also help partner nations to develop their own defence
and security institutions and forces.

[In partnering with NATO, partners can:]{.underline}

[share insights on areas of common interest or concern through political
consultations and intelligence-sharing;]{.underline}

[gain access to advice and support as they reform and strengthen defence
institutions and capacities;]{.underline}

[participate in a rich menu of education, training and consultation
events]{.underline} (over 1,200 events a year are open to partners
through a Partnership Cooperation Menu);

prepare together for future operations and missions by participating in
exercises and training;

contribute to current NATO-led operations and missions;

share lessons learned from past operations and develop policy for the
future;

work together with Allies on research and capability development.

[Through partnership, NATO and partners also pursue a **broad vision of
security:**]{.underline}

integrating gender perspectives into security and defence;

[fighting against corruption in the defence sector]{.underline};

**[enhancing efforts to control or destroy arms]{.underline}**,
ammunition and unexploded ordnance;

**[advancing joint scientific projects]{.underline}**.

**[Partnership has evolved over the years, to encompass more nations,
more flexible instruments, and new forms of cooperation and
consultation]{.underline}**.

#### NATO relies on partners\-\-\--any other interp wrecks the ability to shape doctrine effectively 

**Matlary '14** \[Janne Haaland; 2014; Professor of International
Politics at the University of Oslo and at the Norwegian Defence
University College, Norway; "Partners versus Members? NATO as an Arena
for Coalitions," in NATO's Post-Cold War Politics, Palgrave Macmillan,
London\]

In this chapter, I discuss the importance of burden-sharing partnerships
with NATO as a development that is, as I argue, symptomatic of the
evolution of the Alliance into becoming an arena or platform for
coalitions of the \'willing and able\'. After the end of the Cold War,
we live in an era where [armed attacks against one or several Alliance
members]{.underline}, obliging others to respond immediately (although
not necessarily by military means), [have become rare and
unlikely]{.underline}. As a result, [the organization has increasingly
turned into a \'two-tiered\' or **\'multi-tiered**\']{.underline}
**[alliance]{.underline}**. **[Current operations are mostly Article
4]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} hence, **[unlike Article 5 cases,
voluntary]{.underline}**. [This implies that partners]{.underline}, as
well as members, **[may contribute]{.underline}**. Moreover, few members
seem to be willing and able to make a contribution,1 something that
inter alia the Libya operation has shown - only eight allies were
actually willing to contribute combat capabilities. In other operations,
like ISAF, all members contribute, but only a few with risk-willing
capabilities. All \'show the flag\', but few are willing and able to
contribute to sharp operations that require top skill and
risk-willingness.

In NATO\'s currently valid Strategic Concept, the necessity for a
part-nership policy is visibly highlighted: \'The promotion of
Euro-Atlantic security is best assured through a wide network of partner
relations with countries and organizations around the globe. These
partnerships make a concrete and valued contribution to the success of
NATO\'s fundamental tasks\' (NATO 2010). The section continues to
underline how flexible NATO will be in the time ahead: \'We will enhance
our partnerships through flexible formats that bring NATO and partners
together - across and beyond existing frameworks\' (NATO 2010).
**[NATO]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} also **[prepared to give
partners in operations a \'structural role in shaping strategy and
decisions on NATO-led missions]{.underline}** to which they contribute\'
(NATO 2010, my emphasis).

These are interesting new thoughts about coalition warfare. NATO clearly
requires military contributions from its partners, but the same is true
the other way round: in return for their contributions to operations,
partner governments obtain political influence (Edstrem et al. 2011).
The latter is what is \'offered\' for the first time in a Strategic
Concept in the quotation above. From the perspective of the US, such a
partnership policy has been a reality for quite some time. [The
extensive policy of partnerships is a new way of ensuring political and
military strength]{.underline} (Kay 2011). In many ways, NATO seems to
be introducing the same kind of partnership policy - the willing and
able can contribute to operations, whereas members of the Alliance can
opt out, as they are entitled to. A vivid illustration of this on the
political level was Germany\'s abstention on the UNSC resolution on
Libya (res. 73/11) along with, inter alia, Russia and China. Although
the Libya operation only became a NATO operation after five days, it is
nonetheless illustrative of the current degree of a lack of common
strategic vision in NATO that a major member did not agree with other
close allies in this case. In short, [in NATO there is very great
variety in politico-strategic thinking today, to the extent that there
is hardly anything in common beyond Article 5]{.underline}, and
[operations reflect this fact.]{.underline}

[**NATO has come to rely on partners**. In ISAF, partners like Australia
played key roles in the war-fighting]{.underline} in the South of
Afghanistan. The partners that bring substantial military capabilities
and economic resources to the table clearly benefit the Alliance.
**[Partners themselves achieve NATO interoperability]{.underline}** and
close ties at the operational and tacti-cal level, [and manage to
transcend their neutral stances at home]{.underline}, in their domestic
debates, as in the cases of Sweden and Finland, two prominent NATO
partners. Neutrality as a policy is almost an \'untouchable\' in these
countries. But the ability of partnering with NATO has enabled them to
redefine neutrality to allow for participation in sharp operations
abroad. Thus, there are benefits for NATO as well as for partners.

We do not find any ambiguity in KRS 341.070(1). It is our opinion that
[the key word in the statute is the word [\'in]{.mark},\' preceding the
words \'each of three calendar quarters\',]{.underline} and if the word
is accorded its ordinary and common meaning, [the statute does not
require simultaneous employment. According to Webster\'s]{.underline}
New International [Dictionary, the word \'in,\' used with relation to a
period of time, means \'during the course of.\']{.underline} The same
meaning, expressed in another way, would be [\'within the limits or
duration of.\']{.underline} Employing this meaning, the statute says
that an employer is subject to the Act if, during the course of, or
within the limits or duration of each of three calendar quarters, he had
in covered employment four or more workers, to each of whom the required
amount of wages was paid. This clearly means that the employment need
not be simultaneous. [**[Obviously, the word \'in\' does not mean
\'throughout\']{.mark}** or \'for the entire period of,\' because then
there would be no point in adding the requirement of the payment of a
minimum of \$50 in wages.]{.underline} In these times, no worker
employed for a full calendar quarter would be paid less than \$50 in
wages. The appellant seeks to read into the statute the words \'at the
same time,\' following the words \'had in covered employment\'. There is
no justification for this, unless the word \'in\' means \'during any one
period of time in.\' [We are [not aware of **any authority** for
ascribing such a meaning to the word \'in\']{.mark}]{.underline}.

### In\-\--Not Completely WIthin

Next, the district court construed the claim language \"in,\"
\"within,\" and \"between.\" Each of these claim construction issues is
similar to the interpretation of \"between\" discussed above in relation
to claims 5 and 33-36 The district court construed these words more
narrowly than required by the claim language and context. [The [word
\"in\" does not require that something be completely and continuously
inside of something]{.mark}]{.underline} else. The word \"within\" does
not require that something be completely and continuously within
something else. Further, as discussed above in more detail, the word
\"between\" does not require that something be completely and
continuously between two things.

The conjunctions and and or are two of the elemental words in the
English language. Under the conjunctive/disjunctive canon, and combines
items while [***or*** creates alternatives. **Competent users** of the
language **rarely hesitate**]{.underline} over their meaning. But a
close look at the authoritative language of legal instruments---as well
as the litigation that has arisen over them---shows that these little
words can cause subtle interpretive problems. Although these
conjunctions can appear in countless constructions, we have identified
six types of sentences in which they most frequently appear in legal
instruments.

#1: The Basic Requirement

  Conjunctive List                    Disjunctive List

[With the conjunctive list, **all three things** are required---while
with the **disjunctive list**, **at least one of the three is
required**, but **any one (or more)** of the three satisfies the
requirement]{.underline}. Hence in the well-known constitutional phrase
cruel and unusual punishments,1 the and signals that cruelty or
unusualness alone does not run afoul of the clause: The punishment must
meet both standards to fall within the constitutional prohibition.2 The
same point holds true for the phrase necessary and proper3 in Article I
of the Constitution.

## Artificial Intelligence

### AI\-\--Excludes Semi-Autonomous Weapons\-\--1NC

#### The area of AI excludes semi-autonomous weapons. Prefer DODD 3000.09, which is the only pertinent legal guidance published by any military on the planet. Any other interp opens the floodgates to arms sales affs for any weapon with an autonomous sensor. 

**Allen '22** \[Gregory; June 6; director of the Artificial Intelligence
(AI) Governance Project and a senior fellow in the Strategic
Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, D.C; CSIS; "DOD Is Updating Its Decade-Old
Autonomous Weapons Policy, but Confusion Remains Widespread,"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dod-updating-its-decade-old-autonomous-weapons-policy-confusion-remains-widespread\]

[While describing a military system as AI-enabled or machine
learning-enabled]{.underline} [provides useful information, it often
remains unclear just what functionality is being provided by AI and
**how central AI is to the system overall**]{.underline}.
[Suppose]{.underline}, hypothetically, that [the F-35]{.underline} Joint
Strike Fighter Program Office [decided that it should use machine
learning to improve the performance on one of the aircraft's many
different types of sensors. Does that mean that the entire F-35
program]{.underline}, with its more than \$8.5 billion in annual
spending, [is building AI-enabled weapon systems]{.underline}? The [DODD
3000.09 update is a good]{.underline} [opportunity to formally define
"**AI-enabled**]{.underline}" in DOD policy and to specify how using
machine learning does or does not affect the autonomous weapon senior
review process.

Confusingly, common usage of these terms differs significantly in other
countries. For example, Russian weapons manufacturers routinely refer to
their automated and robotic military systems as using AI even if the
system does not use machine learning, and they rarely make it clear when
it does. Varied definitions complicate international diplomacy on these
subjects.

Define how retraining machine learning models will be handled in the
senior review process.

A 2019 report from the Defense Innovation Board was memorably named
"Software Is Never Done." Updates, bug fixes, cybersecurity patches, and
new features are a critical aspect of managing all modern software
systems. However, software updates for machine learning systems are
different in nature from traditional software, and perhaps even more
important. The "learning" in a machine learning system comes from
applying a learning algorithm to a training data set in order to produce
a machine learning model, which is the software that performs the
desired function. To update the machine learning model, the developers
provide a new (usually larger) training data set that more accurately
reflects the changing operational environment. If the operational
environment changes, failing to rapidly retrain a machine learning model
can lead to reduced performance.

Does each software update and machine learning model retraining require
an autonomous weapon system to go through the senior review approval
process all over again? If so, an already formidable process barrier
risks unintentionally becoming an insurmountable one. A more reasonable
solution would be for the senior review process to assess and decide
upon the acceptability of the process for producing new training data;
to test and evaluate procedures for determining whether new software
updates are sufficiently robust and reliable; and to explicitly state
which potential new features would trigger an additional round of the
senior review approval process. This is similar to how the global
automotive industry regulates software updates and safety compliance.

Clarify [the specific features that **formally define an autonomous
weapon system.**]{.underline}

Despite eight years of negotiations at the United Nations, there is
still no internationally agreed upon definition of autonomous weapons or
lethal autonomous weapons. **[DODD]{.underline}** 3000.09
**[does]{.underline}**, however, **[formally define autonomous weapon
systems]{.underline}** and semi-autonomous weapon systems from the
perspective of U.S. policy:

Autonomous weapon system: A weapon system that, once activated, can
select and engage targets without further intervention by a human
operator. This includes human-supervised autonomous weapon systems that
are designed to allow human operators to override operation of the
weapon system, but can select and engage targets without further human
input after activation.

[Semi-autonomous weapon system]{.underline}: [A weapon system
that,]{.underline} once activated, [is intended to only engage
individual targets or specific target groups that have been selected by
a human operator. This includes:]{.underline}

Semi-autonomous weapon systems that employ autonomy for
engagement-related functions including, but not limited to, acquiring,
tracking, and identifying potential targets; cueing potential targets to
human operators; prioritizing selected targets; timing of when to fire;
or providing terminal guidance to home in on selected targets, provided
that human control is retained over the decision to select individual
targets and specific target groups for engagement.

'Fire and forget' or lock-on-after-launch homing munitions that rely on
\[Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures\] to maximize the probability that
the only targets within the seeker's acquisition basket when the seeker
activates are those individual targets or specific target groups that
have been selected by a human operator.

Notably, machine learning is not mentioned anywhere in these
definitions, and that is because **[machine learning is not always
necessary]{.underline}**. [Traditional software is sufficient to deliver
a high degree of autonomy for some military applications]{.underline}.
For example, [the Israeli]{.underline} Aerospace Industries (IAI) [Harpy
is a decades-old unmanned drone that IAI openly acknowledges
is]{.underline} an [autonomous]{.underline} weapon. [When in autonomous
mode, the Harpy loiters over a given region]{.underline} [for up to nine
hours, waiting to detect electromagnetic emissions consistent with an
onboard library of enemy radar]{.underline}, homes in on the emissions
source (usually enemy air defense radar), and attacks. [No human in the
loop is required.]{.underline}

[The **critical feature** of this definition is that the policy
threshold for autonomy relates specifically and exclusively to the
ability to autonomously "**select and engage targets**]{.underline}."
[DOD officials talk often about their goals for increasing autonomy in
weapon systems, but sometimes they mean increasing]{.underline} [weapon
autonomy in areas like guidance and navigation.]{.underline} For
example, Mike E. White, assistant director for the DOD's hypersonics
office, stated in 2020 that he wanted future DOD hypersonic weapons to
use autonomy and AI to "optimize flight characteristics." **[Increasing
hypersonic weapon autonomy for guidance and navigation is irrelevant
from a DODD]{.underline}** 3000.09 **[perspective]{.underline}** and
relatively innocuous from an international relations perspective, but
the DOD should seek to minimize potential misunderstandings---especially
about hypersonic weapons that could carry nuclear warheads and have
significant implications for global strategic stability. This is an area
where the DOD must communicate clearly and precisely.

Clarify the types of weapons that are and are not required to go through
the autonomous weapon senior review process.

As mentioned above, **[DOD]{.underline}**D 3000.09 [does not ban
autonomous weapons systems but rather subjects them to **additional
technical and process scrutiny**]{.underline} [in the form of a senior
review.]{.underline} However, [not all weapons systems with autonomous
functionality are required to go through the review. The]{.underline}
below **[diagram]{.underline}** [provides a simplified depiction of what
systems must go through the review and **which ones are exempted**. DOD
should publish a similar diagram in a policy handbook]{.underline} to
accompany the DODD 3000.09 update.

II\. Defining AI, Autonomy, and Autonomous Weapons

[Debate concerning the expansion of AI has grown more complex in recent
years.]{.underline} The language used to depict robots is often
ambiguous due to the interdisciplinary nature of the subject. Before
delving into the potential advantages and risks of LAWS, [it is first
necessary to establish a working definition of AI and the related
subject of autonomy, which is part of what differentiates LAWS from
other autonomous weapon systems]{.underline} (AWS). On February 11,
2019, President Donald J. Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 13859 on
Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence. EO 13859
states that, \"artificial intelligence (AI) promises to drive growth of
the United States economy, enhance our \[U.S\] economic and national
security, and improve our quality of life\" (Executive Order 13859). On
§ 9 of EO 13859, artificial intelligence means \"the full extent of
Federal investments in AI, to include: R & D of core AI techniques and
technologies; AI prototype systems; application and adaptation of AI
techniques; architectural and systems support of AI; and
cyberinfrastructure, data sets, and standards for AI\" (EO 13859).

Owing to distinct approaches of research in AI, no universal definition
of it exists. However, H.R. 5515 (115th Congress) or the FY 2019 U.S.
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) does provide a framework for
the purpose of the bill. NDAA § 238, defines artificial intelligence as:

\(1\) Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and
unpredictable circumstances without significant human oversight, or that
can learn from experience and improve performance when exposed to data
sets.

\(2\) An artificial system developed in computer software, physical
hardware, or other context that solves tasks requiring human-like
perception, cognition, planning, learning, communication, or physical
action.

\(3\) An artificial system designed to think or act like a human,
including cognitive architectures and neural networks.

\(4\) A set of techniques, including machine learning, that is designed
to approximate a cognitive task.

\(5\) An artificial system designed to act rationally, including an
intelligent software agent or embodied robot that achieves goals using
perception, planning, reasoning, learning, communicating,
decision-making, and acting.

As outlined above, [AI encompasses a range of technologies with assorted
capabilities, many of which have the potential to advance military
operations in several areas]{.underline}. AI applications for defense
are diverse. They have proven useful for reconnaissance and surveillance
missions, and have marked potential to speed-up cyberspace operations
(Sayler, 2019b). For example, the 2016 Cyber Grand Challenge hosted by
the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) exhibited the
budding aptitude of future Al-enabled cyber tools by challenging
participants to develop an AI algorithm that could detect and patch
software vulnerabilities in seconds instead of months (Fraze, 2016;
Sayler, 2019b). Al-enhanced cyber tools have marked potential to detect
derived viruses, suspicious nodes in networks, and identify system
oddities (Asiru, Dlamini, Blackledge, 2017; Kubovic, Kosinar, & Janosik,
2018). [AI technology is also being incorporated into military vessels
to]{.underline} [communicate with other vehicles]{.underline}, navigate
routes, determine distance between vehicles and surrounding objects, and
improve safety and vehicle performance. (Canis, 2018). Similarly,
offensive applications of AI also vary. They may boost the destructive
competencies of legitimate military forces or third party attackers. A
hacker group\'s intrusion capability, for example, may be augmented by
AI applications that allow its members to generate new evasive malware
variants, combine attack techniques, disseminate propaganda, and
implement automatic self-destruct mechanisms in case of detection
(Kubovic, Kosinar, & Janosik, 2018). In other words, according to James
S. Johnson, a postdoctoral research fellow at the James Martin Center
for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) at the Middlebury Institute of
International Studies, \"AI is best understood, therefore, as a
potentially powerful force multiplier of these developments\" (Johnson,
2020).

Assistant Professor Rebecca Crootof (2015) in her article, \"The Killer
Robots Are Here: Legal and Policy Implications,\" asserts that
\"[autonomy carries vastly different meanings in different
fields]{.underline}\" and [due to these mixed understandings, experts
can often speak past each other.]{.underline} For the purpose of this
paper, **[we will use the definition of autonomy provided by the U.S.
Army Robotic]{.underline}** and Autonomous **[System
Strategy]{.underline}** (2017), which states that, [\"\[autonomy is\]
the condition or quality of being self-governing to achieve an assigned
mission based on the system\'s own situational awareness (integrated
sensing, perceiving, analyzing) planning and
decision-making]{.underline}.\" The U.S. Army Robotic and Autonomous
System Strategy (2017) further emphasizes that independence is \"a point
on a spectrum that can be tailored to the specific mission, level of
acceptable risk, and degree of human-machine teaming.\" According to
this view, autonomy can thus be seen as a continuum and not a dichotomy.
[Weapon systems occupy different points according to how broadly they
can identify and engage a specified target]{.underline} as well as their
degree of self-governance over their pre-programmed or machine-learned
actions. [Technology on the lower end of the autonomy spectrum (i.e.
semi-autonomous weapons) are currently employed by the U.S.
military]{.underline}. The Phalanx Close-In Weapons System (CIWS), for
example, which has been used by the U.S. Navy since the 1980s. CIWS
provides battleships with a mechanized defense system. It can
automatically \"detect, evaluate, engage, and perform kill

assessments against anti-ship missiles (ASM) and high-speed aircraft
threats\" (U.S. Navy: Fact File, 2019).

Similar to AI, [there is no internationally acceptable definition of
AWS]{.underline}. Moreover, [these weapons cannot be easily categorized
because they incorporate a diverse range of technologies]{.underline}
(Patrick, 2019). [U.S. DoD Directive 3000.9]{.underline}, however,
[identifies two types of weapon systems according to their level of
autonomy---**autonomous** and **semi-autonomous**]{.underline}. [LAWS
fall under the first category, which refers to a system that, once
started, can engage targets without further human
intervention]{.underline}. Unlike other countries, [the U.S. definition
of autonomous weapons **specifies the inclusion of human-supervised
AWS**]{.underline}; [this is a system designed to provide people with
the ability to terminate operation of the weapon system following
activation]{.underline}. [Emphasis on possible human intercession is
necessary to assuage concerns related to the use of LAWS in a combat
environment.]{.underline}

### AI\-\--Full Autonomy\-\--1NC

#### AI refers exclusively to completely autonomous technologies\-\--that excludes data mining and logistics. Any other interp opens the floodgates to any military action that uses data (so all of them) 

**Ware '19** \[Jacob; September 24; holds a master's in security studies
from Georgetown University and an MA (Hons) in international relations
and modern history from the University of St Andrews; War on the Rocks,
"Terrorist Groups, Artificial Intelligence, and Killer Drones,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/09/terrorist-groups-artificial-intelligence-and-killer-drones/\]

In 2016, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) carried out its
first successful drone attack in combat, killing two Peshmerga warriors
in northern Iraq. The attack continued the group's record of employing
increasingly sophisticated technologies against its enemies, a trend
mimicked by other nonstate armed groups around the world. The following
year, the group announced the formation of the "Unmanned Aircraft of the
Mujahedeen," a division dedicated to the development and use of drones,
and a more formal step toward the long-term weaponization of drone
technology.

Terrorist groups are increasingly using 21st-century technologies,
including drones and elementary artificial intelligence (AI), in
attacks. As it continues to be weaponized, AI could prove a formidable
threat, allowing adversaries --- including nonstate actors --- to
automate killing on a massive scale. The combination of drone expertise
and more sophisticated AI could allow terrorist groups to acquire or
develop lethal autonomous weapons, or "killer robots," which would
dramatically increase their capacity to create incidents of mass
destruction in Western cities. As it expands its artificial intelligence
capabilities, the U.S. government should also strengthen its anti-AI
capacity, paying particular attention to nonstate actors and the
enduring threats they pose. For the purposes of this article, [I define
**artificial intelligence** as **technology capable of "mimicking human
brain patterns**," **including by learning and making
decisions**.]{.underline}

AI Could Turn Drones into Killer Robots

The aforementioned ISIL attack was not the first case of nonstate actors
employing drones in combat. In January 2018, an unidentified Syrian
rebel group deployed a swarm of 13 homemade drones carrying small
submunitions to attack Russian bases at Khmeimim and Tartus, while an
August 2018 assassination attempt against Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro
used exploding drones. Iran and its militia proxies have deployed
drone-carried explosives several times, most notably in the September
2019 attack on Saudi oil facilities near the country's eastern coast.

Pundits fear that the drone's debut as a terrorist tool against the West
is not far off, and that "the long-term implications for civilian
populations are sobering," as James Phillips and Nathaniel DeBevoise
note in a Heritage Foundation commentary. In September 2017, FBI
Director Christopher Wray told the Senate that drones constituted an
"imminent" terrorist threat to American cities, while the Department of
Homeland Security warned of terrorist groups applying "battlefield
experiences to pursue new technologies and tactics, such as unmanned
aerial systems." Meanwhile, ISIL's success in deploying drones has been
met with great excitement in jihadist circles. The group's al-Naba
newsletter celebrated a 2017 attack by declaring "a new source of horror
for the apostates!"

[The use of drones in combat indicates an intent and capability to
**innovate and use increasingly savvy technologies**]{.underline} for
terrorist purposes, a process sure to continue with more advanced forms
of AI. Modern drones possess fairly elementary forms of artificial
intelligence, but the technology is advancing: Self-piloted drones are
in development, and the European Union is funding projects to develop
autonomous swarms to patrol its borders.

AI will enable terrorist groups to threaten physical security in new
ways, making the current terrorism challenge even more difficult to
address. According to a February 2018 report, terrorists could benefit
from commercially available AI systems in several ways. The report
predicts that autonomous vehicles will be used to deliver explosives;
low-skill terrorists will be endowed with widely available high-tech
products; attacks will cause far more damage; terrorists will create
swarms of weapons to "execute rapid, coordinated attacks"; and, finally,
attackers will be farther removed from their targets in both time and
location. As AI technology continues to develop and begins to
proliferate, "**[AI]{.underline}** \[[will\] expand the set of actors
who are capable of carrying out the attack, the rate at which these
actors can carry it out, and the set of plausible targets."]{.underline}

For many military experts and commentators, [lethal autonomous weapon
systems,]{.underline} or "killer robots," [are the]{.underline} most
feared [application of artificial intelligence in military
tech]{.underline}nology. In the words of the American Conservative
magazine, the difference between killer robots and current AI-drone
technology is that, with killer robots, "the software running the drone
will decide who lives and who dies." Thus, [killer robots,]{.underline}
combining drone technology with more advanced AI, [will possess the
means and power to **autonomously** and **independently** engage
humans]{.underline}. [The lethal autonomous weapon has been called the
"**third revolution in warfare**,"]{.underline} following gunpowder and
nuclear weapons, and is expected to reinvent conflict, not least
terrorist tactics.

Although **[completely autonomous weapons have not yet reached the
world's battlefields]{.underline}**, current weapons are on the cusp.
South Korea, for instance, has developed and deployed the Samsung SGR-A1
sentry gun to its border with North Korea. The gun supposedly can track
movement and fire without human intervention. Robots train alongside
marines in the California desert. Israel's flying Harpy munition can
loiter for hours before detecting and engaging targets, while the United
States and Russia are developing tanks capable of operating
autonomously. And the drones involved in the aforementioned rebel attack
on Russian bases in Syria were equipped with altitude and leveling
sensors, as well as preprogrammed GPS to guide them to a predetermined
target.

[Of particular concern is the possibility of **swarming
attacks**]{.underline}, [composed of thousands or millions of tiny
killer robots, each capable of engaging its own]{.underline}
[target]{.underline}. The potentially devastating terrorist application
of [swarming autonomous drones]{.underline} is best summarized by Max
Tegmark, who has said that "if a million such killer drones can be
dispatched from the back of a single truck, then one has a horrifying
weapon of mass destruction of a whole new kind: one that [can
selectively kill only a prescribed category of people, leaving everybody
and everything else unscathed]{.underline}." Precisely that hypothetical
scenario was illustrated in a recent viral YouTube video,
"Slaughterbots," which depicted the release of thousands of small
munitions into British university lecture halls. The drones then pursued
and attacked individuals who had shared certain political social media
posts. The video also depicts an attack targeting sitting U.S.
policymakers on Capitol Hill. The video has been viewed over three
million times, and was met with increasing concern about potential
terrorist applications of inevitable autonomous weapons technology. So
far, nonstate actors have only deployed "swarmed" drones sparingly, but
it points to a worrying innovation: [Swarming, weaponized killer robots
aimed at civilian crowds would be nearly impossible to defend against,
and, if effective, cause massive casualties]{.underline}.

### AI\-\--Includes Narrow/Strong AI\-\--2AC

[Artificial intelligence is commonly]{.underline} defined as [the theory
and development of computer systems able to **perform
tasks**]{.underline} [that normally require human intelligence, such as
visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation
between languages.]{.underline} [It can range from weak forms, such
as]{.underline} **[narrow a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, [that processes big data to answer basic
questions and generate predictions]{.underline} (e.g., think of Waze
helping you drive home or ad placements online) [to strong forms such as
"Artificial General Intelligence" and "Artificial Super Intelligence"
that exceed human intelligence, creativity, and
adaptability]{.underline}. Military applications range from finding
optimal human-machine symbiosis, the centaur Deputy Secretary of Defense
Robert Work speaks about, to using increased computer processing power
to replace people on the battlefield with autonomous attack swarms.

[Short of the promise of driverless cars and robot servants, narrow
forms of artificial intelligence like machine learning are starting to
change sectors ranging from healthcare to logistics]{.underline}. With
respect to public health, Flowminder, a Swedish NGO, uses narrow
artificial intelligence to predict the spread of diseases. In logistics,
machine learning is helping companies make supply chain adjustments,
optimize delivery routes, and design warehouse systems. Vehicle
developers, such as Volvo, apply artificial intelligence to improve
predictive maintenance. Volvo collects data with smart sensors on their
vehicles and applies machine learning techniques to conduct diagnostics
that reduce down time for services and better inform the resupply.

Artificial Intelligence for the Military

While many commercial applications of artificial intelligence are based
on identifying patterns and trends using big data, [most military
applications focus on autonomous system]{.underline}s. **[Existing
a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [programs in
the Department of Defense include Navy unmanned undersea and aerial
vehicle programs such as the]{.underline} Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle Swarming Technology (**[LOCUST]{.underline}**), [and Air
Force/**DARPA**]{.underline} [ventures such as the Gremlin
anti-surface-to-air missile drone program. The Gremlin program involves
launching a large number of unmanned systems from a transport plane that
swarm to attack hard targets such as mobile SAM platforms and C4ISR
nodes.]{.underline} Within the Army, labs are using artificial
intelligence to experiment with autonomous vehicles. Concepts range from
larger logistics convoys composed of one manned vehicle and a large
number of autonomous vehicles to combat formations mixing manned and
unmanned platforms.

While the private sector focuses on narrow artificial intelligence
applications that aid decision making and optimize business models, the
military's focus on autonomy arises from a technological bottleneck. [A
more advanced version of artificial intelligence than exists today is
likely a necessary development]{.underline} [before the military can
**field autonomous systems**]{.underline} able to adapt to complex,
changing environments. This evolution is especially important for land
forces. Ground platforms have more variables to address than air or
naval systems. Jets and submarines do not have to dodge potholes or
jaywalkers. An autonomous system operating in a future megacity would
have to do both under fire. The result is that autonomous combat
vehicles will likely emerge in the air and maritime domain faster than
the ground domain. Yet, that should not stop continued investment in and
experimentation with artificial intelligence by the Army.

John: [Carla]{.underline} is an Assistant Professor of Law and Director
of R&D at Michigan State Law School. She\'s a Faculty Associate at
Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School. Or
is it at the university?

Carla: University.

\*210 John: University, not the law school, which is a think tank
collaboration of a number of top intellectuals in this field of fintech.
Her focus is on the intersection of blockchain and law, but she [**knows
AI**, because she\'s authoring a **casebook on AI and the
law**]{.underline}. And she\'s very familiar with all the writings on
this issue, so she\'s an asset to our discussion here.

I want to do something that. \... [It may seem elementary to
some]{.underline} of you, [but having sat through a number of
discussions of the use of **AI**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning and large datasets
and analysis for credit-related issues, [I was]{.underline} **[puzzled
exactly how this works]{.underline}**, to be honest with you. [How does
the]{.underline} **[AI]{.underline}** model **[work?]{.underline}** [How
does the]{.underline} **[m]{.underline}**achine
**[l]{.underline}**earning **[model]{.underline}** [work?]{.underline}
And [what is]{.underline} **[done with]{.underline}** big
**[datasets]{.underline}**, particularly non-traditional data that\'s
being used more and more by fintech companies? [As a
kickoff]{.underline} to this, [I wanted to ask Carla to
give]{.underline} us [an]{.underline} **[overview]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} how [these particular programs and tools]{.underline},
that are being developed in fairly substantial quantities and numbers,
[how these]{.underline} **[actually work]{.underline}** [and
**how**]{.underline} the **[m]{.underline}**achine
**[l]{.underline}**earning and the large dataset analysis
[is]{.underline} **[deployed]{.underline}**. Just how it works, so we
can understand.

Carla: So, in other words, you\'re asking the professor to do what
professors do, which is lay the foundation definitionally. I can do
this. Generally speaking, [there\'s]{.underline} really [no
straightforward consensus on the definition of]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence. As a
result, discussion of AI and its sub-fields really are susceptible to a
lot of hype and confusion. For instance, [people use the term
"**m**]{.underline}achine **[l]{.underline}**earning[" and
"**a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence["
**interchangeably**, but they\'re]{.underline} really **[not the
same]{.underline}** thing, and [so the goal here is just to break some
of that down]{.underline} a little bit. [At a pretty high
level]{.underline} still, but just to lay the foundation
[definitionally]{.underline}.

[A]{.underline} **[best consensus definition of
a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [is that it\'s
a]{.underline} **[broad]{.underline}** term, an [**umbrella term**, used
to refer to a **large set of information science**]{.underline}. It\'s
best understood as [a set of **techniques aimed at approximating some
aspect of human cognition using machines**]{.underline}. And the main
takeaway is that, [although we use the term "artificial intelligence" as
**though** it\'s]{.underline} [**monolithic**, it\'s]{.underline} really
[**not**. It covers a range of]{.underline} [**sub fields**,
which]{.underline} **[include]{.underline}**, and I should say
"[but]{.underline} **[is not limited to]{.underline}**" as lawyers say,
[neural networks, vision, data mining, expert systems, robotics, natural
language processing, natural language understanding, planning, and
evolutionary computation]{.underline}.

We actually have a class on evolutionary analysis and the law at MSU Law
School, so [all]{.underline} of these [are]{.underline}
**[relevant]{.underline}** [to the legal field and legal issues, but the
one]{.underline} **[primarily]{.underline}** [people think about and
mean when they use the term "**a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence[" is]{.underline}
**[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning.
**[M]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning
[refers]{.underline} **[generally]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[capacity of a system to improve its performance at
some]{.underline}** task, some **[specific task]{.underline}**, [**over
time**. Often, the task involves recognizing **patterns in
datasets**]{.underline}. Although machine learning [outputs can include
everything from **translating languages**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[grasping objects]{.underline}** [or helping]{.underline} to **[drive
a car]{.underline}**.

\*211 Specifically, machine learning relies on algorithms to analyze
huge datasets. It basically performs predictive analytics far faster
than any human can on a dataset that\'s larger than any human could
reasonably get through efficiently. Notably, however and something I
think that gets lost sometimes in legal discussions, is that, [generally
speaking]{.underline}, oftentimes, [not always but often,
the]{.underline} **[m]{.underline}**achine **[l]{.underline}**earning
[system is]{.underline} both \... and this should be always, is both
**[designed]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[created by
humans]{.underline}**, and then you put inputs into it and it output
results. Those outputs are then interpreted and applied by humans,
right?

### AI\-\--AT: "AI Approximates Humans"/Full Autonomy\-\--2AC

#### Their interp anthropomorphizes AI\-\--no integration of AI into military affairs is ever fully autonomous\-\--imprecise and means no affs meet

**Carchidi '22** \[Vincent; May 16; Master of Political Science from

**[Artificial intelligence is not like us]{.underline}**. For all of
AI's diverse applications, human intelligence is not at risk of losing
its most distinctive characteristics to its artificial creations.

Yet, when AI applications are brought to bear on matters of national
security, they are often subjected to an anthropomorphizing tendency
that inappropriately associates human intellectual abilities with
AI-enabled machines. A rigorous AI military education should recognize
that this anthropomorphizing is irrational and problematic, reflecting a
poor understanding of both human and artificial intelligence. The most
effective way to mitigate this anthropomorphic bias is through
engagement with the study of human cognition --- cognitive science.

This article explores the benefits of using cognitive science as part of
an AI education in Western military organizations. Tasked with educating
and training personnel on AI, military organizations should convey not
only that anthropomorphic bias exists, but also that it can be overcome
to allow better understanding and development of AI-enabled systems.
This improved understanding would aid both the perceived trustworthiness
of AI systems by human operators and the research and development of
artificially intelligent military technology.

For military personnel, having a basic understanding of human
intelligence allows them to properly frame and interpret the results of
AI demonstrations, grasp the current natures of AI systems and their
possible trajectories, and interact with AI systems in ways that are
grounded in a deep appreciation for human and artificial capabilities.

Artificial Intelligence in Military Affairs

AI's importance for military affairs is the subject of increasing focus
by national security experts. Harbingers of "A New Revolution in
Military Affairs" are out in force, detailing the myriad ways in which
AI systems will change the conduct of wars and how militaries are
structured. From "microservices" such as unmanned vehicles conducting
reconnaissance patrols to swarms of lethal autonomous drones and even
spying machines, AI is presented as a comprehensive, game-changing
technology.

As the importance of AI for national security becomes increasingly
apparent, so too does the need for rigorous education and training for
the military personnel who will interact with this technology. Recent
years have seen an uptick in commentary on this subject, including in
War on the Rocks. Mick Ryan's "Intellectual Preparation for War," Joe
Chapa's "Trust and Tech," and Connor McLemore and Charles Clark's "The
Devil You Know," to name a few, each emphasize the importance of
education and trust in AI in military organizations.

Because war and other military activities are fundamentally human
endeavors, requiring the execution of any number of tasks on and off the
battlefield, the uses of AI in military affairs will be expected to fill
these roles at least as well as humans could. So long as AI applications
are designed to fill characteristically human military roles --- ranging
from arguably simpler tasks like target recognition to more
sophisticated tasks like determining the intentions of actors --- the
dominant standard used to evaluate their successes or failures will be
the ways in which humans execute these tasks.

But this sets up a challenge for military education: how exactly should
AIs be designed, evaluated, and perceived during operation if they are
meant to replace, or even accompany, humans? Addressing this challenge
means identifying anthropomorphic bias in AI.

Anthropomorphizing AI

[Identifying the tendency to anthropomorphize AI in military affairs is
not a novel]{.underline} observation. U.S. Navy Commander Edgar Jatho
and Naval Postgraduate School researcher Joshua A. Kroll argue that AI
is often "too fragile to fight." Using the example of an automated
target recognition system, they write that to describe such a system as
engaging in "recognition" effectively "anthropomorphizes algorithmic
systems that simply interpret and repeat known patterns."

But the act of human recognition involves distinct cognitive steps
occurring in coordination with one another, including visual processing
and memory. A person can even choose to reason about the contents of an
image in a way that has no direct relationship to the image itself yet
makes sense for the purpose of target recognition. The result is a
reliable judgment of what is seen even in novel scenarios.

[An AI target recognition system]{.underline}, in contrast, [depends
heavily on its existing data or programming which may be inadequate for
recognizing targets in novel scenarios.]{.underline} This system does
not work to process images and recognize targets within them like
humans. Anthropomorphizing this system means oversimplifying the complex
act of recognition and overestimating the capabilities of AI target
recognition systems.

[By framing and defining AI as a counterpart to human
intelligence]{.underline} --- as a technology designed to do what humans
have typically done themselves --- [concrete examples of AI are
"measured by \[their\] ability to replicate human mental
skills,"]{.underline} as De Spiegeleire, Maas, and Sweijs put it.

Commercial examples abound. AI applications like IBM's Watson, Apple's
SIRI, and Microsoft's Cortana each excel in natural language processing
and voice responsiveness, capabilities which we measure against human
language processing and communication.

Even in military modernization discourse, the Go-playing AI "AlphaGo"
caught the attention of high-level People's Liberation Army officials
when it defeated professional Go player Lee Sedol in 2016. AlphaGo's
victories were viewed by some Chinese officials as "a turning point that
demonstrated the potential of AI to engage in complex analyses and
strategizing comparable to that required to wage war," as Elsa Kania
notes in a report on AI and Chinese military power.

But, like the attributes projected on to the AI target recognition
system, some Chinese officials imposed an oversimplified version of
wartime strategies and tactics (and the human cognition they arise from)
on to AlphaGo's performance. One strategist in fact noted that "Go and
warfare are quite similar."

Just as concerningly, the fact that AlphaGo was anthropomorphized by
commentators in both China and America means that the tendency to
oversimplify human cognition and overestimate AI is cross-cultural.

The ease with which human abilities are projected on to AI systems like
AlphaGo is described succinctly by AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky:
"Anthropomorphic bias can be classed as insidious: it takes place with
no deliberate intent, without conscious realization, and in the face of
apparent knowledge." Without realizing it, individuals in and out of
military affairs ascribe human-like significance to demonstrations of AI
systems. Western militaries should take note.

For military personnel who are in training for the operation or
development of AI-enabled military technology, recognizing this
anthropomorphic bias and overcoming it is critical. This is best done
through an engagement with cognitive science.

The Relevance of Cognitive Science

[The anthropomorphizing of AI in military affairs does not mean that AI
is always given high marks. It is now cliché for some commentators to
contrast human "**creativity**]{.underline}" [with the "fundamental
brittleness" of machine learning approaches to AI]{.underline}, with an
often frank recognition of the "narrowness of machine intelligence."
This cautious commentary on AI may lead one to think that the
overestimation of AI in military affairs is not a pervasive problem. But
so long as the dominant standard by which we measure AI is human
abilities, merely acknowledging that humans are creative is not enough
to mitigate unhealthy anthropomorphizing of AI.

Even commentary on AI-enabled military technology that acknowledges AI's
shortcomings fails to identify the need for an AI education to be
grounded in cognitive science.

For example, Emma Salisbury writes in War on the Rocks that existing AI
systems rely heavily on "brute force" processing power, yet fail to
interpret data "and determine whether they are actually meaningful."
Such AI systems are prone to serious errors, particularly when they are
moved outside their narrowly defined domain of operation.

Such shortcomings reveal, as Joe Chapa writes on AI education in the
military, that an "important element in a person's ability to trust
technology is learning to recognize a fault or a failure." So, human
operators ought to be able to identify when AIs are working as intended,
and when they are not, in the interest of trust.

Some high-profile voices in AI research echo these lines of thought and
suggest that the cognitive science of human beings should be consulted
to carve out a path for improvement in AI. Gary Marcus is one such
voice, pointing out that just as humans can think, learn, and create
because of their innate biological components, so too do AIs like
AlphaGo excel in narrow domains because of their innate components,
richly specific to tasks like playing Go.

Moving from "narrow" to "general" AI --- the distinction between an AI
capable of only target recognition and an AI capable of reasoning about
targets within scenarios --- requires a deep look into human cognition.

The results of AI demonstrations --- like the performance of an
AI-enabled target recognition system --- are data. Just like the results
of human demonstrations, these data must be interpreted. The core
problem with anthropomorphizing AI is that even cautious commentary on
AI-enabled military technology hides the need for a theory of
intelligence. To interpret AI demonstrations, theories that borrow
heavily from the best example of intelligence available --- human
intelligence --- are needed.

The relevance of cognitive science for an AI military education goes
well beyond revealing contrasts between AI systems and human cognition.
Understanding the fundamental structure of the human mind provides a
baseline account from which artificially intelligent military technology
may be designed and evaluated. It possesses implications for the
"narrow" and "general" distinction in AI, the limited utility of
human-machine confrontations, and the developmental trajectories of
existing AI systems.

The key for military personnel is being able to frame and interpret AI
demonstrations in ways that can be trusted for both operation and
research and development. Cognitive science provides the framework for
doing just that.

Lessons for an AI Military Education

It is important that an AI military education not be pre-planned in such
detail as to stifle innovative thought. Some lessons for such an
education, however, are readily apparent using cognitive science.

First, **[we need to reconsider "narrow" and "general"
AI]{.underline}**. **[The distinction between narrow and general AI is a
distraction]{.underline}** --- far from dispelling the unhealthy
anthropomorphizing of AI within military affairs, [it merely tempers
expectations without engendering a deeper understanding of the
technology.]{.underline}

[The anthropomorphizing of AI stems from a poor understanding of the
human mind.]{.underline} This poor understanding is often the implicit
framework through which the person interprets AI. Part of this poor
understanding is taking a reasonable line of thought --- that the human
mind should be studied by dividing it up into separate capabilities,
like language processing --- and transferring it to the study and use of
AI.

The problem, however, is that these [separate capabilities of the human
mind do not represent the fullest understanding of human
intelligence]{.underline}. Human cognition is more than these
capabilities acting in isolation.

[Much of AI development thus proceeds under the banner of
engineering,]{.underline} as an endeavor not to re-create the human mind
in artificial ways but to perform specialized tasks, like recognizing
targets. A military strategist may point out that AI systems do not need
to be human-like in the "general" sense, but rather that Western
militaries need specialized systems which can be narrow yet reliable
during operation.

[This is a serious mistake for the long-term development of AI-enabled
military technology. Not only is the "narrow" and "general" distinction
a poor way of interpreting existing AI systems, but it **clouds** their
trajectories as well]{.underline}. [The "**fragility**" of existing
AIs]{.underline}, especially deep-learning systems, **[may persist so
long as a fuller understanding of human cognition is
absent]{.underline}** from their development. For this reason (among
others), Gary Marcus points out that "**[deep learning is hitting a
wall]{.underline}**."

An AI military education would not avoid this distinction but
incorporate a cognitive science perspective on it that allows personnel
in training to re-think inaccurate assumptions about AI.

Human-Machine Confrontations Are Poor Indicators of Intelligence

Second, pitting AIs against exceptional humans in domains like Chess and
Go are considered indicators of AI's progress in commercial domains. The
U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency participated in this
trend by pitting Heron Systems' F-16 AI against a skilled Air Force F-16
pilot in simulated dogfighting trials. The goals were to demonstrate
AI's ability to learn fighter maneuvers while earning the respect of a
human pilot.

These confrontations do reveal something: some AIs really do excel in
certain, narrow domains. But anthropomorphizing's insidious influence
lurks just beneath the surface: there are sharp limits to the utility of
human-machine confrontations if the goals are to gauge the progress of
AIs or gain insight into the nature of wartime tactics and strategies.

## Biotechnology

### Biotech\-\--Excludes SynthBio\-\--1NC

#### Biotech is distinct from synthbio\-\--it's not technologically advanced enough to encompass gene editing and bioengineering\-\--precludes the vast majority of capabilities described in the 1AC

**Diep '17** \[Patrick; 2017; Synthetic Biologist, PhD in Chemical
Engineering at the University of Toronto; "What is synthetic biology,"
Quora\]

[Clearing the Fog \| A Definition]{.underline}

A discipline is a branch of knowledge.\[2\]If it is a sub-branch, then
it is a sub-discipline. The term synbio is comprised of "synthetic" and
"biology." Biology is already a discipline with many sub-disciplines
(e.g. microbiology, immunology, molecular biology, etc.), but
"**[synthetic]{.underline}**" [is a descriptive word that alters what we
are referring to much like "computational" biology and "systems"
biology]{.underline}. Computational biology is the use of computational
systems to assist with exploration of and discoveries in biology.\[3\]
Systems biology, branching off from computational biology, models
biological systems largely to discover emergent properties and how they
arise.\[4\]\[5\]

"Synthetic" has interesting definitions, the most important being "made
by chemical synthesis, especially to imitate a natural
product."\[6\]Does this kind of work already exist in the discipline of
biology?

Not really. There are two generic sub-disciplines that come close to
this, in my opinion (though they're such large fields I'm not sure if
"sub-discipline" would still capture their individual significance[).
They are biotechnology and bioengineering]{.underline}.

[Biotechnology uses living systems and their components to **produce
things that we want**]{.underline}.\[7\]If you were to look through this
textbook on molecular biotechnology that I studied throughout two
courses, the **[biotechnology examples]{.underline}** that are [provided
are]{.underline}, **[at most]{.underline}**, **[mutagenesis of existing
genes]{.underline}** **[or splicing of genes together]{.underline}**.
[Promoters might be cloned around to accomplish specific goals, but no
where is there an example of making a promoter from nearly
scratch]{.underline}.\[8\] [Genes might be put together to form new
metabolic networks to produce some product, but **they aren't
characterizing and modularizing** these genes like electric circuit
components]{.underline}.\[9\]Perhaps the textbook is too old? Even this
recent molecular biotechnology textbook published last year barely
mentions synthetic biology. It uses the term 19 times covering only
7/622pgs, not counting citations.

[Bioengineering]{.underline} (or biomedical engineering) [use to be more
strictly defined by efforts on prosthetics and clinical/medical devices,
but the advent of DNA synthesis and attempts to characterize/modularize
genetic parts]{.underline} (i.e. promoters, tags, terminators, etc.)
allowed bioengineering to expand into cellular and molecular
biology.\[10\]\[11\]\[12\] [By "expand into" I mean "apply engineering
principles" to these life systems, which has lead to a spur in other
technologies: bioprocess engineering, stem cell engineering,
biomimetics, etc.]{.underline}

**[In relation to biotechnology, synbio is]{.underline}** what I argue
to be **[the evolved version.]{.underline}** **[What previous
biotechnology could not achieve, synbio strives to address those
challenges]{.underline}**. For example I mentioned promoter design
earlier. [Before synbio, "designing" promoters was more like "let's
mutate this and see which mutants do what we want."]{.underline} There
have been many attempts now to de novo design promoters, most recently
here\[13\].

In relation to bioengineering, synbio overlaps with it. There's a
blurred line whether synbio is a separate sub-discipline that can be
used in some bioengineering challenges, or if synbio is a product of
bioengineering, meaning that synbio is a sub-sub-discipline. My opinion
is the former because synbio does serve bioengineering, but synbio also
serves environmental\[14\], computational\[15\], and
aesthetic/artistic(!) challenges too\[16\]. Wikipedia seems to describe
bioengineering more generically by capturing all these themes, but
university websites describe their bioengineering programs as life
science-/health-based which leaves me the impression that bioengineering
is strongly-motivated by human health research\[17\]\[18\]\[19\]\[20\].
Honestly I wonder why? (#grantcommitteepriorities)

[Contrasting synbio, biotechnology and bioengineering is important
because those two are the closest sub-disciplines within the biology
umbrella to synbio.]{.underline} The differences are what define synbio.
Therefore, I conclude this to be the simplest definition:

[Synthetic biology is the characterization and modularization of life's
genetic parts to serve as tools to address challenges contingent on the
manipulation of life at the molecular level]{.underline}.

### Biotech\-\--AT: Excludes SynthBio\-\--2AC

#### 'Biotech' is broad\-\--and it contains synthetic bio as a subsidiary component

If today's technology headlines are any indication, the science fiction
of comic books is becoming science reality. Impenetrable skin and
resilience to gamma rays are no longer just for superheroes. For
instance, [scientists have recently discovered ways to create **spider
silk**]{.underline}, [an **innovative biotechnology**]{.underline} [that
can lead to **lighter**, **more flexible**]{.underline}, [and **stronger
body armor**]{.underline}. [And microscopic animals nicknamed "water

soldiers**]{.underline} [from the health effects of radiation exposure
by **boosting capacity for DNA repair**]{.underline} [or even
**preventing damage to DNA** in]{.underline} the first place.

**[Biotech]{.underline}**nology --- [a **broad term** used to describe
**technological innovation based on biology**]{.underline} --- [has
become an increasingly **agile platform for**]{.underline} [developing
new types of soldier enhancements]{.underline}. As such, the field
offers novel opportunities for improving warfighter survivability on the
battlefield. Despite recent developments, however, [the Department of
Defense has yet to strategically guide the development of these new
technologies at the national level]{.underline}. Recently, War on the
Rocks published an article outlining concerns about [the lack of
coordinated policy for developing synthetic biology -- a branch
of]{.underline} [biotechnology -- while preventing its misuse by
adversaries.]{.underline} The article rightly pointed to the need to
think strategically about the risk of [proliferating synthetic biology
capabilities]{.underline}, but this is [only one part of the
picture.]{.underline} Current national strategies encourage policymakers
to view advances in biology through a narrow lens of risks to national
security and the development of countermeasures to protect against those
risks, which, while crucial, neglects the promise for using the same
science to develop life-saving or other advanced tools for warfighters.
The Pentagon's current efforts to take advantage of synthetic biology as
a platform for defense lack internal cohesion and external direction,
and biological innovation faces further challenges given the absence of
agile business models to fully harness emerging biotechnologies for the
battlefield. Greater coordination between those in the Defense
Department whose work relates to biotechnology and improved
relationships with the private sector are important first steps toward
using this burgeoning area of science not just to mitigate security
risks, but also to benefit soldiers on the battlefield.

Biology, 1 one of the three primary natural sciences, like its
counterpart sciences of chemistry and physics, uses the experimental
method 3 Unlike its counterparts, however, the study of biology
inherently involves living things, including human beings. 4 Because of
this distinction, which implicates both human rights and the Hippocratic
Oath, 5 the experimental method becomes legally and ethically
unacceptable as a means of studying biology, at least when human
subjects are involved. 6 Further, [knowledge gleaned in this science
does not truly come to fruition until applied and used in the real world
through technological innovations, thus the term
\"biotechnology]{.underline}.\" 7

Although not officially defined until 1919 by Hungarian engineer, Karl
Ereky, 8 the first example of biotechnological innovations noted in
literature dates back well before Ereky\'s time to the selective
breeding of livestock and growing of crops during the Agricultural
Revolution. 9 Today, a sort of \"biotechnological age\" is being
realized, 10 as the United States (U.S.) Government, alone, invested
over \$ 18 billion in biotechnology research and development (R&D) for
fiscal year 2000. 11 This figure is dwarfed by the R&D budgets of large
pharmaceutical companies and other commercial investors. 12

Beyond the financial investment in biotechnology is the investment from
both individuals and society as a whole. Because the testing and use of
biotechnological products inherently involves living organisms from
microbes to human beings, 13 complex legal and ethical issues arise, the
solutions to which have yet to be answered, and, at times, even
addressed. Basic standards for research using human subjects have been
enunciated in international instruments beginning with the Nuremberg
Code, 14 but, as history has shown, the research context has often
dictated whether such standards would apply, and to what extent, in
actual practice. 15 Furthermore, research involving the use of human
\"materials,\" namely stem cells 17 raises perhaps even more
controversial issues than human subject research. Once biotechnology
products are developed, a new series of debates arises as to whether
their use is appropriate, and, if so, by whom and for what purpose, 18
as well as what may be done with information obtained through the
research or the use of biotechnology. 19

Ultimately, this question is presented: Do the benefits of biotechnology
outweigh risks associated with these unresolved issues? The answer may
depend on what stands to be lost if testing and use of biotechnology
products is not pursued. In the public health context, these products
provide potential solutions to pressing concerns in the national, as
well as global, arena. Developments in [genetically engineered foods and
drugs]{.underline}, for example[, pose alternatives to addressing issues
of world hunger and disease.]{.underline} [In the medical
context]{.underline}, **[biotechnology products have revolutionized
health care]{.underline}** [by providing new options for injury and
illness prevention, as well as treatment, in the form of
pharmaceuticals, procedures, and devices.]{.underline}

[Also affected on a global scale]{.underline} and, perhaps, ever so
evident with the recent threats of bioterrorism, are [the opportunities
biotechnology presents in the military context]{.underline}, 20 [which
is defined as \"the **exploitation and manipulation of biological
systems to benefit overall military capability**]{.underline}.\" 21

Assurance Technology Analysis Center (IATAC), \"history has shown that
an infusion of technology can provide a significant military advantage
to the side that first realizes its potential and exploits it.\" 22
However, the historical examples described, namely invention of the
tank, development of U.S. naval aviation capabilities, and technologies
emerging from the Information Revolution, fail to invoke the legal and
ethical complexities presented by biotechnological research,
development, and use in the military. Such concerns become particularly
relevant in light of the history of abuse of civilian and service member
subjects in research conducted or sponsored by the militaries of both
the U.S. 23 and its European Ally, the United Kingdom (U.K.). 24

## Cybersecurity

### Cybersecurity\-\--CIA Triad\-\--1NC

#### Cybersecurity policy must expand protections for the confidentiality, integrity, AND availability of data on computer systems and networks\-\--plans that don't address all three explicitly don't meet. 

Cybersecurity law promotes the confidentiality, , integrity, and
availability of public and private information, systems, and networks

**Kosseff '18** \[Jeff; March; Assistant Professor of Cybersecurity Law,
United States Naval Academy. J.D., Georgetown University Law Center;
M.P.P., B.A., University of Michigan; Iowa Law Review, "Defining
Cybersecurity Law," 103 Iowa L. Rev. 985, lexis\]

In late 2015, after years of attempts, Congress passed legislation to
enable companies to voluntarily share information about cybersecurity
threats - such as attempted hacks - with the federal government and
other companies. The bill, entitled the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, was
tucked into a massive omnibus appropriations bill as Division N. 1 The
Cybersecurity Act occupies 136 of the 2,009 pages in the omnibus bill,
and it in detail establishes rules for operators of private networks to
defend their networks, monitor possible threats, and collaborate with
the federal government. 2 The new law also bolsters the Department of
Homeland Security\'s (\"DHS\") cybersecurity efforts. The focus of the
legislation, not surprisingly, is cybersecurity; indeed,
\"cybersecurity\" appears in the bill nearly 200 times. 3

There is just one problem: [The Cybersecurity Act does not define
\"cybersecurity]{.underline}.\" [The statute allows companies to take
certain actions for a \"cybersecurity purpose,\" w]{.underline}hich it
defines as \"the purpose of protecting an information system or
information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an
information system from a cybersecurity threat or security
vulnerability.\" 4 The statute defines \"security vulnerability\" as
\"any attribute of hardware, software, process, or procedure that could
enable or facilitate the defeat of a security control.\" 5 The statute
defines \"cybersecurity threat\" as

an action, not protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of
the United States, on or through an information system that may result
in an unauthorized effort to adversely impact the security,
availability, confidentiality, or integrity of an information system or
information that is stored on, processed by, or transiting an
information system. 6

The statute also defines \"security control,\" 7 \"malicious cyber
command and control,\" 8 and \"cyber threat indicator.\" 9 Although
these definitions help to illuminate the purpose of the legislation, the
Cybersecurity Act does not directly explain what lawmakers meant by
\"cybersecurity.\"

[The statute fails to provide a concrete definition that sets forth the
scope and goals of cybersecurity law.]{.underline} Although the new
statute can function without the definition - and as described in Part
III of this Article: , is a significant improvement over existing law -
its omission of this key definition is illustrative of a larger problem:
[When policymakers talk about cybersecurity, they are not always talking
about the same concept.]{.underline}

A day rarely passes without another report of a major cybersecurity
incident. Hackers routinely breach the systems of retailers, stealing
consumer credit card data, social security numbers, and other valuable
personal information. 10 Attackers launch distributed denial-of-service
attacks, knocking some of the most popular websites offline for hours or
days. 11 Home security webcams become remote spying devices. 12 Even the
U.S. electoral system is compromised by hacks of the email accounts of
political officials and attacks on state elections systems. 13 In the
increasingly frequent news coverage of these attacks, commentators, and
lawmakers demand immediate and swift legal solutions to prevent further
damage. 14 The constant media coverage begs the question: [How well do
our existing laws address cybersecurity threats?]{.underline}

The short answer: **[Not well at all]{.underline}**. The slightly longer
answer: [The patchwork of U.S. statutes and regulations that constitute
cybersecurity law is an uncoordinated mishmash]{.underline} of
requirements that mostly were conceived long before modern
cyber-threats. [Modern]{.underline} U.S. cybersecurity [law stems from
century-old]{.underline} privacy [norms, torts, and criminal laws that
**bear little relation to the protection of the confidentiality,
integrity, or availability of systems, networks, and
data**]{.underline}.

In short, **[the U.S. legal system lacks a consistent definition
of]{.underline}** the term \"**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** law.\" This
Article: aims to fill that gap by defining \"cybersecurity law.\"
Although \"cybersecurity\" is a commonly used term in legal circles, [no
scholarship has stepped back to define exactly what \"cybersecurity
law\" is and]{.underline} the goals of statutes and regulations that aim
to promote \"cybersecurity.\" [By **defining the scope**]{.underline}
and goals [of this new legal field, policymakers can then examine how
lawmakers could improve existing laws.]{.underline} Part II of this
Article: briefly describes the cybersecurity challenges that the United
States faces by examining the cyberattack on Sony Pictures
Entertainment. Part III broadly examines current cybersecurity threats
to the United States and defines \"cybersecurity law\" as a legal
framework that \"promotes the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of public and private information, systems, and networks,
through the use of forward-looking regulations and incentives, with the
goal of protecting individual rights and privacy, economic interests,
and national security.\" Part IV of this Article: explains the current
U.S. legal regime for cybersecurity and concludes that many of the most
prominent cybersecurity laws only address a small portion of the broader
legal framework. Part V examines the gaps in current U.S. cybersecurity
law and suggests which areas of cybersecurity law policymakers could
better address.

One might argue that it is unnecessary to define a legal field. **[By
proposing a definition of \"cybersecurity]{.underline}** law,\" [**I
seek to offer the definition** as a broad taxonomy for policymakers and
courts as they develop **statutes**, **regulations**]{.underline}, [and
court rulings that could **shape cybersecurity**]{.underline} for
generations to come. By defining \"cybersecurity law,\" I suggest the
types of subjects that the law seeks to secure, the methods by which
cybersecurity law protects those subjects, and the reasons behind
cybersecurity law. Moreover, I intend this definition to do more than
merely add to a legal taxonomy; a clear definition of \"cybersecurity
law\" will provide policymakers with goals and guideposts as they debate
new laws to protect information, systems, and networks.

III\. Defining \"Cybersecurity Law\"

The Sony incident - and similar cybersecurity challenges that companies
and governments have faced - provide us with a roadmap for defining this
new area of law. A clear definition of \"cybersecurity law\" is
necessary for lawmakers, regulators, courts, and commentators to offer
solutions to these ongoing threats. This Part offers some elements of
the definition based on the experiences with incidents such as the
attack on Sony Pictures. This Part concludes with a suggested
comprehensive definition of \"cybersecurity law.\"

To form the definition, we must answer five fundamental questions that
examine the underlying values that should shape our cybersecurity laws:
(1) What are we securing?; (2) Where and whom are we securing?; (3) How
are we securing?; (4) When are we securing?; and (5) Why are we
securing?

After addressing these five framing questions[, this Article: proposes a
definition for \"cybersecurity law\" that takes into account the
important considerations in the field of cybersecurity]{.underline}.
This definition allows us to assess the current laws that are frequently
associated with cybersecurity and explore the areas where they are
lacking.

A. What Are We Securing?

[At the outset of any attempt to]{.underline} **[define
\"cybersecurity]{.underline}** law,\" [it is necessary to understand the
intended subject matter]{.underline}. In other words, what should the
law seek to secure? Based on the ongoing drumbeat of significant and
damaging cybersecurity incidents 44 and the increased vulnerability due
to the connection of everyday devices to the Internet, 45 [I
propose]{.underline} that \"**[cybersecurity]{.underline}** law\"
[broadly]{.underline} seek [to promote the confidentiality, integrity,
and availability of information, systems, and networks.]{.underline}

[Cybersecurity]{.underline} often [is **conflated**]{.underline},
particularly [in legal circles, with **data security**]{.underline}. 46
[Although data security is an important part]{.underline} [of
cybersecurity, it is only one part. Cybersecurity focuses not only on
the protection of data, but also on the systems and networks of the
public and private sector.]{.underline} In other words, [cybersecurity
involves **more** than **merely** the **protection of
data**.]{.underline}

[Consider]{.underline}, for example, the 2016 Distributed Denial of
Service (\"[DDOS]{.underline}\") attack on Dyn, [a relatively obscure
but exceptionally]{.underline} [important company that provides a large
portion of the domain name system that directs traffic on the
Internet]{.underline}. 47 A DDOS attack floods a targeted server with
traffic from multiple sources, causing a slowdown in traffic or a
complete shutdown. 48 Due to the DDOS attack on Dyn, Netflix, Twitter,
and other popular online services were unavailable for the majority of a
day. 49 Although the attack resulted in some data being unavailable, it
would not be characterized as a traditional data security compromise.
Instead, it was an attack that compromised an entire network. 50 Laws
focused exclusively on data - rather than networks and systems - will do
little to prevent and remediate harms such as the Dyn attack.

To be sure, data security is a vital component of cybersecurity. For
instance, the attack on Sony compromised a significant amount of the
company\'s valuable data, including confidential emails and unreleased
movies. That aspect of the attack attracted a great deal of publicity.
51 However, Sony also suffered great business harm due to the
unavailability of its systems and networks. 52 The attack on Sony, in
other words, was not merely an attack on the company\'s data security.
It was a comprehensive attack on Sony\'s cybersecurity. The attack
compromised more than just the confidentiality of Sony\'s information,
though it certainly had that effect as well. The attack compromised the
fundamental ability of Sony to carry out its routine business
operations.

[A focus on the security of systems and networks]{.underline} - and not
just information - [is necessary as physical devices are increasingly
**connected to the Internet**]{.underline}. For instance, [policymakers
and regulators are understandably concerned about a cyberattack on a
connected automobile that causes a highway crash, or a remote exploit of
a factory\'s control systems that causes explosions, physical injury,
and property damage]{.underline}. [53 By focusing exclusively on attacks
on information, cybersecurity law would not address such threats to
cyber-physical systems]{.underline}. Cybersecurity law should be
flexible enough to address not only the incidents that already have
occurred, but also potential future vectors of attack.

Therefore, [when we develop the contours for cybersecurity law, we must
develop a broader and more appropriate approach.]{.underline} The
National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies reflects such
an approach, as its definition of \"cybersecurity\" is \"the activity or
process, ability or capability, or state whereby information and
communications systems and the information contained therein are
protected from and/or defended against damage, unauthorized use or
modification, or exploitation.\" 54 This definition captures the need to
protect not only data, but also the systems on which data are stored and
the networks on which data are transmitted. [A definition of
\"cybersecurity law\" that includes this important aspect will focus on
the threats posed by cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[We have established that cybersecurity law should focus not only on the
security of information, but on systems and networks as
well.]{.underline} However, the law does not provide much clarity as to
what \"security\" means in the context of cybersecurity. Even though we
know that we are securing information, networks, and systems, what do we
mean by \"securing\"? Relatedly, how do we accomplish this task?

[Cybersecurity professionals commonly think about security as covering
three general categories of goals]{.underline}: (1)
[confidentiality]{.underline}; (2) [integrity]{.underline}; and (3)
[availability]{.underline}, known in the industry as **[the \"CIA
Triad.\"]{.underline}** 55 [Confidentiality refers to the \"the
prevention of unauthorized disclosure of information.\"]{.underline} 56
Confidentiality often is associated with data breaches because attackers
seek to obtain information without proper authorization. [Integrity
refers to \"the guarantee that the message that is sent is the same as
the message received and that the message is not altered in
transit]{.underline}.\" 57 The defacement of a company\'s website, for
example, is an example of a threat to data integrity. A threat to
integrity also could refer to the modification of a business\'s
financial records, as such a modification would cause internal chaos for
the business\'s operations. 58 [Availability refers to \"the guarantee
that information will be available to the consumer in a timely and
uninterrupted manner]{.underline} when it is needed regardless of
\[the\] location of the user.\" 59 [A DDOS attack that knocks
a]{.underline} popular [website offline]{.underline}, for example, [is
an attack on that site\'s availability.]{.underline}

The Sony Pictures attack threatened all three prongs of the CIA triad.
The hackers compromised the confidentiality of employees\' personal
information as well as the company\'s highly sensitive business
information. By altering the interface of the Sony Pictures internal
computer systems, the attackers compromised the integrity of Sony\'s
systems. The attack also harmed the availability of Sony\'s information
and systems, as employees were unable to access the network.

Likewise, the reports of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections
demonstrate attempts to attack the entire CIA triad. The hack of Clinton
campaign chairman John Podesta\'s emails was a classic compromise of
confidentiality. 60 But Russia at least attempted to do more than access
private emails. According to media reports, Russian hackers accessed
voter databases and other elections systems in 39 states. 61 These
attacks may have been attempts to compromise the integrity of U.S.
voting data. Had the hackers knocked the voting systems offline on
election day, the attacks would have compromised the availability of
information systems and networks that are fundamental to U.S. democracy.

As Part IV of this Article: explains, **[U.S.]{.underline}**
cybersecurity-related [laws heavily focus on only one prong of the CIA
Triad: confidentiality]{.underline}. This focus is because many of the
statutes and regulations that intersect with cybersecurity are
outgrowths of privacy law, which has a much more established field of
jurisprudence and theory that has developed over more than a century. 62
The conflation of privacy and cybersecurity is understandable, 63 as
many highly publicized cybersecurity incidents have involved breaches of
sensitive information. While cybersecurity law should be concerned about
preventing privacy violations, that should not be the unilateral focus
of our approach to cybersecurity law. To be sure, we want to make sure
that cybersecurity law attempts to prevent breaches of confidentiality
that invade individual privacy and exposes corporate intellectual
property and other sensitive information. However, cybersecurity law
should not focus on confidentiality to the exclusion of integrity and
availability. A comprehensive approach to cybersecurity law will
consider all three prongs of the CIA Triad.

A focus on integrity and availability is particularly important in the
Internet of Things era, as everyday devices, ranging from medical
devices to kitchen appliances to automobiles, are connected to the
Internet. 64 Imagine the chaos if hackers manage to disable thousands of
pacemakers, or cause vehicles to accelerate to 100 miles per hours as
they drive through Times Square. Such attacks have little to do with
confidentiality of information, and instead involve the integrity and
availability of systems and networks.

B. Where and Whom Are We Securing?

So far, we have determined that [cybersecurity law should promote the
confidentiality, integrity, and]{.underline} [availability of
information, systems, and networks]{.underline}. [We also must examine
which information, systems,]{.underline} [and networks should be
protected under cybersecurity law]{.underline}. [Should]{.underline}
U.S. [laws focus on bolstering the security of military and civilian
government systems? Or should the laws apply equally rigorous
requirements for private-sector cybersecurity]{.underline}? [This
confusion leads to both overlapping legal requirements and blind
spots]{.underline}, caused partly by the application of criminal and
international law principles to cyberspace. 65 The security of public
infrastructure often will face quite different legal requirements than
the security of private infrastructure. However, the policymakers should
consider the security of both types of systems and networks
comprehensively, and understand how the security (or lack thereof) of
one affects the other.

[The]{.underline} fundamental [design of the Internet would make it
impossible to **effectively address cybersecurity**]{.underline}
[exclusively through the]{.underline} information and infrastructure of
the [public sector. Government systems **intertwine with private
networks**]{.underline} [and rely on the infrastructure of
telecom]{.underline}munications [companies]{.underline},
[cloud]{.underline} storage [providers, and others in order to
operate]{.underline}. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office
recognized that one of the \"key challenges\" of securing Internet
infrastructure was the diffuse control among the private and public
sectors. 66 As described in Part IV of this Article: ,
cybersecurity-related laws largely have not adapted in the decade since
that report.

Often, [it is difficult to isolate a target of an attack as private or
public]{.underline} sector, just as it often is difficult to attribute
an attack to a state or nonstate actor. 67 [DDOS attacks, ransomware,
and other common attack vectors can quickly disperse around the
globe,]{.underline} and many do not discriminate between governments,
companies, and individuals. 68 Accordingly, any effective cybersecurity
law regime will seek to secure both the public sector and private
sector. As seen after the Sony Pictures attack, even if the initial
target is a private company that lacks strong links to the government,
the fallout of an attack on that company can have significant
ramifications for the federal government and international relations.
Therefore, it would be short-sighted for cybersecurity law to focus
exclusively on the public infrastructure and government information.

Accordingly, when policymakers develop cybersecurity laws, they should
consider the security of both public and private infrastructure and
information. As discussed in more detail in Part IV of this Article: ,
some U.S. cybersecurity laws focus exclusively on certain sectors and do
not consider how they operate in conjunction with laws that address
cybersecurity of other sectors. To the greatest extent possible,
cybersecurity law should operate harmoniously across sectors. It is
inevitable that highly sensitive information and systems - such as in
the healthcare sector - may face more rigorous laws than in other areas,
but those laws should not function in a black box.

C. How Are We Securing?

We have determined that we want to secure the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of public and private information, systems,
and networks. A difficult question - particularly in the context of
lawmaking - is how to achieve those goals. This debate often appears to
be a binary choice: coercive laws that deter inadequate cybersecurity
versus cooperative laws that provide incentives for companies and
government agencies to invest in cybersecurity. 69 I propose that
cybersecurity law focus on both coercive and cooperative laws, provided
that the regulations and incentives for both systems are aligned to
achieve similar goals.

The debate over coercive or cooperative laws is not new to the U.S.
legal system. For instance, environmental-law scholars for decades have
debated the most appropriate way to encourage companies to adapt their
business processes to minimize harm to the environment. 70 Advocates of
the coercive approach to environmental regulation argue that companies
seek to maximize profits, and therefore their \"decisions regarding
compliance are based on self-interest; businesses comply when the costs
of noncompliance outweigh the benefits of noncompliance.\" 71

A regulatory model based on coercion and deterrence assumes robust
government oversight through \"extensive government monitoring and
inspections coupled with penalties for observed violations.\" 72 The
penalties for noncompliance, therefore, must be sufficiently severe to
encourage companies to invest in compliance and, in many cases, forego
potential revenue. 73

Critics of the coercive approach in environmental regulation have
developed an alternative model, based on cooperation and incentives.
Under this model, the government\'s function is not \"to accumulate
evidence of violations for subsequent enforcement actions, but rather to
provide advice to regulated entities as a means of facilitating
compliance.\" 74 With this approach, companies are not only
profit-maximizers, but also \"institutions influenced by a mix of civic
and social motives.\" 75 For example, an environmental inspector would
suggest improvements rather than impose severe penalties.

The debate over regulation is not unique to environmental law.
Policymakers and academics have long debated how to best regulate
financial services, 76 consumer safety, 77 and other areas. 78 In most
of these areas, the end result is not a binary choice. Legal regimes
that apply to specific industries or sectors contain both coercive and
cooperative elements. 79

Cybersecurity law should contain a mix of penalty-based regulatory
deterrence along with cooperation and incentives. A unilateral focus on
coercion through regulation would be misguided, as there are many
opportunities for cooperative cybersecurity law. As described above,
cyberspace is a combination of public and private infrastructure. A
threat to a company\'s cybersecurity can harm the government, and vice
versa. Unlike other regulatory areas, regulators cannot achieve an ideal
level of cybersecurity exclusively through the actions (voluntary or
otherwise) of the private sector. Although a company\'s adoption of
cybersecurity measures could help to reduce the likelihood of a
successful cybersecurity incident, the ultimate chances of a successful
attack depend on many other factors, including law enforcement\'s
ability to deter hackers, the security of the company\'s service
providers, and whether the government and companies can quickly
communicate with each other about cybersecurity threats and defensive
measures. Accordingly, for cybersecurity law to succeed, it must foster
effective collaboration between the public and private sectors. As I
describe below, we have made some strides toward that goal, primarily
with the Cybersecurity Act of 2015. That statute takes the first
significant steps to encourage the private sector and federal government
to work together to identify and defend against cybersecurity threats.
However, the vast majority of the laws broadly considered to be related
to cybersecurity are punitive, and they do little to actually encourage
investments in cybersecurity.

The U.S. legal system should continue to penalize behavior that degrades
our nation\'s cybersecurity. The regulations, however, should have the
ultimate effect of encouraging companies to invest in cybersecurity.
Consider the Sony Pictures data breach. Three years earlier, in 2011,
Sony\'s Play Station network experienced one of the largest data
breaches in world history when tens of millions of customers\' accounts
(including credit card data) were compromised by hackers. 80 The company
faced costly class action litigation and regulatory inquiries, and it
reported that through the end of 2012, the breach cost the company \$
171 million. 81 Despite those regulatory and litigation costs - which
are far higher than those associated with an average cybersecurity
incident 82 - Sony did not sufficiently change its organizational
structure or invest in cybersecurity measures to prevent the Sony
Pictures attack three years later. 83 Of course, Sony\'s failure to
properly secure its networks does not mean that all companies would
react similarly to the threat of significant fines and litigation costs.
However, it demonstrates that for some companies, regulatory and
litigation penalties alone will not deter bad behavior.

The questionable efficacy of coercive cybersecurity regulation is
traceable, in part, to the relatively low costs of penalties for large
companies. Benjamin Dean of Columbia University\'s School of
International and Public Affairs analyzed the breaches at Sony Pictures,
Target, and Home Depot, concluding that the breaches cost less than one
percent of the companies\' annual revenues. 84 This suggests that fines,
court awards, and other expenses would need to be significantly higher
to encourage corporate executives to invest in cybersecurity, even at
the expense of other business units that might actually generate more
revenues, such as marketing. Moreover, Dean notes, even if companies
suffer significant expenses due to data breaches and other cybersecurity
incidents, they often can be at least partially reimbursed by insurance,
or they can write off those expenses. 85 This moral hazard, he reasoned,
means that it \"does not make economic sense for companies like Home
Depot to make large investments in information security.\" 86 The
cybersecurity vulnerabilities of individual companies - as seen in
recent attacks on Equifax, Dyn, Target, and Ashley Madison - pose a
significant risk to individuals and, in some cases, national interests.
However, our legal system has not yet created adequate incentives for
individual companies to take the necessary - and sometimes costly -
steps to reduce the likelihood of cybersecurity attacks.

To create an incentive for greater cybersecurity investments, the
government could raise the costs of data breaches to such a high level
that even large companies would go out of business if they suffered a
large data breach or other attack. The government could accomplish this
punitive goal by imposing astoundingly high fines on companies that
suffered from cybersecurity incidents, or by allowing plaintiffs to
recover large damages in class action lawsuits. However, this strategy
would be short-sighted for a few reasons. First, even companies that
invest heavily in cybersecurity cannot anticipate every future vector of
attack. A hyper-regulatory environment for cybersecurity likely would
threaten to penalize even the companies that attempted to make adequate
investments in safeguards. Second, and more practically, it is
politically unlikely that Congress or state legislatures would impose
fines so high that would threaten to put companies out of business.

That is not to say that cybersecurity should be a regulation-free zone.
Coercion can play an important and necessary role in cybersecurity law.
However, coercive measures should encourage the most effective
safeguards, and these measures should be fairly imposed. Most
importantly, coercive cybersecurity measures should be used in
conjunction with cooperative laws.

Cooperation is particularly important for cybersecurity law, as compared
to other business laws, because companies\' goals often - but not
always - are aligned with those of the government. It would be absurd
for a rational Chief Executive Officer to be entirely indifferent to a
cyberattack that cripples the company\'s operations for weeks. For
instance, it is safe to say that both the U.S. government and Sony
Pictures ultimately want to prevent another such attack. It is in the
national interests and Sony\'s corporate interests to avoid another
high-profile embarrassment at the hands of another country. In contrast,
corporate and government interests are not necessarily aligned for
environmental law. The federal government\'s goal may be to reduce
pollution and negative impacts on the environment, while an automaker\'s
goal may be to efficiently produce cars and maximize value to
shareholders. Accordingly, there is far more room for cooperation with
cybersecurity than with other areas. When we discuss cybersecurity law,
we should consider both cooperation and coercion, and determine the
appropriate blend that maximizes effective cybersecurity protections for
both the public and private sector.

The coercive and cooperative cybersecurity laws must be harmonious. For
instance, if the government determines that medical devices are
particularly vulnerable to attacks, it could take a multipronged
approach. First, the government could provide companies with the
technical guidance to adopt adequate safeguards for the devices, as the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") often does by
developing many cybersecurity controls. 87 Second, the government could
create tax incentives for device-makers to invest in the technology and
staff necessary to implement the controls. Third, the Food and Drug
Administration (\"FDA\") could refuse to approve new devices that have
not incorporated these controls into new products. Fourth, the FDA could
impose heavy fines on companies that do not maintain these safeguards
and fix vulnerabilities in existing devices. The government need not
choose only one of these options. Rather, all four approaches could
achieve a common goal.

In short, a well-conceived legal framework will include incentives and
penalties, and ensure that those policies achieve a common goal of
improving cybersecurity. A legal system that consists entirely of
coercion or entirely of cooperation likely will have limited success.
The challenge for policymakers is to determine how to use a combination
of penalties and incentives to most effectively encourage companies to
adopt safeguards.

D. When Are We Securing?

By asking \"when are we securing?,\" we must assess whether
cybersecurity laws should focus on events that already have occurred, or
if they should attempt to build resilience and defenses to prevent the
attacks from occurring in the future.

To the greatest extent possible, cybersecurity law should be
forward-looking. Cybersecurity law should prevent cybersecurity
incidents from ever occurring, and if incidents do occur, cybersecurity
law should help companies and government recover as quickly as possible
and prevent future harmful events.

This element of the definition sounds obvious, but [many of our laws are
backward-looking. They require companies and regulators to litigate the
minute details of incidents that already have occurred.]{.underline} [In
some cases, such retrospection may be valuable]{.underline}, as it can
help companies and governments avoid repeating past mistakes. However,
[the ultimate focus always should be on preventing additional attacks
and losses from occurring in the future.]{.underline}

[The necessity of a forward-looking component of cybersecurity law is
most apparent in any discussion of **cyber-resilience**]{.underline},
[an **increasing focus** of]{.underline} [cybersecurity
professionals.]{.underline} 88 In 2013, President Obama issued
Presidential Policy Directive 21, which encouraged the cybersecurity of
critical infrastructure, such as the electric grid. 89 The Directive
defines \"[resilience\" as \"the ability to prepare for and adapt to
changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from
disruptions,\"]{.underline} and it states that \"resilience includes the
ability to withstand and recover from deliberate attacks, accidents, or
naturally occurring threats or incidents.\" 90 The DHS has stated that
resilience measures include business continuity plans, back-up power
generators, and durable building materials. 91 [This]{.underline}
growing - and entirely justified - focus on resilience [requires
cybersecurity law to be forward-looking]{.underline} and consider not
only how to prevent cybersecurity incidents from occurring (either
through coercion or cooperation), but also how to recover from
cybersecurity incidents once they have occurred.

[This is not to say that cybersecurity laws should not address
cybersecurity incidents that already have occurred.]{.underline}
Companies that have been particularly negligent or reckless with their
cybersecurity safeguards should expect to face consequences, such as
regulatory investigations, fines, and lawsuits. Large fines and
judgments could set an example for other companies and motivate them to
invest in stronger cybersecurity safeguards. But the ultimate goal of
penalties for past cybersecurity incidents should be deterrence of
future events.

E. Why Are We Securing?

To fully define the scope of cybersecurity law, we must fully articulate
our ultimate goals. The government should not impose regulations or make
substantial investments until there is a more thorough understanding of
why it is doing so.

The Sony Pictures attack caused great harm and embarrassment to
individuals by allowing egregious privacy violations. The cyberattack
also damaged Sony\'s business interests by exposing its confidential
business information and significantly reducing the value of its movies.
Finally, the incident threatened U.S. national security and further
strained the U.S. government\'s relationship with North Korea. In short,
the Sony Pictures attack (and others like it) highlight three distinct
types of harm that cybersecurity law should seek to provide: (1) harm to
individuals; (2) harm to business interests; and (3) harm to national
security.

The first reason to enact cybersecurity laws is to prevent and mitigate
harm to individuals. This harm often involves privacy violations, 92
such as the disclosure of the email messages of Sony executives and the
personal information of Sony employees. Such disclosures are highly
embarrassing and can have dramatic effects on individuals\' lives.
Courts and legislators often focus on the financial harm to
individuals - such as the consequences of identity theft - caused by
data breaches. Indeed, in some consumer lawsuits against companies that
have experienced data breaches, courts have refused to find that the
plaintiffs have Article: III standing unless the plaintiffs demonstrate
that they have actually suffered identity theft as a result of the
breach. 93 However, cybersecurity law - both statutes and court
rulings - should attempt to prevent not only identity theft and other
financial harm; cybersecurity law should address all potential harm to
individuals caused by cybersecurity incidents. Daniel J. Solove and
Danielle Keats Citron recently articulated this wide spectrum of harms
by making a compelling case for courts to recognize the intangible harms
of data breaches, such as increased anxiety among consumers:

The harm from an increased risk of identity theft is akin to the risk of
contracting a chronic disease. The risk of a data breach is ongoing.
Data breach notification letters explicitly inform people that there is
a risk of identity theft. Credit monitoring services are offered for one
or two years, signaling to plaintiffs an increased risk of theft for
that time period. When a person has a reasonable belief that her credit
identity is in jeopardy, she is rightly afraid that her creditworthiness
is out of her hands. 94

The concern about anxiety-related harms to individuals could be seen
after the 2015 data breach of Ashley Madison, a site that allowed users
to seek extramarital affairs. 95 Despite the lack of concrete financial
harm, the public disclosure of the names of Ashley Madison customers had
far-reaching effects, including job resignations and suicides. 96

The second reason to enact cybersecurity laws is to prevent economic
harm to companies. On average, a data breach costs a company
approximately \$ 4 million, and the cost per stolen record is
approximately \$ 158, according to a recent report by the Ponemon
Institute for IBM. 97 According to the report, a U.S. company has a 26%
chance of experiencing a breach within 24 months of at least 10,000
records. 98 On aggregate, cybersecurity incidents take a significant
economic toll. A recent study estimated that the aggregate cost of data
breaches will exceed \$ 2 trillion in 2019. 99 Cybersecurity law should
attempt to reduce these negative impacts both on individual companies
and the economy as a whole.

Finally, cybersecurity law must incorporate the national security
interests of the United States. In the Sony incident, these concerns
came to the forefront when the United States attributed the attack to
North Korea and imposed sanctions, at the time an unprecedented move
after a cyberattack. Similarly, Russia\'s interference in the 2016 U.S.
election, via cyberattacks, threatened to fundamentally undercut the
confidence and legitimacy of the U.S. democratic system. Even if the
attacks target entirely private infrastructure - such as the email
system of a political party - the consequences for the public and
national security can be far-reaching.

Moreover, attacks on critical infrastructure - even if it is owned and
operated by the private sector - can severely harm national security.
President Obama recognized this danger in Presidential Policy Directive
21, writing of the need \"to strengthen and maintain secure,
functioning, and resilient critical infrastructure - including assets,
networks, and systems - that are vital to public confidence and the
Nation\'s safety, prosperity, and well-being.\" 100 To date, the United
States has not suffered a devastating cyberattack on critical
infrastructure that has caused significant physical damage, but serious
critical infrastructure attacks have occurred in other countries. For
instance, in 2007, Estonia, a small nation that is highly dependent on
the Internet, suffered a massive economic slowdown after its
cyber-infrastructure was hit with massive denial-of-service attacks. 101
In 2015, Ukraine suffered a cyberattack that caused blackouts for more
than 80,000 people for several hours. 102 U.S. cyber officials have
reported a rapid increase in the number of attacks on critical
infrastructure, such as the industrial control systems of utilities. 103
Such attacks not only threaten economic and business interests; they can
cause injuries, death, and national unrest. Accordingly, national
security must be among the top considerations of cybersecurity law.

F. [A Proposed Definition of \"Cybersecurity Law\"]{.underline}

Factoring in all of these considerations, [we can develop a broad and
flexible definition that provides the general parameters and **scope of
cybersecurity** law]{.underline}. By providing this definition, this
Article: does not intend to suggest that cybersecurity law should be
limited to a particular set of policy prerogatives. Rather, this
Article: identifies areas **[that should be considered when we develop
and refine laws that address cybersecurity]{.underline}**:

[Cybersecurity]{.underline} law [promotes the **confidentiality**,
**integrity**, and **availability of public and private information,
systems, and networks**, through the use of forward-looking regulations
and incentives]{.underline}, with the goal of protecting individual
rights and privacy, economic interests, and national security.

another**. **The more one is dependent on the internet**]{.underline},
i.e. the more services one's company provides via and using the
internet, [**the bigger the cyber threat** and the more comprehensive
one's cybersecurity efforts and commitments should be.]{.underline}

[Relating cybersecurity and cybersecurity governance directly to their
enterprise's exposure to cyber space, and explaining that this exposure,
widens the potential attack from cyber criminals, should simplify
matters.]{.underline} It would furnish executive management and BoDs
with a clearer understanding of why cybersecurity governance has become
such an important aspect lately, requiring their direct and dedicated
attention.

information security and the governance thereof, used to be, and still
is, very important in every modern-day enterprise, but cybersecurity and
cybersecurity governance have grown to become critical issues today,
calling for the direct attention and oversight of BoDs and executive
management.

Information security, through the activity referred to as information
security governance, was and still is an important responsibility of the
BoDs, and it forms part of their general governance mandate. In the
light of the recent proliferation of business activities and processes
utilizing cyber space (the internet), the extent of the cyber-related
risks has increased to such an extent that the BoDs and executive
management must pay more attention to the potential (negative) effects
thereof. It would certainly be negligent not to do so. For this reason,
understanding what cybersecurity entails has become very important to
BoDs, to properly govern cybersecurity in this time and age. This is
certainly non-negotiable to any modern BoD.

BoDs must demand to be informed and made aware of the enterprise's
involvement in and exposure to cyber space. Once the BoD realizes the
extent of the enterprise's exposure to cyber space, they should ensure
that they understand the associated risks of this exposure. Once the BoD
has understood (evaluated) the situation, it must demand (direct) that a
plan of action to address these risks is put in place. Subsequently, the
board must ensure that it regularly gets updated on (monitor) the risk
status. These aspects should feature as a permanent BoD agenda item, and
they would assist BoDs in properly governing cybersecurity.

them, and they must access data from appropriate databases to fabricate
the components in question. Compromising these programs or data could
cause the components to be fabricated in ways that are slightly off from
the specification. Such imperfections would likely be caught in
subsequent inspections, but their deliberate introduction into the
fabrication process would be a definite minus for quality control.

A New Definition of Cybersecurity

[We propose the following definition, which integrates key concepts
drawn from the literature and engagement with the multidisciplinary
group:]{.underline}

[Cybersecurity is the organization and collection of resources,
processes, and structures used to protect cyberspace and
cyberspace-enabled systems from occurrences that **misalign de jure from
de facto property rights.**]{.underline}

We deconstruct this definition as follows:

\...the organization and collection of resources, processes, and
structures...: This aspect captures the multiple, interwoven dimensions
and inherent complexity of cybersecurity, which ostensibly involve
interactions between humans, between systems, and between humans and
systems. By avoiding discussion of which resources, processes, or
structures, the definition becomes non-prescriptive and recognizes the
dynamic nature of cybersecurity.

...used to protect cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems...: This
aspect includes protection, in the broadest sense, from all threats,
including intentional, accidental, and natural hazards. This aspect also
incorporates the traditional view of cyberspace but includes those
systems that are not traditionally viewed as part of cyberspace, such as
computer control systems and cyber-physical systems. By extension, the
protection applies to assets and information of concern within
cyberspace and connected systems.

...from occurrences...: This aspect recognizes that \"protections\" are
intended to address the full range of intentional events, accidental
events, and natural hazards. It also suggests that some of the
occurrences are unpredictable.

...that misalign de jure from de facto property rights...: This aspect
incorporates the two separate notions of ownership and control that
dominate discussion of cybersecurity and digital assets introduced in
the property rights framework of Ostrom and Hess (2007), which include
access, extraction, contribution, removal, management, exclusion, and
alienation. [Any event or activity that misaligns actual]{.underline}
(de facto) [property rights from perceived (de jure) property rights,
whether by intention or accident, whether known or unknown, is a
cybersecurity incident.]{.underline}

[Substantiating Our Definition]{.underline}

As discussed earlier, our [definition should engender greater
interdisciplinary and collaborative efforts on
cybersecurity]{.underline}. Our goal is to "bring together" not to "push
apart" or "isolate". Our success (or failure) can be partly validated if
we can demonstrate that:

We can map other definitions of cybersecurity into our definition.

[Our definition is unifying and inclusive in that it supports
interdisciplinarity.]{.underline}

[To assist in the analysis and mapping of the definitions to our new
definition, we identified conceptual categories from definitions drawn
from the literature as well as our own definition]{.underline} (Table
2). Unless otherwise cited, the category definitions are drawn largely
from the Oxford (2014) online dictionary. The exact wordings of the
definitions are meant to be as encompassing as possible.

This analysis helps to demonstrate that [our new definition is inclusive
of key components]{.underline} from a sample of extant and participant
definitions. Furthermore, three of the dominant themes -- technological
solutions; strategies, processes, and methods; and human engagement --
are all refinements of the "the organization and collection of
resources, processes, and structures used to protect\..." component of
our definition. The dominant theme of "events" is a refinement of
"occurrences." We also view "referent objects (of security)" as a
refinement of "cyberspace and cyberspace-enabled systems."
Retrospectively, we therefore show how our definition is consistent with
the dominant themes of cybersecurity and reflects the previously
identified distinguishing aspects. Therefore, this mapping illustrates
how our definition supports interdisciplinarity.

Conclusion

[We have provided a new, more inclusive, and unifying definition of
cybersecurity that we believe will enable an enhanced and enriched focus
on interdisciplinary cybersecurity dialectics and, thereby]{.underline},
[will influence the approaches of researchers, funding agencies, and
organizations to cybersecurity challenges.]{.underline} For example,
[the new definition and associated perspectives could lead to changes in
public policy and **inform legislative actions**]{.underline}.

Abstract

[Cybersecurity is a broadly used term, whose definitions are highly
variable, often subjective, and at times, uninformative. The absence of
a concise, broadly acceptable definition that captures the
multidimensionality of cybersecurity impedes technological and
scientific advances by reinforcing the predominantly technical view of
cybersecurity]{.underline} while separating disciplines that should be
acting in concert to resolve complex cybersecurity challenges. In
conjunction with an in-depth literature review, we led multiple
discussions on cybersecurity with a diverse group of practitioners,
academics, and graduate students to examine multiple perspectives of
what should be included in a definition of cybersecurity. In this
article, we propose a resulting new definition: \"[Cybersecurity is the
organization and collection of resources, processes, and structures used

Introduction

The term \"cybersecurity\" has been the subject of academic and popular
literature that has largely viewed the topic from a particular
perspective. Based on the literature review described in this article,
we found that [the term is used broadly and its definitions are highly
variable, context-bound, often subjective]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}, at times, [uninformative]{.underline}. There is a
paucity of literature on what the term actually means and how it is
situated within various contexts. The absence of a concise, broadly
acceptable definition that captures the multidimensionality of
cybersecurity potentially impedes technological and scientific advances
by reinforcing the predominantly technical view of cybersecurity while
separating disciplines that should be acting in concert to resolve
complex cybersecurity challenges. For example, there is a spectrum of
technical solutions that support cybersecurity. However, these solutions
alone do not solve the problem; there are numerous examples and
considerable scholarly work that demonstrate the challenges related to
organizational, economic, social, political, and other human dimensions
that are inextricably tied to cybersecurity efforts (e.g., Goodall et
al., 2009; Buckland et al., 2010; Deibert, 2012). Fredrick Chang (2012),
former Director of Research at the National Security Agency in the
United States discusses the interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity:

"A science of cybersecurity offers many opportunities for advances based
on a multidisciplinary approach, because, after all, cybersecurity is
fundamentally about an adversarial engagement. Humans must defend
machines that are attacked by other humans using machines. So, in
addition to the critical traditional fields of computer science,
electrical engineering, and mathematics, perspectives from other fields
are needed."

In attempting to arrive at a more broadly acceptable definition aligned
with the true interdisciplinary nature of cybersecurity, [we reviewed
relevant literature to identify the **range of definitions**, to
**discern dominant themes**]{.underline}, [and to distinguish aspects of
cybersecurity]{.underline}. [This research was augmented by **multiple
engagements** with a multidisciplinary group of cybersecurity
practitioners, academics, and graduate students]{.underline}. Together,
[these]{.underline} two activities [resulted in a new, more inclusive,
and unifying definition of cybersecurity that will hopefully enable an
enhanced and enriched focus]{.underline} on interdisciplinary
cybersecurity dialectics and thereby influence the approaches of
academia, industry, and government and non-government organizations to
cybersecurity challenges. This article reflects the process used to
develop a more holistic definition that better situates cybersecurity as
an interdisciplinary activity, consciously stepping back from the
predominant technical view by integrating multiple perspectives.

Literature Review

Our literature review spanned a wide scope of sources, including a broad
range of academic disciplines including: computer science, engineering,
political studies, psychology, security studies, management, education,
and sociology. The most common disciplines covered in our literature
review are engineering, technology, computer science, and security and
defence. But, to a much lesser extent, there was also evidence of the
topic of cybersecurity in journals related to policy development, law,
healthcare, public administration, accounting, management, sociology,
psychology, and education.

Cavelty (2010) notes [there are multiple interlocking discourses
around]{.underline} the field of [cybersecurity]{.underline}.
Deconstructing the term cybersecurity helps to situate the discussion
within both domains of \"cyber\" and \"security\" and reveals some of
the legacy issues. "Cyber" is a prefix connoting cyberspace and refers
to electronic communication networks and virtual reality (Oxford, 2014).
It evolved from the term \"cybernetics\", which referred to the "field
of control and communication theory, whether in machine or in the
animal" (Wiener, 1948). The term \"cyberspace\" was popularized by
William Gibson's 1984 novel, Neuromancer, in which he describes his
vision of a three-dimensional space of pure information, moving between
computer and computer clusters where people are generators and users of
the information (Kizza, 2011). What we now know as cyberspace was
intended and designed as an information environment (Singer & Friedman,
2013), and there is an expanded appreciation of cyberspace today. For
example, Public Safety Canada (2010) defines cyberspace as "the
electronic world created by interconnected networks of information
technology and the information on those networks. It is a global commons
where... people are linked together to exchange ideas, services and
friendship." Cyberspace is not static; it is a dynamic, evolving,
multilevel ecosystem of physical infrastructure, software, regulations,
ideas, innovations, and interactions influenced by an expanding
population of contributors (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010), who represent
the range of human intentions.

[As for the term \"security\"]{.underline}, in the literature we
reviewed, **[there appeared to be no broadly accepted
concept]{.underline}**, and the term has been notoriously hard to define
in the general sense (Friedman & West, 2010; Cavelty, 2008). According
to Buzan, Wæver, and Wilde (1998), discourses in security necessarily
include and seek to understand who securitizes, on what issues
(threats), for whom (the referent object), why, with what results, and
under what conditions (the structure). Although there are more concrete
forms of security (e.g., the physical properties, human properties,
information system properties, or mathematical definitions for various
kinds of security), the term takes on meaning based on one's perspective
and what one values. It remains a contested term, but a central tenet of
security is being free from danger or threat (Oxford, 2014). Further,
although we have indicated that security is a contested topic, Baldwin
(1997) states that one cannot use this designation as "an excuse for not
formulating one's own conception of security as clearly and precisely as
possible".

As a result of our literature review, we selected nine definitions of
cybersecurity that we felt provided the material perspectives of
cybersecurity:

"Cybersecurity consists largely of defensive methods used to detect and
thwart would-be intruders." (Kemmerer, 2003)

"Cybersecurity entails the safeguarding of computer networks and the
information they contain from penetration and from malicious damage or
disruption." (Lewis, 2006)

"Cyber Security involves reducing the risk of malicious attack to
software, computers and networks. This includes tools used to detect
break-ins, stop viruses, block malicious access, enforce authentication,
enable encrypted communications, and on and on." (Amoroso, 2006)

"Cybersecurity is the collection of tools, policies, security concepts,
security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions,
training, best practices, assurance and technologies that can be used to
protect the cyber environment and organization and user\'s assets."
(ITU, 2009)

"The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from
cyber-attacks." (CNSS, 2010)

"The body of technologies, processes, practices and response and
mitigation measures designed to protect networks, computers, programs
and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access so as to ensure
confidentiality, integrity and availability." (Public Safety Canada,
2014)

"The art of ensuring the existence and continuity of the information
society of a nation, guaranteeing and protecting, in Cyberspace, its
information, assets and critical infrastructure." (Canongia & Mandarino,
2014)

"The state of being protected against the criminal or unauthorized use
of electronic data, or the measures taken to achieve this." (Oxford
University Press, 2014)

"The activity or process, ability or capability, or state whereby
information and communications systems and the information contained
therein are protected from and/or defended against damage, unauthorized
use or modification, or exploitation." (DHS, 2014)

Although some of these definitions include references to non-technical
activities and human interactions, they demonstrate the predominance of
the technical perspective within the literature. As stated by Cavelty
(2010), the discourse and research in cybersecurity "necessarily shifts
to contexts and conditions that determine the process by which key
actors subjectively arrive at a shared understanding of how to
conceptualize and ultimately respond to a security threat". Accordingly,
within their particular context, the definitions above are helpful but
do not necessarily provide a holistic view that supports
interdisciplinarity. Referring back to Buzan, Wæver, and Wilde's (1998)
discussion of securitization studies, any definition should be able to
capture an understanding of the actor, subject, the referent object, the
intentions and purposes, the outcomes, and structure. In our review of
the literature, we did not find a definition that is inclusive,
impactful, and unifying. Cybersecurity is a complex challenge requiring
interdisciplinary reasoning; hence, any resulting definition must
attract currently disparate cybersecurity stakeholders, while being
unbiased, meaningful, and fundamentally useful.

Towards a New Definition

Faced with many definitions of cybersecurity from the literature, we
opted for a pragmatic qualitative research approach to support the
definitional process, which melds objective qualitative research with
subjective qualitative research (Cooper, 2013). In effect, the result is
a notional definition that is grounded in objectivity (e.g., an
intrusion-detection system) versus supposition (e.g., the intentions of
a hacker). This definitional process included: a review of the
literature, the identification of dominant themes and distinguishing
aspects, and the development of a working definition. This definition
was in turn introduced to the multidisciplinary group discussions for
further exploration, expansion, and refinement to arrive at the posited
definition.

Dominant themes

In our literature review, we identified five dominant themes of
cybersecurity: i) technological solutions; ii) events; iii) strategies,
processes, and methods; iv) human engagement; and v) referent objects
(of security). Not only do these themes support the interdisciplinary
nature of cybersecurity, but, in our view, help to provide critical
context to the definitional process.

Distinguishing aspects

In conjunction with the emergence of the themes, we formulated
distinguishing aspects of cybersecurity, initially through discussion
amongst the authors to be refined later through the multidisciplinary
group discussions. In the end, we identified that cybersecurity is
distinguished by:

its interdisciplinary socio-technical character

being a scale-free network, in which the capabilities of network actors
are potentially broadly similar

high degrees of change, connectedness, and speed of interaction

Through the process, there was consensus within the multidisciplinary
group to adopt the view that the Internet is a scale-free network (e.g.,
Barabási & Albert, 1999), meaning it is a network whose degree
distribution follows a power law, at least asymptotically. Even though
this characterization of the Internet is a subject of debate (e.g.,
Wallinger et al., 2009), we argue that there are cyber-attack scenarios,
and especially the evolution of malware markets, where the capabilities
for launching attacks has been largely commoditized, hence flattening
the space of network actors.

Throughout the initial part of the process that resulted in a working
paper, we intentionally attempted to redress the technical bias of
extant definitions in the cybersecurity literature by ensuring that
scholars and practitioners contributed to the discussion and were
provided an opportunity to review and comment on our initial definition,
themes, and distinguishing aspects. To expand the discussion and create
additional scholarly dialogue, we posited an original \"seed\"
definition for discussion and further refinement during two three-hour
engagements with a multidisciplinary group of cybersecurity
practitioners, academics, industry experts from the VENUS Cybersecurity
Institute, and graduate students in the Technology Innovation Management
(TIM) program at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.

Emergent definitions of cybersecurity

Our engagement with the multidisciplinary group primarily consisted of
providing selected readings from the literature, an initial presentation
and discussion of our own work to date, followed by a syndicate activity
related to distinguishing aspects and defining cybersecurity. Three
syndicates were formed from the group and they were asked to develop
their own definitions. These definitions, along with the authors' brief
critiques, are presented in Table 1. The first two definitions were
developed by the authors, whereas the next three definitions arose from
group participants.

**[If You Can't Properly Define]{.underline} Cybersecurity[, How Can You
Know What It Is?]{.underline}**

[It's clear that the cybersecurity industry hasn't been able to agree
upon what cybersecurity is and isn't. Even NIST]{.underline}, who is
responsible for the definition of technical terms used by the U.S.
Federal Government, [has four different definitions of cybersecurity! At
a minimum, there are dozens of different definitions of]{.underline}
[cybersecurity currently in use. Nearly all are **incomplete in scope**,
some are **horridly wrong,** and nearly all fail to differentiate
between cybersecurity and its **information security
cousin**.]{.underline}

Background

If you look up the definition of "cybersecurity," most of the answers
you get are laughable. Most appear to be written by some "expert" with
no actual concept of what cybersecurity is. [Nearly all of those
definitions sound as though they were written by an academic
pontificating what he thinks cybersecurity theoretically should
be]{.underline}, without himself ever having done any actual hands-on
cybersecurity engineering.

Until July 2019, the sole "official" definition of cybersecurity (as
defined by NIST) was: "The ability to protect or defend the use of
cyberspace from cyber attacks." Hyper-informative, wasn't it? It's about
like telling a man who's never seen a donut that, "A donut is a pastry
shaped like a donut torus." \[See note 1.\]

Then, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. Now NIST can't
even agree within itself what cybersecurity is! It now four different
definitions of cybersecurity! None of them tell you anything
particularly useful about cybersecurity. Those definitions of
cybersecurity are: \[2\]

Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers,
electronic communications systems, electronic communications services,
wire communication, and electronic communication, including information
contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity,
authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber
attacks.

The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and
responding to attacks.

The prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, exploitation of, and
--- if needed --- the restoration of electronic information and
communications systems, and the information they contain, in order to
strengthen the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these
systems.

If you search online for a definition of cybersecurity, most definitions
are just as bad --- if not worse --- than the definitions NIST provides.
Here are some examples:

Measures taken to protect a computer or computer system (as on the
Internet) against unauthorized access or attack. \[3\]

The art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized
access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information. \[4\]

May also be referred to as information technology security. \[5\]

The preventative techniques used to protect the integrity of networks,
programs and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. \[6\]

The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital
attacks. \[7\]

The protection of information assets by addressing threats to
information processed, stored, and transported by internetworked
information systems. \[14\]

Notice [the pattern? The definitions all talk about defending
**computers**, **networks**, and **data**]{.underline}. [That isn't what
cybersecurity is. That's what **information security** is! Plus, the
scope is strictly digital in many cases]{.underline}. Clearly, [whoever
wrote those definitions have no experience with **industrial controls
security**, where **even analogue devices can be at risk of
attack**]{.underline}. \[8\]

We have two problems here. First, we have failed to define what
cybersecurity adequately or accurately is. Worse, [we are trying to
somehow shoehorn cybersecurity into being either the same as information
security]{.underline} or some subset of information security. It isn't,
and I'll go into detail why in a minute.

So, if we can't even agree upon what cybersecurity is, how can we
possibly expect to create reasonably secure systems and products that
depend upon an in-depth understanding of cybersecurity?

Clearly, we can't.

And, the problem is compounded by the mindset that the same tools and
techniques used for information security are applicable to
cybersecurity. Yes, most information security tools and techniques can
be applied to cybersecurity, but cybersecurity requires tools and
techniques which go far beyond those of information security.

[How can we expect to secure our systems when we are using the wrong
tools]{.underline}? Or, at best, an incomplete set of tools?

Again, clearly, we can't.

In my professional opinion, the root of the problem we're facing is that
too many "cybersecurity experts" began their careers as "information
security experts" and never have had actual hands-on cybersecurity
experience beyond applying partial aspects of cybersecurity to
information systems. Thus, we are left with information-centric
definitions of cybersecurity, where the "experts" have tried to mold
cybersecurity into the shape of information security.

Well, it's time to break that mold!

Let's get started with a few definitions.

Definitions

First, [let's define security:]{.underline}

[Security is the protection of assets from threats.]{.underline}

That's fairly clear, but let's dissect it to ensure the subtleties are
covered:

Assets are anything tangible or intangible that has value. In the
context of security, usage of the word ["asset" usually refers to a
"protected asset."]{.underline}

[Protected Assets are any asset protected by a security
service]{.underline}. Examples of protected assets could include: data
or information (electronic or physical), network and computing
infrastructure, software, products and associated intellectual property,
people (employees, customers, vendors), real estate and personal
property, and utilities and other critical infrastructure. That is,
anything of value is a potential protected asset.

Security Services are any threat reduction capability provided by
security. There are five generally recognized security services:
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and
Access-Control. (See the blog post, What Are The Fundamental Services
Provided By Security? Hint: CIA Is Not The Answer for additional
details.)

[Threats are anything with the potential to cause harm]{.underline}. For
example, the potential for an attack to occur. Threats can be either
[intentional]{.underline} (e.g., [sabotage]{.underline}) or
[accidental]{.underline} (e.g., [aircraft]{.underline} bird strike), and
they can be both [man-made events]{.underline} (e.g., [human
errors]{.underline}, cyber attacks, power failures, and network outages)
[or natural events]{.underline} (e.g., fires, floods, earthquakes,
hurricanes, and tornados). Also, see security threats, below.

Attacks are any action taken against an asset with the intention of
causing harm.

[Security Threats are anything that may cause harm to a protected
asset]{.underline} and/or associated entities. For example, whereas a
security threat that discloses personally identifiable information would
most likely inflict minimal harm to the asset that held the disclosed
information, the disclosure itself could do considerable harm to both
the organization's brand and to the individuals whose information was
disclosed. There are seven generally recognized categories of security
threats: Denial of Access, Forgery, Spoofing, Repudiation, Unauthorized
Access, Unauthorized Disclosure, and Unauthorized Modification (see blog
post referenced in Security Services for more details.).

Entities, in the context of security, are anything that attempts to use
a protected asset. An entity can be a person, software, robot, or
anything else that attempts to use a protected asset.

Okay, I lied: That definition has a lot of subtly buried within it.
Hopefully, now the definition of security has a deeper meaning for you.

So, that's the definition of the mission of security across all of the
organization's security domains. In most organizations, [there should be
three top-level security domains]{.underline}:

**[Corporate Security]{.underline}**

**[Information Security]{.underline}**

**[Cyber Security]{.underline}**

Now, let's define each of those security domains.

Corporate Security

[Corporate Security is those aspects of an organization's security not
directly related to technology]{.underline}.

That is, in general, [corporate security is those aspects of security
that pre-date technology or technological security solutions, or are
unrelated to technology]{.underline}. Falling under the corporate
security domain would be aspects of security related to employee
services, safety, environmental services, or facilities; or which are
intellectual property, legal, or regulatory in nature. (This is not an
all-inclusive list.)

In other words, much of what you would think of as an organization's
security before the advent of digital technologies falls into the
corporate security domain.

Today, corporate security often makes extensive use of technology. But,
corporate security's technology is often not under the auspices of
information security or cybersecurity. Without close collaboration
between security groups, serious gaps in security defenses will occur.

Worse, [there often isn't a corporate security group in the
organization]{.underline}. Instead, you often find aspects of corporate
security disbursed between multiple (and, often non-communicating)
groups, such as human resources, facilities, safety, plant protection,
legal, risk management, and environmental.

I plan to discuss corporate security in more detail in an upcoming blog
post, Corporate Security: The Forgotten Security Domain.

Information Security

[Information Security is the protection of information in any form and
at all times]{.underline}.

That's pretty much the classic paragraph-long definition of information
security, summarized into one sentence.

Now, let's dissect it to get a deeper understanding of what that means.

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Protection is the rendering safe from harm. Protection is passive
security. That is, security that does not offer a response to an attack.
It is equivalent to putting a lock on a door to secure your house.

In any form means it includes both physical (e.g., printed documents)
and electronic (e.g., files and databases) information.

At all times means the information must be protected, whether it is at
rest (i.e., in storage), in use, or in motion (e.g., electronic
information sent over a network, or a printed document transported by a
courier).

Thus, we define information security as the protection of information.
Note that we didn't place any constraints upon the scope of protection.
That is, if we have to protect computers and networks to protect
information, then that would be within the scope of information
security. But, keep in mind that the objective is the protection of
information. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Cyber Security

We've already shown that there isn't a commonly agreed-to definition for
cybersecurity. Now, [I'm going to propose a definition for cybersecurity
which covers all aspects of cybersecurity]{.underline} --- something
which is lacking from other definitions --- [while providing a clear
distinction from information security.]{.underline} \[10\]

[Cybersecurity is the **protection** and defense of **both analogue and
digital electronic devices**]{.underline}, **[their communications
channels]{.underline}**, and [their **processing-and-control logic and
algorithms**]{.underline}.

Now, let's dissect that definition to get a deeper understanding of what
it means and its ramifications.

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Protection is the rendering safe from harm. Protection is passive
security. That is, security that does not offer a response to an attack.
It is equivalent to putting a lock on a door to secure your house.

Defense is an action taken to resist an attack. Defense is active
security. This means that you have dynamic security with ever-changing
defenses --- which can include offensive actions to stop an attack. It
is the equivalent of confronting an intruder in your house with a loaded
weapon.

Digital Devices are any electronic device that uses discrete data and
processes for all its operations. This clearly includes computers, cell
phones and tablets, routers, switches, WiFi access points, and
firewalls, but it also includes all other digitally networked devices,
such as all IoT devices, VoIP telephones, digital security cameras,
smart badge readers, etc.

Analogue Devices are any electronic device that uses continuous data and
processes for all its operations. This would include landline
telephones, fax machines, most nuclear reactor control systems, older
radar systems, older industrial controls, some satellite and other space
systems controls, and literally thousands of other devices. In
industrial controls situations, analogue devices often serve as failsafe
backups to digital controls.

Communications Channels are the means by which a device is connected to
other devices. For analogue device communications, this could be a
simple wire or wire-pair, coax cable, analogue radio, or similar
technologies. For digital device communications, it would include any
type of wired or wireless network. For digital to analogue device
communications, it could include any of the previously mentioned means
of analogue device communications used to communicate to an analogue
interface in the digital device.

Processing Logic and Algorithms are the means by which a device
accomplishes its designated purpose. For analogue devices, this is all
done in hardware. For digital devices, this includes both hardware and
software (microcode, firmware, operating systems, applications, etc.).

Control Logic and Algorithms are the means by which a device regulates
its processing. For analogue devices, this is all done in hardware. For
digital devices, this includes both hardware and software (microcode,
firmware, operating systems, applications, etc.).

Now, let's put the phrases together and detail the bigger picture.

[Is the protection and defense is cybersecurity's first significant
difference from information security. Cybersecurity not only offers
protection like information security, but it also offers defense. In
other words, cybersecurity can take the offensive actions necessary to
defend systems]{.underline}.

Of both analogue and digital electronic devices is the next significant
difference from information security, as information security's tools
seldom address analogue devices. It is also different in that
information security offers protection of non-electronic information
(e.g., printed), whereas cybersecurity only deals with electronic
devices and their data. \[11\]

This definition means that protection and defense are also offered to
the electronic devices (components) combined to construct a more complex
electronic device. For example, protection and defense would be offered
to CPUs, GPU, FPGAs, ASICs, NICs, DACs, memory, controllers, and all the
other various analogue and digital components that comprise a modern
end-purpose electronic device, such as a smartphone or a computer. In
other words, cybersecurity protects and defends any security-sensitive
electronic device, be it analogue or digital, and be it an end-purpose
device or a component of such a device.

Their communications channels is again a difference between
cybersecurity and information security. Cybersecurity provides both
protection and defense of the electronic communications channels
themselves, both analogue and digital. Whereas, information security
only provides for the protection of the information conveyed over those
communications channels.

Additionally, [information security also provides for the protection of
information communicated by non-electronic means]{.underline} (e.g.,
printed documents), **[which is outside the scope of
cybersecurity]{.underline}**.

And their processing-and-control logic and algorithms is the final
difference between cybersecurity and information security. Cybersecurity
offers protections to both hardware and software, and can take actions
to defend both from attack. By contrast, **[information security only
provides passive protection to information.]{.underline}**

So, that is the definition of cybersecurity and an explanation of its
scope.

To recap, cybersecurity provides security for all electronic technology,
except for the information processed by such technology (information is
protected by information security).

Or, another way to view the difference between information security and
cybersecurity is that information security secures the information
itself, and cybersecurity secures everything that creates, uses,
processes, stores, or communicates that information.

Where Information Security Fails Us

In my blog introduction, I state that "trying to treat cybersecurity
problems as though they are information security problems" is one of the
fundamental mistakes we are making in security today. The lack of an
understanding of the differences between information security and
cybersecurity is the root cause of this problem.

As we have seen in the preceding definitions, [information security is
"data-centric," and cybersecurity is "device-centric.]{.underline}"
Trying to apply information security principals to "device security"
creates two problems: First, you can't adequately secure "hardware"
using the same controls used to secure data; And second, there is
nothing in information security that provides for an active defense.

Let's look at some of the issues that the premises supporting
information security fail to address. To do this, we'll examine an
example from product security.

[The overwhelming **insecurity**]{.underline} [of **IoT** products has
filled the news recently]{.underline}. Why? Many would say that it's a
simple matter of companies trying to produce products on the cheap.
However, I would argue that [the]{.underline} [issue is more likely the
product's designers' failure to recognize the potential for security
problems in their products.]{.underline}

I believe that fundamentally, such product failures are compounded by an
incomplete view of security: a view driven by an information security
focus. A focus that, for embedded systems products (such as IoT
devices), is incomplete, at best. Why incomplete? Because [most security
issues with IoT devices are not information related. Rather the problems
are with the devices themselves.]{.underline}

Let's begin by listing some of the security questions that product
designers should be asking, but are obviously not asking. And, with most
product security practitioners coming from an information security
background, those product security architects probably do not even know
they should be asking these questions.

After all, why should they know better? Nothing they had learned in the
scope of information security would indicate that these are issues with
which to be concerned. The types of product security questions (that is,
cybersecurity questions) which all product security architects should be
asking include:

How do you prevent reverse engineering of the product?

How do you prevent tampering with the product?

How do you prevent the production of unlicensed clones of the product?

How do you prevent access to the hardware interfaces used for
development debugging of the product?

How do you prevent access to the hardware interfaces used for
manufacturing testing of the product?

How do you perform failsafe firmware updates of the product (such that a
failed update does not brick the product)?

How do you prevent unauthorized modification of the product's firmware?

How do you prevent your firmware from running on third-party devices?

How do you ensure the integrity of your supply chain?

How do you prevent unauthorized modification of the device itself?

How do you prevent misuse of the device from damaging the device itself
(e.g., using a USB port on a device for other than its intended purpose,
and drawing too much power)?

How do you prevent misuse of the device from creating a safety incident
(e.g., using an aerosol can to create a vapor fog to trigger a motion
detector to unlock a door)?

How can this device be abused by an attacker to cause harm?

How can we verify that our UI is always unambiguous to its intended
audience?

How can we verify that our UX is always intuitive to its intended
audience?

How can we verify that our UI creates neither security or safety issues?

How can we verify that our ID creates neither security or safety issues?

And this is just a very small sample of the questions that every product
development organization should be asking, but which is clearly failing
to occur.

Now, I can already hear the objections: "These are hardware engineering
issues, not information security issues, and that's why they're not
covered by information security." Well, that's half wrong and half
right. Wrong, in that they are not hardware engineering issues; rather,
they are hardware security issues. Right, in that they are not
information security issues; rather, they are cybersecurity issues.
\[12\]

These, and tens of thousands of other similar issues, are being left
unaddressed during product development because information security
doesn't address these types of issues. Nor should it, as those issues
are cybersecurity issues and not information security issues.

Nothing in an information security professional's background or training
would prepare them to even know that they should be asking the types of
questions I posited. And, that's what should be expected, because these
are not information security issues and I would not expect an
information security professional even to have half-a-clue that such
problems exist. It's for precisely this reason that cybersecurity exists
and is different from information security.

The problem is really simple: **[Information security exists to protect
information]{.underline}**. Nothing in the fundamentals of information
security was ever intended to secure anything other than information.
Thus, we need to stop trying to use an information security mindset to
secure "stuff" that isn't information. We must recognize that
cybersecurity's scope is beyond that of information security, and thus
apply cybersecurity principals to cybersecurity problems.

Defense

We also need to remember that [cybersecurity]{.underline} [allows for
active measures to defend devices. There's a reason that the military
and intelligence agencies refer to their security operations as
cybersecurity, and that's because they take active countermeasures to
attacks]{.underline}. You don't do that when your objective is to secure
information. In fact, that entire concept is an anathema to the
information security principals and mindset.

Cybersecurity defense is a big rabbit hole I don't plan to explore
further in this posting, other than to remind you that cybersecurity's
objective is the protection and defense of assets.

Summary

There is an old saying, "When the only tool you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail." With no real cybersecurity experience,
too many information security experts are trying to hammer cybersecurity
into becoming an information security nail. We need to reset the
thinking of those information security professionals and teach them that
cybersecurity is more like a bolt than a nail, and that you use a
wrench, not a hammer, when installing or removing a bolt.

Now, a quick review...

In most organizations, there are three security domains with which it
must be concerned:

Corporate Security, which protects (and sometimes defends) people; and
real, corporate, and intellectual property.

Information Security, which protects information (data).

Cybersecurity, which protects and defends: hardware, communications, and
software.

The diagram below illustrates those relationships among the
organization's security domains.

![Security Domain
Relationships](media/image8.jpeg){width="4.16971019247594in"
height="3.374405074365704in"}

We established the following definitions in support of those security
domains:

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Corporate Security is those aspects of an organization's security not
directly related to technology.

Information Security is the protection of information in any form and at
all times.

Cybersecurity is the protection and defense of both analogue and digital
electronic devices, their communications channels, and their
processing-and-control logic and algorithms.

Trying to treat cybersecurity problems as though they are information
security problems is one of the fundamental mistakes we are making in
security today. We have to remember that information security is
"data-centric," and cybersecurity is "device-centric." Trying to apply
information security principals to "device security" creates two
problems:

You cannot adequately secure "hardware" using the same controls used to
secure data, and

[There is nothing in information security that provides for active
defense.]{.underline}

If you search the Internet, you will find that many so-called
"information security experts" claim that cybersecurity is a subset of
information security. But, compared to information security,
cybersecurity has a substantially broader scope, addresses a more
complex set of security threats, and offers active defenses not provided
by information security.

If anything, we should view information security as a subset of
cybersecurity. However, that's not accurate either, as what those two
domains are attempting to secure is different --- data vs. hardware,
software, and communications. Some overlap between the two is
unavoidable, but at the most fundamental levels, they are attempting to
solve different problems. \[13\]

Thus, we need clear, concise, unambiguous definitions of both
cybersecurity and information security.

Hopefully, you will find the definitions provided here meet those
criteria.

So, don't let alleged information security experts try to tell you what
is and is not cybersecurity! Those so-called "information security
experts" are precisely that, and nothing more, because they clearly do
not understand cybersecurity!

Please leave cybersecurity to actual cybersecurity practitioners.

Thank you!

### Cybersecurity\-\--Includes Preemption/OCO's\-\--2AC

#### Cybersecurity, especially for NATO, entails preventive and preemptive action. 

**Panagiotis '19** \[Marios; 2019; Efthymiopoulos Journal of Innovation
and Entrepreneurship, "A cyber-security framework for development,
defense and innovation at NATO," 8:12 Springer Open\]

Characteristics of cyber-Security

**[Cyber-security is a strategy of both preventive and/or pre-emptive
action]{.underline}**. [It allows for technological growth and
advancement; it also allows for innovation and entrepreneur-
ship.]{.underline} It introduces us to a new virtual reality that we
created and are standing at: the worldwide web, its methods and
opportunities, is by now an integrated part of our lives. All elements
that we are working with or at professionally or privately at some given
time rely or depend on technological advancements that make our life
easier and at the same time more complicated while we are in need for
constant and enhanced cyber-security protection of our data and also
virtual way of life.

Strategically, constant security resilience is of essence. Security as
policy is a protection method. Among others, it reflects government
policies. In the virtual world, through cyber-security, democracy,
development, sustainability, and growth, innovation and entrepreneurship
can take place.

[Cyber-security is both a strategy and operational framework, a field of
operational capacity, an element of cross-disciplinary and
trans-disciplinary approach]{.underline} that is fit to all levels of
socio-political, economic, engineering, IT, legal, and security-led
levels of theoretical approach and practicability uses and issues.

A cyber-security strategy is holistically and politically business
oriented; it is entrepre-neurial and innovative. Cyber-security in the
field of defense is a continued struggle for technological methods of
defense development, growth, innovation, democracy, and continuity
toward the convergence of a society that is very much depended on
technology.

Resilience in cyber-security is reflected in multiple fields. As long as
there is a cooperative or global cyber-security strategy. The necessity
for a joined cooperative strategic and operational capacity needs to be
displayed and pointed out. Safeguarding and enhancing methods and tools
of protection against malicious attacks that may involve one or more
countries, institutions, businesses, or agencies.

**[An alliance cyber-security]{.underline}** [becomes a policy framework
for technological continuity, a multinational aspect of cooperative
approach that enhances elements of pluralism of Democracy; it will help
boost interconnectedness and will boost security efforts to meet all
security threats symmetrical and asymmetrical.]{.underline}

National securities and defense strategies rely solely on national
cyber-security protection policies and application methods; how
cooperation can and will be achieved; information agility and
technological advance mechanisms; considering the multidimensional level
of threats and challenges. Yet risk analyses and threat analyses are to
this extend considered only as national. The article proposes for a
joined cooperative approach on Grand Cyber-Security Strategy. A strategy
that at an age of interconnect- edness and operational creativity will
provide an efficient political and military framework to work on, a
legal framework that will in turn allow for operational deliverables
through a cyber-security command such like the new cyber-security center
in Mons Belgium, a decision-taken by Heads of States and Governments, at
the recent Brussels NATO Summit of July 2018.

Setting the stage

[Cyber-security is yet to be **globally**, **legally**,
**operationally**, and strategically defined]{.underline}. The scale of
a security perspective is more attractive at this time considering the
geostra- tegic challenges and threats. The possibility of innovation and
entrepreneurship in the field is also a tangible reality, due to the
necessary research and development methods. More so, the possibility of
an open market economy sharing of knowledge and technological skills
makes security and cyber-security or defense for that matter more
attractive. What lacks in the world wide legal and political framework
of operations, exchange of information and protectiveness from new
sources or methods that can be deemed as elements of infiltration.

The article\'s aim is to examine and recommend a global strategic
framework for op-erational capacity and management resilience between
allied and cooperative partners in the field of cyber-security. The
current article is a follow up of prior scientific publications made in
2014 first and later in 2018, on NATO\'s cyber-security strategy,
presented through a framework of Cyber-Development, Cyber-Democracy, and
Cyber-Defense (Carayannis, Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014; Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2018). The aim is to converge diversified
information on cyber-security, in a single strategic framework; reflect
to the actual practical needs in understanding operations and tactical
ability to deliver in multi-complex and dimensional world through
management and operational efficiency capabilities. The article requests
interoperability of aims and objectives under a global framework of
cyber-security; through a strategic framework on cyber-security, global
law can be proposed, defined, and adopted by the international
community. The strategic framework will define structures that are
needed to be put in place on a global scale, when reflecting issues of
cyber-security and inclusive for [NATO. It will define threats and
challenges, as cyber-attacks are real.]{.underline} Cyber-security is
not an asymmetrical or hybrid threat, but an existential one. Its
destructive capacity can be multi-leveled and can also lead to human
casualties. The future of e-safety lays at both a global estimation
framework of what constitutes cyber-security and how we react to it; it
lays in between cooperation of allies and members of wider alliances,
against specified or approximate threats. Yet, **[its framework of aims
and objectives, management, command and control, and operations will be
defined and decided by allied parties only such as is the case of
NATO]{.underline}**.

## Predictability

### Plain Meaning\-\--2AC

#### Prefer plain meaning.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and

[Words are to be understood in **their ordinary, everyday
meanings**---**unless** the context **indicates**]{.underline} that
[they bear a **technical sense**]{.underline}.

[The **ordinary-meaning rule** is the **most fundamental semantic rule**
of interpretation]{.underline}.1 [It governs constitutions, statutes,
rules, **and** private instruments. Interpreters should **not** be
required to divine **arcane nuances** or]{.underline} to [discover
**hidden meanings**]{.underline}. Justice Joseph Story's words are as
true today as they were when written in the middle of the 19th century,

### General Terms\-\--2AC

#### General terms like "security cooperation" should be understood [broadly]{.underline}.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "General-Terms
Canon," Ch. 9\]

[General terms are to be given their **general meaning**]{.underline}
(generalia verba sunt generaliter intelligenda).

[Without]{.underline} some [**indication** to the contrary, general
words]{.underline} (like all words, general or not) [are to be accorded
their **full and fair scope**. They are not to be **arbitrarily
limited**]{.underline}. This is [the general-terms canon]{.underline},
which [is based on the **reality**]{.underline} that [it is **possible
and useful** to formulate categories]{.underline} (e.g., "dangerous
weapons") [without knowing **all the items that may
fit**]{.underline}---or may later, once invented, come to fit---[within
those categories]{.underline}.

### Intent To Exclude Unnecessary\-\--2NC

#### A definition need not [specify]{.underline} something is excluded to [actually exclude]{.underline} something.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "General-Terms
Canon," Ch. 10\]

[The expression of one thing **implies** the exclusion of
others]{.underline} (expressio unius est exclusio alterius).

Expressio unius, also known as inclusio unius, is a Latin name for the
communicative device known as negative implication. In English, it is
known as the negative-implication canon. We encounter the device---and
recognize it---frequently in our daily lives. [When a car dealer
promises a **low financing rate** to "purchasers with good credit," it
is **entirely clear** that the rate is ***not* available** to purchasers
with spotty credit]{.underline}.

### Intent to Exclude Necessary\-\--2AC

#### Disagreed with the above.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "General-Terms
Canon," Ch. 10\]

**[Virtually all]{.underline}** the [**authorities** who discuss the
negative-implication canon emphasize]{.underline} that [it must be
applied with **great caution**]{.underline}, since its application
depends so much on context.1 Indeed, one commentator suggests that it is
not a proper canon at all but merely a description of the result gleaned
from context.2 That goes too far. Context establishes the conditions for
applying the canon, but where those conditions exist, the principle that
specification of the one implies exclusion of the other validly
describes how people express themselves and understand verbal
expression.

The doctrine properly applies only when the unius (or technically, unum,
the thing specified) can reasonably be thought to be an expression of
all that shares in the grant or prohibition involved. Common sense often
suggests when this is or is not so. [The sign outside a restaurant "No
dogs allowed" **cannot** be thought to mean that **no other creatures**
are excluded---as if **pet monkeys**, **potbellied pigs**, and **baby
elephants** might be **quite welcome**]{.underline}. Dogs are
specifically addressed because they are the animals that customers are
most likely to bring in; [**nothing** is implied about **other
animals**]{.underline}. On the other hand, the sign outside a veterinary
clinic saying "Open for treatment of dogs, cats, horses, and all other
farm and domestic animals" does suggest (by its detail) that the circus
lion with a health problem is out of luck. (Notice how ejusdem generis
\[§ 32\] also comes into play with this example.) The more specific the
enumeration, the greater the force of the canon:

### "Include" Does Not Exclude\-\--2AC

#### When a "definition" is based on the word "include," it does not [exclude]{.underline} any aff.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "Presumption of
Nonexclusive Include," Ch. 15\]

[The verb to **include** introduces **examples**, **not** an exhaustive
list]{.underline}.

[In **normal English usage**, if a group "consists of" or "comprises"
300 lawyers, it contains **precisely** that number. If it "includes" 300
lawyers, there may well be **thousands of other members** from **all
walks of life** as well]{.underline}. That is, [the word include does
**not**]{.underline} ordinarily [introduce an **exhaustive
list**]{.underline}, while comprise---with an exception that we will
discuss shortly---ordinarily does. [That is the rule]{.underline} both
[in **good English usage**]{.underline}1 and in textualist
decision-making.2 Some jurisdictions have even codified a rule about
include.3

### No Redundancy\-\--2NC

#### [Reject]{.underline} interpretations that make words [redundant]{.underline}.

**Scalia '12** \[Antonin Scalia and Bryan Garner; 2012; Justice on the
Supreme Court of the United States; American lawyer, lexicographer, and
teacher; Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts, "Surplusage
Canon," Ch. 26\]

[If **possible**, **every word**]{.underline} and every provision [is to
be **given effect**]{.underline} (verba cum effectu sunt accipienda1).
[**None** should be ignored. None should **needlessly** be given an
interpretation that causes it to **duplicate** another provision or to
have **no consequence**]{.underline}.

"These [words cannot be **meaningless**, else they would **not have been
used**]{.underline}."

> United States v. Butler,
>
> 297 U.S. 1, 65 (1936) (per Roberts, J.).

The surplusage canon holds that it is no more the court's function to
revise by subtraction than by addition. [A provision that
seems]{.underline} to the court **[unjust or unfortunate]{.underline}**
(creating the so-called casus male inclusus) [must]{.underline}
nonetheless [be given effect]{.underline}. As Chief Justice John
Marshall explained: "It would be dangerous in the extreme, to infer from
extrinsic circumstances, that a case for which the words of an
instrument expressly provide, shall be exempted from its operation."2 Or
in the words of Thomas M. Cooley: "\[T\]he courts must . . . [**lean**
in favor of a construction which will render **every word operative**,
rather than one which may make some **idle and
nugatory**]{.underline}."3 [This is true not just of legal texts but of
**all sensible writing**]{.underline}: "Whenever a reading arbitrarily
ignores linguistic components or inadequately accounts for them, the
reading may be presumed improbable."4
