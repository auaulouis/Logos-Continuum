#### PPPs fail 

Henrich Böll **Stiftung**, 11-19-20**18**, \"History RePPPeated,\" The
Green Political Foundation,
https://www.boell.de/en/2018/12/11/history-repppeated-how-public-private-partnerships-are-failing///jc

[Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are increasingly being promoted as
the solution to the shortfall in financing needed to achieve the
Sustainable Development Goal]{.underline}s (SDGs). Economic
infrastructure, such as railways, roads, airports and ports, but also
key services such as health, education, water and electricity are being
delivered through PPPs in both the global north and south. Although the
involvement of the private sector in public service provision is not
new, there is currently keen political interest in PPPs as an important
way to leverage private finance. Donor governments and financial
institutions, such as the World Bank Group (WBG) and other multilateral
development banks (MDBs), have set up multiple initiatives to promote
changes in national regulatory frameworks to allow for PPPs, as well as
to provide advice and finance for PPP projects. [Since 2004 there has
been a rapid growth in the amount of money invested in PPPs in the
developing world. Although the trend has been volatile since
2012]{.underline}, efforts by MDBs to leverage private finance in both
emerging and low-income economies have continued --- for example,
through the "Cascade" approach developed by the WBG, whereby the use of
private finance is prioritised over public or concessional finance. This
indicates a more determined push to reduce the risk so private investors
come in. **[Many projects have been procured as PPPs simply to
circumvent budget constraints and to postpone the recording of fiscal
costs.]{.underline}** Some accounting practices allow governments to
keep the cost of the project and its contingent liabilities "off balance
sheet". This ends up exposing public finances to excessive fiscal risks.
Current austerity measures and orthodox policy prescriptions that
encourage a low fiscal deficit also create a perverse incentive in
favour of PPPs. [This report gives an in-depth, evidence-based analysis
of the impact of 10 PPP projects that have taken place across four
continents, in both developed and developing countries.]{.underline}
These case studies build on research conducted by civil society experts
in recent years and have been written by the people who often work with
and around the communities affected by these projects. The countries
included are: Colombia, France, India, Indonesia, Lesotho, Liberia,
Peru, Spain and Sweden. The sectors they cover are: education, energy,
healthcare, transport, and water and sanitation. Although we do not
intend to generalise our conclusions in the vast and complex universe of
PPPs, these 10 cases illustrate the most common problems encountered by
PPPs. Therefore, they challenge the capacity of PPPs to deliver results
in the public interest. We found that: [All 10 projects came with a high
cost for the public purse, an excessive level of risk for the public
sector and, therefore, a heavy burden for citizens.]{.underline} For
example, the Queen Mamohato Hospital in Lesotho has had significant
adverse and unpredictable financial consequences on public funds. Latest
figures suggest that in 2016 the private partner Tsepong's 'invoiced'
fees amount to two times the "affordability threshold" set by the
Government and the WB at the outset of the PPP. Contributing factors to
cost escalation include flawed indexation of the annual fee paid by the
government to Tsepong (unitary fee) and poor forecasting. [In Sweden,
the total construction cost of Nya Karolinska Solna (NKS) hospital has
rocketed --- from €1.4 billion to €2.4 billion]{.underline} --- and has
been beset by technical failures. It is now known as the "most expensive
hospital in the world". [Every single PPP studied was riskier for the
state than for the private companies involved, as the public sector was
required to step in and assume the costs when things went wrong. A
significant example is]{.underline} the case of Jakarta Water in
Indonesia, [where two PPP contracts resulted in significant losses for
the public water utility]{.underline}, PAM Jaya. In 2011, it reported a
financial loss of US\$18 million. [Estimates suggest that losses will
eventually total US\$2.4 billion if the cooperation agreement continues
as planned until its expiry date in 2022. Five of the 10 PPPs reviewed
impacted negatively on the poor, and contributed to an increase in the
divide between rich and poor.]{.underline} For instance, in the case of
the Queen Mamohato Hospital in Lesotho, the increasing and inflexible
cost of the PPP hospital compromised necessary investment in primary and
secondary healthcare in rural areas where mortality rates are rising and
where three-quarters of the population live. In Jakarta, the provision
of water through private operators (Jakarta Water) resulted in a radical
increase in monthly bills, which are unaffordable for many poor
families. Residents often rely on groundwater from community wedge
wells, or have to buy water in jerry cans, which can cost as much as
half a person's daily income. [Three of the PPPs resulted in serious
social and environmental impacts. Poor planning and due diligence
accounts for some of these]{.underline}. For example, on the Mundra
coast in Gujarat, India, where a thermal power station project has taken
place, there were serious social and environmental violations from the
outset. [Following flawed impact assessments, there has been a
deterioration in water quality and fish populations; community health
impacts are evident due to air emissions; access to fishing and drying
sites has been blocked; forced displacement of fishermen has taken
place. This has also impacted on the life of women. Girls in particular
have also been pulled out of school to perform physical and domestic
labour to survive.]{.underline} In Colombia, [the PPP project designed
to improve the navigability]{.underline} of the Magdalena River suffered
from poor planning. Although the project never went into the
construction phase --- it [collapsed due to the failure of the company
to get the financing needed to implement it --- the preliminary works
carried out have already negatively affected the environment in and
around the river. **Nine out of 10 of the projects lacked transparency
and/or failed to consult with affected communities, and undermined
democratic accountability.**]{.underline} The failure to publish
contract details does not chime well with the risks that the public
sector is forced to take on. In the small Indian town of Khadwa, for
example, where a PPP was launched to provide municipal water, it took
four years to finally inform the population about what was happening.
[More than 10,000 households filed objections against the project within
a period of 30 days.]{.underline} This was in a town where regular
domestic water connections totalled 15,000. In Liberia, where the
government outsourced its public pre-primary and primary schools,
initially to Bridge International Academies Ltd (BIA), the process was
not competitive, local communities were not properly consulted, and
there was not full transparency. **[All cases showed PPPs were complex
to negotiate and implement, and that they required specific state
capacities to negotiate in the public interest]{.underline}**, including
during the renegotiation process. In Peru, the renegotiation process to
build a new airport through a PPP in Chinchero resulted in a change to
the entire funding structure of the project. After a strong report from
the Comptroller General referring to economic damages for the state, and
in the midst of a national scandal over the project, the Peruvian
government finally had to cancel the contract on the grounds of national
interest. The construction of a courthouse in Paris proved so complex,
costly and controversial that the new French Justice Minister has
decided that her Ministry will never engage in a PPP again. [Three of
the PPP contracts had to be cancelled due to an evident failure in the
process, including proper due diligence to identify the possible impacts
of the project.]{.underline} For example, the Castor Project --- feted
as Spain's biggest offshore gas storage plant --- was halted after gas
injections caused more than 1,000 earthquakes. Despite never being used,
the Castor project has so far cost the public €3.28 billion, which is
currently set to be paid through increased gas bills. This joint [CSO
report makes the following recommendations]{.underline} to the WBG, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other public development banks,
together with the governments of wealthy countries that play a leading
role in these institutions: **[Halt the aggressive promotion and
incentivising of PPPs for social and economic infrastructure
financing]{.underline}**, and publicly recognise the financial and other
significant risks that PPPs entail. Support countries in finding the
best financing method for public services in social and economic
infrastructure, which are responsible, transparent, environmentally and
fiscally sustainable, and in line with their human rights obligations.
Prioritise tax revenues, whilst augmenting them with long-term external,
and domestic, concessional and non- concessional finance, where
appropriate. [**Ensure good and democratic governance is in place before
pursuing large-scale infrastructure or service** developments. This
should be done through informed consultation and broad civil society
participation and monitoring, including by local communities, trade
unions, and other stakeholders.]{.underline} Uphold the right to free,
prior and informed consent, and ensure the right to redress for any
affected communities. The rights of affected communities should be taken
into account. Ensure that rigorous transparency standards apply,
particularly with regard to accounting for public funds --- the contract
value of the PPP and its long-term fiscal implications must be included
in national accounts. Contracts and performance reports of social and
economic infrastructure projects should be proactively disclosed. The
public interest ranks higher than commercial interests. Finally, [we
urge all those concerned with justice, equality, sustainability and
human rights to resist the encroachment of]{.underline} PPPs and to push
instead for high-quality, publicly-funded, democratically-controlled,
accountable public services. The wellbeing of our communities and
societies depends on it.

#### Aftershock of the pandemic ensures increased P3 failure

**Financial Express**, 7-11-20**22**, \"Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
project failures: Don't put zombies on life-support,\" Financialexpress,
https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/public-private-partnership-ppp-project-failures-dont-put-zombies-on-life-support/2146855/

[Macroeconomic crises are an important reason behind Public-Private
Partnership (PPP) project failures. A]{.underline} World Bank paper
(Harris and Pratap, 2009) finds that the occurrence of a macroeconomic
shock increases the likelihood of project cancellation (failure) from
less than 5% to more than 8%, controlling for other variables[. The
Covid-induced macroeconomic shock will likely be similar in its impact
on PPP projects]{.underline}, from the demand and the supply side.
During the lockdown period in India, there was near total shutdown of
road, rail and air traffic, and power consumption was drastically down
in March-May 2020; all this has gradually eased from June 2020 onwards.
The supply of labour and access to capital was also seriously affected
during the lockdown period. Though the pace of recovery is much faster
than anticipated (growth rate recovering from -23.9% in Q1FY21 to -7.5%
in Q2), **[it is likely that there would be increased PPP project
failures because of Covid in the future.]{.underline}** The PPP project
failure rate in the developing world, as per the Private Participation
in Infrastructure (PPI) database of the World Bank (ppi.worldbank.org),
is below 4%, both by the number of projects and associated investments.
As per this database, 292 PPP projects (out of 8,295 projects, or 3.5%)
failed in the period 1990 to 2020 in the developing world. In terms of
investments, the corresponding numbers were \$71 billion out of \$1.99
trillion, or 3.6%. This is much below the overall corporate failure rate
and is attributed to concerns about service continuity (after all,
almost all PPP infrastructure projects carry out erstwhile sovereign
functions), possible termination payments, and negative publicity
surrounding these perceived failures. \[AD OMITTED\] In a recent blog,
Makhtar Diop, [the World Bank's Vice President for Infrastructure, talks
about having used artificial intelligence]{.underline} to gauge Covid's
impact on infrastructure. He finds that, [since February 2020, 256
private infrastructure projects in developing countries have been
reported cancelled or delayed]{.underline}. For projects already under
construction, the number of projects facing disruptions peaked in May
and has since been decreasing. But, [the sheer number of distressed
projects]{.underline} (256) [vis-à-vis the total number of cancelled
projects (292) since 1990 should be deeply concerning and point to an
increased number of cancellations in the near future.]{.underline} From
this analysis, it can be safely inferred that India, with the
second-highest number of PPP projects and associated investments in the
developing world, is also likely to see increased project failures in
the wake of Covid.

Understanding the definition of civil-military relations promotes
understanding between groups active in the field of security

civil-military relations. In this article, I argue that civil-military
relations are more than just a naturally occurring by-product of
civilian and military interaction. Rather, understanding what comprises
civil-military relations in a democracy -- even a fledgling one \--
involves a deeper appreciation of the role society plays in the
civil-military nexus. In addition, I propose that embracing society's
role in civil-military relations can decrease conflicts in
civil-military relations.

### 2AC -- Solvency -- No Compliance

#### Private businesses will not comply with regulations

**Jordan, ND**, \"Public vs. Private: Compliance,\" Bid Lab,
https://www.thebidlab.com/learning-center/public-vs-private-compliance/

[Public Sector]{.underline} Procurement For any business vying for
public contracts, compliance is everything. In order to bid on public
contracts, certain requirements must be met in accordance with
government policy. And[, if that business is not in adherence to those
rules, the bid is "non-compliant" and the firm is no longer a viable
option for award]{.underline}. One benefit of opting to bid in the
public sector is that agencies have their regulations available to the
public. So [when businesses are seeking to contract with a government
agency, they have the opportunity to vet their regulations and
requirements first]{.underline}. There are instances in which a business
finds they're not compliant with a requirement. In that case, they have
the opportunity to pursue that compliance requirement(s) prior to
bidding on that agency's RFP. (For example, to bid on a contract to
serve as the sanitation company for Utah's public schools, ABC agency
may need to first be certified by the state of Utah.) However, it's also
important to note that there are oftentimes instances where there's not
enough time before an RFP's deadline to pursue a number of compliance
requirements. This is why it's always important to start bids as close
to their release date and also to keep your certifications up-to-date at
all times. [To provide a level and competitive playing field, federal
regulations mandate that all public agencies post their RFPs publicly.
At a minimum, RFPs will include: a description of the government's
requirement(s), terms and conditions that are applicable to that
contract, vendor requirements for responding to the RFP, and scoring
criteria that the issuing agency will utilize in its evaluation process.
As a firm with a foot planted on either side of the procurement
process]{.underline}, The Bid Lab can tell you firsthand that
procurement teams very well may review proposals for compliance before
reading a single word in the response. Why? To save time and to help
eliminate bids prior to completing the substantive review. For bidders,
being compliant with that agency allows your business to make it
"through the front door". Then, procurement teams can evaluate your
business on merits per their evaluation criteria to determine the
winning bid. Unfortunately, agencies don't provide an opportunity to
submit forms or supplemental information after the submission deadline
passes. So, your business should verify adherence to compliance
requirements prior to completing the remainder of the proposal. Private
Sector Procurement In the public sector, "compliance" is mostly defined
by the procuring business. (We'll discuss mostly in the next
section**[.) In the private sector, procuring businesses usually don't
need to comply with the same regulations set by governing
agencies]{.underline}**. Compliance rules are defined in-house per what
that business's expectations are for their project. Because of this,
[companies may issue an RFP with a vendor already in mind for their
project. Unlike public sector procurement, this isn't an illegal
act]{.underline}. For this reason, responding businesses should know who
their competitors are and what they claim their competitive advantage(s)
to be. In this case, you'll be able to recognize if the procuring
company prepared the RFP with the intention of working with a
competitor. More and more, especially due to increasing environmental
movements, private companies are making internal compliance regulations
available to the public. By doing this, the public is able to track
their supply chain to verify that the company is complying with its own
statements, as a form of public trust. For instance, the public can view
clothing brand Patagonia's social, sustainability and environmental
programs right on their website. Furthermore, if a business would like
to do business with Patagonia, they can visit the company's available
guiding principles to learn how they make decisions to operate business
around the globe. We suggest always knowing your potential customer,
their policies and backgrounds prior to investing time in doing business
with them. And, many like Patagonia will be happy to share their
compliance rules with you first, if those rules will determine who they
will do business with. Your RFP will not only be compliant, but will
also check all of the reviewer's boxes by reading How to Ensure RFP
Compliance. Finally, [since companies mostly define their compliance,
the rules may be more lax when it comes to reviewing bids. Procuring
companies may overlook deviations from the question]{.underline}. They
also have the opportunity to ask the bidder to clarify their response
after the fact. As in the Patagonia example used above, it might also be
possible to ask for extended submission deadlines so your business can
meet the compliance requirements first. Depending on the situation,
private companies may be more flexible with bidding companies.

### 2AC -- Solvency -- Civil Military is Bad

#### CMR fails

Gregory D. **Foster**, 9-1-19**97**, \"Failed Expectations: The Crisis
of Civil-Military Relations in America,\" Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/failed-expectations-the-crisis-of-civil-military-relations-in-america/

[How much longer will it be before the American people awaken to the
realization that we are confronted today by a crisis in civil-military
relations? How many more unseemly and embarrassing incidents and abuses
of public trust involving the military will it take to make us see that
the failings of the military, egregious enough in themselves, are simply
the most telltale signs of a larger crisis that has enormous
implications for our national security?]{.underline} No single incident
of late---not the highly publicized dismissal from the Air Force of
Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, or the adultery-related withdrawal of General
Joseph Ralston from consideration as the next chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, or the multiple charges of sexual misconduct against
the sergeant major of the army, or the ongoing series of court-martial
trials of army trainers for massive sexual abuse at Aberdeen Proving
Ground and Darmstadt, Germany---constitutes a crisis in and of itself.
But these events are not isolated aberrations. They are part of a far
larger pattern of institutional misbehavior that includes the security
and intelligence lapses that produced the Khobar Towers truck bombing in
Saudi Arabia, the safety and equipment failures that led to the deaths
of the secretary of commerce and 34 others in a plane crash in Croatia,
the suicide of a chief of naval operations who faced allegations that he
had been wearing unauthorized combat decorations, white supremacist
elements in one of our most "elite" combat divisions, the rapes of young
girls by U.S. servicemen in Okinawa and Australia, general officers
misappropriating military aircraft for personal and family use, the
profligate procurement of gold-plated weapon systems that have failed
major performance tests, revelations that the Pentagon may have withheld
and distorted information dealing both with the exposure of perhaps
thousands of soldiers to depleted uranium munitions and chemical agents
and with the performance of expensive armaments in the 1991 Persian Gulf
war, and countless other breaches of the public trust. [At one level,
such recurring incidents typify a military institution that]{.underline}
(as distinct from the individuals who constitute it) is [seriously
diseased---characterized]{.underline} not by an ethos of duty, honor,
and country, but by parochialism, a steady undercurrent of
chest-thumping machismo, and [a disturbing degree of self-serving
advocacy and duplicity.]{.underline} At a deeper level, these events
reflect a breakdown among the three parties to the triad of
civil-military relations: the military itself; the civilian officials
who ostensibly control the military; and the people, who bear ultimate
responsibility under republican rule for overseeing the military's
civilian overseers. It may not be at all clear how---or even
whether---to cure the military's ills. Judging from the feeble response
to date of the country's most senior decisionmakers, both civilian and
military, it isn't even clear that they recognize, much less are willing
to admit and deal with, the problem. (Perhaps that is because they are
so much the culprits themselves.) The start of a solution, though, must
rest with our collective ability as a nation to discover the source of
the disease rather than simply acknowledging its most obvious symptoms.
And the source of the disease lies deep: in the expectations the three
parties involved have of one another and in their uniform failure to
measure up. \[AD OMITTED\] What are these expectations? To the practiced
observer, they are obvious. For their part, civilian officials,
presidents in particular, expect two things above all else from the
military. The first is operational competence---the ability to
accomplish assigned missions, whatever they may be. The second is sound
advice. Of course, there are no clearly objective bases for determining
what constitutes either. Both are inherently subjective and depend
ultimately on the powers of discernment possessed by those who make such
judgments. An uninformed observer---whether political appointee or
average citizen---devoid of military understanding, especially of the
strategic ramifications of military affairs, is fundamentally
ill-equipped to distinguish a military that is doing well what it should
be doing from one that is doing either the right thing badly or the
wrong thing satisfactorily. We see and hear much of this today from
those in authority who, wishing to establish their bona fides,
incessantly mouth the platitudes of militarese---"readiness," "op
tempo," "warfighting"---without having the first demonstrable clue as to
what militaries actually do or ought to do, much less how. G Gregory D.
Foster Soundness of advice similarly may have much---or little---to do
with how broad (strategic) or narrow (purely military) the advice is,
whether it reinforces or runs counter to what its recipients want to
hear, or whether it truly determines results that are subject to so many
other intervening influences. Success or failure, in other
words---whether in policy or operations, whether in Bosnia or Aberdeen
Proving Ground, whether concerned with NATO expansion or the treatment
of homosexuals---may bear little direct relationship to the soundness of
advice that precedes action (or inaction). Beyond expecting operational
competence and sound advice, civilian officials give ample evidence that
they expect three other things from their uniformed charges. First, they
expect generally unquestioning obedience, not merely to legitimate
political direction, but to the full range of civilian dictates and
desires (however frivolous, ill-conceived, or self-serving). By this
line of reasoning, even responsible dissent is considered disobedience.
And no task---ushering at the White House, for instance---is considered
too inconsequential to direct dutiful military personnel to perform.
Second, they expect a measure of political sensitivity that takes the
form, if not of outright docility, at least of responsible enough
conduct to avoid becoming a political liability. And finally, they
expect sufficient affordability not to visibly drain resources from
other political priorities. The military, in turn, expects several
things from civilian officials generally and presidents specifically.
The most important, executive competence, reflects the degree to which
civilian decisionmakers demonstrate the cardinal leadership traits of
courage, decisiveness, integrity, and vision in sufficient measure to
earn the deference the military expects, and is expected, to give. No
less, though, does the military seek from its civilian masters clear
strategic guidance---an unambiguous articulation of national purpose,
direction, and priorities that charts the country's course into the
future. Such guidance, when available, transcends and provides an
antidote to the momentary imperatives of expediency that pervade the
policy process. It also establishes a rational basis for allocating
national resources, preventing constant crisis, determining military
requirements, and justifying the use or nonuse of the military under
particular circumstances. It thereby assures the military and the public
that those in charge know what they are doing, understand the
complexities of the world around them, and are motivated by something
more consequential than self-interest. Executive competence and clear
strategic guidance represent the high end of the military's expectations
of civilian officials and are only rarely delivered. Politics doesn't
ensure competence in actual governing---as many in office regularly
demonstrate. Moreover, politicians typically show little inclination,
even if they are able, to produce the sort of specific blueprint for
action that opponents could use to hold them accountable for their
performance. Accordingly, the military generally is content to limit its
expectations of civilian officials to two minimal obligations. The first
is appreciation and support---if not understanding---of the military's
purposes and uses, its capabilities and limitations, its needs and
concerns, and its value to society. The second is sufficient political
acumen to get things done, properly and effectively, in the messy,
frustratingly pluralistic worlds of domestic and international politics.
The military's expectation that civilian officials show appreciation and
support is, in a deeper sense, a desire that the civilians who command
its allegiance display enough reciprocal loyalty and familiarity with
military affairs to give them empathetic license for exercising the
martial prerogatives of the state. And if the military, socialized as it
is to prize order and efficiency, is rightly to stay out of
politics---at least of the low, partisan variety---the least politicians
can do is to practice the requisite statesmanship to make the system
work the way civic indoctrination has convinced us it can and should.
The Military and the People No less telling in their impact on the
attitudes, comportment, and performance of the armed forces are the
military's expectations of the people. Though hoping for true
appreciation, the military expects the support of the citizenry---if
only as psychological recompense for the sacrifices the military sees
itself making---but seems willing to accept mere noninterference in its
professional affairs as a minimal reflection of public trust. The
military also seems to expect civic commitment and public order from the
people as essential signs of the public's willingness to meet the
obligations of citizenship (preferably of the compliant, deferential
kind). The people seem to share with civilian officials the expectation
that the military provide operational competence and sound
advice---although the public's powers of discernment and judgment, as
well as the concomitant good-faith willingness to forsake the rights to
know about and speak out on allegedly sensitive national security
matters, vary widely. Thus given to more-or-less blind trust in those
who profess to serve them, the people therefore also implicitly ask that
their military maintain strict political neutrality---distancing itself
from partisan politics, staying out of domestic affairs---and that
military personnel conform to the highest standards of ethical and legal
conduct, even if the international environment in which they may have to
operate is the Hobbesian jungle realists tell us it is and must be.
Civilian Leaders and the People What is not so clear is what civilian
officials and the people expect of one another and, moreover, where
Congress fits in the equation---whether as extension and voice of the
people, as representative of an elitist political class that consorts
with executive branch officials over the heads of the people, or as an
independent force with its own agenda, perspective, and expertise. [One
would like to think that the people (including Congress) expect civilian
officials to demonstrate executive competence, provide clear strategic
guidance, and serve the public interest unconditionall]{.underline}y[;
and that civilian officials, in turn, expect active, knowledgeable civic
participation for the common good]{.underline} from the people. A more
cynical view, tempered by experience, suggests that what both parties
ought to seek from the other is quite the opposite of what they actually
do expect or want. Today precious [few of the mutual
expectations]{.underline} the three parties to the civil-military
relationship have of one another [are being met]{.underline}. From these
failed expectations flows the crisis that now afflicts us.
[Ideally]{.underline} the military would be a useful, usable instrument
of national power that facilitates the attainment of the country's
strategic goals, as well as a socially, politically, and economically
responsible institution that contributes to the preservation and
functioning of civil society. [Civilian authorities would establish
definitive strategic purpose and direction for the country, effectively
manage events and circumstances, and exercise responsible military
oversight. The people would be civically engaged and employ reasoned
judgment to rigorously oversee the military's overseers. Reality has
fallen well short of this ideal. Civilian officials]{.underline},
increasingly devoid of firsthand or even derivative military experience
(a general portent of the future that has been especially pronounced in
the Clinton administration), h[ave shown commensurately little faculty
for critical discernment in military matter]{.underline}s. Having
further been consistently less than adroit in the larger conduct of
international affairs, they have failed to engender the minimal
credibility necessary to compensate for their military illiteracy.
**[Instead they have feigned understanding and support---first, by
invariably deferring to established military practices and preferences;
second, by shamelessly invoking insider rhetoric, not only to mask their
substantive shortcomings, but also to counter prospective criticism and
to ingratiate themselves with potentially restive military
elements.]{.underline}** At the same time, under the guise of urgency
and national self-defense, **[these civilian officials have perpetuated
the practice common to all recent presidencies of repeatedly
circumventing]{.underline}**---or at least
outmaneuvering---[**Congress** in committing U.S. troops
abroad]{.underline}. Bosnia, and the accompanying promise---deceitful
and unfulfilled---to pull U.S. troops out within a year of their
deployment, is but the most glaring recent example. The result has been
a progressive, largely subliminal diminution of effective civilian
control of the military. The military---parochial to a fault, insatiably
greedy for resources and the expensive appurtenances of its craft,
disturbingly politicized at the top, and beset by a largely unrecognized
but nonetheless real and pervasive civic illiteracy within its own
ranks---has made the most of its practiced bureaucratic and political
survival skills. While ostensibly accepting a variety of nontraditional
assignments that its core true believers consider extraneous and
burdensome---peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and the like---and
while zealously trumpeting itself as the revolutionary vanguard for a
new age of third-wave, fourth-generation cyberwar, the military has
remained mired in a hidebound conception of war and self whose central
tenets are only too familiar: war is inevitable; peace, never but a
temporary respite, is a function of one's readiness for war; war is
traditional combat; victory in war goes to the party most proficient in
the application of violence; the military exists solely to prepare for
and wage war; the profession of arms therefore occupies privileged
standing and subscribes to a superior ethos which should be immune from
the meddling scrutiny of unworthy amateurs. Such beliefs, deeply
ingrained in the thinking of uniformed professionals and their most
ardent acolytes (including more than a few on Capitol Hill), have led
the military to continue preparing, as always, for the wars of the past;
to deny the relevance of---and therefore to be generally unprepared
for---[the many contemporary contingencies that do not conform to the
traditional model of war; and, accordingly, to give experience-impaired
civilian officials little strategic maneuver room in responding to
emergent crises between the equally unpalatable options of inaction and
failure.]{.underline} These same beliefs, because they reflect something
deeper about the types of individuals the institution attracts and
rewards in fulfilling its sense of mission and self, also have
contributed materially to the military's incessant incident proneness.
Such incidents constitute a form of collective institutional
disobedience apparently too subtle for most of us to recognize for what
it is---the outgrowth of an institution that has lost its identity, that
no longer has confidence in or respect for those it is supposed to
serve. [The people]{.underline}, finally---[increasingly disenchanted,
cynical, and alienated, and captive still of the Cold War mentality that
convinced them they endanger the republic by knowing too much about or
questioning the methods or motives of their military and its civilian
masters---evince varying degrees of apathy, hostility, and distrust, all
of which undermine national will, societal civility, and the very life
of democracy itsel]{.underline}f. Congress, in turn, far from fulfilling
the republican ideal, has generally set itself above the people and
repeatedly shown its cultivated incapacity as a deliberative body, as an
effective check on presidential excess, and as a representative voice
for popular sovereignty. In their totality, these conditions call to
mind the facetious Cold War aphorism that under communism the workers
pretend to work, and the state pretends to pay them. Similarly might it
be said that under post Cold War American democracy, [civilians pretend
to control the military, and the military pretends to be
controlled.]{.underline}

\(1\) The future of warfare and the role of new and emerging
technologies The first webinar took place on 25 November 2020. As the
inaugural event in the series, it gave a preview of upcoming topics and
focused on the future of warfare and the role of new and emerging
technologies. [Major topics of discussion included artificial
intelligence (AI) and big data, AI in warfare, bridging the knowledge
and capability gap around AI-automated systems between the public and
private sectors, differences in regulatory frameworks across the
Alliance and opportunities for defence investment in AI tools, among
others. In addition to AI, emerging technologies]{.underline} like
hypersonic weapons, quantum and nanotechnologies and autonomous systems
[were also on the agenda]{.underline}. [Participants also discussed the
vital importance of cooperation between NATO and the private sector to
achieve NATO 2030 objectives]{.underline}, including public-private
partnerships with large corporate actors as well as small and medium
enterprises. The webinar also included a discussion on innovation
ecosystems and venture capital's role in Allied defence and security,
and how NATO and Allies can work to ensure safe financing for start-ups
that act as key hubs of creativity in the race to implement and adopt
new technologies. (2) Potential private sector contributions to Alliance
security In the second webinar, on 21 January 2021, [GLOBSEC facilitated
a dialogue between NATO and various business leaders on ways in which
the private sector could contribute to Alliance security]{.underline}.
Throughout the exchange, participants pointed out several potential
fields for increased cooperation with NATO on Alliance security. They
highlighted in particular that the private sector's extensive pool of
data and expertise could help enhance the Alliance's situational
awareness[. They also stressed the role that businesses can and must
play to improve the resilience of critical infrastructure, which is
often at least partially privately run]{.underline}. The participating
industry leaders also called on the public sector to close regulatory
loopholes on private investment in order to make supply chains more
transparent and emphasised the need for public support to boost
innovation. (3) Sustainable defence innovation and climate change On 11
February 2021, the third webinar focused on sustainable defence
innovation and its contribution to the fight against climate change.
Both NATO and the private sector recognise the ways in which climate
change affects security and defence. Indeed, the participating industry
leaders stressed that climate change will soon impact most policy areas
and concerns in one way or another. In this light, participants
underlined the importance of climate foresight and called for greater
transatlantic coordination on policy and technological innovation in
order to address emerging challenges early on, including as part of
efforts to mitigate climate change. (4) Geopolitical competition in the
information landscape The fourth webinar, held on 25 February 2021,
brought together various private sector leaders to exchange views with
NATO on geopolitical competition in the information landscape. The
participating private sector representatives recognised that the
information landscape is becoming ever more complex and contested,
especially in the context of changing geopolitical realities. In this
light, they discussed various concrete challenges to improved governance
in the information space. The participants highlighted in particular the
need for a coordinated transatlantic approach to online regulation and
increased public-private cooperation on threat analysis. They stressed
that the private sector, including small and medium enterprises, has
access to extensive data that can help inform public sector responses to
threats in the information space. They also underlined the importance of
wider public outreach to promote media literacy and data protection
across the transatlantic space. (5) Ethical deployment and governance of
new technologies On 25 March 2021, the fifth webinar was based around
the theme of transatlantic cooperation on the ethical deployment and
governance of emerging technologies. The discussion centred on the need
to improve regulation and fill regulatory gaps to ensure the ethical
development of emerging technologies[. Participants highlighted in
particular the role that NATO could play to coordinate and advance the
development of common tech norms. The private sector, they suggested,
could support such efforts with its technological and industry
expertise.]{.underline} The dialogue explored a number of concrete
ethical and legal challenges of emerging technologies in the fields of
both kinetic and non-kinetic warfare. As a general theme, industry
leaders called for the development of more elaborate and up-to-date
legal frameworks to reduce uncertainties and tackle potential ethical
issues early on. (6) Security of critical infrastructure and supply
[chains On 22 April 2021, GLOBSEC facilitated the sixth and final
webinar between NATO and private sector representatives]{.underline},
focused on critical infrastructure and the security of supply chains.
Critical infrastructure and supply chains have become increasingly
complex, global and interconnected. The participating industry leaders
recognised that this makes it more complicated to address
vulnerabilities and discussed a broad range of existing and emerging
challenges. [Noting the private sector's focus on cost minimisation,
participants stressed in particular the need for businesses to achieve a
balance between an appropriate level of security and costs. The public
sector, they suggested, could facilitate this effort by further
harmonising regulatory systems and facilitating exchanges between
industries in the transatlantic space]{.underline}.
