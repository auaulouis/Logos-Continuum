[Building the capacity of defense cyber institutions can help partner
nations identify, assess, and better understand risks, capacities, and
threats within their defense cyber ecosystem. The cyberspace
institutional capacity building community can act as a convener and
integrator, bringing together partner nation civilian and military
officials to:]{.underline} ¶ [Identify critical partner nation
cybersecurity needs and agree on areas of mutual interest for engagement
with the U.S.]{.underline}¶ [Devise risk mitigation
strategies]{.underline} and codify applicable policies and procedures¶
[Build new capabilities or institutions]{.underline} that are resourced,
trained, and equipped to effectively manage cybersecurity systems¶ Align
interoperability requirements between U.S. security cooperation
assistance and partner nation systems¶ Enhance the integrity and
security of local cyber defense institutions¶ Develop human capital
strategies for building and sustaining a cyber workforce¶ CCB supports
the development of cyberspace governance, national frameworks, policy,
strategy, and workforce development planning, which can become a force
multiplier for many other programs. Building new cyber capabilities
together with a partner nation is not enough. These must be effectively
integrated into their force structure, sustained and maintained, and
well-coordinated with other capabilities. Therefore, ISG enables close
partnership with diverse implementers, within DoD's security cooperation
ecosystem as well as across industry and academia. Working together with
the cybersecurity capacity building community, ISG is developing shared
tools and approaches to enhance the outcome of its work alongside
partner nations. In addition, the Institute is working to integrate
cybersecurity into the mainstream of ICB planning, and to support the
integration of country-level projects among the various implementers.
The Institute's CCB activities encompasses several initiatives:¶ Support
the integration of partner nation cyberrelated requirements into ICB
planning and design and support the integration of capacity building
projects at the country-level ¶ Support the development of a common
assessment methodology and lend support to GCCs to conduct assessments
of partner nation cyber capabilities as needed¶ Deliver a range of
capacity building and educational engagements on cyber governance,
policy, and strategy in support of GCCs and partners¶ Create tools and
aides for the broader community of interest/practice. Most recently, the
Institute conducted a study, initiated by ODASD Cyber Policy, and
developed 1) a cyber-focused capacity building playbook; and, 2) a
workforce development framework and compendium of relevant U.S.
training/education in support of the broad cyber capacity building
community. These products, developed through a collaborative process,
aim to further harmonize and improve the cyber community's development

Approves Global Posture Review Recommendations, 11-29-2021,

recommendations/#:\~:text=The%20Global%20Posture%20Review%20has,with%20his%20national%20security%20guidance,
bk

\"That [guidance asserts that the United States will lead with diplomacy
first, revitalize our unmatched network of allies and partners and make
smart and disciplined choices regarding our national defense and
responsible use of our military]{.underline},\" Karlin said. \"Nested
within this guidance, [the global posture review assesses
DOD]{.underline} overseas [forces]{.underline} and footprint along with
the framework [and processes that govern our posture decision
making.\"]{.underline}

The main outcome of the review is the return to normal of determining
military posture around the world and tying that to America\'s strategic
alignment, an official speaking on background earlier in the day said.
\"[The GPR has strengthened our decision making processes by
deliberately connecting strategic priorities, global trade-offs, force
readiness and modernization, interagency coordination and allied and
partner coordination to global posture planning and
decisions,]{.underline}\" the official said.

It is no surprise that the Indo-Pacific is the priority region for the
review, given the secretary\'s focus on China as America\'s pacing
challenge. [The review directs additional cooperation with allies and
partners to advance initiatives that contribute to regional stability
and deter Chinese military aggression]{.underline} and threats from
North Korea, Karlin said.

[These initiatives include seeking greater regional access for military
partnership activities,]{.underline} enhancing infrastructure in Guam
and Australia and prioritizing military construction across the Pacific
Islands. They also include new U.S. rotational aircraft deployments and
logistics cooperation in Australia, which DOD announced in September.

The review also approved the stationing of a previously rotational
attack helicopter squadron and an artillery division headquarters in the
Republic of Korea.

More initiatives are forthcoming in the region, but these require more
discussions among the allies and remain classified, Karlin said.

[In Europe, the review looks to strengthen the U.S. combat deterrent
against Russia, and enable NATO forces to operate more
effectively,]{.underline} she said. DOD has already instituted a couple
of recommendations including lifting the 25,000-man cap on active duty
troops in Germany imposed by the previous administration and the
decision to permanently base a multi-domain task force and theater fires
command --- a total of 500 U.S. Army personnel --- in Wiesbaden,
Germany. DOD will also retain seven sites previously designated for
return to Germany and Belgium under the European infrastructure
consolidation plan. The review identified additional capabilities that
will enhance U.S. deterrence posture in Europe, and these will be
discussed with allies in the near future, Karlin said.

[Since the beginning of the invasion, **DSCA** has executed \$2.3
billion in presidential drawdown of security assistance to Ukraine and
\$300 million under the Ukraine Security Assistance
Initiative]{.underline} as of April 1, the official said.

[The term presidential drawdown is used when the president authorizes
military hardware to be pulled from existing U.S. military
stock.]{.underline}

\"**[This is a time of higher \[operations tempo\] and faster movement
than we\'ve really ever done in our history]{.underline}**,\" the
official said.

The official then described how a presidential drawdown works.

[Working together with the Ukrainians and with U.S. European Command, a
list of requirements is developed and shared with those who work on
policy in the Pentagon. Coordination of stocks and deliveries is also
made with allies and partners.]{.underline}

A determination is made whether the U.S. industrial base can refill
those stocks over time.

[DSCA shares the list with the military departments, to determine if
they have the availability of the stocks.]{.underline}

The military departments provide information on what the readiness
impacts are of drawing down that equipment from U.S. stocks.

The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff provides his recommendations
and then a memorandum goes to the secretary of defense for his approval
of the drawdown plan.

The package of requirements is then built.

At that point, the president will direct the drawdown.

Then, [the State Department secretary signs a memo directing DOD to
execute and then DSCA puts out the executive order]{.underline}.

[Although there seem to be a lot of steps, that whole process has been
known in the last several months to done in as few as 48 to 72 hours,

WASHINGTON --- [The Biden administration said Friday that it will send
another \$400 million in military equipment to Ukraine, including four
more advanced rocket systems.]{.underline} The weapons, said a senior
defense official, will bolster Ukrainian efforts to strike deeper behind
Russian frontlines in the eastern Donbas region.

The aid comes as Moscow this week claimed full control of Ukraine\'s
Luhansk province in the Donbas, but Ukrainian officials say their troops
still control a small part of the province and fierce fighting continues
in several villages.

The defense official said that the eight High Mobility Artillery Rocket
Systems, or HIMARS, that were previously sent are still being used by
Ukraine forces in the fight. This will give them four more to help hit
Russian command and control nodes, logistics capabilities and other
systems that are further back behind the battlefront. A senior military
official said at least 100 Ukrainian troops have been trained on the
HIMARs. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss
details not yet made public.

Russia in recent days has launched dozens of missiles across Ukraine and
pinned down Ukrainian forces with continuous long-range fire for
sometimes hours at a time. The U.S. military official said that 10 to 15
Russian battalion tactical groups are in the Donbas region, but that
Russia has sustained significant losses in the recent fighting and may
have to pause to reorganize and reset equipment. There are between 800
to 1,000 troops in a battalion tactical group.

[Ukraine's leaders have publicly called on Western allies to quickly
send more ammunition and advanced systems that will help them narrow the
gap in equipment and manpower]{.underline}. The precision weapons can
help Ukraine hit Russian weapons that are farther away and are being
used to bombard Ukrainian locations.

[The latest aid, approved by President Joe Biden on Friday afternoon, is
the 15th package of military weapons and equipment transferred to
Ukraine from Defense Department stocks]{.underline} since last August.
[In addition to the HIMARS, the U.S. will also send 1,000 rounds of 155
millimeter artillery]{.underline} which has an increased precision
capability that also will help Ukraine hit specific targets. The package
also will include three tactical vehicles, counter battery radar
systems, spare parts and other equipment.

Acting Pentagon Press Secretary Todd Breasseale said the assistance will
meet critical needs for Ukraine's fight.

Looking ahead to the coming months, the defense official said that a key
goal is to build up Ukraine's logistics and repair capabilities so
troops can maintain its weapons systems and continue the fight into the
future.

[Overall, the U.S. has sent about \$7.3 billion in aid to Ukraine since
the war began in late February.]{.underline}

RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany --- [Defense leaders from more than 40
nations amassed]{.underline} on a blustery April day in southwestern
Germany, recruited by U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [to better
coordinate efforts supporting Ukraine in its defense against the Russian
invasion.]{.underline}

[Tuesday's gathering]{.underline}, which was organized with less than a
week's notice, [will now be a **monthly event**. Austin announced the
creation of a standing Ukraine-focused "contact group"]{.underline}
during a press briefing at the end of the event at Ramstein Air Base,
Germany.

["The contact group will be a vehicle for nations of goodwill to
intensify our efforts, coordinate our assistance, and focus on winning
today's fight and the struggles to come," Austin said.]{.underline}

[A key focus of these meetings will be improved coordination with
participating nations' defense-industrial bases, he added. "That means
dealing with the tremendous demand that we're facing for munitions and
weapons platforms."]{.underline}

The congregation of so many countries --- not only NATO members but also
partners based in Africa, Asia and the Middle East --- on Tuesday sends
"a powerful signal," Austin added. [Several nations, including Germany
and Canada, announced new heavy weapons shipments to Ukraine over the
course of the event.]{.underline}

While this meeting was in person, future gatherings could be virtual or
mixed, he noted. A senior defense official told reporters there will
likely be more nations attending virtually.

[The intent is to include any nation that wants to contribute to the
self-defense of Ukraine]{.underline}, and the monthly meetings will take
place in different locations, the official added, noting that [the
frequency of the meetings is due to the sense of urgency participants
feel about the second phase of the war in Ukraine, as Russia focuses its
attention and combat power in the Donbas region.]{.underline}

**[The meeting Tuesday and its successive events to follow are just one
example of the U.S. Defense Department and its allies' plans to continue
supplying lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine as quickly as
possible]{.underline}**.

[In March, U.S. European Command created a new unit called EUCOM Control
Center Ukraine, or ECCU, to coordinate and synchronize equipment
deliveries from Washington and its partners.]{.underline} Fifteen other
partner nations --- including NATO and non-NATO countries --- have
provided staff stationed at the center, located at U.S. Army Garrison
Stuttgart, a senior defense official told reporters Tuesday.

ECCU, led by the command's director of logistics, Rear Adm. R. Duke
Heinz, consists of a "near-soup-to-nuts of all things security systems
delivery," and combines a call center, a watch floor and meeting rooms,
the official said[. It has facilitated the delivery of equipment from
more than 40 nations to Ukraine.]{.underline}

[The center has worked to ensure those deliveries are facilitated as
quickly as possible]{.underline}, the official added, noting that since
Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, [the DoD has **significantly
ramped up delivery rates** --- from one flight every other day, to about
eight to 10 flights per day.]{.underline}

["At some points, it has spiked to nearly double that as we ramped up
our coordination and logistics efforts to make sure that we're meeting
the needs of the Ukrainian armed forces in near-real time,"]{.underline}
the official added. [The U.S. military has also expanded its equipment
delivery support from "a single path" to a "multi-modal effort,"
including multiple routes over air, ground and rail,]{.underline} the
official said.

[In the 60-plus days since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24,
nations have supplied more than \$5 billion worth of equipment to the
Ukrainian forces, with about \$3.7 billion coming from the United
States, Austin said Tuesday.]{.underline}

#### Defense base innovation is key check great power competition from Russia and China. 

**Marks 19**, Michael, former Senior Policy Advisor to the Under
Secretary for Security Assistance, Science and Technology at the U.S.
Department of State., 10-10-2019, \"Strengthen Us Industry To Counter
National Security Challenges,\" American Military News,
https://americanmilitarynews.com/2019/10/strengthen-us-industry-to-counter-national-security-challenges/

[While U.S. defense budgets have recently been on the rise, it is likely
that we will see a spending decline in the coming years as competition
for non-defense federal budget dollars increases and deficits grow. The
United States, therefore, must take action to ensure that we maintain
our technological edge against our adversaries by empowering the private
sector to provide cost-effective innovation for America's defense. Since
the end of the Second World War **the U.S. has relied on qualitative
superiority**]{.underline} [over its potential adversaries,]{.underline}
e[specially those like the Soviet Union/Russia and China, who enjoyed
comparative quantitative advantages.]{.underline} **[These qualitative
advantages were vital to maintaining global stability and helped enable
our nation to become the preeminent global economy]{.underline}**, [but
they have been eroded over the last few decades.]{.underline} In 1960,
the U.S. share of global research and development (R&D) spending stood
at 69%. U.S. defense-related R&D alone accounted for 36% of total global
expenditures. Soon thereafter other nations recognized the need to
increase their R&D expenditures and build their own defense industrial
bases to compete with the United States. From 2000-2016, China's share
of global R&D rose from 4.9% to 25.1% while the U.S. share of global R&D
dropped to 28%. U.S. defense-related R&D meanwhile now makes up a mere
4% of global R&D spending. [There can be no doubt that Russia and China
are determined to challenge America's qualitative advantage. From the
rebirth of Russian military power under Vladimir Putin to the
ever-growing Chinese military prowess across the board, their efforts
show no sign of slowing down.]{.underline} Russia has been and continues
to undergo a major modernization of its armed forces. For example, they
are in the midst of a ten-year program to build hundreds of new nuclear
missiles and have set a goal of modernizing 70% of the Russian Ground
Force's equipment by 2020. [One of the most frightening examples of
Russia's resurgence is its development of a hypersonic missile that
could be ready for combat as early as 2020]{.underline}. Worryingly, the
US is currently unable to defend against this type of missile. [To
accompany these developments came the emergence in 2017 of Russia as the
world's second-largest arms producer, ready and able to support nations
hostile to US interests.]{.underline} China, on the other hand, used to
be a country that only manufactured cheap products and knockoffs, but
that is no longer true. [Technology development and innovation figure
prominently in all of China's national planning goals, with plans to
make the country the global leader in science and innovation and the
preeminent technological and manufacturing power by 2049]{.underline},
the 100th anniversary of the Chinese communist revolution. This, of
course, has huge implications for China's military capability. [The
country now has the second-largest national defense budget behind the
U.S. and wants to be Asia's preeminent military power. Beijing is
developing next-generation fighter jets, ICBMs and shorter-range
ballistic missiles, as well as advanced naval vessels. The People's
Liberation Army has reached a critical point of confidence and now feel
they can match competitors like the United States in
combat]{.underline}. **[This has implications for the security of
Taiwan, Japan, other US allies in the region as well as to America
itself]{.underline}**. [To make matters worse, there are a growing
number of experts that see China developing asymmetric technologies,
combined with conventional and nuclear systems **that could create an
existential threat to the U.S. pacific based assets.** It is in the wake
of these growing threats to our national security American industry will
likely be expected to shoulder an even larger responsibility concerning
investment in defense-related R&D.]{.underline} One of the ways we can
empower companies to make these additional investments and lead
next-generation defense innovation is to allow commonsense mergers
between important defense and aerospace companies. Horizontal
consolidation eliminates the redundancy of enormous fixed costs, leading
to savings passed down to customers. Mergers can also create economies
of scale and existing synergies that help the combined company realize
access to larger numbers of engineers and innovators, while keeping
costs low and improving the timeline for taking a product from concept
to development. A recent example of how this can work is the proposed
Raytheon and United Technologies merger. The two parties project that
the new combined company will employ more than 60,000 engineers, hold
over 38,000 patents and invest approximately \$8 billion per year in
research and development. This will allow the development of new,
critical technologies more quickly and efficiently than either company
could on its own. Such private sector investments in innovation will be
critical in the face of the growing challenges to American military
dominance. [America's R&D advantage, crucial to maintaining military
superiority, is increasingly at risk. As China and Russia continue to
challenge America's military dominance and pressures on the defense
budget continue to mount, **the federal government will likely turn more
and more to contractors and commercial companies to develop
next-generation defense capabilities**. Strengthening U.S. industry,
therefore, will be critical to countering our national security
challenges.]{.underline}

#### That risks nuclear escalation

**Mitchell 16,** A. Wess Mitchell 2016, President of the Center for
European Policy Analysis, 2-12-2016, Predators on the Frontier" The
American Interest,
<http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/02/12/predators-on-the-frontier/>

Revisionist powers are on the move. ‎From eastern Ukraine and the Persian
Gulf to the South China Sea, large rivals of the United States are
modernizing their military forces, grabbing strategic real estate, and
threatening vulnerable U.S. allies. Their goal is not just to assert
hegemony over their neighborhoods but to rearrange the global security
order as we have known it since the end of the Second World War. We
first wrote about these emerging dynamics in 2010, and then in TAI in
2011. We argued three things. First, that [revisionist powers were using
a strategy of "probing]{.underline}": a combination of assertive
diplomacy and small but bold military actions [to test]{.underline} the
outer reaches of [American power]{.underline} and in particular the
resilience of frontier allies. Second, we argued that the small, exposed
allies who were the targets of these probes were likely to respond by
developing back-up options to U.S. security guarantees, whether through
military self-help or accommodation. And third, we argued that that
**[China and Russia were learning from one another's
probes]{.underline}** in their respective regions, and that allies
themselves were drawing conclusions about U.S. deterrence in their own
neighborhood from how America handled similarly situated allies
elsewhere. Five years later, as we argue in a new book released this
month, these dynamics have intensified dramatically. Revisionist powers
are indeed probing the United States, but their methods have become
bolder, more violent---and successful. [Allies]{.underline} have grown
more alert to this pressure, amid the steady whittling away of
neighboring buffer zones, and [have begun to pursue]{.underline} an
array of self-help schemes ranging from [arms build-ups]{.underline} to
flirtations with the nearby revisionist power. It has become harder for
the United States to isolate security crises to one region: Russia's
land-grabs in Eastern Europe provide both a model and distraction effect
for China to accelerate its maritime claims in the South China Sea;
Poland's quest for U.S. strategic reassurance unnerves and spurs allies
in the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific. By degrees, [the world is
entering the path to war]{.underline}. Not since the 1980s have the
conditions been riper for a major international military crisis. [Not
since the 1930s has the world witnessed the emergence of **multiple
large, predatory states** determined to revise the global
order]{.underline} to their advantage---if necessary by force. At a
minimum, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in coming years
could face the pressure of managing several deteriorating regional
security spirals; at a maximum, it [could be confronted with a **Great
Power war** against]{.underline} one, and possibly [two]{.underline} or
even three, **[nuclear-armed peer competitors]{.underline}**. In either
case, the U.S. military could face these scenarios without either the
presumption of technological overmatch or favorable force ratios that it
has enjoyed against its rivals for the past several decades. How should
the United States respond to these dynamics? As our rivals grow more
aggressive and our military edge narrows, we must look to other methods
for waging and winning geopolitical competitions in the 21st century.
The most readily available but underutilized tool at our disposal is
alliances. [America's frontline allies offer a mechanism by which it can
contain rivals]{.underline}---indeed, this was the original purpose for
cultivating security linkages with small states in the world's rimland
regions to begin with. In coming years, the value of strategically
placed allies near Eurasia's large land powers will grow as our relative
technological or numerical military strength shrinks. The time has come
for the United States to develop a grand strategy for containing peer
competitors centered on the creative use of frontline allies. It must do
so now, before geopolitical competition intensifies. Predatory Peers
Probing has been the strategy of choice for America's modern rivals to
challenge the existing order. Over the past few years, [Russia, China,
and]{.underline}, to a degree, [Iran]{.underline} have sensed that the
United States is retreating in their respective regions---whether out of
choice, fatigue, weakness, or all three combined. But they [are unsure
of how much remaining strength the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has, or of the solidity of its commitments to
allies]{.underline}. Rather than risking direct war, [they have employed
low-intensity crises to test U.S. power]{.underline} in these regions.
Like past revisionists, they have focused their probes on seemingly
secondary interests of the leading power, either by humbling its weakest
allies or seizing gray zones over which the United States is unlikely to
fight. These probes test the United States on the outer rim of its
influence, where the revisionist's own interests are strongest while the
U.S. is at its furthest commitments and therefore most vulnerable to
defeat. Russia has launched a steady sequence of threatening military
moves against vulnerable NATO allies and conducted limited offensives
against former Soviet satellite states. China has sought out
low-intensity diplomatic confrontations with small U.S. security
clients, erected military no-go zones, and asserted claims over
strategic waterways. When we wrote about this behavior in The American
Interest in 2011, it was composed mainly of aggressive diplomacy or
threatening but small military moves. But the probes of U.S. rivals are
becoming bolder. Sensing a window of opportunity, in 2014 Russia upped
the ante by invading Ukraine---the largest country in Eastern
Europe---in a war that has so far cost 7,000 lives and brought 52,000
square kilometers of territory into the Russian sphere of influence.
After years of using unmarked fishing trawlers to harass U.S. or allied
naval vessels, China has begun to militarize its probes in the South
China Sea, constructing seven artificial islands and claiming (and
threatening to fight over) 1.8 million square kilometers of ocean. Iran
has recently humiliated the United States by holding American naval
vessels and broadcasting photos of surrendering U.S. sailors. In all
cases, revisionist powers increased the stakes because they perceived
their initial probes to have succeeded. Having achieved modest gains,
they increased the intensity of their probes. The strategic significance
of these latest probes for the United States is twofold. First, they
have substantially increased the military pressure on frontline allies.
The presence of a buffer zone of some sort, whether land or sea, between
allies like Poland or Japan and neighboring revisionist powers, helped
to reduce the odds of sustained contact and confrontation between allied
and rival militaries. By successfully encroaching on or invading these
middle spaces, [revisionists have advanced the zone of contest closer
to]{.underline} the territory of [U.S. allies, increasing the potential
for a deliberate or **accidental** military clash]{.underline}. Second,
the latest probes have significantly raised the overall pressure on the
United States. As long as Russia's military adventures were restricted
to its own southern periphery, America could afford to shift resources
to the Pacific without worrying much about the consequences in
Europe---an important consideration given the Pentagon's jettisoning of
the goal to be able to fight a two-front war. With both Ukraine and the
South China Sea at play (and with a chaotic Middle East, where another
rival, Iran, advances its reach and influence), the United States no
longer has the luxury of prioritizing one region over another; with two
re-militarized frontiers at opposite ends of the globe, it must
continually weigh trade-offs in scarce military resources between
geographic theaters. This disadvantage is not lost on America's rivals,
or its most exposed friends. Frontier Frenzy The intensification of
probing has reverberated through the ranks of America's frontline
allies. In both Europe and Asia, the edges of the Western order are
inhabited by historically vulnerable small or mid-sized states that over
the past seven decades have relied on the United States for their
existence. The similarities in the geopolitical position and strategic
options of states like Estonia and Taiwan, or Poland and South Korea,
are striking. For all of these states, survival depends above all on the
sustainability of U.S. extended [deterrence]{.underline}, in both its
nuclear and conventional forms. This in turn [rests on]{.underline} two
foundations: [the assumption among rivals and allies alike that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is physically able to fulfill
its security obligations to even the smallest ally, and the assumption
that it is **politically willing to do so**]{.underline}. Doubts about
both have been growing for many years. Reductions in American defense
spending are weakening the U.S. military capability to protect allies.
Due to cuts introduced by the 2009 Budget Control Act, the U.S. Navy is
smaller than at any point since before the First World War, the U.S.
Army is smaller than at any point since before the Second World War and
the U.S. Air Force has the lowest number of operational warplanes in its
history. Nuclear force levels are static or declining, and the U.S.
technological edge over rivals in important weapons types has
diminished. The Pentagon in 2009 announced that for the first time since
the Second World War it would jettison the goal of being able to conduct
a two-front global war. At the same time that U.S. capabilities are
decreasing, those of our rivals are increasing. Both Russia and China
have undertaken large, multiyear military expansion and modernization
programs and the technological gap between them and the United States is
narrowing, particularly in key areas such as short-range missiles,
tactical nuclear weapons, and fifth-generation fighter aircraft. Recent
American statecraft has compounded the problem by weakening the belief
in U.S. political will to defend allies. The early Obama
Administration's public questioning of the value of traditional
alliances as "alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a
long-gone Cold War" shook allied confidence at the same time that its
high-profile engagement with large rivals indicated a preference for
big-power bargaining over the heads of small states. The U.S.-Russia
"reset" seemed to many allies both transactional and freewheeling, and
left a lasting impression of the suddenness with which U.S. priorities
could shift from one Administration to the next. This undermined the
predictability of patronage that is the sine qua non of effective
deterrence for any Great Power. As the revisionists' probes have become
more assertive and U.S. credibility less firm, America's frontier allies
have started to reconsider their national security options. Five years
ago, many frontline states expressed security concerns, began to seek
greater military capabilities, or looked to offset risk by engaging
diplomatically with revisionists. But for the most part, such behavior
was muted and well within the bounds of existing alliance commitments.
However, as probing has picked up pace, allied coping behavior has
become more frantic. In Europe, Poland, the Baltic States, and Romania
have initiated military spending increases. In Asia, littoral U.S.
allies are engaged in a worrisome regional arms race. In both regions,
the largest allies are considering offensive capabilities to create
conventional deterrence. Their willingness to build up their indigenous
military capabilities is overall a positive development, but it carries
risks, too, spurring dynamics that were absent over the past decades.
The danger is that, absent a consistent and credible U.S. overwatch,
rearming allies engage in a chaotic acquisition strategy, poorly
anchored in the larger alliance. Fearing abandonment, such states may
end up detaching themselves from the alliance simply by pursuing
independent security policies. There is also danger on the other side of
the spectrum of possible responses by frontline allies. Contrary to the
hopeful assumptions of offshore balancers, not all frontline allies are
resisting. Some are choosing strategies of accommodation. Bulgaria,
Hungary, and Slovakia in Europe and Thailand and Malaysia in Asia are
all examples of nominal U.S. allies that are trying to avoid
antagonizing the stronger predator. Worsening regional security dynamics
create domestic political pressures to avoid confrontation with the
nearby revisionist power. Full-fledged bandwagoning in the form of the
establishment of new alliances is not yet visible, but hedging is. Seeds
of Disorder The combination of intensifying probes and fragmenting
alliances threatens to unravel important components of the stability of
major regions and the wider international order. Allowed to continue on
their current path, security dynamics in Eastern Europe and the Western
Pacific could lead to negative or even catastrophic outcomes for U.S.
national security. One increasingly likely near-term scenario is a
simmering, simultaneous security competition in major regions. In such a
scenario, [rivals]{.underline} continue [probing allies]{.underline} and
grabbing middle-zone territory while steering clear of war with the
United States or its proxies; allies continue making half-measure
preparations without becoming fully capable of managing their own
security; and the United States continues feeding greater and greater
resources into frontline regions without achieving reassurance, doggedly
tested and put in doubt by the revisionists. Through a continued series
of probes, the revisionist powers maintain the initiative while the
United States and its allies play catch up. The result
[might]{.underline} be a gradual hardening of the U.S. security
perimeter that never culminates in a Great Power war but
[generate]{.underline}s many of the negative features of sustained
security competition---[arms races, proxy wars, and cyber and hybrid
conflicts---that **erode the bases of global economic
growth**.]{.underline} A second, graver possibility is war.
[Historically, a lengthy series of successful probes has often
culminated in a military confrontation.]{.underline} One dangerous
characteristic of today's international landscape is that not one but
two revisionists have now completed protracted sequences of probes that,
from their perspective, have been successful. If the purpose of probing
is to assess the top power's strength, [today's probes
could]{.underline} eventually [convince either Russia, China, or both
that the time is ripe for a more definitive contest]{.underline}. It is
uncertain what the outcome would be. Force ratios in today's two
hotspots, the Baltic Sea and South China Sea, do not favor the United
States. Both Russia and China possess significant anti-access/area
denial (A2AD) capabilities, with a ten-to-one Russian troop advantage in
the Baltic and massive Chinese preponderance of coastal short-range
missiles in the South China Sea. Moreover, [both powers possess nuclear
weapons and, in Russia's case, a doctrine favoring their **escalatory
use for strategic effect**]{.underline}. And even if the United States
can maintain overwhelming military superiority in a dyadic contest, war
is always the realm of chance and a source of destruction that threatens
the stability of the existing international order. Having failed a
series of probes, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could
face]{.underline} the prospect of either [a]{.underline} short, sharp
**[war that culminates in nuclear attack]{.underline}** or an
economically costly protracted two-front conflict. Either outcome would
definitely alter the U.S.-led international system as we know it. A
third, long-term possibility is a gradual eviction of the United States
from the rimland regions. This could occur either through a military
defeat, as described above, or through the gradual hollowing out of U.S.
regional alliances due to the erosion of deterrence and alliance
defection---and therefore this scenario is not mutually exclusive of the
previous two. For the United States, this would be geopolitically
disastrous, involving a loss of position in the places where America
must be present to prevent the risk of hemispheric isolation. Gaining a
foothold in the Eurasian rimlands has been a major, if not the most
important, goal of U.S. grand strategy for a century. It is through this
presence that the United States is able to shape global politics and
avoid the emergence of mortal threats to itself. Without such a
presence, America's largest rivals would be able to steadily aggrandize,
building up enlarged spheres of influence, territory, and resources that
would render them capable of sustained competition for global primacy.
Unlike in the 20th century, current A2AD and nuclear technology would
make a military reentry into these regions difficult if not impossible.

#### Permanently destabilizes the West -- laundry list of catastrophic impacts

// st

[If Russia gains control of Ukraine or manages to destabilize it on a
major scale, a new era for the United States and for Europe will
begin.]{.underline} U.S. and European leaders would face the dual
challenge of rethinking European security and of not being drawn into a
larger war with Russia. All sides would have to consider the potential
of nuclear-armed adversaries in direct confrontation. [These two
responsibilities---robustly defending European peace and prudently
avoiding military escalation with Russia---will not necessarily be
compatible. The United States and its allies could find themselves
deeply unprepared for the task of having to create a new European
security order as a result of Russia's military actions in
Ukraine.]{.underline}¶ MANY WAYS TO WIN¶ [For Russia, victory in Ukraine
could take various forms. As in Syria, victory does not have to result
in a sustainable settlement. It could involve the installation of a
compliant government in Kyiv or the partition of the country.
Alternatively, the defeat of the Ukrainian military and the negotiation
of a Ukrainian surrender could effectively transform Ukraine into a
failed state.]{.underline} Russia could also employ devastating
cyberattacks and disinformation tools, backed by the threat of force, to
cripple the country and induce regime change. With any of these
outcomes, [Ukraine will]{.underline} have [be]{.underline}en effectively
[detached from the West.]{.underline}¶ If Russia achieves its political
aims in Ukraine by military means, [Europe will not be what it was
before the war. Not only will U.S. primacy in Europe have been
qualified; any sense that the European Union or NATO can ensure peace on
the continent will be the artifact of a lost age.]{.underline} Instead,
security in Europe will have to be reduced to defending the core members
of the EU and NATO. Everyone outside the clubs will stand alone, with
the exception of Finland and Sweden. This may not necessarily be a
conscious decision to end enlargement or association policies; but it
will be de facto policy. [Under a perceived siege by Russia, the EU and
NATO will no longer have the capacity for ambitious policies beyond
their own borders]{.underline}.¶ [The United States and Europe will also
be in a state of permanent economic war with Russia. The West will seek
to enforce sweeping sanctions, which Russia is likely to parry with
cyber-measures and energy blackmailing, given the economic asymmetries.
China might well stand on Russia's side in this economic tit for tat.
Meanwhile, domestic politics in European countries will resemble a
twenty-first-century great game, in which Russia will be studying Europe
for any breakdown in the commitment to NATO and to the transatlantic
relationship]{.underline}. Through methods fair and foul, [Russia will
take whatever opportunity comes its way to influence public opinion and
elections in European countries.]{.underline} Russia will be an anarchic
presence---sometimes real, sometimes imagined---in every instance of
European political instability.¶ Eastern member states would have NATO
troops permanently on their soil.¶ [Cold War analogies will not be
helpful in a world with a Russianized Ukraine.]{.underline} The Cold War
border in Europe had its flash points, but it was stabilized in a
mutually acceptable fashion in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975. By
contrast, [Russian suzerainty over Ukraine would open a vast zone of
destabilization and insecurity from Estonia to Poland to Romania to
Turkey]{.underline}. For as long as it lasts, Russia's presence in
Ukraine will be perceived by Ukraine's neighbors as provocative and
unacceptable and, for some, as a threat to their own security. Amid this
shifting dynamic, order in Europe will have to be conceived of in
primarily military terms---which, since Russia has a stronger hand in
the military than in the economic realm, will be in the Kremlin's
interest---sidelining nonmilitary institutions such as the European
Union.¶ [Russia has Europe's largest conventional military, which it is
more than ready to use. The EU's defense policy---in contrast to
NATO's---is far from being able to provide security for its
members.]{.underline} Thus will military reassurance, especially of the
EU's eastern members, be key. Responding to a revanchist Russia with
sanctions and with the rhetorical proclamation of a rules-based
international order will not be sufficient.¶ IMPERILING EUROPE\'S EAST¶
In the event of a Russian victory in Ukraine, [Germany's position in
Europe will be severely challenged. Germany is a marginal military power
that has based its postwar political identity on the rejection of war.
T]{.underline}he ring of friends it has surrounded itself with,
especially in the east with Poland and the Baltic states, risks being
destabilized by Russia. France and the United Kingdom will assume
leading roles in European affairs by virtue of their comparatively
strong militaries and long tradition of military interventions. The key
factor in Europe, however, will remain the United States. NATO will
depend on U.S. support as will the anxious and imperiled countries of
Europe's east, the frontline nations arrayed along a now very large,
expanded, and uncertain line of contact with Russia, including Belarus
and the Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.¶ Eastern member states,
including Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania, will likely
have substantial numbers of NATO troops permanently stationed on their
soil. A request from Finland and Sweden to gain an Article 5 commitment
and to join NATO would be impossible to reject. In Ukraine, EU and NATO
countries will never recognize a new Russian-backed regime created by
Moscow. But they will face the same challenge they do with Belarus:
wielding sanctions without punishing the population and supporting those
in need without having access to them. Some NATO members will bolster a
Ukrainian insurgency, to which Russia will respond by threatening NATO
members. ¶ Ukraine's predicament will be very great. [Refugees will flee
in multiple directions, quite possibly in the millions. And those parts
of the Ukrainian military that are not directly defeated will continue
fighting, echoing the partisan warfare that tore apart this whole region
of Europe during and after World War II.]{.underline}¶ [The permanent
state of escalation between Russia and Europe may stay cold from a
military perspective. It is likely, though, to be economically
hot.]{.underline} The sanctions put on Russia in 2014, which were
connected to formal diplomacy (often referred to as the "Minsk" process,
after the city in which the negotiations were held), were not draconian.
They were reversible as well as conditional. [Following a Russian
invasion of Ukraine, new sanctions on banking and on technology transfer
would be significant and permanent. They would come in the wake of
failed diplomacy and would start at "the top of the ladder," according
to the U.S. administration. In response, Russia will retaliate, quite
possibly in the cyber-domain as well as in the energy sector. Moscow
will limit access to critical goods such as titanium, of which Russia
has been the world's second-largest exporter. This war of attrition will
test both sides. Russia will be ruthless in trying to get one or several
European states to back away from economic conflict by linking a
relaxation in tension to these countries' self-interest, thus
undermining consensus in the EU and NATO.]{.underline}¶ Europe's strong
suit is its economic leverage. Russia's asset will be any source of
domestic division or disruption in Europe or in Europe's transatlantic
partners. Here Russia will be proactive and opportunistic. [If a
pro-Russian movement or candidate shows up, that candidate can be
encouraged directly or indirectly. If an economic or political sore
point diminishes the foreign policy efficacy of the United States and
its allies, it will be a weapon for Russian propaganda efforts and for
Russian espionage.]{.underline}¶ Much of this is already happening. But
a war in Ukraine will up the ante. [Russia will use more resources and
be unchained in its choice of instruments. The massive refugee flows
arriving in Europe will exacerbate the EU's unresolved refugee policy
and provide fertile ground for populists. The holy grail of these
informational, political, and cyberbattles will be the 2024 presidential
election in the United States. Europe's future will depend on this
election. The election of Donald Trump or of a Trumpian candidate might
destroy the transatlantic relationship at Europe's hour of maximum
peril, putting into question NATO's position and its security guarantees
for Europe.]{.underline}¶ TURNING NATO INWARD¶ For the United States, a
Russian victory would have profound effects on its grand strategy in
Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. First, [Russian success in Ukraine
would require Washington to pivot to Europe]{.underline}. No ambiguity
about NATO's Article 5 (of the kind experienced under Trump) will be
permissible. Only a strong U.S. commitment to European security will
prevent Russia from dividing European countries from one another. This
will be [difficult in light of competing priorities, especially those
that confront the United States in a deteriorating relationship with
China]{.underline}. But the interests at stake are fundamental. T[he
United States has very large commercial equities in Europe.]{.underline}
The European Union and the United States are each other's largest trade
and investment partners, with trade in goods and services totaling \$1.1
trillion in 2019. A well-functioning, peaceful Europe augments American
foreign policy---on climate change, on nonproliferation, on global
public health, and on the management of tensions with China or Russia.
If Europe is destabilized, then the United States will be much more
alone in the world.¶ [NATO is the logical means by which the United
States can provide security reassurance to Europe and deter Russia. A
war in Ukraine would revive NATO not as a democracy-building enterprise
or as a tool for out-of-area expeditions like the war in Afghanistan but
as the unsurpassed defensive military alliance that it was designed to
be.]{.underline} Although Europeans will be demanding a greater military
commitment to Europe from the United States, a broader Russian
[invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine should [drive every NATO member to
increase its defense spending.]{.underline} For Europeans, this would be
the final call to improve Europe's defensive capabilities---in tandem
with the United States---in order to help the United States manage the
Russian-Chinese dilemma.¶ [The nuclear superpowers would have to keep
their outrage in check.]{.underline}¶ [For a Moscow now in permanent
confrontation with the West, Beijing could serve as an economic backstop
and a partner in opposing U.S. hegemony. In the worst case for U.S.
grand strategy, China might be emboldened by Russia's assertiveness and
threaten confrontation over Taiwan.]{.underline} But there is no
guarantee that an escalation in Ukraine will benefit the Sino-Russian
relationship. China's ambition to become the central node of the
Eurasian economy will be damaged by war in Europe, because of the brutal
uncertainties war brings. Chinese irritation with a Russia on the march
will not enable a rapprochement between Washington and Beijing, but it
may initiate new conversations.

### Food Prices

#### Spikes food prices

// st

[The price of failure -- **the true cost of a Putin victory** -- could
be staggering]{.underline}. It is potentially unsupportable for
fractious western democracies and poorer countries alike, beset by
simultaneous post-pandemic security, energy, food, inflation and climate
crises. Yet out of myopic self-interest over issues such as Russian oil
and gas imports, and from fear of wider escalation, western leaders duck
the tough choices that could ensure Ukraine's survival and help mitigate
such ills.¶ The past week furnished a grim glimpse of the future that
awaits if Putin is able to continue to wage war with impunity, commit
more heinous crimes, threaten nuclear and chemical blackmail and trash
the UN charter. [Drastically downgrading its growth forecasts due to the
conflict, the International Monetary Fund predicted global economic
fragmentation, rising debt and social unrest.]{.underline}¶ [David
Malpass, head of the World Bank, said a "human catastrophe" loomed as an
unprecedented, estimated **37% rise in food prices**, caused by
war-related disruption to supplies, pushed millions into poverty,
increased malnutrition,]{.underline} and reduced funding for education
and healthcare for the least well-off.

He cited [destabilizing dynamics in Mali, Chad, Malawi, and Burkina

conflicts in Ethiopia and Afghanistan; drought and famine in Africa, and
a "ring of fire around the world" as an escalating number of people
continue "marching to starvation".]{.underline}¶ ["Food security is
critical to peace and stability" globally]{.underline}, he underscored.¶
The WFP chief said 276 million people are struggling to find food, and
49 million in 43 countries are "knocking on famine's door," which
results not only in death but "unmatched migration," which destabilizes
societies.¶ And while the "perfect storm" has resulted in a rise in food
prices in 2022, he said that food availability would be the big concern
in 2023.¶ Mr. Beasley stressed the importance of increasing production,
opening Ukraine's ports and emptying its silos to stabilize markets and
address the global food crisis.¶ ["Act with urgency today,"]{.underline}
he told the Council.¶ Reversing prosperity¶ The Food and Agriculture
Organization's (FAO) Director-General, Qu Dongyu, discussed the
importance of people, peace, prosperity and the planet.¶ "Worldwide,
prosperity is being reversed," he said. "There is [less food
security]{.underline}, health security and income" while [inequality
becomes greater.]{.underline}¶ He pointed to a "spike in acute hunger
globally," with 2022 threatening even further deterioration.¶ While FAO
has strengthened agri-food systems to save lives and protect livelihoods
for the most vulnerable[, "more needs to be done together," according to
its top official, who called conflict "the single greatest driver of
hunger".]{.underline}

economic and diplomatic [competition with **Russia** and]{.mark} a
surging [**China** could spiral out of control.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Concurrently, we face threats to our future security posed by growing
civil strife, famine, and refugee and migration challenges which create
incubators for extremist and anti-American government factions. Our
response cannot be one dimensional but instead must be a nuanced and
comprehensive National Security Strategy combining all elements of
National Power including a Food Security Strategy. [An **American Food
Security Strategy** is an imperative factor in **reducing the multiple
threats impacting our National wellbeing.**]{.underline} [Recent history
has shown that **[reliable food supplies and stable prices
produce]{.mark} more [stable]{.mark} and secure [countries.]{.mark}**
Conversely, food insecurity, particularly in poorer countries, can lead
to instability, unrest, and violence. [**Food insecurity** drives mass
migration]{.mark} around the world from the Middle East, to Africa, to
Southeast Asia, destabilizing neighboring populations, **[generating
conflicts]{.mark}**, and threatening our own security by disrupting our
economic, military, and diplomatic relationships.]{.underline} [**Food
system shocks** from extreme food-price volatility can be correlated
with protests and riots.]{.underline} Food price related protests
toppled governments in Haiti and Madagascar in 2007 and 2008. In 2010
and in 2011, food prices and grievances related to food policy were one
of the major drivers of the Arab Spring uprisings. Repeatedly, history
has taught us that a strong agricultural sector is an unquestionable
requirement for inclusive and sustainable growth, broad-based
development progress, and long-term stability. The impact can be
remarkable and far reaching. [Rising income, in addition to reducing the
opportunities for an upsurge in extremism, leads to changes in diet,
producing demand for more diverse and nutritious foods provided, in many
cases, from **American farmers** and ranchers.]{.underline} [**[Emerging
markets]{.mark}** currently [purchase 20 percent of U.S.
ag]{.mark}riculture exports [and that]{.mark} figure [is **expected to
grow**]{.mark} as populations boom.]{.underline} Moving early to ensure
stability in strategically significant regions requires long term
planning and a disciplined, thoughtful strategy. To combat current
threats and work to prevent future ones, our national leadership must
employ the entire spectrum of our power including diplomatic, economic,
and cultural elements. The best means to prevent future chaos and the
resulting instability is positive engagement addressing the causes of
instability before it occurs. This is not rocket science. We know where
the instability is most likely to occur. The world population will grow
by 2.5 billion people by 2050. Unfortunately, this massive population
boom is projected to occur primarily in the most fragile and food
insecure countries. This alarming math is not just about total numbers.
Projections show that the greatest increase is in the age groups most
vulnerable to extremism. There are currently 200 million people in
Africa between the ages of 15 and 24, with that number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Already, 60% of the unemployed in Africa
are young people. Too often **[[these]{.mark} situations [deteriorate
into]{.mark} shooting [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}** requiring the
deployment of our military forces. We should be continually mindful that
the price we pay for committing military forces is measured in our most
precious national resource, the blood of those who serve. For those who
live in rural America, this has a disproportionate impact. Fully 40% of
those who serve in our military come from the farms, ranches, and
non-urban communities that make up only 16% of our population. Actions
taken now to increase agricultural sector jobs can provide economic
opportunity and stability for those unemployed youths while helping to
feed people. A recent report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
identifies agriculture development as the core essential for providing
greater food security, economic growth, and population well-being. [Our
active support for food security, including agriculture development, has
helped stabilize key regions over the past 60 years. A robust food
security strategy, as a part of our overall security strategy, can
mitigate the growth of terrorism, build important relationships, and
support continued American economic and agricultural prosperity while
materially contributing to our Nation's and the world's
security.]{.underline}

Russia is already confident enough to start wars to change borders in
Europe, attempt a coup in Montenegro; conduct multiple cyber-attacks
against Western nations; meddle in several referendums and elections;
assassinating (or attempt thereof) of Russian individuals abroad, and
conduct influence operations across Europe.¶ [A Russian defeat of
Ukraine will mark the rise of "Great Russia" in both physical and
psychological terms.]{.underline}¶ Firstly, [it would happen because the
West allowed Russia to defeat Ukraine]{.underline}. The tools we
selected to coerce Russia into cooperation -- being the same the West
always applies -- would once again have been proven impotent. Neither
sanctions, (temporarily) diplomatic isolation, dialogue, international
condemnation nor military measures would have stopped Russia.¶ [Russia
recognizes that if it is commercially attractive today, it will become
even more so as "Great Russia" (Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine) with a
population of nearly 200 million people. President Putin has even argued
that]{.underline}¶ ["... any integration of Russia and Ukraine, along
with their capacities and competitive advantages would spell the
emergence of a rival, a global rival for both Europe and the
world.]{.underline} No one wants this. That's why they'll do anything to
tear us apart."¶ [A Russia "reconnected" to its past economic marked,
with a revamped defense industry, controlling a bigger part of Europe's
supply of both energy and agricultural product, an emerging IT industry,
while simultaneously dominating both present and emerging shipping lane
between Europe and Asia (Eastern Mediterranean and North-East Passage),
will emerge more self-confident than ever.]{.underline}¶ It will emerge
as the global power it always aspired to be, partner to the US and China
only[. Being a nuclear power already, Russia will also have a
modernized, battle-hardened and reinforced conventional force, capable
of operating effectively under the Hybrid War concept.]{.underline}¶
[Russia will emerge stronger at the cost of the West. We will have
emboldened and enlarged an aggressive nation with great power ambitions.
Russian self-confidence will be a consequence of both strategic wins and
a restored and tested military power, as well as a perception of a West
in decline.]{.underline}

Russian imperial aggression, while the nations of Central Asia are
clearly at risk. It is also worth noting that Poland and Finland were
once part of the Russian Empire that Putin longs to
resurrect.]{.underline} ¶ For almost three decades, [Western leaders
have approached successive acts of Russian imperial aggression as
isolated incidents and have sought to downplay their significance while
focusing on the economic advantages of continuing to do business with
Moscow. This has only served to encourage the Kremlin]{.underline}. The

[Future of Former Soviet Republic]{.underline}¶ [Furthermore, the more
complete the Russian victory, the more it will enable Putin afterward to
impose direct control over all other former Soviet republics (except for
the NATO member Baltic countries), turn them into client states, and
reinstate some reshaped version of the Soviet empire, with Russia as its
core.]{.underline}¶ [It's highly unlikely that there will be much, if
any, resistance from the West to impede this process after Moscow's
supposed victory in Ukraine.]{.underline}¶ In general, the successful
conquest of Ukraine can [establish Russia and its newly acquired
satellites as a separate, distinctly anti-Western power block with a
radically conservative ideology]{.underline}, something Putin has
actively been championing since 2012.¶ Hence, the mid-term and even the
long-term [future of former Soviet republics depends]{.underline} not
only [on a possible Russian victory in Ukraine]{.underline} but [also on
how decisive that victory will be.]{.underline}

#### Additional ev: Putin and the people of Russia want to restore Soviet Union territories

**Chaisty 4/13** \[Paul Chaisty (A Professor of Russian and East
European Politics, University of Oxford), 4-13-2022, \"Putin\'s Russia:
people increasingly identify with the Soviet Union -- here\'s what that
means,\" Conversation,

// st

The view that the Russian president, Vladimir [Putin]{.underline},
[wants to restore territories of the Soviet Union]{.underline} has been
a big part of the commentary on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But how
much is he in tune with the wishes of the Russian people? Our research
suggests that while Russian citizens increasingly identify with the
USSR, this is only partially explained by their desire to expand
Russia's borders. [People's identification with the Soviet Union appears
to have a clear and growing basis in Russian public
opinion.]{.underline} Surveys we have conducted [throughout the Putin
period]{.underline} show that [Soviet identification among the general
population]{.underline} -- something that had been steadily declining
after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 -- [began to increase in
2014, when the Russian government annexed Crimea and supported
rebellions in the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. By 2021,
almost 50% of those surveyed identified with the Soviet Union rather
than the Russian Federation.]{.underline}¶ \[graph omitted\]¶ This
pattern was also evident among Putin's supporters. As the graph below
shows, after we have controlled for age and affluence -- two variables
that are strong predictors of identifying with the Soviet Union, with
older and less affluent people more inclined to identify with the USSR
-- the probability that Putin voters are likely to be Soviet rather than
Russian identifiers increases significantly after 2014.¶ \[graph
omitted\]¶ [But is this growth in Soviet identity motivated by support
for Putin's expansionist policies? In other words, did the annexation of
Crimea create a bedrock of expansionist support for the Kremlin's
military assault on Ukraine in 2022?]{.underline}¶ Hankering for the
past¶ [Identification with the Soviet past]{.underline} can derive from
many sources. These tend to include nostalgia for Soviet era economic
and welfare policies as well as a cultural nostalgia for a particular
Soviet "way of life" and traditional values. It can also manifest as a
desire for direct worker participation in politics, and a rejection of
"elitist" forms of representative liberal democracy. Finally -- and [in
line with the primary focus of our research -- identifying with the
Soviet Union may stem from hostility towards perceived western
interference and a desire to expand Russia's borders to include parts of
the former Soviet Union -- the so-called "near abroad".]{.underline}

### Geostrategy

#### Ukrainian defeat allows Russia to strengthen their land and air forces and grow their sphere of influence -- forces will target NATO and exploit its vulnerabilities

After Russia, Ukraine is the second biggest country in Europe. It is
603.628 km2 and is nearly as big as Germany and Poland combined. [A
Ukrainian defeat would, therefore, have grave geostrategic
consequences.]{.underline}¶ [The border between authoritarianism and
democracy will move roughly 900 km westward. The combined military power
of "Great Russia" and its sphere of interest will move
correspondingly.]{.underline}¶ The illegal annexation of Crimea has
already secured Russia's ability to project power towards the Middle
East, the Mediterranean, the Caucasus, and Europe.¶ Ukraine subjugated
to Kremlin will go a long way in establishing the Black Sea as a
"Russian lake." At the same time, this will effectively reduce future
threats to its sea control.¶ [The Russian military has become much more
capable since 2008 as a "result of substantial increases in expenditures
on military programs and forces, as well as a focus on readiness,
organization, fielding modernized weapons, and updating tactics and
doctrine." Russian warfighting in Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria has
supported the development.]{.underline}¶ According to RAND,¶ ["Russian
Ground Forces have local dominance along its European and Central Asian
borders. Of great concern to Russia's neighbors and to NATO are Russia's
enhanced capabilities to invade and hold territory in neighboring
countries on short notice... Key investments in lighter and more mobile
armor, ground-based missile, and long-range fire systems, and electronic
war and cyber capabilities have turned the Russian military into a
highly mobile unit in Europe capable of conducting "combined-arms
maneuvers at the formation level" that "pose serious challenges to US or
NATO units in a conventional conflict."]{.underline}¶ This must be seen
in the context of the change in the NATO force structure after the end
of the Cold War, resulting in a reduction in its inventory of main
battle tanks and artillery. Additionally, Russia has maintained its
sustainability, resilience, and strategic mobility while developing
supporting capabilities (e.g. ordnance, active and passive protection,
UAV, EW, and more).¶ [Achieving indirect control over the Ukrainian
Security and Defence sector, Russia could potentially gain control of
one of the biggest, most experienced, and battle-hardened Land Forces in
Europe.]{.underline}¶ It includes the modernized and partly reformed
Army, Marines, National Guard, and the Special Operating Forces.
Ultimately, its combined Security and Defence sector could increase by
as many as 510.000 men and women. The Armed Forces and National Guard of
Ukraine alone consist of 250.000 soldiers. In real terms, the Russian
gain would, however, probably be far less. More about that later.¶ The
8th, 58th, and 49th Combined Arms Army and 22nd Army Corps of the
Southern Military District of the Russian Forces would not only be
reinforced, but its area of responsibility would also border to Romania,
Moldova, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland.¶ [A Ukrainian defeat would also
allow Russia to redeploy its comprehensive Anti-Access/Area Denial
(A2/AD) capabilities 300-900 km westwards. This includes traditional
airpower, unmanned aerial vehicles, maritime capabilities, offensive and
defensive missile systems (such as the Iskander, Bastion, Kalibr, and
S-400), offensive electronic warfare, special operations forces, and
cyber capabilities.]{.underline}¶ [The A2/AD concept is aimed at both
limiting NATO's freedom of movement while exploiting NATO
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. In a time of conflict, the capability in
place could impact NATO's ability to deploy forces into and its ability
to operate in the area. Increasing the costs associated with bringing in
reinforcements to allies, it could potentially undermine the alliance's
political decision-making process.¶ [It would cover Bulgaria, Romania,
Slovak, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland. This would to an extent
both negate the NATO AirPower while ensuring Russian Land Forces freedom
of maneuver.]{.underline}¶ [The combination of a strengthened Land
Force, the westward deployment of both Land Forces and A2/AD capacities,
increased control of the Black Sea, permanent naval presence in the
Eastern Mediterranean, and forces based in Syria constitutes a
re-emergence of a military threat to NATOs southeastern
flank.]{.underline} A threat that disappeared with the collapse of the
Soviet Union.

### Psychological Warfare

#### A Russian victory results in psychological manipulation of the Ukrainian people -- influences their elections and collective mindset. This leads to the decimation of Ukrainian civil and political rights by the new pro-Russian government

[Consequently, the main threat is not military invasion and occupation,
but the accumulated psychological effect on both population and
leadership as a result of a long-term effort to destabilize Ukraine from
within. The ever-present threat has, however, shaped and will continue
to shape the collective mindset at all levels of the Ukrainian
society.]{.underline} The military threat will keep on generating
profound economic, political, and diplomatic insecurity in the years to
come, while little by little helping create the foundation for a future
Ukrainian defeat.¶ [Russia wants to re-establish political control over
Ukraine and thus reintegrate it into the "Russian world." For this to
happen, Ukraine's political landscape must change.]{.underline}¶ [Russia
has won -- and Ukraine and Europe have lost -- when Ukraine either
elects a pro-Russian government or a government who gives in to Russian
pressure. This will both ensure and legitimize Russian control over
Ukraine politics, and consequently, its choice of alliances.
Additionally, this will remove the basis for international sanctions and
create the basis for normalization between Russia and the
West.]{.underline}¶ [The outcome of a Hybrid War is a victory in the
cognitive space. Russia will have succeeded in influencing the Ukrainian
majority to elect what is, from a Russian perspective, the ideal
president and government.]{.underline}¶ Presently, it is, of course,
close to impossible to imagine Ukraine electing a pro-Russian president
and government, and equally difficult to envisage Ukraine accepting a
government crossing the red line. Any process of changing the country's
pro-European and Euro-Atlantic path would, however, be as gradual and
long-term as the Hybrid War itself. It would include the introduction of
the mindset, public support and legal framework needed to ensure an as
peaceful transition as possible.¶ The process would include the gradual
preparations for what is bound to follow a political and diplomatic
U-turn; namely civil protests, demonstrations and ultimately another
Euromaidan.¶ This would probably include transfer of control of the
National Guard to the president and several constitutional changes to
increase the power of internal forces to deny an[d dissolve illegal
gatherings, political rallies, and demonstrations; increase control over
media and social networks, infringement of basic civil and political
rights such as privacy and the freedom of thought, speech, religion,
press, assembly, and movement, the right to a fair trial and due
process, and more.]{.underline}¶ [Any president or government giving in
to Russian pressure would need to gradually copy the Russian legislation
to be both able to remain in power and ensure a level of stability.
Ukraine would slowly need to turn into an autocracy, where all power is
gathered by a political elite under Russian influence, without any
constitutional or institutional restrictions. Key leadership positions
would be replaced by people who are considered loyal to a new president
and government.]{.underline}¶

### AT: NATO beats Russia

#### Russia is willing to do whatever it takes, and they will beat NATO in a war

// st

[Research published]{.underline} in 2019 [by the Royal United Services
Institute]{.underline} (RUSI) found that, assuming annihilation in a
nuclear conflict was avoided, British forces would be "comprehensively
outgunned" in a conflict with Russia in eastern Europe.¶ The RUSI found
that the British Army and its [Nato]{.underline} allies [had a "critical
shortage" of artillery and ammunition that would leave them struggling
to maintain a credible defence position if Russia were to opt for
all-out aggression.]{.underline}¶ "At present, there is a risk that the
UK -- unable to credibly fight -- can be dominated lower down the
escalation ladder by powers threatening escalation," said RUSI's
report.¶ Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) head Professor Michael
Clarke told Sky News last week that current British and [Nato rocket
launch systems were developed enough for combat, but that the allies
would "need much more" to hold off Russian forces with a long-range
attack.]{.underline} ¶ But the UK wouldn't need to stand alone against
Russia. And Nato's biggest player, the US, has an overwhelming advantage
over Russia in conventional forces.¶ However, Russian military analyst
Felgenhauer told Deutsche Welle that [open warfare often comes down to
far more than the inventories that each side of the conflict can call
upon.]{.underline} ¶ "It's like predicting the result of a soccer match:
yes, basically, Brazil should beat America in soccer, but I have seen
Americans beat Brazil in South Africa, at the Confederations Cup," said
Felgenhauer. "You never know the result until the game is played."¶
Retired Air Vice Marshal Sean Bell told Sky News that another
consideration was that [Russia is not fighting by international rules of
war. The Kremlin will do whatever it takes to win, without being bogged
down by politics or the media, he argued.]{.underline}¶ ["They\'re not
constantly looking over their shoulders about, \'Oh, if we hit a
civilian, if we hit a building...\'" said Bell. "They just get on with
it."]{.underline}
