Realism: Partial, Yet Powerful

In light of the partial nature of the rational realist theory, one might
wonder whether the rational theory is fully useful on its own and why
realist theories continue to have so much influence within IR. In fact,
[the rational realist theory exists ~~stands~~ well on its own for a
variety of reasons]{.underline}.

First, and most important in this context, [the **inputs**]{.underline}
to the rational theory [are]{.underline} often [known sufficiently well
that effective analysis is possible without a more complete
theory]{.underline}. [[Values of the]{.mark} independent [variables
are]{.mark}]{.underline} often **[[knowable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
known, **[without a theory that fully explains them]{.underline}**. For
example, [[we can measure]{.mark} a state's [power **without a full
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the state [that explains its productive
potential and its ability to extract resources]{.underline} for national
purposes. [At the very least, basic material traits can be used to
estimate power, with a well-established literature]{.underline} on that
subject in place. Similarly, [[we can]{.mark} often [be **confident**
of]{.mark} the [**causal logics** a state will employ]{.mark} to
evaluate the impact of available strategies **[without]{.mark}** having
[theories]{.mark} [that explain]{.mark} the [origins of]{.mark} the
[ideas]{.mark} and why one set of arguments was adopted instead of
others]{.underline}. In other words, [[a theory of]{.mark} the
**[inputs]{.mark}** to the rational theory [is **not required**]{.mark}
to [for]{.mark} the rational theory to support **[productive
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Second, [[the]{.mark} rationalist [theory is **well
matched**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to analyzing]{.underline}]{.mark} many
of the **[[key questions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the field of IR is
most interested in. These include such questions as: [[What factors
influence]{.mark} the **probability of [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} and,
closely related, when is war more or less likely? [[Are
cooperative]{.mark} or competitive [strategies best]{.mark} matched to
achieving]{.underline} a state's [security, economic, and other
goals?]{.underline} [[When]{.mark} and why [do states form
alliances]{.mark}, [engage in **arms races**]{.mark}, make **territorial
concessions**]{.underline}, [[and **join**]{.mark} **international
[institutions?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Are states able to communicate
information about their motives and intentions, and under what
conditions is this possible?]{.underline} My point here is not that
rational realist theories are the only theories capable of shedding
light on these questions, as this would clearly undervalue other
approaches. But [[the]{.mark} **[extensive]{.mark} [realist
lit]{.mark}erature** that [has]{.mark} **productively [tackled]{.mark}**
[these questions]{.mark}, and many other related questions, [should
**leave little doubt** about]{.mark} the **[analytic value]{.mark} of
the theories**]{.underline}. [This should not be a surprise, because the
rationalist approach captures much of what is central to understanding
the issues that drive these questions]{.underline}. And, of course,
[this is **not an accident**]{.underline}. Quite the opposite; [this is
why many analysts have chosen this approach to explore these
questions]{.underline}.

Third, and closely related to the preceding discussion, [[the
**importance**]{.mark} **of these questions** [to **real-world
debates**]{.mark} and states' most important security and foreign policy
choices virtually [**guarantees** that **realist analyses** will]{.mark}
continue to [have a **prominent role**]{.mark} within IR]{.underline}.
More specifically, [[theories of]{.mark} foreign and **[security
policy]{.mark}** that are [built on]{.mark} rational [**realist
foundations** focus]{.mark} on the **[strategies]{.mark} that [states
can choose]{.mark}** from---including investing in economic growth,
allying, arming, bargaining, fighting, etc.---[and]{.mark} therefore
[have]{.mark} [**great potential** to **contribute to**]{.mark} **policy
[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Competition

Origins of the Competition

Given the extensive complementarity between the [constructivist and
realist theories]{.underline}, [why have these]{.underline} approaches
[been cast as competitors in IR theory?]{.underline} Many factors have
contributed. Part of the answer undoubtedly lies in the professional
inclination within IR theory to generate new arguments that can replace
those that preceded them. Some of the answer may lie in [the dominance
of realist theory]{.underline} during the Cold War and arguably since
then, which has **[made it a target]{.underline}** for all other types
of explanations. Part of the answer may lie in an underappreciation of
realism, especially structural realism, as a partial theory, which meant
that complementarity was not possible.

In addition to these more generic reasons, some of the competition
likely reflects the order in which certain key arguments have been
established, which in turn left them vulnerable to critiques from
alternative approaches. Specifically, [Waltz's seminal statement of
structural realism made]{.underline} two [arguments that were flawed or
overstated]{.underline}, which left structural realism overly
vulnerable: [first, the theory was formulated and characterized as a
purely material theory; and second, Waltz's central conclusion was that
the anarchic nature of the international system generated a strong
tendency toward competition, rendering cooperation both rare and
limited]{.underline}.14 As my sketch of structural realism explains,
neither of these claims was sustainable, and [**[strands of
realism]{.mark}** have been developed that **[correct these
shortcomings]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Waltz's formulation therefore left the door open for constructivists (as
well as realists and others) to offer as competitors the ideational
arguments and the cooperation-under-anarchy arguments that were missing.
Wendt's structural constructivism, which takes Waltz's structural
realism as its central point of departure, develops many of these
opposing arguments from a constructivist perspective.15 [If the rational
realist theory had been more fully developed and appreciated before
Wendt tackled these arguments, the debate might have proceeded rather
differently]{.underline}. Instead of arguing that structural
constructivism could explain and predict interaction and cooperation
that were beyond the reach of Waltz's realism, [Wendt would have had to
argue that his approach produced similar results from an alternative
perspective]{.underline}. [Instead, the approaches ended up]{.underline}
at least partly [**talking past each other** and appearing to clash even
more than they actually do]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline},
however, [some **real competition**]{.underline} [between the rational
realist theory and]{.underline} Wendt's [structural constructivist
theory]{.underline}.

Substance of the Competition

To appreciate how both competition and complementarity between realism
and constructivism are possible, it is useful to distinguish different
types of constructivism. Some constructivist work has focused on states
and individuals, exploring the sources of beliefs, identifies, and
norms. Other constructivist research has focused on the international
system, exploring how structure influences states' choices; Wendt's is
the defining work in the structural constructivist field.16 The
complementary nature of constructivist arguments that focus on states
and individuals is clear; as explained above, these theories explain
inputs to the rational theory. In contrast, structural constructivism
emphasizes the role of the international system on states' actions and,
therefore, runs largely parallel to structural realism, even though it
defines the international system differently. This similarity and,
closely related, the similarity in the questions the two approaches set
out to answer makes them competitors.

Wendt argues that the key to understanding the possibility of multiple
"logics" of anarchy is "conceptualizing structure in social rather than
material terms." The sole variable in Waltz's international structure is
the distribution of capabilities. Consequently, Waltz's theory is
characterized as purely material.17 Waltz concludes that international
anarchy requires states to pursue competitive policies; in Wendt's
terminology, this means that Waltz finds that anarchy has a single
logic. Wendt argues instead that anarchy can take three principal forms,
which vary in their tendencies to generate competition and cooperation.
He defines the different anarchies in terms of the states' roles,
specifically their orientation toward each other---enemy, rival, and
friend---which reflect the rules that states expect others to observe.
Working with these structural roles, [Wendt explains how cooperation and
even deep peace are possible within international anarchy]{.underline}.
Enemies generate a Hobbesian anarchy that is highly competitive;
although similar in some ways to the anarchy explained by Waltz's
neorealism, the Hobbesian anarchy is more competitive and states are
more insecure. Rivals generate a Lockean anarchy that is less
competitive and that, Wendt argues, is in certain respects closer to
Waltz's anarchy. Friends are concerned not only about their own
security, but also other states' security, and their interaction
generates a Kantian anarchy in which states do not fear that others will
use force against them and in which confidence in a long-lasting peace
is possible.18

Wendt's effort to explore the possibility that international anarchy can
produce a much wider range of outcomes than is suggested by Waltz is a
productive move. Whether extensive security cooperation is possible
under anarchy is the central question posed by structural IR theories.
Moreover, a variety of historical examples that run counter to Waltz's
claim about the persistent presence of competition---including restraint
and cooperation between powerful states, and substantial military
capabilities that do not generate substantial insecurity---indicate the
need for a more encompassing theory. [Wendt's [focus on **social
variables**]{.mark}, however, **[masks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the
potential of]{.mark} **structural [realist]{.mark} and rational
[theories]{.mark}** [to explain variation in]{.mark} states' [policies
under anarchy and]{.mark}]{.underline} thereby **[[incorrectly
suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that **realist theories** are
incapable of explaining]{.mark} broad and basic [variation]{.mark} in
states' strategies in the face of anarchy]{.underline}. In fact, Wendt
is explicit on this critical issue:

The real question is whether the fact of anarchy creates a tendency for
all such interactions to realize a single logic at the macro-level. In
the Neorealist view they do: anarchies are inherently self-help systems
that tend to produce military competition, balances of power, and war.
Against this I argue that anarchy can have at least three kinds of
structure at the macro-level, based on what kind of roles---enemy,
rival, and friend---dominate the system.19

[To appreciate why **structural [realism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[can
**explain** and **predict**]{.mark} **[coop]{.mark}**eration but that
this possibility is overlooked by Waltz, we need to return to his core
argument]{.underline}. It turns out that the logic of [Waltz's arguments
requires]{.underline} the [introduction of another variable: a state's
information about the **opposing state's motives**]{.underline}. Waltz
holds that although states may have motives beyond security, their
international behavior can be understood largely by assuming that they
are seeking only security. If[,]{.underline} however, [all states knew
that all the other states were security seeker]{.underline}s (and if all
states knew that this is what the others knew), [then the international
system should not generate competition]{.underline}. This
**[[uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[about the]{.mark} [**opposing
state's type** lies at **the core of the security dilemma**]{.mark},
and]{.underline}, closely related, [the security dilemma lies at the
center of structural realism's ability to explain
competition]{.underline}.20 If states did not face a security dilemma,
security seekers could always achieve their core objective while
adopting policies that avoided generating competition. [Once the
importance of uncertainty about motives is made explicit, including it
as a variable is the natural next step for the rational
theory.]{.underline}

A key point for our discussion here is that [structural
[realism]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at the least the more general rational
theory that logically flows from it, [[is **no longer a purely material
theory**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This matters because it means that
[distinguishing realist and constructivist theories in]{.mark} terms of
[material versus ideational arguments]{.mark}---a broad category that is
typically understood to include information, norms, and causal
ideas---**[no longer creates a sharp divide]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The implications reach beyond mere characterizations and definitions,
however. [[Including]{.mark} **[info]{.mark}rmation [about
motives]{.mark}** as a key variable in a rational realist theory
**[opens the door to]{.mark} arguments** that address much of the
terrain also covered by]{.underline} Wendt's [structural
[constructivism]{.mark}]{.underline}. More specifically, [the rational
realist theory]{.underline} (1) [explores the nature of interactions
that]{.underline} can [enable states to revise]{.underline} their
[assessments of the opposing state's type and]{.underline} thereby
[generate more cooperative or]{.underline} more [competitive policies,
providing a **more straightforward explanation**]{.underline} than
Wendt's changes in interests, (2) [explains international
**[coop]{.mark}**eration [under anarchy as a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[result]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}** [in
combination [with]{.mark} [**material factors** instead of]{.mark}
Wendt's focus on **[identities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and (3) shows
that [Wendt]{.underline} has [both **exaggerated** and
**underestimated**]{.underline} [the potential for international
cooperation, the former by underplaying the role of material factors in
constraining states' choices and the latter by relying on states'
collective interests instead of pure security seeking, which is more
neutral regarding cooperation]{.underline}. The remainder of this
section sketches these points.21

First, the realist theory provides an alternative explanation of how
states' interactions can influence their relationship and, in turn,
their behavior. Wendt argues that interaction between states is the key
to their understandings of self and other, and that interactions play a
central role in determining whether the international system is
competitive or cooperative. He holds that interaction cannot play this
important role in realist theories, because "realists would probably
argue that each should act on the basis of worst-case assumptions about
the other's intentions, justifying such an attitude as prudent in view
of the possibility of death from making a mistake."22 This is a
reasonable reading of Waltz; since he barely touches on a possible role
for information about the opposing side, assuming the worst can be seen
as implicitly running through his formulation. Offensive realism makes
fully explicit the requirement for states to assume the worst about
opposing states.23 Contrary to this position, however, rational states
should not assume the worst when facing uncertainty about their
adversary's motives and intentions. Instead, at least from a standard
expected utility perspective, a state should consider the probability
that the opposing state is a revisionist/greedy type as opposed to
status quo/security type. The state should also consider the danger if
the opposing state is a greedy type; many types of cooperation would not
put the state at great risk, that is, death is not always, or even
usually, the cost of misjudging the adversary's motives. These arguments
lie at the core of the rationalist realist theory that includes
information as a key variable defining a state's international
environment, which in turn enables the theory to fully integrate the
security dilemma into its arguments.

Given this realist formulation, states' interactions can influence their
understanding (their information) of the opposing state's motives. When
a state takes an action that would be more likely to be taken by a
security-seeking state than by a greedy state, the opposing state should
positively update its prior estimate of the probability that the state
has security motives. [Because states have an **incentive to mislead
adversaries**]{.underline}, [the opposing state should only find useful
information]{.underline} when the state's action is costly, that is,
[when the state's action is a **"costly signal."**]{.underline} [This
occurs when a specific cooperative action would be more costly for a
greedy state than for a security-seeking state]{.underline}. Wendt
describes a similar process of interaction but emphasizes different
changes and relies on different types of arguments--- symbolic
interactionism---not rational updating made possible by costly signals.
His arguments describe how states' interactions can change their
interests and identities, which in turn support cooperation in anarchy.
The rationalist explanation has the advantage of greater simplicity---it
holds interests constant, does not involve the creation of social
structures, and does not require changes in interests---while appearing
to explain essentially the same international phenomenon.

Second, the rational realist theory explains that anarchy can generate a
variety of outcomes---including various degrees of competition,
cooperation, and mixtures of the two---that have much in common with
Wendt's three anarchies. According to the rational theory, whether a
securityseeking state should choose cooperation over competition depends
on both material variables, which include the state's power and
offensedefense variables, and information variables, which capture what
a state knows about its adversary's motives.24 Material variables
largely determine the military capabilities a state can acquire, given
the opposing state's ability to build military forces of its own. They
determine the types of military missions that states will be able to
perform and their relative prospects for performing them successfully.

Information variables influence a state's expectations about its
adversary's behavior, including reactions to the state's own policies.
The theory explains that when defense has the advantage---that is, when
holding territory or maintaining the capabilities required for
deterrence are relatively easy---states can achieve high levels of
security without engaging in intense competition. When offense and
defense are distinguishable---that is, when the forces that support
offensive missions would contribute less (or more) to defensive
missions---states may be able to choose forces and strategies that
signal benign motives and to use arms control to increase the
feasibility of defensive force postures. Information variables also
influence the prospects for cooperation. A state that believes the
opposing state is likely to be a security seeker should be more willing
to run the risks of restraint and cooperation. These strategies have the
potential to generate positive political spirals, which can in turn make
states willing to choose military strategies that pose smaller risks to
others' security.

In short, [the **rationalist theory** describes the conditions under
which anarchy can produce cooperative international security policies
and relatively peaceful international politics]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} both [corrects Waltz's conclusion about the general
tendency for anarchy to generate competition and shows that Wendt's
social structure is unnecessary to produce this result]{.underline}.
Again, [the rationalist theory has the advantage of being **more
straightforward**, **less complex**, and **more
parsimonious**]{.underline} than Wendt's constructivist alternative.

Third, and related, the rationalist theory shows that Wendt is both too
pessimistic and too optimistic, in different ways, about the prospects
for cooperation under anarchy. On the pessimistic side, the rationalist
theory shows that cooperation is possible without introducing "friends,"
that is, states that have collective identities in which they value each
other's security as well as their own. According to the rational realist
argument, the states' international situation is doing most of the work;
nonfriends---security seekers that do not value others' security---have
fundamental preferences that are relatively neutral between cooperation
and competition. In contrast, collective identities and altruistic
preferences play a central role in the constructivist argument, and it
views them as necessary for deep cooperation. [My point here is not that
considering the impact of collective identities is analytically flawed,
but that relying on collective identities to make extensive cooperation
possible is a significantly weaker finding regarding the potential of
anarchy to allow and support cooperation]{.underline}. If, as seems
likely, [[**pure security seekers** are **much more common than
friends**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then Wendt is pessimistic about
cooperation under anarchy, in that he finds the possibility of
cooperation existing under narrower, less common conditions.

At the same time, however, [[Wendt is **overly optimistic**
about]{.mark} the [prospects for **coop**]{.mark}eration because [he
fails to adequately incorporate]{.mark} the [constraints that]{.mark}
**[info]{.mark}**rmation [and]{.mark} **[material factors]{.mark}** can
[impose on]{.mark} states' [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[A
**strength** of the]{.mark} **rational [realist theory]{.mark}** is that
[it]{.mark} **explicitly [explains]{.mark}** [how]{.mark} [both]{.mark}
material [variables]{.mark} and information variables [influence]{.mark}
the [prospects for]{.mark} **[coop]{.mark}**eration, and how they
interact]{.underline}. In contrast, [Wendt's social theory **does not**
bring in material factors and]{.underline} thereby **[implicitly
ignores]{.underline}** the [**constraints** they]{.underline} could
[impose]{.underline}. Wendt is partially correct in arguing that
"History matters[. Security dilemmas are not acts of God; they are
effects of practice]{.underline}."25 [[States]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [**[do not get to choose]{.mark} their [history]{.mark}** [at
the time they are making]{.mark} forward-looking
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, in the past they did have
partial control over it via the policy choices they made, although these
were constrained by information and material factors. At the time of a
new choice, however, [the past and its related history are fixed
and]{.underline} thereby [impose severe constraints on states'
practice/choices]{.underline}. [Their interactions may start under
information conditions that prevent them from overcoming material
conditions that make cooperative policies too risky]{.underline}.
Moreover, these information conditions could reflect previous material
conditions that required the security-seeking state to compete, thereby
signaling greedy motives, which contributed to the initial information
from which the states begin this round of interaction. Consequently,
[although certainty or near certainty that the opposing state is a
security seeker could be sufficient to eliminate the security dilemma
under even very dangerous material conditions, states will not always
have this information]{.underline}. Moreover, [a state can face material
conditions]{.underline}---for example, **[offense
dominance]{.underline}**---[that make cooperation **too
risky**]{.underline}, even when the state believes that adversary is
probably a security-seeking state. In short, [[states]{.mark} can
[**face constraints** that **require** them to choose **competitive
policies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} can **[make the
security dilemma]{.mark} still more [severe]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} **[coop]{.mark}**eration [a]{.mark} **still [worse
option]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### 1AR -- Realism Good

#### Realism is politically useful even if its not theoretically perfect\-\--their reductionism results in ahistoricity that triggers worse violence

**Abraham 17** (Kavi Joseph, Johns Hopkins University. "Making Machines:
Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial Thought,"
https://academic.oup.com/ips/article-abstract/11/3/221/3798787)

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that [those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to [**deem realism**, in all its
**complex**]{.mark} and **contradictory
[manifestations]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} as [a **failed**,
**unethical**,]{.mark} and **[fundamentally racist/imperial
project]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A second response is to
politically align against liberalism, while holding this partnership at
arm's length. [A third response]{.underline}, derived from Ayoob's
(2002) subaltern realism, [is to work on an **epistemic register**,
**selectively taking insights** from realist traditions that help better
explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this [[failing **does not
delegitimize**]{.mark} **other [realist insights]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
What is important for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to
combine plausible realist insights with other categories that can grasp
the extent of global politics, including the dynamics of the
postcolonial experience, better.

The final response is the one I advance. To adopt a mode of
argumentation concerned with building a counter-imperial machine is to
neither dismiss constituencies that become caught up in imperial
formations, nor merely to tactically align with them; rather,
establishing resonant connections among postcolonial and realist lines
of thought, highlighting shared dispositions to difference, is to push
the latter toward repositioning itself on new ethical lines that limit
contemporary forms of violence. To recover a minor position in realism
is not to accept all realist positions, nor is it to synthesize or
convert any theoretical line into a coherent framework. It is, however,
to amplify the shared spirituality that informs both realist and
postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies toward prudential rather
than imperial defenses of difference. It is to furnish current research
agendas with an anti-imperial focus, to seek the creative possibilities
that may arise when divergent constituencies meet, interfuse, and shift.
Thus, our response to Morgenthau, as to other realists, is to cultivate
the connections that do exist, not for epistemic reasons but for a
political project that strengthens counter-imperial movements.

Thinking from the Present

By way of conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that
motivates a theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial
thinking. If the ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of
liberalism and its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a
return to classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and
above postcolonial approaches. However, the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a counter-imperial machine, to cultivate a shared
spirituality that can gather diverse and divergent constituencies to
confront dangerous practices. In my estimation, countering an imperial
machine that operates in complex ways and at complex sites requires a
political strategy as unwieldy and diffuse, linking constituencies that
we may otherwise dismiss. [[That]{.mark} a tradition of [realism]{.mark}
**regularly [circulates through halls of power]{.mark}** across the
globe **[should be reason not to reject]{.mark} righteously**
[but]{.mark} rather [to **leverage its authorized status**. We can talk
about]{.mark} **[imperialism]{.mark}**, **knowledge production**, and
**race** here, [while they can talk about **anarchy**]{.mark},
**power**, [and **self-interest**]{.mark} there---or we can
theoretically work on the lines of thought that **reverberate among
us**]{.underline}. To reiterate, building a countermachine is not driven
to "pragmatic" reconciliation or consensus and, thus, remains distinct
from the "eclecticism" of other plural approaches popular in IR today.
While the combinatory logic of paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the
connections between realist and postcolonial thought articulated here
are made in a far more agonistic manner. Rather than produce something
like a "postcolonial-realism," [this]{.underline} argument [involves
pushing contemporary realist scholarship toward **new research agendas**
and **new forms of critique**]{.underline} that both capture a spirit
internal to its own traditions while confronting the realities of
contemporary global politics. It engages with minor positions along the
realist canon to orient today's realism away from the logic of great
power politics operating under anarchy toward an understanding of how
the logic of liberal order permits forms of imperial intervention.

Needless to say, [drawing together realist and postcolonial
thought]{.underline}, as this essay has done, [can be met with
**analytical skepticism** and **political hostility**. [A mode]{.mark}
of argumentation [that **refuses comparisons**]{.mark} of theoretical
cores or non-truncated readings of select theorists [strikes a note of
**analytical evasion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To this there is no
defense---other than that already discussed at length. On the other
hand, if the expressly political purpose of this work is accepted, the
argument anticipates strong political reservations: why align the
project of postcolonial theory with realism, an unethical tradition of
militarism and realpolitik? To this I would respond that while a kind of
strategic essentialism has its place, [[**reducing** "realists"]{.mark}
to a coherent body of thought [not only **obscures**]{.mark} **the
[complexity]{.mark}** of their thinking]{.underline} (see never-ending
interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) [[but **reproduces the
narrative** ]{.mark}**of transhistorical unity** [that some]{.mark}
realists [use to **authorize unethical**]{.mark} **policy
[programs]{.mark}** in the first place]{.underline}. More critically,
however, [in embodying an **[unproductive ahistoricism]{.mark}**, it
[poses]{.mark} conventional [realist categories of **anarchy**,
**selfinterest**]{.mark}, and **military power** [as the]{.mark}
political **[problem to confront]{.mark}** whereas [the present]{.mark}
historical [context **demands attunement** to how]{.mark} some of [these
drives]{.mark}]{.underline} (militarism, national interest) [**[connect
with discrete problems]{.mark}** of liberalism and imperial
practices]{.underline}. In fact, there are good reasons to think that
the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated (Walker and Morton
2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of liberal IR theory
is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of a US liberal
world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while realism may
have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must theorize
from the present. In doing so, we may find that [[countering imperial
formations **may benefit from** ]{.mark}resonances established not just
among postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and other "critical"
theorists but contemporary [realists who identify links between]{.mark}
**[liberalism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Walt 2013). Indeed, [[if
realism]{.mark} as a policy program defending the national interest [is
**entangled with**]{.mark} **current militaristic** and imperial
[**interventions**, we should **push the premise**]{.mark} of this
statement, [that **difference should be defended**, in
**anti-imperial**]{.mark} and **prudential
[directions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Doing so may allow new openings to
emerge in the present sense of closure, new strategies to think and
defend alternative politics. In this way, we may more fully embody
postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow critique or
brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

### 2AC -- War First

#### Case turns the K -- War is qualitatively different then everyday life - The affs pragmatic approach to security is compatible and necessary to accomplish feminism goals in IR

**Peach 4** (Lucinda Joy, Professor in the Department of Philosophy and
Religion at American University, 2004, "A Pragmatist Feminist Approach
to the Ethics of Weapons of Mass Destruction," in Ethics and Weapons of
Mass Destruction: Religious and Secular Perspectives, ed. Hashmi, p.
436-441)

[The pragmatist feminist perspective]{.underline} that I develop in this
chapter is deeply indebted to and [affirms in many respects the antiwar
feminist approach]{.underline} outlined [by]{.underline} Carol **[Cohn
and]{.underline}** Sara **[Ruddick]{.underline}** in the preceding
chapter, [but with **some marked differences**. These
differences]{.underline}, I argue, [reveal]{.underline} more completely
both the promise and [**the limitations** of antiwar
feminism]{.underline}.

At the outset, it is important to note that there is neither a single
\"feminism\" nor a single \"pragmatism\" with which it might be aligned.
Instead, there are multiple feminisms, just as there are multiple
pragmatisms. [The \"pragmatist feminism\" developed in this essay draws
on several elements from American Pragmatism]{.underline}, a
philosophical school developed in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, most prominently by Charles Peirce, William James,
John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead.

Despite the many differences among the pragmatists, [they]{.underline}
tend to [share several features]{.underline}. Perhaps [most
salient]{.underline} to the subject of this volume [is their
presumption]{.underline} [\"that human agency]{.underline} in all of its
higher manifestations [has evolved from \... concrete circumstances in
which a vulnerable organism is confronted]{.underline}, often (if not
usually) in concert with other organisms of the same species, [with
possibilities of both injury and fulfillment]{.underline}.\"\' It is
[the continuous reminder of \"human fallibility and
finitude]{.underline}\"\' that **[constrains pragmatists]{.underline}**
from positions such as foundationalism and dogmatism and thus
[**against** ideologies that encourage the use of armed
force]{.underline}, and especially of WMD, [in all but the most extreme
circumstances. It is also a reminder that armed conflicts are composed
of embodied human beings]{.underline}, **[each of whom has the capacity
for suffering]{.underline}** as well as happiness, a point stressed by
feminist analyses of armed conflicts.

There are several significant points of commonality or intersection
between pragmatism and feminism.3 Perhaps most important for thinking
about the ethics of weapons of mass destruction is that both are
actively engaged in attempting to solve social problems. The early
pragmatists viewed the purpose of philosophical reflection to be \"the
intelligent overcoming of oppressive conditions.\" Dewey, for example,
recommended the criticism of beliefs underlying society that have led to
\"unsatisfactory conditions in order to radically reconstruct our
society according to non-oppressive and cooperative standards.\"5

[[Feminist goals of liberating women from
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[echo pragmatist
ones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While most often feminist movements have
been focused specifically on ending the male domination and oppression
of women, [a more inclusive feminist vision has as its object the
elimination of all hierarchical and oppressive
relationships]{.underline}, including the oppression of so-called third
world or developing nations (especially of the Global South) by those of
the so-called first world or industrialized nations (especially of the
Global North), of ethnic, cultural, racial, or religious minorities by
majorities, homosexuals by heterosexuals, the poor by the wealthy,
children by adults, and so on.

In addition, [pragmatists advocate the elimination of sharp divisions
between theory and practice, reason and experience, and knowing and
doing]{.underline}.8 [[Pragmatists **focus**]{.mark} **much [more on
consequences]{.mark}** rather [than]{.mark} on [a priori]{.mark}
abstract [conceptualizing]{.mark}]{.underline}, captured in the phrase
that pragmatists assign value on the basis of \"what works\" or what
provides \"emotional satisfaction.\"9 From a pragmatist perspective, the
most important questions are practical ones.

[[Pragmatists consider moral agents]{.mark} to be **actors [within a
concrete]{.mark} particular [context]{.mark}** that both influences what
is experienced and is influenced by those experiences]{.underline}. The
inextricability of the perceiver from what is perceived means that
[**action**, whether in the context of armed conflict and the use of WMD
or otherwise,]{.underline} [**must be situated within the larger
context** of which it is a part]{.underline}. [Since every decision to
enter or engage in an armed conflict]{.underline} and every decision to
deploy WMD, of whatever type, [must be considered within the full
context of **other relevant actors, agencies, and term strategies or
results**]{.underline},12 [[a pragmatist perspective is **unlikely** to
result in the]{.mark} kind of [abstract thinking that antiwar feminism
criticizes in dominant]{.mark} just war and [realist
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}.13

Feminism also shares pragmatism\'s rejection of traditional rationalist
and empiricist approaches and its commitment to the inseparability of
theory and practice.14 Both believe that reason must be grounded in
experience and requires being supplemented, at least in particular
circumstances, by emotion.15 In this respect, feminists also favor a
posteriori rather than a priori forms of knowledge, those that develop
on the basis of experience rather than those that are posited prior to
it.16

In sum, [both pragmatism and feminism accord a central place to the
particular, the concrete, and the factual elements of experience, as
opposed to the universal, the generalizable, and the
abstract]{.underline}.17 This opposition to abstraction is apparent, for
example, in feminist understandings of women\'s \"different voice\" and
Dewey\'s views about the importance of the qualitative background of
situations. In contrast to mainstream philosophy, both feminist and
pragmatist perspectives focus on everyday life and emphasize respect for
others and the constitutiveness of community. [The pragmatists\'
sensitivity to the social embeddedness of persons led them to understand
the \"I\" \"only in relation to other selves, so that the autonomy of
individual agents needed to be integrated with their status as social
beings\" existing in community]{.underline}. 18

[This common conception of the \"relational self\" suggests that both
pragmatists and feminists will resist turning others into \"the Other,\"
who can then be demonized and made into \"the enemy,\" suitable to be
killed]{.underline}. [The feminist commitment to the well-being of
others, in both the local and the global community, is]{.underline} well
[illustrated by]{.underline} Carol [Cohn\'s and]{.underline} Sara
[Ruddick\'s contribution]{.underline} to this volume. However, [this
commitment also provides the basis for [the pragmatist feminist]{.mark}
position articulated here that **[refuses to categorically rule
out]{.mark} the moral legitimacy of [any]{.mark} resort to armed
[force]{.mark} or war**, since [such resort may be **morally imperative
to protect innocent others**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In addition to these marked similarities, it is also important to
acknowledge how a pragmatist feminism differs significantly from
American Pragmatism. Perhaps most important is pragmatist feminism\'s
attention to the gendered character of the social world and gender\'s
impact on the formation and maintenance of male and female identities.
These subjects largely were ignored by the American Pragmatists19 but
influence the analysis of the ethics of WMD outlined here. In addition,
feminists tend to give greater import to the cognitive aspects of affect
than pragmatists, even though, as already discussed, pragmatists
recognize the importance of emotions to agency and cognition.

Despite its differences from more mainstream strands of feminism,
[[pragmatist feminism shares the goals]{.mark} of many strands of
feminism [to **make gender a central consideration**]{.mark} **of the
analysis**]{.underline} (here of armed force and WMD)20 [[and]{.mark} to
[eradicate (patriarchal) oppression]{.mark} and domination]{.underline}.
[[These goals result in]{.mark} a **[strong presumption against]{.mark}
the [use of]{.mark} any [weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not only WMD,
[since they are in their very inception designed as tools for domination
and suppression of others designated as \"the enemy]{.underline}.\"
[[This]{.mark} opposition to the use of armed force [is related to
feminist observations of the patriarchal]{.mark} and hierarchical,
[male-dominated]{.mark} and -controlled [character of the military and
the oppressive effects of war and militarism]{.mark}]{.underline} around
the world, [especially on women]{.underline} and children. In addition,
the pragmatist feminist view described here affirms much in the
\"constitutive positions\" of antiwar feminism articulated by Cohn and
Ruddick,21 especially its observation of the gendered character of war
and militarism, its suspicion of masculinist approaches to war and
conflict resolution, and its critique of the dominant tradition for its
focus on the physical, military, and strategic effects of these weapons
separate from their embeddedness in the rest of social and political
life.

With this brief overview in mind, in the following section, I describe
how a pragmatist feminist perspective compares with the antiwar feminist
position outlined by Cohn and Ruddick in Chapter 21 with respect to the
specific issues addressed by this volume.

SOURCES AND PRINCIPLES

Although pragmatist feminism itself does not directly provide general
norms governing the use of weapons in war, it does so indirectly through
its affirmation of elements of justwar theory, as described below.
[Pragmatist feminism **does not categorically rule out the use of armed
force** or engagement in war]{.underline}. [Its pragmatist perspective
steers in a different direction from the antiwar feminists\'
\"practical\" opposition to war]{.underline}. Whereas the realist
tradition has been unduly pessimistic in its assumption that war and
armed conflict are necessary, certain, and inevitable, on a pragmatist
feminist view, [[antiwar feminist thinking tends to be]{.underline}
[**unduly optimistic** about the]{.underline}]{.mark} [human [capacity
to transcend]{.mark} the use of [violent methods]{.mark} of resolving
disputes]{.underline}, given the consistent and continual resort to such
means throughout most of human history.

[From a pragmatist feminist perspective]{.underline}, the
[[historical]{.mark} and contemporary [experience of]{.mark} the
[repeated resort to violence and]{.mark} the [inability]{.mark} of
humanity]{.underline} thus far [[to develop alternative
mechanisms]{.mark} for resolving large-scale disputes [suggests the
likelihood of future]{.mark}]{.underline} wars and [[armed
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}. In light of this history,
[**[overcoming]{.mark} the \"[war culture]{.mark}**\" that antiwar
feminists view so unfavorably [can be possible **only outside the
immediate situation of armed conflict**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Once the aggressor has struck]{.mark} or threatens to do so
imminently]{.underline}, **[[it is too late to change our societies and
ourselves]{.mark} in order [to avoid war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rather,
[[it is]{.mark} then [necessary to act]{.mark} in order [to **avoid
annihilation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in one form or another.

Given its view that some wars and some opposition to war and armed
conflicts are morally necessary to protect ourselves and others from
harm, pragmatist feminists seek to impose moral limits on the harm and
suffering to the minimum necessary. Despite an awareness of its
limitations,22 a pragmatist feminist perspective considers just war
theory to provide a flexible and modifiable set of criteria for
attempting to act morally and in accordance with principles of justice,
both in entering into an armed conflict (jus ad bellum) and in the
actual engagement of that conflict (jus in bello). In particular,
pragmatist feminism shares just war\'s starting premise of a strong
presumption against the legitimacy of the use of armed force and
violence to resolve conflicts.

[[A pragmatist feminist perspective]{.underline}]{.mark} thus
[**[rejects Cohn\'s and Ruddick\'s contention]{.mark}** that justwar
[theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} \"implicitly **[[accept war as a
practice even when condemning particular
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\"23 [Recognizing the historical and global
reality of war]{.underline} making and armed force [as means of
resolving conflicts and **adopting strategies to maximize justice and
minimize immorality** when such means are adopted **is not the same as
\"implicitly accepting the practices of war**]{.underline},\" at least
[in the absence of **demonstrably effective means of eliminating such
conflicts**. [To ignore the reality of]{.mark} the [continuing resort to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} and armed force [[is]{.mark} itself [to revert
to **abstraction** **rather than**]{.mark} offering **[a practical
method for eliminating]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[human
[suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}** and incalculable damage [caused by
war]{.underline} and armed conflict.

Here [Colin and Ruddick reveal]{.underline} (intentionally or otherwise)
[their situatedness as citizens of a war-making state]{.underline}, one
that has had the choice in many, if not all, instances since the
mid-twentieth century, at least, of deciding whether or not to go to
war. [Just as Cohn and Ruddick criticize just war theory]{.underline}
for failing to explore nonviolent alternatives once a just cause is
determined or war has begun, [**their [antiwar feminist approach fails
to offer concrete suggestions for avoiding armed conflict]{.mark}** when
a nation]{.underline} or people [is confronted with armed aggression or
assault by others]{.underline}, the situation [where the options boil
down to \"**fight or die**.\" [This]{.mark} perspective **[fails to look
at war from the point of view of the
aggressed-against]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [when]{.underline}]{.mark}
[armed [conflict becomes a necessity]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to
retain national and/or cultural and/or ethnic identity from subjugation
by the aggressor(s). [In such circumstances, the moral necessity of
armed force looks quite different]{.underline}. And in such
circumstances, [the [**threatened** use of WMD can be]{.mark} seen as
**[less evil than]{.mark}** the **[alternatives]{.mark}**, such as
**[doing nothing]{.mark}**]{.underline} and being conquered **[[or
fighting a]{.mark} conventional [war and faring
poorly]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Rather than reverting to abstract thinking about war, pragmatist
feminism affirms just war theory\'s casuistic approach to particular
armed conflicts as well as its position that such means are sometimes
morally justifiable or even morally obligator)\' in order to protect
oneself (individual or nation) or innocent third parties. Further,
[[pragmatist feminism affirms]{.underline}]{.mark} just war thinking\'s
[[**attention to particular conflicts rather than war in the abstract**
and]{.mark} its stance of moderation and of **[imposing]{.mark}** the
**[minimal suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline} necessary to accomplish the
objective of restoring the peace.24 Thus, with respect to the military
response of the United States to the September 11 terrorist attacks, a
pragmatist feminist application of just war criteria yields the
conclusion that the jus ad bellum principles of \"last resort\" and
\"proportionality,\" as well as the in hello principles of
\"proportionality\" and \"discrimination,\" were not satisfied.

[A second difference]{.underline} in the two feminist perspectives
[emerges out of [the]{.mark} antiwar feminist [observation]{.mark} that
[war and militarism are not separate from everyday
life]{.mark}]{.underline} but integral aspects of it.25 [While
[this]{.mark} is]{.underline} an extremely [important]{.underline}
insight into the underlying conditions of war and militarism, [it [needs
to be joined with]{.mark} **alternative [proposals for
addressing]{.mark} the [\"large-scale military conflict]{.mark}**.\"
There has been scant attention to this issue in antiwar feminist
scholarship]{.underline}. [Even if one assumes]{.underline}, as antiwar
feminists do, [that [war is a \"presence\" in everyday life]{.mark} and
not merely a discrete \"event\"]{.underline} that occasionally
\"erupts,\"26 [it is nonetheless the case that \"**[war\" is more
damaging and harmful, and creates greater suffering]{.mark} in a
multiplicity of ways**, [than]{.mark} the [absence of war]{.mark}.
[Pragmatist feminist thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} about the ethics of
WMD [[is **attentive to how such differences in consequences**
differentiate war from "everyday life]{.underline}]{.mark}."

A third significant area of difference between the two types of feminist
theories concerns responses to the causes of war. Whereas pragmatist
feminists agree with antiwar feminists that wars are partially a mutual
construction, they also insist that some wars have much more to do with
unjust aggression for which opposing sides do not share equal
responsibility. Antiwar feminism fails to accept that some wars are not
only necessary as a matter of prudence, but also morally justifiable *on
feminist grounds*, for example, humanitarian intervention to end the
severe oppression of innocent victims.

### 2AC -- Extinction O/W

#### Preventing extinction [isn't]{.underline} liberal futurity or naïve optimism\-\--mobilizing against dangerous conditions is preferable to [fatalism]{.underline} that consigns the planet to nuclear war.

**Stevens 18** (Tim, Lecturer in Global Security, King's College London,
"Exeunt Omnes? Survival, Pessimism and Time in the Work of John H.
Herz," Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 46, No. 3, pp.
283-302) \[ableist language modifications denoted by brackets\]

Herz explicitly combined, therefore, a political realism with an ethical
idealism, resulting in what he termed a 'survival ethic'.65 This was
applicable to all humankind and its propagation relied on the generation
of what he termed 'world-consciousness'.66 Herz's [implicit recognition
of an **open** yet **linear temporality** allowed him to **imagine
possible futures** aligned with the survival ethic, whilst **at the same
time imagining futures in which humans become extinct**]{.underline}.
His [**pessimism** about the latter **did not preclude** working towards
the former.]{.underline}

As Herz recognised, [[it was one thing to develop]{.mark} an [ethics of
survival but]{.mark} quite [another to **translate theory**]{.mark}
**in[to practice]{.mark}**[. What was required was]{.mark} a
**[collective]{.mark}**, **transnational** and **inherently
interdisciplinary [effort]{.mark}** [to address
**nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} and environmental [**[issues]{.mark}**
and to problematize notions of security]{.underline}, sustainability and
survival [[in]{.mark} the context of **nuclear
[geopolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the technological transformation
of society. Herz proposed various practical ways in which young people
in particular could become involved in this project. One idea floated in
the 1980s, which would alarm many in today's more cosmopolitan and
culturally-sensitive IR, was for a Peace Corps-style 'peace and
development service', which would 'crusade' to provide 'something
beneficial for people living under unspeakably sordid conditions' in the
'Third World'.67 He expended most of his energy, however, from the 1980s
onwards, in thinking about and formulating 'a new subdiscipline of the
social sciences', which he called 'Survival Research'.68

Informed by the survival ethic outlined above, and within the
overarching framework of his realist liberal internationalism, Survival
Research emerged as Herz's solution to the shortcomings of academic
research, public education and policy development in the face of global
catastrophe.69 It was also Herz's plea to scholars to venture beyond the
ivory tower and become -- excusing the gendered language of the time --
'homme engagé, if not homme révolté'.70 His proposals for Survival
Research were far from systematic but they reiterated his life-long
concerns with nuclear and environmental issues, and with the necessity
to act in the face of threats to human survival. [The **principal
[responsibilities]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}]{.underline} survival
[[**researchers** were]{.mark} two-fold. [One, to **raise awareness** of
survival]{.mark} issues in the minds of **policy-makers** and the
**public**, [and]{.mark} to **[demonstrate]{.mark} the [link
between]{.mark} political [inaction]{.mark} now** [and]{.mark} its
[effect on]{.mark} **subsequent human [survival]{.mark}**[. Two,
to]{.mark} **suggest** and **[shape]{.mark} new [attitudes]{.mark}**
[more 'appropriate to]{.mark} the solution of new and
[unfamiliar]{.mark} survival [problems', rather than **relying on
ingrained modes of thought**]{.mark} and **practice**]{.underline}.71
The primary initial purpose, therefore, of Survival Research would be to
identify scientific, sociocultural and political problems bearing on the
possibilities of survival, and to begin to develop ways of overcoming
these. This was, admittedly, non-specific and somewhat vague, but the
central thrust of his proposal was clear: ['In our age of global
survival concerns, it should be the **primary responsibility of
scholars** to engage in survival issues']{.underline}.72 Herz considered
[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark} an essential disciplinary contributor to this
endeavour, one that should be promiscuous across the social and natural
sciences. It [**[should not be afraid to think the worst]{.mark}**, if
the worst is at all possible, and to **establish the various
requirements**]{.underline} -- social, economic, political -- [of 'a
**livable world**'.]{.underline}73 How this long-term project would
translate into global policy is not specified but, consistent with his
previous work, Herz identified the need for shifts in attitudes to and
awareness of global problems and solutions. Only then would it be
possible for 'a turn round that demands leadership to persuade millions
to change lifestyles and make the sacrifices needed for survival'.74

Productive pessimism and temporality

In 1976, shortly before he began compiling the ideas that would become
Survival Research, Herz wrote:

For the first time, we are compelled to take the futuristic view if we
want to make sure that there will be future generations at all.
Acceleration of developments in the decisive areas (demographic,
ecological, strategic) has become so strong that even the egotism of
après nous le déluge might not work because the déluge may well overtake
ourselves, the living.75

[Of [significance]{.mark} here [is **not**]{.mark} **the [appeal to
futurism]{.mark} per se**]{.underline}, although this is important,
[[but]{.mark} the [suggestion this is 'the **first time**' futurism is
**necessary to ensur**]{.mark}**ing human [survival]{.mark}**[. This
is]{.mark}]{.underline} Herz the realist declaring a break with
conventional realism: Herz is [**[not bound to]{.mark} a [cyclical
vision]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} political or historical [time]{.mark} in
which events and processes reoccur over and again]{.underline}. His
[identification of [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} as an
'absolute novum' in international politics [[demonstrate]{.mark}s this
[belief in]{.mark} the **[non-cyclical nature of]{.mark} humankind's
unfolding [temporality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.76 As Sylvest observes of
Herz's attitude to the nuclear revolution, ['the horizons of meaning it
produced installed a **temporal break** with the past, and
simultaneously carried a **promise for the future**']{.underline}.77

[This '[promise for the future' was **not**]{.mark}, however, a
**[simple]{.mark} liberal [view]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a **[better
future]{.mark} consonant [with]{.mark} human
[progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. His autobiography is clear that his
[experiences of **Nazism** and the **Holocaust** destroyed all remnants
of any original belief in '**inevitable progress**']{.underline}.78 His
[frustration at scientism, technocratic deception, and the brutal
rationality of twentieth-century killing, all but **demanded a
rejection** of the **liberal dream** and the **inevitability of its
consummation**. If the 'new age' ushered in by [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} he wrote, [is [characterised
by]{.mark} anything, it is by its '**indefiniteness of the age** and the
**[uncertainties of]{.mark} the [future]{.mark}**[']{.mark}; it was
**impossible** under these conditions to **draw firm conclusions** about
the future course of international politics]{.underline}.79 Instead, he
recognised the contingency, precarity and fragility of international
politics, and the ghastly tensions inherent to the structural core of
international politics, the security dilemma.80

Herz was uneasy with [both **cyclical** and **linear-progressive ways**
of perceiving historical time]{.underline}. The former 'closed'
temporalities are endemic to versions of realist IR, the latter to
post-Enlightenment narratives feeding liberal-utopian visions of
international relations and those of Marxism.81 In their own ways, [each
**marginalises** and **diminishes** the contingency of the social world
in and through time, and the **agency of political actors** in effecting
change]{.underline}. Simultaneously, [each **shapes the futures that may
be imagined** and **brought into being**]{.underline}. Herz recognised
this danger. Whilst drawing attention to his own gloomy disposition, he
warns that [without care and attention, 'the **assumption may determine
the event**']{.underline}.82 As a pessimist, Herz was alert to the
hazard of succumbing to negativity, cynicism or resignation. E.H. Carr
recognised this also, in [the difference between]{.underline} the
['**deterministic pessimism**']{.underline} of 'pure' realism
[and]{.underline} those **[[realists]{.underline}]{.mark}** 'who have
made their mark on history'; [the latter [**may be pessimists**
but]{.mark} they still [believe 'human affairs can be]{.mark}
**directed** and [**modified** by human action]{.mark} and human
thought']{.underline}.83 Herz would share this anti-deterministic
perspective with Carr. Moreover, [the **possibility of [agency]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} a [product of]{.mark} a [temporality 'neither]{.mark}
**temporally [closed]{.mark}** [nor **deterministic**]{.mark}, neither
**cyclical** nor **linear-progressive**; it is **rooted in
contingency**']{.underline}.84

Again quoting from his autobiographical account of the impact of Nazism,
Herz described the relationship between his early pessimism and his
developing intellectual stance:

The world became a theatre of the absurd. Suicide would probably have
been the logical next move, and I considered it from time to time. But I
was still too young for such a radical step. One thing, however,
emerged: a growing interest in domestic and, above all, international
politics. My complete resignation was no longer appropriate. If not from
within, fascism might perhaps still be destroyed from without. To my
continuing interest in theory, therefore, was added a practical interest
in action.85

Channelling the spirit of E.H. Carr, he wrote of this 'brutal awakening'
to the nature of power politics in the 1930s that, 'Study could no
longer be "pure" research; it had to become research committed to warn
of the deadly peril and show the way to the necessary action.'86 His
commitment to active engagement was an early one, gestated during his
personal experiences of Nazism in the 1930s.87 This desire to combat
Nazism from the outside was manifest in his activities for the Allies
during and after World War II but it coloured his scholarly life also.
Herz recognised pessimism was a powerful force in his life but, rather
than overcome or mask it, he used it to propel his intellectual project
further, and to engage with, not withdraw from, the world. He was, as
van Munster and Sylvest relate, '\[d\]eeply pessimistic yet a committed
social thinker'.88

Herz was explicit about this: [a **realistic** and **consistent
pessimism** can clarify where we are and prepare us to do what is
necessary]{.underline}.89 [Pessimism is a **necessary component** of a
realistic view of the world, upon which **proper** and **reasoned action
can be founded**]{.underline}. In this sense, [[pessimism can be
**productive**]{.mark}. It **[produces positive outcomes through
action]{.mark}**, rather than **negative ones through inaction** or
**resignation**. These are **subjective value-judgements**]{.underline},
to be sure, [but are obtained through a **process of realist engagement
with the world**, rather than]{.underline} blind [\[mere\] **fumbling**
or **ideological railroading**]{.underline}.
[[Survival]{.underline}]{.mark} Research [[was]{.mark} a **[response
to]{.mark}**]{.underline} Herz's [[**pessimism** about]{.mark} the
[future, **not a rejection**]{.mark} **of it**]{.underline}. This leads
us to two observations about the relevance of pessimism to the study of
international relations.

The first is that [pessimism **does not imply disengagement** from the
world]{.underline}. If anything, the example of John Herz suggests the
opposite. He was a pessimist, but his brand of [pessimism was no
'**passive fatalism**']{.underline}.90 As he recalled a few years before
he died, 'I consider myself a realist who comes sometimes to pessimistic
conclusions, but never gives up looking for solutions if ever so
difficult ones'.91 [Pessimism can be a **spur to thought** and to
**action** and **need not be a watchword for conservatism** in theory or
practice]{.underline}.92 This is not to say being a pessimist is easy.
Morgenthau, for his part, 'never flagged in efforts to use his
conceptual skills to help improve the human condition', despite his
[[pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark} about the ability and will of people to
take the long view on significant political issues.93 This
[[required]{.mark} that [scholars]{.mark} **chart different paths**
through troublesome times and [**articulate alternative visions** of
i]{.mark}nternational [order, not to **preclude political action**
but]{.mark} to **[facilitate it]{.mark}**]{.underline}; not quite the
conservative position realism is often assumed to occupy.94 [In the face
of worldly frustrations and horrors, it is this **attention to the
production of alternative futures** that prevents 'pessimism from
**turning into fatalism**']{.underline}.95

The second observation is that [it is **unhelpful** and **misleading**
to treat pessimism and optimism as **oppositional**]{.underline}.96
Pessimism and optimism are commonly regarded as antonyms but often enjoy
a symbiotic relationship. In Herz, [they **mingle** and
**cross-pollinate** in ways that defy easy explication]{.underline}.
Stirk claims, for instance, that Herz's [optimism about how the world
could be refashioned 'was **never more than guarded**']{.underline},
restrained by his fierce attachment to the importance of the security
dilemma.97 Puglierin notes that his 'blatant pessimism' (eklatanter
Pessimismus) was always accompanied by some form of optimism.98 We are
reminded of Gramsci's famous statement regarding 'pessimism of
intellect, optimism of the will' as the cognitive binary at work in the
political mind.99 [Even as]{.underline} his [pessimism
deepened]{.underline} over the course of his career, he was
**[always]{.underline}** wont to **[end]{.underline}** his [**analyses**
with a '**yet**' or '**in spite of it all**']{.underline}.100
Importantly, as he became more pessimistic, 'the solutions he proposed
became ever more ambitious'.101 His [growing pessimism was accompanied
by increasing resolve to **tackle the problems of the world
head-on**]{.underline}, although, as he admitted in a footnote in the
1980s, 'Not for a moment do I have the illusion that what I have
proposed is likely to happen'.102 A suitably pessimistic aside, perhaps,
but it did not deter him from continuing his project for another twenty
years. [[This drive seems not to be rooted in **optimistic
conviction**]{.mark}, nor even a **subtle version of hope**, [but
in]{.mark} a **properly [pessimistic reading]{.mark}** [of the
world]{.mark} and its possibilities, engendered as they were by the
**ontological temporality of perpetual change**.]{.underline}

### 2AC - Perm

#### Perm: Do both - Working with both critical feminist IR and traditional IR is most productive and consistent with the neg's literature

**Hudson et al 10** (Valerie M., Prof. of Poli Sci @ Texas A&M, PhD in

Sci @ the University of Massachussetts-Amherst, PhD in Poli Sci from the

We acknowledge the important role played by some IR feminists in
critiquing/expanding security studies to be more inclusive of women\'s
needs. But it is also true that deploying gender as a variable and a
category of analysis has contributed important insights to security
studies, which must be taken seriously by security studies scholars not
only for feminist reasons, but because security scholars -- and policy
makers -- miss much of what is going on by ignoring gender. **[[We
reject the claim that IR feminist approaches require]{.mark}
non-quantitative methods or a [critical theoretical
epistemology]{.mark}, a claim which has in the past been reified both by
IR feminists]{.underline}** (Tickner 2005) and by those writing within
the IR mainstream (e.g., Carpenter 2003). **[As Mary Caprioli has
argued, much quantitative work is also relevant to feminist
questions]{.underline}** (Caprioli 2004). We agree with Robert Keohane
(1989) that gender as a category of analysis can contribute something to
IR as conventionally defined, and it is this contribution which we
explore in this essay.¶ In our view, **[[seeking to integrate
gender]{.mark} more fully [into]{.mark} the discipline of [security
studies serves to validate]{.mark} the empirical [insights]{.mark}
yielded [by]{.mark} many [feminist IR scholars by taking them seriously
within the mainstream]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While methodologies and
specification of explanans and explanandum may differ from the work
cited above, **[[such analysis can]{.mark} indeed [be consistent with
"rethinking security on feminist grounds]{.mark}." By [drawing
on]{.mark} empirical [insights from gender theory, while speaking to the
major concerns of]{.mark} international [security
studies]{.mark}]{.underline}** as a discipline, the **[literature on
gender and security [can speak to both]{.mark} IR [feminists and
security]{.mark} studies [scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In this
essay, we will concentrate on what this literature can say to mainstream
security studies, whose primary concerns are, following Walt: "the
conditions that make the use of force more likely, the ways that the use
of force affects individuals, states and societies, and the specific
policies that states adopt in order to prepare for, prevent, or engage
in war (1991:212).¶ **[[Taking a gender perspective need not entail a
rejection of conventional concepts, methodologies, or questions that
define the discipline]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Unlike the critical
feminist scholarship, which is skeptical of conventional methodologies,
this literature review includes a range of **[empirical scholarship on
gender,]{.underline}** whether qualitative or quantitative, positivist
or constructivist, that **[make a meaningful contribution to security
studies]{.underline}**.

### 1AR - Perm

#### The aff and alts methods should be synthesized -- rejecting the permutation creates a methodological hierarchy that limits both theories

Dichotomies toward Effective Synergies\",

[These two broad research traditions talk about similar subjects but in
different ways. [Postpositivists]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[problematize]{.underline}**]{.mark}, while maintaining an interest
in, [[questions o]{.mark}f where and [how women participate in political
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Likewise, [the best [positivist analyses
of]{.mark} where and [how women participate in political violence
are]{.mark} theoretically [informed by]{.mark} complex understandings of
gender and [gender relations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, these two groups of [scholars' [adherence to
their]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[own intellectual
traditions]{.underline}** **[limit]{.underline}** [their ability to
produce]{.underline} **[synergistic understandings]{.underline}** [of
gender]{.underline}]{.mark} [and violence]{.underline}. Because many
feminist researchers reject positivists' tendency to use dichotomized
understandings that reduce gender to sex in order to formulate testable
hypotheses, they find it difficult to directly engage those hypotheses
and the associated statistical results. Yet feminist scholars are well
situated, for example, to provide deeper sociological interpretations of
the findings of positivist data analysis and to use the results of that
data analysis to tell more complicated stories. Positivists' tools, on
the other hand, are poorly suited to addressing the questions with which
feminist research is most concerned. First, positivists' implicit
assumptions that sex categories are stable, dichotomous, and contain
essential characteristics that can be read onto people hamper their
ability to account for gender differences as constitutive of sex
differences in political violence. In other words, it impedes their
ability to recognize statistical problems with which they are otherwise
quite familiar: correlations (between sex and violence) may be spurious
(with gender as the underlying cause) and correlations can be produced
by unseen or difficult to measure intervening variables (Kadera and
Mitchell 2005). Second, standard regression analyses are constrained by
the difficulty of detecting coconstitution and the challenges of
directly testing relationships between quantifiable and unquantifiable
phenomena.4 Neither research program is above reproach on its own terms
either. Large-n statistical work on women's political violence
encounters difficulties other large-n statistical work does not: it is,
for example, limited by difficulties in obtaining data, including
criminalization of most political violence, the fact that politically
violent women commit (and often hide) transgressions of gender norms,
secrecy of politically violent groups, personal security risks in
conflict zones, and political interests of both researchers and their
funders. Feminist work, even as it seeks to resist sensationalization
and stereotyping, can struggle with sex, race, and cultural essentialism
as it tries to make sense of performance, presentation, and policy
surrounding women's violence in global politics.5 The two research
approaches cannot---and do not aim to---analyze identical subjects.
Furthermore, neither can provide sufficient leverage on all forms of
relevant questions related to women's political violence to warrant
excluding or superseding the other. A deeper, more engaged dialogue that
accepts these differences (and sometimes incommensurabilities) would
provide significant intellectual purchase. In order to build effective
positivist--feminist bridges, we must recognize what each piece of
research analyzes and evaluates, and its analytical strengths and
weaknesses. Dialogues can then address and engage the knowledge
parameters that limit the generalization of particular claims, resulting
in richer conversations about both extant work and trajectories for
future research. Seeing Effective Synergies The
[[syntheses]{.underline}]{.mark} we envision, [then, [do
not]{.mark}]{.underline} **[equate]{.underline}** [or **compare apples
and oranges**]{.underline} [or [create a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[hierarchy]{.underline}** [among approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}[.
[Instead, they]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[leverage
difference]{.underline}** [as a source of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[complementarity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} differences as a
source of [**[dialogue]{.mark}**. [Recognizing]{.mark} the **rich
[nuances]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} a variety of [work in
gender and IR, rather than]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[dichotomizing]{.underline}**]{.mark} understandings, [[produces
more]{.underline} **[effective engagement]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Below,
we provide three examples from the literatures on conflict sexual
violence, international norms and Convention on the Elimination of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), and terrorism and political
violence, of actual and potential dialogues.

### 2AC - Link Turn (Arms Control)

#### War turns [gendered violence]{.underline}, but analysis [isn't enough]{.underline} -- only [material engagement]{.underline} with the circulation and use of weapons makes feminist advocacy effective 

**Mhajne 18** (Anwar, a Palestnian citzen of Israel, recently received
her Ph.D. in Politcal Science from the University of Cincinnat in the
US. Her current research focuses on gender, politcs, and religion. \"THE
FUTURE OF FEMINIST FOREIGN POLICY: TOWARDS A MORE INCLUSIVE
UNDERSTANDING OF WOMEN'S (AND MEN'S) SECURITY.\"
<https://www.peacewomen.org/sites/default/files/Disrupted%20-%20The%20Post-Colonial%20Issue-Anwar%20Mhajne.pdf>)

As opposed to the aforementioned foreign policies, [an [effective
feminist]{.mark} foreign policy [needs to acknowledge]{.mark}
**[existing]{.mark} power [structures]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and
analyse the causes and consequences of patriarchy, militarisation, and
neoliberalism]{.underline} as the dominant order. [Profiting from arms
[production creates a **vested interest** in]{.mark} sustaining the
**[systems of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
**[manufacture]{.underline}**, [**[trade]{.underline}**,
**[proliferation]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [possession, [and **use of
weapons** facilitate]{.mark} sexual and [gender]{.mark}-based
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, human trafficking, [and armed conflicts,
which are integrally tied up with **violent
masculinities**]{.underline}. Governments need to reallocate resources
spent on the military towards activities that benefit women and humanity
in general, such as implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. As
Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) have always
argued, bloated military spending raids funds set aside for human
security and sustainable development: "If the \[1.6 trillion USD\] spent
on military security in 2015 was directed towards human security, this
would provide a substantial portion of the total needed to realise the
2015 Sustainable Development Goals" (WILPF, 2017: 20). [Militarism and
arms trades are tightly connected]{.underline}. [An emphasis on
**militarism**]{.underline} [might serve the interests of those
profiting from arms production, thus sustaining the systems of
**war**]{.underline}. As various studies produced by WILPF and the
United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) demonstrate (see: Gaynor,
2015 & WILPF, 2016), [[women]{.underline}]{.mark} [and girls often
[disproportionately suffer from]{.mark} the **[use of weapons]{.mark}**
[in conflict]{.mark} [due to]{.mark} "forced [displacement]{.mark},
[sexual violence, trafficking]{.mark}, lack of access to health
care]{.underline} (including sexual and reproductive health), [[and lack
of access to]{.mark} victim and [survivor
assistance]{.mark}"]{.underline} (WILPF, 2016: 6).

[Therefore, [a more **impactful** approach]{.mark} to feminist foreign
policy [should be based on challenging]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[militarism]{.underline}** [and preventing **arms** from reaching
**entities**]{.underline} [that will utilise them]{.underline}]{.mark}
[to violate the rights of men and women. [A feminist]{.mark} foreign
[policy should not only focus on]{.mark} addressing
[women's]{.mark}]{.underline} [[needs during conflict, but]{.mark} also
focus on]{.underline} **[[preventing conflict
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and reducing its intensity [through
controlling]{.mark} the **influx of [weapons]{.mark}** [and
limiting]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[arms trade]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[[It is important to ensure]{.mark} that [peace processes are
inclusive]{.mark} and **gender-sensitive**, but [this alone is
**insufficient**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather, to ensure peace,
policymakers need to focus on how militarism and arms trade fuel
conflicts and increase civilian casualties for men and women alike. [A
feminist foreign [policy should enable]{.mark} effective [conflict
prevention through **disarmament**]{.mark}, women's meaningful
participation, and providing effective conditions for **women's
empowermen**]{.underline}t.

### 2AC - Case Outweighs

#### Our impact outweighs and the alt fails--- forwarding claims about representations over resolving the violence of war-torn areas is simply academic complicity.

**Hudson 15** (Heidi, professor of International Relations and Director
of the Centre for Africa Studies at the University of the Free State,
Bloemfontein, South Africa, "(Re)framing the Relationship between
Discourse and Materiality in Feminist Security Studies and Feminist
IPE," pg 413-419, Politics & Gender; Cambridge Vol. 11, Iss. 2, June
2015)

Critical Perspectives on Gender and Politics¶ [While feminists usually
try to ground the meanings that they study]{.underline}, [theorizing the
mundane or the everyday]{.underline} may [very well represent
a]{.underline} detour\--or even [a dead end]{.underline}\--**[if
bread-and-butter issues]{.underline}** [related to the security and
economic well-being of ordinary]{.underline} women and men \[[people\]
are ignored]{.underline}. **[[What value does feminist
theorizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even if it draws from women\'s lived
experiences) **[[have]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [war-affected]{.mark}
[contexts]{.mark} [where meeting]{.mark} [immediate needs is
paramount]{.mark}]{.underline}**? **[At what point does the theorizing
of the body]{.underline}** under such circumstances **[become a means to
satisfying intellectual fetishes]{.underline}**? Theorizing the everyday
is messy because it has to contend with the immediate social setting in
which popular culture is inseparable from the economic materiality of
the conditions of oppression.¶ In response to this dilemma, [my aim is
to argue for a productive rather than a reductive relationship between
[Feminist Security Studies]{.mark}]{.underline} (FSS) [and]{.underline}
[Feminist]{.underline} (International) [Political Economy]{.underline}
(FPE), achieved through a reframed relationship between discursive
subjectivity and a structure-centred materiality. I argue for a more
systematic feminist analysis that reunites FPE and cultural FSS
critiques. This analytical synthesis is based on an understanding of the
co-constituted agency of discourse and materiality underpinned by a
postcolonial-feminist attention to the politics of space.¶ After the
Cold War, security became a catch-all concept for critical variants of
IR, but instead of working against disciplinary fragmentation,
\"security has settled into each new camp in particularistic ways\"
(Sylvester 2013, 618). For FSS the main concern is to underscore the
conceptual necessity of gender to understanding security. Although
scholars have also emphasized the theoretical and methodological
diversity of FSS, I contend that there is an implicit hierarchy of sorts
when it comes to which critical tradition matters more theoretically or
epistemologically\--with a subtle but distinct privileging of the
discursive as evidenced by the influential contributions of, among
others, Judith Butler (1993), Karin Fierke (2013a), Lene Hansen (2006),
and Laura Shepherd (2008). FSS thus tends to focus on the gendered,
discursive construction of forms of violence with less attention paid to
materialities of economic insecurity. In contrast, FPE tends to avoid
the security frame and its discursive implications and concentrates more
on gender as a social relation of inequality and the gendered effects of
capitalism or economic globalization.¶ Poststructuralist scholarship in
FSS insists that the discursive is not privileged over the material and
that objects in the material world and human subjects both take their
forms and agencies relationally, as they are embedded within particular
locations. Similarly, gendered and embodied security is theorized to be
the outcome of relational processes\--performed in, by, and through
those relations. Theory thus makes practice (Foucault 1972). Yet,
thinking about our bodies as cultural constructs, produced as objects in
security discourse, has a high level of abstraction. Before we can
analyze discourse about bodies, shouldn\'t we first make the bodies from
\"other worlds,\" rooted in everyday struggles of human insecurity,
feature in IR? How is attention to contextualized discourses of
individuals or groups without considering their basic needs different
from what liberal feminists are doing, namely treating those whose
security is at stake as abstract, silent, rights-bearing individuals
with no culture? [Moreover, for all this [talk about interactions
between language and matter]{.mark} ([as if]{.mark} they were
[equal]{.mark}), \"**language\" remains the star of the
show**]{.underline}, as evidenced in Karin Fierke\'s claim that
\"embodied security is \... fundamentally bound up in the interaction
between humans and their material environment, both of which are
constituted in and through language\" (Fierke 2013b, 16).
[Theoretically, materiality should gain agency through the fact that it
cannot ontologically be separated]{.underline} [from discursive
forces]{.underline} but **[in practice discourses [treat material
practices]{.mark}]{.underline}** (bodies) **[[as
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}** (objects) **[[rather than
causes]{.underline}]{.mark}** (subjects), and consequently maintain
agency (Wilcox 2012). **[A subtle hierarchy is therefore
imposed]{.underline}**. [Reversing the starting point of the inquiry may
succeed in troubling dualistic thinking but does not transcend it. We
may have thrown the baby]{.underline} [out with the
bathwater]{.underline} **[when we [privileged]{.mark} the effects of
[cultural constructions of gender]{.mark}]{.underline}** difference
**[[at the expense of]{.mark} the [material effects of bodies]{.mark},
economic justice, [and security]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Fraser
2013).¶ **[There are clearly limits to discursive
analysis,]{.underline}** [especially when it comes to connecting
physical insecurity and the materiality of insecurity linked to
structures. We must therefore look to the so-called \"new
materialisms]{.underline}\" on posthumanist agency (Connolly 2013),
material feminisms (Hughes 2013), and Feminist IPE. Feminist IPE as a
diverse body of scholarship studies structures, social practices, and
the meanings of the global political economy (Griffin 2010; Peterson
2007). [The emphasis falls on specifically gendered bodies while also
[foregrounding **differences**]{.mark}]{.underline} **[that are [based
upon material and structural inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} [well [as **intersectional**]{.mark} relations of
disadvantage]{.underline} (e.g., gender, institutionalized racism, or
ethnicity). In this regard, FPE may find itself closer than FSS to a
radical definition of human security as everyday life experiences
embedded in global structures of inclusion and exclusion and can keep
FSS honest by guiding it back to a concern with everyday (economic)
insecurities.¶ While FPE reminds us to consider the global picture of
inequality, a systematic feminist political economy theory of
security/conflict/violence is yet to emerge. That said, [revisiting the
material conditions that influence the socioeconomic production of
gender as a relation of inequality is a potentially agency-inducing
factor **that could complement**]{.underline} (together with attention
to new materialisms) [the discursive analytics of FSS,]{.underline} as
will be shown in the discussion that follows on sexual and gender-based
violence (SGBV) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).¶ [FSS
research has highlighted the harmful discursive misrepresentations that
characterize international attention on rape as a tool of
war]{.underline} in the DRC (e.g., Baaz and Stern 2013). However,
[[feminist]{.mark} [poststructuralism]{.mark} on its own is [not a
suitable lens]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [understand]{.mark} the
[hybridity]{.mark} of how women in the DRC adapt SGBV discourses to fit
in with local cultural practices and [to fulfil]{.mark} particular
[sociomaterial]{.mark} [needs]{.mark} within their specific
context]{.underline}. One needs a postcolonial feminism for that. To
keep the international community interested and maintain the status that
funding brings, women\'s organizations in the eastern DRC tend to
emphasize the brutal and extensive nature of SGBV. The outcome is not
straightforward\--women\'s victimhood is reinforced\--but at the same
time, it could mean that so-called \"victims\" fight back, negotiating
the \"global patriarchal bargain\" from below, simultaneously engaging
with discourse and the material aspects of socioeconomic justice and
empowerment (Jean-Bouchard 2013).¶ [This case also underlines the
necessity to consider a broad range of materialities]{.underline} (i.e.,
not only those that are discursively produced, but also \"conventional\"
political economy materialities during and after war). During war, rape
as a form of gendered accumulation by dispossession was used in
Mozambique and Rwanda to strip women of their productive and
reproductive labor power, as well as their possessions and access to
land and livestock. Postwar, Baaz and Stern (2013) found that Congolese
men rape due to a complex mix of cultural and political economy
perceptions about masculinity, women as property, and a sense of
entitlement to sex as compensation for their loss of status as
providers. Borrowing Claudia Card\'s (2003) term \"social death\" to
describe the cultural shame as a consequence of rape, I argue that the
loss of social vitality is not just a loss of identity and meaning for
one\'s existence, but also a deeply material loss of political,
economic, and social relations. Both FSS and Feminist IPE should
therefore pay more attention to the political economy of social
relations and inequalities of the everyday.

### 2AC - Binary DA

#### The dualistic nature of equating militarism and patriarchy reinforces the cultural basis of Western gendered power relations

By [[equating militarism and patriarchy]{.underline},]{.mark} these
feminists often structure their arguments in such a way as to [[suggest
that]{.mark} to be [male is synonymous with strength, aggression,
and]{.mark} the will [to dominate]{.mark} and do violence to others
[and]{.mark} that to be [female is synonymous with weakness, passivity,
and]{.mark} the will [to nourish]{.mark} and affirm the lives of
others]{.underline}. While these may be stereotypical norms that many
people live out, [such [dualistic thinking is dangerous;
it]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}is a basic ideological component of the
logic that [[informs and promotes domination in Western
society]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even when inverted and employed for a
meaningful purpose, like nuclear disarmament, it is nevertheless risky,
for [[it reinforces the]{.mark} cultural [basis of sexism and]{.mark}
other forms of group [oppression. Suggesting]{.mark}]{.underline} as it
does [[that women and men are inherently different]{.mark} in some fixed
and absolute way]{.underline}, it [[implies that
women]{.underline}]{.mark} by virtue of our sex [have [played no]{.mark}
crucial [role in]{.mark} supporting and upholding [imperialism]{.mark}
(and]{.underline} the [militarism]{.underline} that serves to maintain
imperialist rule) or other systems of domination. O[ften the women who
make such assertions are white]{.underline}. Black women are very likely
to feel strongly that [[white women have been quite violent,

The question of incentives here certainly applies to some women who were

roles made]{.underline} their [evacuations safer and less

[men and women fall along]{.underline} a [spectrum between hero and
victim]{.underline}, [rather than]{.underline} [entirely]{.underline} as
[one]{.underline} [or]{.underline} the [other]{.underline}. The
**[protective masculine and vulnerable feminine model
represents]{.underline}** a **[broad view that]{.underline}** sometimes

in]{.underline} their [model of patriarchal violence]{.underline} does
not always apply, or [applies only in]{.underline} a [rigidly logical
way]{.underline}. The stories in this study show that [women, men and
children]{.underline} were [all victims of military
aggression]{.underline}. However, in some cases, women were the only
agents available to save the children; in other cases, representatives
of the patriarchal order, such as fathers or fathers-in-law, were either
left behind or uninvolved. While the men did protect the
womenandchildren in some instances, [women, who subscribed to their
gender roles]{.underline} as mothers and wives, [acted in instances when
men were impotent to act]{.underline}, [thus]{.underline} in a sense
[protecting the men also]{.underline}. While **[some]{.underline}**
would **[argue that these]{.underline}** women's **[performances lie
outside]{.underline}** the realm of **[gender norms]{.underline}**, one
could clearly see that [such binary distinction is

### 2AC - Essentialism DA

#### Essentialism DA: Their analysis reductively reifies gender norms. 

**Reiter 15** (Dan, Department of Political Science, Emory University.
10/2015. "The Positivist Study of Gender and International Relations."
Journal of Conflict Resolution, vol. 59, no. 7, pp. 1301--1326.)

Summary This wide array of positivist gender/IR work offers three major
sets of contributions and challenges to existing IR scholarship. First,
this scholarship has provided positivist evidence shedding light on many
of the theoretical and descriptive suppositions developed in
nonpositivist gender/IR work. Furthermore, the positivist evidence has
argued for the substantive as well as statistical significance of gender
in explaining critically important phenomena. As noted, Hudson et al.
(2012) propose that gender has a larger impact on conflict onset than
economic development or democracy. Erik Melander (2005a) found that
measures of gender equity have at least as much impact on civil war
onset as factors such as economic development, democracy, and ethnic
fractionalization. Gizelis (2009) found that improved gender equity, as
measured by higher female life expectancy, increases the likelihood of
the success of UN peacekeeping missions several fold. **[Some of the
[positivist work critiques the]{.mark} simple [view that women
are]{.mark} always [more peaceful]{.mark} than men are, [supporting the
general feminist perspective that]{.mark} the [effects of gender on
behavior are sophisticated]{.mark}]{.underline}**, especially because
gender is cultural/social as well as biological. For example, **[[the
role of women in]{.mark} terrorist and insurgent [groups varies
widely]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as women are sometimes combatants, even
engaging in sexual assault. **[The [effects of gender on public opinion
are also complex. Contra]{.mark} some 1980s [perspectives about]{.mark}
the [hypermasculinity of nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for
example, **[there is some evidence that [American women are
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** significantly **[[less
likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[than American men [to favor
nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second, this
positivist work has helped address some scholarly questions that
nonpositivist scholars had identified as important and underexplored. At
a very simple level, positivist data collection has helped shed more
light on the monumental scope of gender-related violence, a set of
behaviors that significantly negatively affect the lives of hundreds of
millions of people who happen to be women (Hudson et al. 2012).
Positivist work has helped describe and understand the effects of
elements of the global economy on the lives of women. It has also helped
improve our understanding of the role women play in the foreign policy
process, especially female heads of state, cabinet members, and members
of parliament. Third, positivist work has helped identify new questions
related to gender and IR. Positivist work has explored the role gender
plays in the formation of trade policy preferences, the different
political roles of female as compared with male casualties, the
international determinants of the spread of gender equity, and others.
New Directions Positivist scholarship has not yet come close to
answering all existing questions relating to gender and IR. Much work
remains to be done. Perhaps **[the single [most important]{.mark}
priority [is for scholars to be aware of]{.mark} making [essentialist
assumptions]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that the]{.mark} meaning and
behavioral [consequences of gender are constant across space and
time.]{.mark} Some of the positivist [gender/IR work assumes]{.mark}
that [gender has essentialist effects, using research designs that do
not allow for]{.mark} the possibility of [varying effects]{.mark} of
gender across context. Future positivist gender/IR work would benefit
from relaxing essentialist assumptions]{.underline}**, **[developing
ideas as to how the effects of gender might vary across
contexts]{.underline}**. For example, a female national leader emerging
from a society with weaker gender equity norms might behave differently
than a female national leader emerging from a society with stronger
gender equity norms. Research already suggests that the consequences of
gender vary drastically across insurgent and terrorist groups, a
phenomenon that deserves greater attention.

### 2AC - State Important

#### Feminist strategies must engage the state

**Mansbridge 03** (Jane, "Professor of Political Leadership and
Democratic Values @ Harvard, Anti-statism and Difference Feminism in
International Social Movements," International Feminist Journal of
Politics)

[[Feminist strategies that neglect]{.mark} or]{.underline} consistently
[deplore [state action cannot accomplish what women]{.mark}
[need]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [because [individuals
need]{.mark}]{.underline} collectives such as [[states to solve
collective action problems]{.mark} and to move toward more just social
arrangements]{.underline}. Strategies that rely heavily on women's
differences from men also cannot accomplish what women need -- because
women are like men in many ways relevant to individual and collective
action. Despite these truths, social movements also need some strategies
of action that work separately from and sometimes against the state.
Moreover, strategies that accentuate the differences between oppressed
and oppressing bring needed energy to a movement. The best overall
strategy is, therefore, to realize that both states and difference
theories are dangerous weapons, and proceed with caution.¶ In this
important paper, Jane Jaquette sounds the alarm. She exposes the dangers
of ignoring the state and the dangers of 'difference feminism'. She also
shows how these are linked. Although I will underscore the merits of
anti-state activity and difference feminism, I agree that [[a]{.mark}
feminist [strategy that neglected]{.mark} or deplored [state action
would be weak]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed. So would a strategy that
relied on women's differences from men.¶ First, the merits of Jaquette's
argument.¶ [One strand in feminist theory and practice greatly suspects
the state. This [**suspicion can escalate into outright rejection**,
with]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially **[[grave consequences for
women]{.underline}]{.mark}**.¶ [The philosophical case for the state
is]{.underline} relatively [simple. Collective action]{.underline}¶ [can
improve human lives]{.underline}. Efficient [[collective action requires
coercion.]{.mark} Instru- ments of collective action involving coercion
can]{.underline}, paradoxically, [increase human freedom]{.underline}.
We are freer to do many things if we can bind ourselves with legally
enforceable contracts. Rather than enforcing these contracts privately,
[it is]{.underline} more efficient and potentially [more just to give a
monopoly of legitimate violence to one entity]{.underline}, so long as
that entity can reasonably claim to be more just than the alternatives.
Humans have long struggled to devise relatively legitimate forms of
coercion. The history of democracy is part of that struggle, although
that history has nowhere produced national-level institutions that are
highly legitimate. [[Despite their incapacity ever to be fully
legitimate]{.underline},]{.mark} however, [[we still
need]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} and
international institutions [[to help solve collective]{.mark} action
[problems]{.mark} and to give scope to the human capacity for
justice]{.underline}.¶ Regarding women, the practical case for the
state, must be grounded in contemporary realities. [[In some
states]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as Sweden, [[women do
better]{.underline}]{.mark}, compared to men, [[than in the most
egalitarian of known pre-state entities]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as
the Kung!. Moreover, although the dangers of state power for women are
great, [it is not practical to contemplate returning to pre-state
entities]{.underline}. Human beings seem to want the goods produced by
more extensive forms of cooperation, including those that require
legitimate coercion. [[Given that states will not
disappear]{.underline}]{.mark} in the near future, [[what stance should
we take toward them]{.mark}?]{.underline} My answer is: [wary
usage]{.underline}. **[[State power will be used against
women]{.underline}]{.mark}**, just as other forms of power are used
against women, [**[unless we intervene]{.underline}**. [One response is
to establish barriers, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} constitutional or
internationally enforceable [[rights]{.mark}, to certain kinds of
invasions by state power. Another is to make states more likely to act
in the interests of women]{.underline}.¶ In the United States both
theory and institutional practice carry suspicion of the state farther
than in most countries, with some malign consequences. Ours has been a
'liberalism of fear' more than an Enlightenment liberalism that
envisions a common good. Americans are wary of state power, encouraged
in that wariness by powerful capitalist interests. Jaquette rightly
warns against this. State power can serve both as a brake on the
negative externalities of capitalism and as a positive force for
material redistribution. Particularly when patriarchal power takes
violent forms in the private sphere, state power can help women struggle
against that violence as well as other non-state evils.¶ The question,
then, is how far to carry wariness of state power and of theories of
state universalism and impartiality. I believe [[we must]{.mark} both
[use state power and place bounds on. Because the
state]{.mark}]{.underline} as a tool [[is dangerous]{.mark} and flawed,
[we need to use it with caution]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Jaquette faults
contemporary feminist anti-state theorists not for wanting to abolish
the state but for spending their energies on wariness rather than on how
to use it for redistribution. How important one thinks this problem is
depends on how one judges the current balance within feminist theory.
[Many feminist theorists]{.underline} -- e.g. Susan Okin, Nancy
[Fraser]{.underline}, Iris Young -- [call for]{.underline}
redistributive [reforms requiring state power]{.underline}. Perhaps in
Latin America, from¶ 356 International Feminist Journal of Politics
------------------------------------------------------¶ ￼Downloaded by
\[Harvard Library\] at 12:19 04 August 2014¶ which Jaquette takes her
lead, theorists of the North are represented by anti- state theory. In
that case, one must ask why these are the theorists Latin American
feminists choose to read. Anti-state discourse may have informed radical
practice in Latin America not because anti-state theory is dominant in
the North but because activists in Latin America find that anti-state
discourse meets their organizing needs. Anti-state discourse may reflect
the reality of individuals working on the margins of states that either
are relatively corrupt or, even more obviously than most, enforce the
interests of dominant classes.¶ Jaquette also rightly warns of the
dangers of valorizing action in civil society to the neglect of state
action. However, we need evidence that the more women participate in
NGOs the less they participate in the state. Without such evidence it
seems equally plausible that the more women participate in NGOs the more
they will acquire the skills and contacts required for involve- ment in
state politics. Some individuals also will not be able to deal with the
hierarchy, coercion and male dominance embedded in all states. They will
need to work in social movements. Political activism usually sustains a
division of labor, with the individuals who can best deal with
established institutions doing just that and those who are most repelled
by those institutions charting another course. The directions they take
sometimes conflict with one another.¶ Women and feminists trying to
achieve places in the state, whether as femocrats or politicians, face
major barriers but also major attractions. I do not know how much we
should worry that they will not be attracted to these jobs because of
radical anti-state discourse. In the United States this does not seem to
be a huge problem. In some countries, women who could be agents of
feminist change turn down jobs in the state because those jobs are
boring and unsatisfying. When these women speak of their frustrations,
radical anti- state discourse appears to play a small or non-existent
role.¶ In short, Jaquette is right that an est[ablished [anti-state
discourse]{.mark} within radical movements [makes productive interaction
with states less likely]{.mark}]{.underline}, but I am not sure that
such discourse is created by feminist theory.¶ Jaquette also points to
distortions produced by difference feminism. It is true that any stress
on women's differences reinforces the tendency of dominant groups such
as white or middle-class women to interpret 'women's' experiences
primarily in light of their own experiences. In recent years, women of
color have produced the greatest advances in feminist theory, forcing
white feminists to look more closely at their hegemonically defined
concepts of commonality; this work has given all feminists the tools to
understand better differences within their groups and subgroups.¶ In
addition, in most areas of presumed personality difference between men
and women, the differences are extremely small. The currently definitive
meta-analysis of studies on Carol Gilligan's hypothesis shows that -- at
least in the United States, in the highly educated populations where she
argues that differences should appear -- only very small differences can
be found.¶ ------------------------------------ Jane
Mansbridge/Anti-statism and difference feminism 357¶ Downloaded by
\[Harvard Library\] at 12:19 04 August 2014¶ Most studies do not show
women taking a different approach to justice or behaving more
cooperatively than men. Studies designed to elicit behavioral gender
differences often generate practically none.¶ In-groups, we now know,
exaggerate similarities within their group and their differences from
other groups. The human brain makes these predictable cognitive and
emotional mistakes in in-group/out-group differentiation. Recognizing
this tendency, we should constantly struggle to take into account the
fact that our social and first-order cognitive estimates of such
differences are usually exaggerated. In the case of gender, all
societies also engage in 'gratuitous gendering' -- giving gendered
meanings to nouns and patterns of action that do not functionally
require that identification. These processes increase even more our
perceptions of gender difference.¶ Today we have little idea what
differences might or might not emerge between men and women in a
non-oppressive society. It seems mistaken, therefore, to insist on
difference rather than focusing on the effects of dominance.¶ Finally,
as Jaquette warns, promising different political results based on the
premise that women are different from men is dangerous. We are almost
certain not to deliver on that promise, at least in the short run. The
backlash after the US suffrage movement was undoubtedly caused in part
by disillusion at the lack of change when women won the vote.¶ And yet,
small differences that do appear between men and women can take on major
symbolic significance, precisely because of our human tendency to
exaggerate group differences. Although using that significance is
danger- ous, not only because it exaggerates reality but also because it
underlines the very stereotypes that have been used to keep women in
their place, the existence of danger does not mean that we should
forswear this tool -- any more than for swearing the tool of state
action. Just remember: when using a dangerous tool, take active
precautions against its potential harms.¶ Difference arguments for
electing women are not just arguments from 'utility', as Jaquette
reports Marian Sawer's point. For example, the fact that women are
perceived as more honest than men can advance an attack on corruption by
associating its female leaders with honesty. Using positive stereotypes
of women in this way need not be degrading. Successful uses may even
result in males adopting certain features of female symbolism to signify
their own adherence to better standards.¶ In another example, among
professional populations in the United States, women are somewhat more
likely than men to adopt participatory, egalitarian styles of
leadership. The difference probably derives from women's relative
powerlessness, which teaches skills of persuasion rather than command.
In the US women's movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, women used the
gender differences they perceived in listening, interpreting body
language and participatory style to create significant departures from
the prevailing styles of left politics in organizations dominated by
men. The message, 'We do things differently' is exhilarating. It prompts
greater effort in trying to¶ 358 International Feminist Journal of
Politics ------------------------------------------------------¶
Downloaded by \[Harvard Library\] at 12:19 04 August 2014¶ forge a new
model, because the effort is associated not only with a different
culture that can replace the old one but also with a different self and
associated selves.¶ Turning from practical politics to political theory,
concepts are also often gender-coded. Freedom and self-interest, for
example, are often coded as male, community and altruism as female. It
is not surprising, then, that when feminist theorists entered the field
of theory, some explicitly supported certain values previously
denigrated as female. Although the arguments made for these values might
not be female, their proponrnts often were. Moreover, having been raised
in a subculture that had been allocated cultural respon- sibility for
these values, women had often thought about them more thor- oughly than
men. Women had also usually experienced the denigration of these values
first-hand.¶ In short, Jaquette is right that stressing women's
differences from men is fraught with danger. But values and practices
that many cultures associate with women are often good in themselves,
denigrated because of their association with women. Asserting the value
of these ideals and practices from a stance as women often makes
emotional, cognitive and political sense.¶ Importantly, Jaquette
identifies a link between anti-state discourse and difference feminism.
A number of anti-state theorists who are also strongly anti-essentialist
would deny this identification. But in social movements themselves, the
identification makes sense. The state is male; hence difference
feminists should be anti-state. The state is instrumental,
self-interested and hierarchical; women are communal, nurturing and
participatory. To the degree that these associations are simply accepted
as unchangeable truths, they compound the most problematic anti-state
mistake.¶ I agree wholeheartedly with Jaquette's fears in seeing no
visible trend toward a renewed interest in the politics of economic
justice, at least in the United States. In contrast to the creativity in
the struggle against globalization, there has been an absence of
'street-level' activism against, for example, the revolutionary shift in
tax burdens in the USA. More positively, the anti- sweatshop movement
has had some good effects in raising consumer con- sciousness and
bringing younger activists in touch with international labor movement
organizing. As for the causes of the shift away from the politics of
economic justice, I agree with Jaquette that it is related to the
post-Cold War era and the temporary triumph of capitalism. I am not so
sure that it has much to do either with activists' anti-state discourse
or with difference feminism.¶ This commentary has concentrated on the
caveats to Jaquette's thesis. I conclude by stressing again my
fundamental agreement with her argument. [Feminists have a 'stake in a
capable state'. [It would be **catastrophic** to be so carried away by
the theoretical virtues of civil society]{.mark} or by anti-state
discourse [as to deaden oneself to the practical need to work with the
state to **improve the lives of women**]{.mark}]{.underline}.¶ Because
ideas have influence, it is worth stressing Jaquette's point that¶

### AT: Empiricism/Rationality Bad

#### Empiricism is good and compatible with a feminist framework

**Neilson**, **05** (Joyce, Sociology Prof @ University of Colorado at
Boulder, Vital Variables and Gender Equity in Academe: Confessions from
a Feminist Empiricist Project, Signs 31(1), pp. 1-28)

The now substantial literature on the topic describes feminist research
as "passionate, scrappy, energizing" (Garko 1999, 167) and also as
contradictory, controversial, revolutionary, dynamic, problematic,
oxymoronic, explosive, and filled with creative tension. Deborah L.
Tolman and Laura A. Szalacha refer to "epistemological unrest" (1999,
10). Michelle Fine and Susan Gordon describe feminist psychology as an
inherent contradiction, pointing out that psychological laboratory
studies, with their isolation, sterility, and lack of relationships, are
designed to "drive women mad" (1992, 11). Elizabeth Merrick (1999)
describes her complex feminist reanalysis of data on teen pregnancy as
"like chewing gravel." There is agreement in the literature that
[traditional methods need feminist-inspired interruption]{.underline}
(Harding 1987). Indeed, Ellen [Scott and]{.underline} Bindi
[Shah]{.underline} (1993, 99) [cite]{.underline} Beatriz
[Pesquera]{.underline} as [[wondering]{.underline} [if "we can develop
**empowering methodologies**]{.underline} [without examining the whole
process]{.underline}]{.mark} [of **academic production**]{.underline}
[within the university]{.underline}." Certainly we have accomplished one
goal of this article, that is, to capture the contradictory, emergent,
and potentially revolutionary nature of feminist research as it is
practiced. Backstage, inside-story accounts of research in progress have
been contributing to improving methodologies at least since Julius A.
Roth's "Hired Hands Research" (1966). Feminist research is especially
known for its reflectivity. It is not surprising, then, that there is a
substantial literature of case studies of feminist research projects.16
Indeed, there is so much that Jane Ussher (1999) asks if feminist
researchers are obsessed with methods. A second purpose of this article
is to contribute to this literature. [[Our focus is]{.underline}]{.mark}
specifically [on]{.underline} **[[feminist]{.mark}
[empiricism]{.mark}]{.underline}**, something described in the
literature as in transition and controversial even (or primarily) among
feminists. See, for example, Sandra Harding's (1993) detailed comparison
between the feminist standpoint, on the one hand, and prefeminist and
spontaneous feminist empiricist epistemologies, on the other; Richmond
Campbell's (1994) model of internal feminist empiricism; Helen Longino's
(1993) philosophical model of contextual empiricism; and Lynn Hankinson
Nelson's (1990, 1993) naturalized empiricism. Thus, [juxtaposing our
reflective thoughts on feminist empirical work with writings by
theorists and philosophers on the topic should be
informative]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, we do not exactly fit any
one description of feminist empiricism---not completely and not yet
anyway. Certainly we recognize what Harding (1993) calls spontaneous
feminist empiricism in the earliest stages of this project. But our
thinking quickly became unstable, transitioning across different
feminist approaches.17 [To contribute to current discussion and debate
around feminist empiricism,]{.underline} how it is practiced, and how it
is transitioning, [we present a few close-to-the-ground conclusions
based on this particular research experience]{.underline}. As stated
earlier, [we recognized]{.underline}, perhaps agonizingly, that [our
[feminist thinking had **outpaced**]{.mark} [available]{.mark} methods
and **[strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This was most obvious in
efforts to measure feminist consciousness when we realized that it was
impossible to capture conceptual complexities and refinements in a few
or even a series of survey questions. We also realized that to generate
useful data and capture the thinking of our respondents, we had to
abandon our own constructs and temporarily adopt our respondents' points
of view. We saw the same pattern---that our feminist thinking had
outpaced our empiricist approach---with respect to understanding salary
differences between male and female faculty. We began with an effort to
explain (away) via regression analyses the gendered gap in salaries at
this university[. We ended with critical questions about the larger
social structure and culture]{.underline}---questions that are
unanswerable within regression-mode thinking. The questions that emerge
when one attempts a deeper---behind the numbers---understanding of this
pattern relate to the division of labor by sex. That is, answers to
questions about salary differences are found in patterns of sex
segregation by academic discipline and likely by associated patterns of
work distribution (research, teaching, and service) across and within
disciplines. These in turn are patterns that reflect the larger societal
division of labor by sex. It is interesting that these kinds of
substantive questions begin to approach those that constitute starting
points for feminist standpoint theory. We cite, for example, Harding's
description of Dorothy Smith's questions about women's work that are
generated by a strategy of grounding knowledge in women's everyday
experience: "She \[Smith\] points out that if we start thinking from
women's lives, we (anyone) can see that women are assigned the work that
men do not want to do for themselves" (Harding 1993, 53). We come to a
similar conclusion---that [our feminist work developed similarities to
standpoint and postmodern]{.underline} approaches---from our experience
of dual vision. That is, as we shifted between views of the university
from central and from marginal social locations, from both the inside
and the underside, we experienced firsthand the multivocal and complex
nature of the realities we were studying. In other words, [this process
erased, eroded, and undermined any semblance of the monologic voice that
usually underlies and characterizes prefeminist empiricism]{.underline}
[and much of feminist empiricism]{.underline}. Does it matter what we
call our practice of feminist research? [Does it matter whether what we
have described is contextual]{.underline} (Longino 1993),
[spontaneous]{.underline} (Harding 1993), [positivist]{.underline},
[internal]{.underline} (Campbell 1994), [or]{.underline}
[naturalized]{.underline} feminist empiricism (Nelson 1990, 1993)? It
does insofar as feminist empiricism is still emerging and this work can
be seen as part of the transition toward delineating an effective,
successful, and transforming version of feminist research. [[As a
feminist project]{.mark} whose researchers are cognizant of the variety
of feminist alternatives]{.underline}, **[[it has descriptive
and]{.mark} thus [epistemological value]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [As
a]{.underline}]{.mark}[n actual [project against which]{.mark} primarily
[theoretical work can be compared, its value is in]{.mark} its [very
doing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why confessions? **[[This]{.mark} account
[feels]{.mark} [confessional]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[i]{.mark}n the
sense that **[alternatives]{.mark} to feminist
empiricism**]{.underline}---**[standpoint and postmodern
feminism]{.underline}**---[[seem more cutting edge because they are
**more deliberately critical**]{.mark} of]{.underline} [traditional ways
of producing knowledge]{.underline}. [We felt apologetic for continually
falling back on known empiricist strategies when we were thinking more
radically and aware of being constrained methodologically. **[This
is]{.mark} an [odd]{.mark} stance to take**]{.underline}, though,
[[since feminist empiricism has been **revolutionary**]{.underline} [in
its contribution to **women's**]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[liberation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and, as Francesca Cancian (1996)
and Longino (1993) point out, [[despite]{.mark} much [writing
about]{.mark} creating **[innovative]{.mark}
[methods]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [most [feminist work revises mainstream
methodologie]{.mark}s]{.underline}. (An oft-repeated theme in the
literature is that **[[feminism is not in the methods]{.mark} per se
[but in their use]{.mark}]{.underline}**.) [Postmodern
thinking]{.underline} in particular is often more exhilarating and
challenging theoretically, yet insofar as it [[rejects grand
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, [large-scale models, and]{.underline}
indeed any kind of [generalization]{.underline}, it **[[poses]{.mark}
almost [irresolvable empirical challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Our
theme that [feminist empiricism is outgrowing its traditional methods is
worth pursuing through further analysis of specific research projects
such as the one we describe]{.underline}. For now, we continue to
stretch and expand the research paradigm with which we began.

### At: Sjoberg

#### They [overstate gender]{.underline} and their root-cause arguments [re-create essentialism]{.underline} -- this directly indicts Sjoberg

**Prugl 14** (Elisabeth, professor of International Relations/ Political
Science at the Graduate Institute of International and Development
Studies, Geneva, March,
http://www.cambridge.org.secure.sci-hub.bz/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/div-classtitlea-discussion-of-laura-sjobergandaposs-span-classitalicgendering-global-conflict-toward-a-feminist-theory-of-warspandiv/16E6B6EA6CCAB1DACFC1B1A4D9F26837)

[One of the [dangers of unmooring feminism from]{.mark} itself
and]{.underline} from [[other]{.underline}]{.mark} critical
[[approaches]{.mark} is]{.underline} that [[its insights become
molded]{.mark} so as [to]{.mark} be **[all things]{.mark}** to **[all
approaches]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the process, [[its core
propositions **get flattened**]{.mark} so they can adjust to other
theoretical axioms]{.underline}. This is the case here with regard to
gender, arguably feminism ' s core analytical concept. Sjoberg develops
a " realist feminism, " proposing that gender hierarchy is a structural
feature of the international system and a permissive cause of war, in
addition to or substituting for anarchy (p. 98). In this approach,
gender becomes " genders " (pp. 76 ff), that is, the categories women
and men, and gender hierarchy an organizational attribute of states.
[What is lost is gender as a relational concept and as an analytical
category]{.underline}, the usages preferred by many feminists. Casting
aside feminist debates about the sense and nonsense of structuralist
theories of patriarchy, Sjoberg resurrects them under the mantle of
gendering neorealism. In her dialogue between unequals, gender yields to
the theoretical axioms of the mainstream.

Another casualty of this dialogue between unequals is the explanatory
status of masculinity, which has become somewhat contested in feminist
IR. [In [Sjoberg]{.mark}'s hands, [hegemonic masculinity freezes into a
predictive variable]{.mark}]{.underline}. She hypothesizes that " the
more competitive a state ' s hegemonic masculinity, the more likely that
state is to make war. . . . States with elements of hypermasculinity in
the nationalist discourse would be expected to be more aggressive " (p.
100). [[We are left to guess why masculinities]{.mark}]{.underline}
always [[seem]{.underline}]{.mark} to be ([**[more or
less]{.underline}**) [competitive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [what
hypermasculinity consists of, and how its characteristics can be known
in advance]{.underline}. Despite the feminist truism that gender (and
thus masculinity) is a social construct, pro- fessed also by Sjoberg,
[[she seems to imply]{.mark} that too much [masculinity **somehow**
brings]{.mark} about [war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} That is,
[masculinities always seem to be already tainted with militarism and
aggression, **[suggesting some masculine core]{.mark} that [no amount of
social construction can overcome]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Perhaps it is overdrawn to assign responsibility for this confusion to a
dialogue between unequals in which gender is reformu- lated to fi t
positivist epistemologies; however, a targeted engagement with feminist
literatures on militarist masculinities might have prevented this
mistake. Indeed, Gendering Global Con fl ict i s most satisfying when
the author leaves the mainstream behind, as she does in the next to last
chapter, on gendered experiences of war. Here, she brings to life one of
the most important con- tributions of feminist writings on war, that is,
recalling what war feels like to those who participate in it, its
economics, its deprivations, its sensual impressions, and its violences.
This is the starting point I would love to have seen Sjoberg take in
this book, using her encyclopedic knowledge of the fi eld, together with
her analytic prowess, not just to argue but to demonstrate the unique
contri- butions of feminist security studies.
