Finally, another type of socialization practice enacted by NATO involved
role-playing, and targeted in particular the "next generation" elites of
Central and Eastern Europe. As social psychologists have explained,
role-playing seeks to alter the behavior of targeted individuals by
having them adopt actively the role of another person.40 Although
different in their dynamics, teaching and persuasion are similar in that
they seek to directly affect the understandings, attitudes, and desires
of socializees. By contrast, role-playing works primarily by changing
the overt behavior of socializees: it is aimed at leading socializees to
adopt new behavioral dispositions by fulfilling the particular pattern
of behavior associated with a given social position.41 It is true that
[the effect of roleplaying can sometimes transcend behavioral
dispositions]{.underline} and include a change in the belief systems of
socializees. **[However]{.underline}**, [that effect is
only]{.underline} **[indirect]{.underline}**, [and it usually involves a
form of]{.underline} **[self-persuasion]{.underline}** (**[i.e.,
individuals convince themselves to change their opinion]{.underline}**
regarding a situation). [The]{.underline} **[assumption]{.underline}**
[is that, by]{.underline} first [learning to behave
like]{.underline}---and fulfill the duties associated with---[particular
roles]{.underline}, for instance, "good" liberal leaders, [it is likely
that subjects who participate in role-playing will]{.underline}, **[in
time]{.underline}**, also [accept the basic principles and norms
associated with those roles]{.underline}.

## Framing

### 2AC\-\--Framing\-\--AT: V2L

#### Large scale impacts access this

"Complexity, creeping normalcy and conceit: sexy and unsexy catastrophic
risks",

The normative perspective tends to track moral, political and legal
philosophy within the liberal tradition6 . Within this perspective, what
makes the prospect of an existential catastrophe a very bad thing is the
anticipated extent and severity of the harm to living, breathing human
beings. Harm is standardly regarded as a wrongful or undesirable
outcome, whether it takes the form of actual or risked damage, and
whether it is to our physical health and basic needs, to the resources
and freedoms each of us needs to pursue our own conception of the good
life, or to our psychological wellness and social bonds. [A [GCR]{.mark}
[that brings about our **extinction** would entail maximum
mortality]{.mark}, likely [preceded by]{.mark} **[unprecedented human
suffering]{.mark}**. If there are survivors, then [loss of
civilization]{.mark}al acquis [would severely **damage their life
chances**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. through the loss of medical,
pharmaceutical and agricultural supplies, equipment and know-how). The
normative perspective would not be indifferent to the loss of future
possibilities entailed by extinction, and at least some versions of it
would assign non-instrumental value to elements of the civilizational
acquis (e.g. art works); but these would be comparatively marginal
considerations.

#### Life is a [prerequisite]{.underline} to [V2L]{.underline}

Lisa **Schwartz 2** (Lisa Schwartz is a Chair at the Centre for Health
Economics and Policy Analysis, 2002, accessed 3/23/21, "Medical Ethic: A
Case Based Approach", www.fleshandbones.com/readingroom/pdf/399.pdf)

The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a
criterion for decisionmaking is closely related to the first, but with
an added dimension. This assertion suggests that [[the determination of
the value of]{.mark} the quality of a given [life is]{.mark} a
[subjective]{.mark}]{.underline} [determination]{.underline} [**[to be
made by the person experiencing that life]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
important addition here is that [[the decision is a personal one
that]{.underline}]{.mark}, ideally, [[ought not to be made externally by
another person]{.mark} but internally by [the individual]{.mark}
involved]{.underline}. Katherine Lewis made this decision for herself
based on a comparison between two stages of her life. So did James
Brady. [Without this element]{.underline}, [decisions based on quality
of life criteria lack salient information]{.underline} and the patients
concerned cannot give informed consent. [Patients [must be given the
opportunity to decide]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[for themselves]{.mark}**
[whether they think their lives are worth living]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}or not. [To ignore or overlook patients' judgement in this
matter is to violate their autonomy and their freedom to decide for
themselves]{.underline} on the basis of relevant information about their
future, and comparative consideration of their past. As the
deontological position puts it so well, to do so is to violate the
imperative that we must treat persons as rational and as ends in
themselves.

### 2AC\-\--Extinction Inevitable\-\--T/L

#### Extinction inevitable

The [[most **insidious threat**]{.mark} to humankind
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} something called "**[[extinction
debt]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [There [comes a time]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
the progress of **[any species]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even ones that
seem to be thriving, [[when extinction]{.mark} will be
[inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[no matter what]{.mark} they might do
to avert it]{.underline}. The cause of extinction is usually a delayed
reaction to habitat loss. [The [species most at risk]{.mark} are [those
that **dominate**]{.mark} particular **habitat patches** [at the
**expense of others**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[who]{.mark} tend to
**migrate elsewhere**]{.underline}, [and [are]{.mark} therefore [spread
more thinly]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Humans occupy]{.underline}]{.mark}
more or less [[the whole planet]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and with our
sequestration of a large wedge of the productivity of this planetwide
habitat patch]{.underline}, [we are dominant within it]{.underline}.
[[H. sapiens might]{.mark} therefore [already be a **dead species
walking**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **[signs]{.mark} are [already there]{.mark}** for those **willing
to see them**]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} the [**habitat** becomes
**degraded**]{.mark} such that there are **[few]{.mark}er
[resources]{.mark}** to go around]{.underline}; [when
**[fertility]{.mark}** starts to **[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline};
[when the **[birth rate sinks below]{.mark} the** **[death
rate]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [and when **[genetic resources]{.mark} are
[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[the only way is
**down**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The question is "How fast?"

I suspect that [the [human population]{.mark} is **[set]{.mark}** not
just [for]{.mark} shrinkage but
**[collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[and
**soon**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To paraphrase Lehrer, [if we are going to
write about human extinction]{.underline}, [we'd better start writing
**now**.]{.underline}

It [[slams into]{.mark} the **[Earth\'s surface]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[**trillion tons** of]{.mark} [rock]{.mark} moving so fast it [strikes

the energy [of]{.mark} **[ten billion]{.mark} [Hiroshima

arsenal. It [smashes a **hole** **thirty kilometers deep** into the

devastates the Caribbean. [**Trillions** of **tons** of **rock** and
**dust**]{.underline} are [thrown]{.underline} far up [into the
sky]{.underline}. Some of this [[superheated]{.mark} [rock]{.mark}
**[rains]{.mark} [down]{.mark}** over **millions** of square
**k**]{.underline}ilo**[m]{.underline}**eters, [**[burning]{.mark}** the
[animals to **death**]{.mark} and [igniting **fires**]{.mark} that
**[spread]{.mark}** the **[devastation]{.mark}**]{.underline} still
[[further]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [**much more deadly** is the
**dust** that stays **aloft**]{.underline}.

A [**billowing [cloud]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [dust]{.mark} and ash
[rises]{.mark}]{.underline} all the way [[to]{.mark} the **[upper
atmosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**[blocking]{.mark} out** the
**[Sun\'s light]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is [this that [turns]{.mark}
regional [catastrophe]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[mass]{.mark}
[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Slowly, [it [spreads across]{.mark}
the **[entire world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [engulfing it in
**[darkness]{.mark} [lasting years]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[With]{.underline} the [darkness [comes]{.mark} a **[severe global

[blocked by the dust and reflected off]{.underline} the [haze of
**sulfate aerosols**]{.underline} released when the sea floor was

#### Even a small one causes extinction

**Martin 19** -- (Sean, a science reporter at Express, "Asteroid
warning: How asteroid explosion could lead to all out nuclear war -
shock claim," 9-1-2019, Express,
https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/1171987/asteroid-earth-2019-nuclear-war-chelyabinsk-meteor-us-russia-news-nuclear-bomb)

[[A **SMALL asteroid**]{.mark} explosion over a city [**could be
mistaken as a bomb being dropped** and]{.mark} might inadvertently
[**lead to all out nuclear war**,]{.mark} it has been warned. In
[2013]{.mark}, a 20 metre [meteor]{.mark} exploded over Chelyabinsk,
Russia, which [smashed windows]{.mark} and caused injuries to more than
1,000 people. Experts had not anticipated the incident,]{.underline} and
at first officials were unsure what caused the impact.
**[[Now]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one journalist theorises that **[[if a
small asteroid were to explode over Russia or the US now, where
political tensions are high]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Bryan Walsh, author
of End Times which analyses the existential threats to the human race,
said in the book: "[The airburst]{.underline} from the 2013 meteor
[[could]{.mark} have **[easily]{.mark} [be]{.mark}en [mistaken for a
nuclear strike]{.mark} by the U**nited **S**tates, which was indeed the
first reaction of many witnesses on the ground.]{.underline}
**["[Nuclear tensions]{.mark} between Washington and Moscow [are even
higher now than they were in 2013]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "It's not
difficult to imagine -- but horrifying to picture -- what a knee-jerk
Russian reaction to a seeming nuclear attack could have lead to." Recent
research found that [a [nuclear war]{.mark} between the US and Russia
[would have devastating consequences]{.mark} for everyone across the
globe, inducing a **[major climate shift]{.mark}** and **[plunging the
planet into darkness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} New research, based on a
2007 study, has found [there would be a 30 percent reduction in
precipitation across the globe in the ensuing months of a US-Russia huge
nuclear war.]{.underline} [This would lead to **[severe global food
shortages]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the researchers have warned. The
report also stated that **[[a cloud of smoke would envelope the entire
globe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [with up to 150 megatons of soot would be
dropped across the planet.]{.underline} The report warned: "[The use of
nuclear weapons in this manner by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Russia [would have **disastrous consequences
globally**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Researchers from Rugters University,
New Jersey, and the University of Colorado Boulder took examples from
forest fires, volcanic eruptions, and previous nuclear bomb detonations,
all of which have an impact on the planet's climate, to study how
exactly Earth would be impacted by a nuclear war -- and it would not be
good news. [The ash would cover the Northern Hemisphere in just one
week, with the whole planet being covered in a fortnight.]{.underline}
It would take a staggering three years for surface light to return to
just 40 percent of its pre-nuclear war levels. [The major planet climate
shift would cause "devastating" agricultural losses, and the Northern
Hemisphere could experience below freezing temperatures in the summer
months.]{.underline} The article read: "Nuclear winter, with below
freezing temperatures overmuch of the Northern Hemisphere during summer,
occurs because of a reduction of surface solar radiation due to smoke
lofted into the stratosphere."

HBisevac)

[New ultraprecise [measurements show]{.mark} that the **asteroid
[Bennu]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} a [**higher chance** than thought of
**impacting our planet**]{.mark}]{.underline} sometime in the next 300
years, [NASA says]{.underline}. For hundreds of millions of years, a
top-shaped rubble pile called Bennu has orbited the sun in relative
isolation. The asteroid, about a third of a mile wide at its equator,
poses no immediate threat to our planet. But hundreds of years from now,
there is a small chance that Bennu could slam into Earth. In a new study
published in the scientific journal Icarus, scientists used data from
[[NASA]{.mark}'s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft]{.underline} to make a precise
calculation of Bennu's orbit and its future proximity to our home
planet. The researchers then [[analyzed]{.mark} the [impact
hazard]{.mark}]{.underline} between now and the year 2300. [The study
[finds]{.mark}]{.underline} a 1-in-1,750 chance of a future collision
over the next three centuries---a slightly [[**higher probability** than
previously estimated]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nearly all of the riskiest
encounters with Bennu will occur in the late 2100s and early 2200s, with
the single likeliest impact coming on the afternoon of September 24,
2182. On that Tuesday, Bennu has about a 1-in-2,700 chance of hitting
Earth. The team---led by Davide Farnocchia, a navigation engineer at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory---reached its revised
[estimate]{.underline} by [pinpointing [Bennu's]{.mark} [distance
from]{.mark} Earth to within [about **seven feet at dozens of
times**]{.mark} between 2019 and 2020]{.underline}. That level of
precision is like measuring the distance between the Empire State
Building and the Eiffel Tower to within a few thousandths of an inch.
"[Bennu is by far the best characterized asteroid in the solar
system]{.underline}," says University of Arizona planetary scientist
Dante Lauretta, OSIRIS-REx's principal investigator and the study's
senior author. "We know where it's going to be over 100 years into the
future, within meters. [No other object in the solar system has that
level of **fidelity** to its **orbital solution**---even
Earth]{.underline}!"
