#### "The world might, in fact, be transformed into a human zoo, a zoo so intelligently managed that its inhabitants are not aware that they are there merely for the purposes of observation and experiment"[^1]

#### The zoo is vectoralist control -- the myth of history must be disenchanted as critical theories fall into reproduced sameness -- we can't go to the archive and call it truth. Increasing abstraction of commodification of information has produced a new class relation -- the vectoralist and hacker classes are a layer-on-top, a piece of information that must be considered to avoid total environmental collapse.

\"Capital is dead\", Introduction)//gideon

[Why is there so much resistance to]{.underline} even [thinking about
whether]{.underline} all [this is a component of a new mode of
production]{.underline}? I start in Chapter 1 with why **[we want to
believe this is capitalism even if we hate it]{.underline}**. If you
take a step back, this really does seem a bit odd. [Even its
opponents]{.underline} have [started to imagine that Capital is
eternal]{.underline}. Perhaps it's time to ask whether the concept of
[Capital]{.underline} has [ended up being]{.underline} rather [more of a
**theological** production than Marx would have intended]{.underline}.
Hence Capital is Dead proceeds along two lines at once. It makes a
minimally plausible case that the thesis of a new mode of production is
worth investigating, and at the same time it is a critical account of
how we got stuck trying to explain all emerging phenomena as if they
were always expressions of the same eternal essence of Capital. Most
**[Marxists]{.underline}** like to [think they have separated themselves
from religion]{.underline} [but]{.underline} have **[made a religion
of]{.underline}** this **[separation]{.underline}**.35 If Capital is to
function as a historical concept, then the question of how and when it
ends has to be an open one. Where we seem to have ended up is with a not
very logical but still emotionally compelling way of thinking: [since
communism has not prevailed, this must still be capitalism]{.underline}.
The reality and the language of the present are anchored in an imaginary
future. The challenge is to [disenchant this myth of
history]{.underline} without losing the ability to think of historical
time as having other possibilities.36 [Critical theories of the culture
industry tend to stop short of thinking through the extent to
which]{.underline} **[the production of critical theory itself is now a
minor genre within the culture industry]{.underline}**. 37 It has some
of the characteristic hallmarks: [a repetition of received
ideas]{.underline}, [narrative forms that resolve in predictable ways, a
culture of exegesis that reproduces sameness]{.underline}. **[Critical
theory becomes hypocritical theory]{.underline}**. And so in Chapter 1,
I try to combine the critical impetus of Marx with approaches to writing
drawn from the historic avant-gardes that attempt to break from such
habits, which treat writing as a more open-ended material practice.
Perhaps [the writing of critical theory texts is part of the same
information political economy as everything else.]{.underline} Perhaps
[the]{.underline} distinctive [property form of the information
commodity saturates such objects]{.underline} as it does so many other
things. Perhaps [treating the archive of such texts as the archive of
private property is part of the problem]{.underline}. In Chapter 1, I
advocate another relation to the archive, to writing, one advanced by
the situationists: détournment. It works and plays as if writing were a
practice of a literary communism.38 After looking at habits of belief
and practices of writing, Chapter 2 elaborates on the thought experiment
that this may not be capitalism any more, but something worse. Here I
restate in condensed form an argument I first made in A Hacker Manifesto
(2004), updated to take account of the further unfolding of the
tendencies of this peculiar mode of production.39 Here I assign its
features some temporary names: I call the emerging ruling class [the
vectoralist class]{.underline}, because their class power [derives from
ownership and control of the vector of information]{.underline}. The
vector of information includes the capacity [to transmit, store, and
process information. It is the material means for
assembling]{.underline} so-called [big data and realizing its predictive
potential]{.underline}. The vectoralist class owns and controls
[patents]{.underline}, which [preserve monopolies on]{.underline} these
[technologies]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} owns or [controls the
brands and celebrities that galvanize attention. It owns the logistics
and supply chains that keep information in its proprietary
stacks]{.underline}. One thing that is distinctive about an information
political economy is the way [it instrumentalizes difference rather than
sameness]{.underline}. The farmer and worker produce units of
commodities that are equivalent within their kind. What I call [the
hacker class has to produce difference out of sameness.]{.underline} It
has to [make information that has enough novelty to be recognizable as
intellectual property,]{.underline} a problem that landed property or
commercial property does not have. [By hacker class I mean everyone who
produces new information out of old information]{.underline}, and not
just people who code for a living[. Part of the struggle]{.underline} of
our time [is to see a **common class interest** in all kinds of
information making]{.underline}, whether in the sciences, technology,
media, culture, or art. [What we all have in common is producing new
information but not owning the means to realize its value]{.underline}.
And yet the way we go about this is not quite the same thing as labor,
just as being a worker is not quite the same thing as being a farmer. As
is much clearer from Marx's political writings than from Capital, [there
are always many subordinate classes, just as there can be more than one
ruling class]{.underline}.40 [Modes of production are multiple and
overlapping]{.underline}. Chapter 3 asks whether developments in the
forces of production changed the relations of production and threw up a
new kind of ruling class with different interests. But this is not a
story where the forces of production are outside of historical struggle
and simply develop on their own. On the contrary, [the forces of
production take a form determined by a series of class struggles as
well]{.underline}. Who are the agents to that struggle? What role do
scientists and engineers play? Could things have turned out otherwise?
To even ask this involves questions about the selective tradition within
which we think about the twentieth century. 41 [What we imagine
happened]{.underline}, and who we imagine are the committed writers who
struggled in and against it, [is a picture mutilated by the Cold
War]{.underline}. 42 [The scientific left was stripped from the
picture]{.underline}. [They were Communists]{.underline} or fellow
travelers. [Their legacy has been suppressed, even on the
left]{.underline}. Here I present [the current state of the forces of
production not as some]{.underline} supposedly [inevitable
outcome]{.underline} of the metaphysics of technics [but]{.underline} as
[the result of a lost struggle over the form of technology and the labor
of creating new information in **scientific and technical
fields**]{.underline}. The first time something like [a
transnational]{.underline} farmer, worker, and hacker
[alliance]{.underline} was even [posited]{.underline} was [in the
thirties.]{.underline} It [was subsumed into the global struggle against
fascism and into Soviet realpolitik]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it
[was defeated (on both sides) by the Cold War.]{.underline} [One of the
consequences]{.underline} of defeat [is the **unchecked acceleration**
of more and more **abstract forms of commodification**]{.underline},
reaching from land to labor to information. [The instrumentalization of
information enables]{.underline} all of [the earth to appear as a
resource to be mobilized under the control of information]{.underline},
but where that control is based on [information]{.underline} that
[treats everything]{.underline}, [including information itself, as a
commodity]{.underline}. This might not be the commodity in its classical
form, as Marx thought it in the middle of the nineteenth century. 43
**[The commodity form is not eternal]{.underline}**. Commodification now
means not the appearance of a world of things but the appearance of a
world of information about things, including information about every
possible future state of those things that can be extrapolated from a
quantitative modeling of information extracted from the flux of the
state of things, more or less in real time.44 [A commodity today
appears]{.underline} as [nothing but a vector]{.underline},
[as]{.underline} a [potential fulfilled through the interface of
your]{.underline} phone or tablet or [computer]{.underline}. Looking
closely at the forces of production is not quite the same thing as the
study of technology. The difference is that the former asks questions
about agency, and in particular class agency. 45 Chapter 4 brings us to
a broader consideration of questions of class. Here, we look at what
distinguishes Marxist approaches to class from other sociological
theories. Once we have a means of analyzing class not just as a category
but as forms of antagonism, we can ask whether [new]{.underline} kinds
of [class relations may be emerging]{.underline}. [A class
antagonism]{.underline} may arise [out of]{.underline} relations of
[property]{.underline}, [authority]{.underline}, [or
expertise]{.underline}.46 If we combine thinking about emerging forces
of production with attention to class, we can ask whether the
[production of information as a force of production]{.underline} also
**[modifies class relations]{.underline}**. The information vector is
clearly connected to new kinds of property, authority, and expertise.
While based in patent and copyright, intellectual property as a suite of
near private property rights in all kinds of novel information is a
relatively new development.47 The evolution of these legal forms both
responds to and further enables changes in the forces of production.
Information also gave rise to new kinds of authority. **[We just don't
live in Foucault's Panopticon. It's far worse.]{.underline}** Whole new
fields of expertise have emerged quite recently, reshaping the
university and turning [the university itself into a site for managing
risk in the production of intellectual property]{.underline}. 48 Chapter
4 is a slice through the social formation, showing its workings in cross
section. Chapter 5 is a speculation on its genesis. It always seems
strange to me that people who imagine they are thinking like Marxists
offer a strictly idealist view of recent history: everything has changed
because of ideas, and those ideas are "neoliberal." These then become
policy and law through the agency of political actors.49 This seems to
me to betray every last principle of a materialist view of history. The
irony is that in order to think a materialist history in a really quite
"orthodox" way, one is forced to think in a heretical manner in relation
to received ideas on the intellectual left. The very same forces of
production that enable this unprecedented mobilization of the world in
the service of control through information also enable a science of the
earth which shows conclusively that [continuing to misvalue the whole of
the world can't go on]{.underline}. Sooner or later (but probably
[soon]{.underline}er), **[it will crash the whole climate system of the
planet]{.underline}**.50 Chapter 6 looks for ways to think about how
[the transformation of Capital]{.underline} beyond itself, [into
Vector]{.underline}, [comes in contact with]{.underline} the very thing
it lacks the means to properly know[: the earth as the home from which
it has expelled us]{.underline}. There are two classic ways to think
about capitalism being superseded by another mode of production. [Either
capitalism accelerates]{.underline} its movement [to the point of
qualitative transformation]{.underline}; [or the
proletariat]{.underline} that it produces as its own antagonist [negates
it from within]{.underline}.51 The problem is that [both of these are
merely social theories]{.underline}, or at best, social-technical
theories. [Neither puts history]{.underline} back [in the
context]{.underline} of natural history, and in the era [of the
Anthropocene]{.underline}, of [climate disruption and much
else]{.underline}, that is the **[information]{.underline}** that
**[must be included in our thinking]{.underline}** if it is to be at all
timely. 52 Chapter 6 adds two other kinds of historical narration into
the mix. The first extrapolates from natural history, looking for ways
we can learn about forms of organization of matter, energy, and
information that are adaptable and enduring. [Extrapolation is not
reductionist, its key proposition is that very different kinds of form
are possible at different scales of organization]{.underline}.
Extrapolation opens the door to creative and speculative ways of
producing collaborative knowledge across very different fields and
assembling corresponding social movements. [It's a way for the hacker
class to think and act as a class, producing]{.underline} not only
[collaborative knowledge]{.underline} but also experimental prototypes
of [another way of life]{.underline}. [The counterpoint]{.underline} to
this [is]{.underline} what I call [inertia]{.underline}. [How is it that
despite all the evidence that it is on a suicide mission]{.underline},
**[the current mode of production keeps accelerating toward
failure]{.underline}**? **[Why won't it change course]{.underline}**?
Where extrapolation stresses the possible connections between natural
history and social history, inertia stresses the difference. [We act in
and against a world that remains other to us]{.underline}. [Reduced to
**nothing but users**]{.underline}**,** and [our actions forced into the
commodity form]{.underline}, [our collective work and play produces a
world over and against us]{.underline}, one [that]{.underline} massively
[persists in its own habits of functioning]{.underline}.53 Worse,
[collective]{.underline} human [labor]{.underline} made a world for a
ruling class that [keeps making]{.underline} not only itself but us [in
its image]{.underline}. Extrapolation opens exciting possibilities for
thinking and acting collaboratively to build another civilization, here
in the ruins of this one. [Inertia is a sobering reminder of how hard
that is going to be]{.underline}. I conclude Capital is Dead with a
commentary on Raoul Peck's film The Young Karl Marx (2017). What I
stress there is how [Marx]{.underline} and his closest comrades [changed
the language and style of the progressive movements of their
time]{.underline}. T[hey freed themselves from received ideas, from
selective tradition,]{.underline} even [from radical selective
tradition]{.underline}. In vulgar terms: [they were punks]{.underline}.
**[Radicals can be the most conservative of people when it comes to
textology, or faith in the exegesis of the written word from the archive
as a form of knowledge]{.underline}**.54 [We have to produce and defend
knowledge]{.underline} in the face of a dominant ideology [that insists
that those texts are either useless or dangerous]{.underline}. (That it
is an ideology is clear from its insistence in these incompatible
faults). Wanting [to **move on from those cherished texts** is assumed
to be an attack on what they stood for]{.underline}. Sometimes the
moment comes to summon your inner punk rock goddess and **[do things
differently]{.underline}**. **[Make some noise]{.underline}**. **[Our
knowledge-production methods might have become a bit too genteel for the
times]{.underline}**. It may at least be a better way to channel one's
rage than ordering Patti Smith albums on Amazon. Chapter 7 defends
vulgar Marxism for its closeness to the everyday and to emerging
technics of cultural and critical production. Here I look at four kinds
of vulgar thinking, two from (or about) the twenties and two from the
sixties. These are vulgarians who know something about how developments
in the forces of production change the space of possibility for daily
life and daily struggle. Unlike more genteel kinds of critical theory,
they detect mutations in historical forms because they are not bound to
residual and archaic forms of cultural work. They are already multiple
and diverse, in terms of race, sex, sexuality, as the vulgar includes
all of those excluded or marginalized within genteel institutions. [For
years I was]{.underline} one of what the so-called alt-right calls [a
"cultural Marxist]{.underline}," [interested]{.underline} mostly [in
what happens in the political and cultural superstructures of modern
society, rather than in the technical and economic base.]{.underline}
However, [trying to understand culture will lead]{.underline} you
[to]{.underline} understanding [media]{.underline}, which will lead you
to try [to]{.underline} figure out some things about
[technology]{.underline}. Then it turns out that the genteel forms of
**[Western Marxist thinking]{.underline}** taught in universities for
several generations [now are **not good at understanding how the forces
of production actually work**]{.underline}.55 That requires some actual
technical knowledge and experience, or at least a willingness to concede
that others may know about such things and to learn from them. The
production of [counterhegemonic knowledge can]{.underline} really [only
be comradely and collaborative]{.underline}.56 We have to [start
from]{.underline} the [tensions]{.underline} apparent in the present and
freely adapt the textual resources from the past to that situation. This
might work better than starting with fidelity to the texts or events of
the past and ignoring anything in the present that does not conform to
them.57 I read Peck's film as celebrating a will to transform even this
closely cherished radical language in the interests of comprehending a
present historical time in terms that enable it to appear as actionable,
transformable. In that sense, it's a work of art that should give us
courage to not just repeat the received ideas, even those of dear old
Karl, but to embark on the collaborative production of a knowledge of
the present that might help lead us out if it.

#### Edward Joseph Snowden is an American former computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency when he was an employee and subcontractor. His disclosures revealed numerous illegal global surveillance programs, many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.[^2]

#### Snowden gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists[^3]

#### Snowden revealed a system worse than capitalism -- a self-consuming, ever accelerating system eats our brains and bodies. Data asymmetry from internet searches, DNA lookups, banks, retail, and mapping software aggregates a vectoral power that is at the root of technological problems, financialization, neoliberalism, and biopolitics. The NSA understands this relation and gathered it into a program of control. This cannot be understood with genteel high theory -- The 20^th^ century is long gone -- modernity must be deconstructed through a new lens

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 2: Capitalism---or Worse?)//gideon

So how is this worse than capitalism? [The vectoral infrastructure
throws]{.underline} all of [t**he world into**]{.underline} **[the
engine of commodification]{.underline}**, meanwhile **[modifying the
commodity form itself]{.underline}**. [There is nothing that can't
be]{.underline} tagged and [captured through information]{.underline}
about it and considered a variable in the simulations that drive
resource extraction and processing.26 Quite simply, [we have run out of
world to commodify.]{.underline} And now [commodification
can]{.underline} only [cannibalize its own means of
existence]{.underline}, both natural and social. It's like that Marx
Brothers film where [the train runs out of firewood, so the
carriages]{.underline} themselves [have to be]{.underline} hacked to
pieces and [fed to the fire]{.underline} to keep it moving, [until
nothing but the]{.underline} bare [bogies are left]{.underline}.27 It is
worse also in that rather than some acephalous multitude, they are
complex class alliances and conflicts at play. 28 The trickiest part of
it is the politics of [the hacker class]{.underline}, which after all is
the class most of us here reading and writing this stuff belong to. Yes,
it appears as a "privileged" class, among those whom Bruce Robbins calls
the beneficiaries of global relations of exploitation.29 And it is a
class that [has a]{.underline} very [hard time thinking its common
interests]{.underline}, [because the kinds of new information its
various subfractions produce are all so different]{.underline}. We have
a hard time thinking what the writer and the scientist and artist and
the engineer have in common. Well, [the vectoral class does not have
that problem]{.underline}. What all of us make is [intellectual
property]{.underline}, which from its point of view [is]{.underline} as
[equivalent and]{.underline} as [tradable]{.underline} as pink goo. [The
hacker class experiences]{.underline} extremes of a [**winner-take-all**
outcome of its efforts]{.underline}. On the one hand, [fantastic careers
and]{.underline} the spoils of some simulation of the old bourgeois
lifestyle; on the other hand, [precarious]{.underline} and part-time
[work]{.underline}, [start-ups that go bust]{.underline}, and the making
routine of our jobs by new algorithms---designed by others of our very
own class. [The hacker class]{.underline} was supposed to be a
privileged one, shielded from proletarianization by its creativity and
technical skill. But it too [can be made casual and
precarious]{.underline}. A controversial ad campaign for the website
[Fiverr embodied]{.underline} all [these contradictions]{.underline}. It
played on the desire to quit one's lousy job and become a boss, by
offering the pleasure of subjecting others to the tyranny one feels as a
precarious creative or technical employee these days. [The ads promise a
way to hire]{.underline} versions of your old self who are
"[doers]{.underline}." The most notorious ad showed a black and white
picture of a hollow-cheeked, sad-eyed young woman staring directly at
the viewer: "You eat a coffee for lunch. You follow through on your
follow through. Sleep deprivation is your drug of choice," it reads,
concluding: "You might be a doer." Another slogan was "Nothing like a
safe, reliable paycheck to crush your soul." And "How much did you make
for your boss today?" The one I most often saw defaced read "White
Collars Can Come With Leashes." The slogans appear under pictures of [a
"diverse" workforce]{.underline}, of course: the algorithm is in theory
very **[tolerant about who it exploits]{.underline}**. [The old dream of
labor, that it could organize itself, is supposed to be
dead]{.underline}. **[There can be no dream of the hacker class to
self-organize]{.underline}** in any way, whether like labor or in some
other form. Such desires are unspeakable, even if they keep erupting in
all sorts of interesting ways. Sanctioned desire is neatly summed up in
the image and slogan of a cellphone company: "Boss Revolution." The
image is of a raised fist, with a cellphone in it, in red[. **The only
desire** permissible **is to become a boss**]{.underline}, like Don
Draper. [This has not stopped]{.underline} some interesting and
promising signs of hacker self-organization in technical and creative
industries, from the [unionization of creatives at Vice Media to the
Google walkout to refusal to work on border control or military projects
across the tech industry]{.underline}. 30 Baby steps, to be sure; it is
always a tough argument to propose common interests among subordinate
classes. [Counter-hegemony is hard. Hackers]{.underline}, like workers
or farmers, [are distracted by]{.underline} particular and [local
interests]{.underline}. As with other subordinate classes, [class
consciousness is rare]{.underline} among hackers. [Most]{.underline} of
us [are]{.underline} rather [reactionary]{.underline}, even in the
nontechnical trades. But then [class consciousness is always a rare and
difficult thing]{.underline}. Unlike other identities, [it has to be
argued contrary to appearances]{.underline}. The feeling of [belonging
to a class rarely extends beyond appearances]{.underline}. It appears
that one is a "creative" or working in "tech," for example. There could
be a myriad of such classes. As we shall see in Chapter 4, this [self-
understanding of class restricts itself to appearances and
masks]{.underline} not an essence but [a structural question as to how
one's efforts end up being commodified and who reaps]{.underline} most
of [the benefit]{.underline} of that. The received ideas within which
one is asked to think about one's identity don't help when it comes to
thinking how one is located within an information political economy, one
where the hidden side of appearances is not eternal essence, just things
one usually doesn't see---the forces of production. [To come into an
awareness of class is to speak another language]{.underline}. It is to
**[refuse the terms that are given and seek other terms]{.underline}**,
other concepts. This can be difficult. I can tell you from experience:
the American college students that I meet cannot even pronounce
[bourgeoisie]{.underline}, let alone conceptualize it. Everything it
once meant culturally [has evaporated]{.underline}. [The outward
signs]{.underline} and styles [of the ruling class don't look
bourgeois]{.underline}. Our newstyle overlords only wear suits when
called before Congress; otherwise [they wear discreetly expensive
t-shirts]{.underline}. You don't see them cutting ribbons at factory
openings. They don't preach hard work and thrift; they preach
creativity, mindfulness, and ethical consumption. The bourgeois culture
with which generations of Marxist aesthetics had a love---hate
relationship is effectively extinct. The ruling class is not what it
used to be. Maybe it needs another name. What is even harder is to name
those whose location in the political economy of information is the
making of new information. It isn't exactly labor, as it's not the same
thing every day; it's a different thing every day. [Output is not
quantifiable]{.underline} in increments, although that won't stop the
vectoralist class from trying. One popular attempt to describe them (us)
was as [the creative class?]{.underline}31 More radical approaches have
called what we do immaterial labor or postfordist labor, and us the
cognitariat?32 But [there's something]{.underline} a bit [mystifying
about the language of creativity]{.underline}, something a bit idealist
about the immaterial, something backward looking about just adding a
modifier, and something of a rationalist bias in the category of
cognition, given that the management of feelings can be part of our job
description, too.33 [I opted to call us the hacker class. Twenty years
ago, that was]{.underline} perhaps too [romantic]{.underline} a term, on
the border of legality, outside the logic of commodification.34 [Now it
has]{.underline} more exclusively [criminal associations]{.underline}.
If anything, **[it's an index of how much the vectoralist class has
succeeded]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} all but
[inconceivable]{.underline} now [that there could be an]{.underline}
open-ended, playful, [experimental approach to making the
new]{.underline} appear [out of the old in]{.underline} techniques of
[information that would not be]{.underline} entirely [contained with the
commodification and control of the information vector]{.underline}. But
just [as the industrial working class retained a utopian feeling about
what labor should be]{.underline} like from craft labor, so too [it is
possible to hold]{.underline} onto [a feeling about what it's like to
make elegance appear that wasn't there before]{.underline} with a
technique for transforming information, and to do it on one's own time,
[with one's own goals and objectives]{.underline}.35 [That is what it
might mean to hack]{.underline}. Some of the more compelling scenes in
both Mad Men and Halt and Catch Fire try to find a televisual language
for these joyful moments, caught though they are, as the narrative arc
reminds us, within the commodification of information. [To think that
one's class is the hacker class might]{.underline} now [be]{.underline}
not unlike [repurposing]{.underline} the word queer, or any of the other
negatively charged terms that those so designated reclaim with
pride---just [as Marx and Engels reclaimed the word
communist]{.underline} from its denouncers in the opening poetic gambit
of the Manifesto. [That was]{.underline} an artful bit of
**[détournement]{.underline}**. They refunctioned found language from
the common store, deleted false meaning, pasted in fresh ones. **[To
clear a space for thought is to work in and against language, to put
some pressure on it]{.underline}**. What if we took a more daring,
modernist, defamiliarizing approach to writing theory? [What if we asked
of theory as a genre that it be as interesting]{.underline}, as strange,
[as]{.underline} poetically or [narratively rich as]{.underline} we ask
our [other kinds of literature]{.underline} to be? [What if we treated
it **not as high theory**, with pretentions to legislate or
interpret]{.underline} other genres, [**but as low theory**,
as]{.underline} something [**vulgar, common**, even]{.underline} a bit
[rude]{.underline} ---[having no greater or lesser claim to speak of the
world than any other]{.underline}?36 It might be more fun to read. It
might tell us something strange about the world[. It might]{.underline},
just might, [enable us to act]{.underline} in the world otherwise. A
world in which the old faith in History is no more, but where there are
histories that still might be made--- in a pinch. [The end of the
dominance of capitalism]{.underline} as a mode of production [is not a
subject that has received]{.underline} much useful
[attention]{.underline}. [For its devotees, it has no end]{.underline},
as it is itself the end of History. 37 [For its enemies, it can end only
in Communism]{.underline}. If Communism---a state that exists mostly in
the imaginal realm, [always deferred into the future]{.underline}---has
not prevailed, then this by definition must still be the reign of
Capital. Let's pause for a moment over the ideological freight attached
to this poetic conceit and its consequences: **[the present is
defined]{.underline}** mostly **[in terms of a hoped-for negation of
it]{.underline}**. [Some theology]{.underline}! [If capitalism is to be
of any use as a historical concept]{.underline}, then [the question of
its end has to remain]{.underline} an [open]{.underline} one. The
thought experiment as to whether it may already have been surpassed by
another dominant mode ought at least to be one that can be posed. [The
concept of Capital is theological]{.underline} precisely to [the extent
that questions of its]{.underline} possible [surpassing]{.underline} by
other exploitative modes of production [remain off limits]{.underline}.
How then can a concept of capitalism be returned to its histories? By
abandoning the duality of its essence and appearance. [Theories of the
eternal quality of Capital's essence]{.underline}, its unity and
identity through time, tend to [focus on the]{.underline} analysis of
the [relations of production]{.underline}. One can extract from Marx's
Capital a quite remarkable theoretical armature that appears in the
negative through the critique of the theological concepts of bourgeois
political economy. This conceptual armature is so robust that [there are
few phenomena that resist interpretation as surface appearances of these
concepts when posited as a hidden essence. Two things **slip from
view**]{.underline} in this procedure. First, [that **the bourgeois
political economy**]{.underline} that Marx took as the object of
critique [i**s now itself a museum piece**]{.underline}.38 Second, that
in this focus on the relations of production, **[the forces of
production receive very little attention]{.underline}**. [We
don't]{.underline} spend [enough time on how the brain-fryer
is]{.underline} a [different]{.underline} machine [from the meat
grinder]{.underline}. This is something of a problem, as surely the
dynamism of those forces of production under capitalism was one of the
salient points of the theory in the first place. But [where **the
relations of production can be understood theoretically**, **the forces
of production cannot**]{.underline}. [They **don't lend themselves to an
abstract, conceptual overview by a master thinker within a genteel high
theory**. They can]{.underline} really [only be known through the
**collaborative production** of a critical theory sharing the
experiences of many fields]{.underline}. [That would include those with
a **knowledge of information technology, artificial intelligence, supply
chain management, material science, computational biology**, and much
else]{.underline} besides. [We're]{.underline} way [past]{.underline}
the [steam engines]{.underline} that Marx was sketching in his
notebooks.39 Is it not possible, then, that there have been sufficient
transformations in the forces of production to break out of the fetters
of a strictly capitalist mode of production? There are two versions of
this question. One is looking for a theological justification for this
appearance of something new as finally putting an end to the more
troubling aspects of capitalism for vectoralist class apologetics. But
the more salient version of the question might be to [ask whether what
has emerged]{.underline}, in addition to and laminated on top of a
capitalist mode of production, [is something]{.underline} qualitatively
[different]{.underline}, but [which generates new forms of class
domination]{.underline}, new forms of the extraction of surplus, even
new kinds of class formation. The emergence of [information as a
material force of production]{.underline} looked for a while like it
[might escape the confines of existing relations of production
and]{.underline} that it could [negate existing property
forms]{.underline}. (I return to this topic in Chapter 4). It looked for
a while as though [the one thing that]{.underline} really [could form
the basis of the commons was information]{.underline}. [It blew apart
the]{.underline} old [culture industry]{.underline}. Producers of
information started to think not just about their craft or trade
interests but about a class interest. Or so it looked early in the
twenty-first century when I wrote A Hacker Manifesto. What I did not
anticipate was the emergence of a whole other technique for the capture
of creation. While there are still elements among the ruling class that
want to confine creation within ever stricter forms of private property,
some took the opposite tack. [Rather than police or restrict free
creation]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} other [strategy]{.underline}
[was to move its capture to a]{.underline} more [abstract
level]{.underline}. [The production of information can be
**outsourced**]{.underline} to free labor, [to people who work but
**need not**]{.underline} even [**be paid**, and the aggregate value of
their]{.underline} production of [information can then be]{.underline}
captured and treated as a resource that can be
**[monetized]{.underline}**.40 [This]{.underline} [new]{.underline} kind
of [ruling class does not appropriate]{.underline} a quantity of
[surplus value so much as **exploit an asymmetry of
information**]{.underline}. **[It gives]{.underline}**, sometimes even
**[as a gift]{.underline}**, **[access to]{.underline}** the location of
a piece of **[information]{.underline}** [for which you are
**searching**]{.underline}.41 [Or]{.underline} it lets you [assemble
your own]{.underline} **[social network]{.underline}**. [Or]{.underline}
it lets you [perform a]{.underline} particular **[financial
transaction]{.underline}**. [Or]{.underline} it [gives]{.underline} you
**[coordinates]{.underline}** on the planet and what can be found at
that location. [Or]{.underline} it will even [tell you]{.underline} some
things [about your]{.underline} own **[DNA]{.underline}**.
[Or]{.underline} it will [provide a]{.underline} logistical
[**infrastructure**]{.underline} for your small business. [But while you
get that]{.underline} [little]{.underline} piece of
[information]{.underline}, **[this ruling class gets all of that
information in]{.underline}** the **[aggregate]{.underline}**. **[It
exploits the asymmetry between the little you know and the aggregate it
knows]{.underline}**---an aggregate it collects [based on information
you were]{.underline} [obliged to "volunteer]{.underline}." In practice,
[this]{.underline} emergent [ruling class]{.underline} of our time
[insists on the confinement of]{.underline} particular acts of [creation
within the property form and access to collective creative
activity]{.underline}, [from which to harvest information]{.underline}
in the aggregate. [This is the vectoralist class.]{.underline} If the
capitalist class owns the means of production, **[the vectoralist class
owns the vectors of information]{.underline}**. They own the extensive
[vectors of **communication**]{.underline}, which **[traverse
space]{.underline}**. They own the intensive [vectors of
**computation**,]{.underline} which **[accelerate time]{.underline}**.
They own the **[copyrights]{.underline}**, the [**patents**,
and]{.underline} the **[trademarks]{.underline}** that
**[capture]{.underline}** attention or assign
**[ownership]{.underline}** to novel techniques. They own the
[logistic]{.underline} [systems]{.underline} that [manage]{.underline}
and monitor [the disposition and movement of any resource]{.underline}.
They own the [financial instruments that stand in for]{.underline} the
[value]{.underline} of every resource and that can be put out on markets
to crowdsource the possible value of every possible future combination
of those resources. They own [the algorithms that rank and
sort]{.underline} and assign particular [information]{.underline} in
particular circumstances. [This **vectoralist class comes to
dominate**]{.underline} [not just subordinate classes, but]{.underline}
**[other ruling classes as well]{.underline}**. Just as capital came to
dominate landed property, subsuming its control over land in a more
abstract and fungible property form, so too [the vectoralist class has
**subsumed and outflanked capital**]{.underline} in a more abstract
form. The capitalist class finds itself at a disadvantage. [Owning the
means of production]{.underline}, labor materialized into capital in the
sense of plant and equipment, [is]{.underline} a [rigid and
long-term]{.underline} investment. [Owning]{.underline} and controlling
[the vector]{.underline}, the hack of new information materialized into
patents, copyrights, brands, proprietary logistics. It [is more
abstract, flexible, adaptive]{.underline}. It is not more rational, but
it is more abstract. The vectoralist class monopolizes the crossroads
where information traffics, feeding like Michel Serres's parasite on the
buzz of information and noise at crucial junctures.42 The most obvious
aspect of vectoral rule in everyday life is its monopoly of attention,
although it is not reducible to this. As Yves Citton notes,
[in]{.underline} a world awash in [digital data]{.underline}, [what is
rare is]{.underline} the [attention]{.underline} paid to it.43
[**Commanding attention** through the ownership and control of brands,
celebrities and media "properties" is the]{.underline} public face, the
[**disintegrating spectacle,** of vectoral economy.]{.underline} 44 In
part, [this descends from]{.underline} what was formerly [the culture
industry]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} it is [no longer an industry
apart, commodified leisure. It's now integrated into the whole of
production and consumption.]{.underline} This brief sketch of the
supersession of capitalism as a dominant mode has the advantage of
enabling many of the features of contemporary life that are often
treated as separate to appear as aspects of the same historical
development. [The **rise of technology, financialization, neoliberalism,
and biopolitics** appear as **effects of the same transformation** of
the forces of production]{.underline}, putting pressure on the relations
of production, to the point where what bursts forth is a new ruling
class formation. In the usual historical narrative, [by the end of the
seventies]{.underline}, the forces of [labor]{.underline} had [fought
capital to a standstill]{.underline} in the overdeveloped world.45 In
this story, [financialization and neoliberalism come to the rescue.
**But how**?]{.underline} [**What** material means **made
financialization** even **possible**]{.underline}? What underlying
social forces enabled neoliberal ideas to even appear plausible as
policy instruments? [Why does this **coincide with the**]{.underline}
apparent **[birth of "tech"]{.underline}** as an
**[industry]{.underline}** sector? In the thought experiment I am
sketching, all of [these developments fit together]{.underline} in a
novel way. [The capitalist class was searching for a way out of
the]{.underline} impasse of confronting the [demands of
labor]{.underline} at a time when improvements of the old means of
production no longer yielded much by way of a productivity increase.
[The capitalist class]{.underline} thought it [found a way out by
**replacing labor with the vector**]{.underline} and escaping along it.
**[Globalization, deindustrialization, and outsourcing]{.underline}**
would [enable]{.underline} it [to be **free from the power of labor to
block the flows of production**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} same
information [vector]{.underline} [would enable]{.underline} not just a
more abstract and flexible kind of production, but also of
[consumption]{.underline}, [through the financialization of everyday
life]{.underline}.46 Workers as producers found their jobs had moved
elsewhere; [workers as consumers found their purchasing power
restored]{.underline}--- at least [temporarily]{.underline}. **[Here's
the twist]{.underline}**: [what]{.underline} at first [appeared to
assist capital to defeat labor]{.underline} in the overdeveloped world
[was]{.underline} also **[a defeat for capital]{.underline}**. The
[novel]{.underline} forces of [production]{.underline} that enabled this
outflanking of labor [became]{.underline} themselves the new
[dominant]{.underline} forces of production. [Power over the value chain
moves]{.underline} from the ownership and control of the means of
production [to ownership and control of the vectors]{.underline} of
information. Whole new industries arose, as did whole new
corporations---the so-called tech sector. But actually [**all
corporations** become]{.underline} increasingly **[organized
around]{.underline}** the ownership and control of
**[information]{.underline}**. [Control over]{.underline} the value
chain through ownership of the [information]{.underline} vector
[extends]{.underline} even **[into life itself]{.underline}**. This is
not the least reason, incidentally, [that it is no longer helpful to
posit the vitalism of living labor against capital as dead
labor]{.underline}. 47 [Not capital but **the vector enters the flesh**
and commands it]{.underline}, and not just as meat, but also **[as
information]{.underline}**, [through **monitoring**]{.underline} its
states, through **[modifying]{.underline}** its functions [with
drugs]{.underline} that alter chemical signals, through [**patenting**
aspects of life as design]{.underline}.48 [What is at stake is neither a
bios nor a polis but a regime of property in information extending into
the organism]{.underline}. [The novel forces of production]{.underline}
as they have emerged in our time [are]{.underline} [also forces of
reproduction]{.underline} [and]{.underline} forces of
[circulation]{.underline}. [The power of the vectoralist class is
not]{.underline} [cognitive]{.underline}; [nor]{.underline} is it a
power over the general [intellect]{.underline}.49 [It
thrives]{.underline} just as well [on noise]{.underline}, on
volatility[, on bad information as it does on]{.underline} any kind of
[intelligence or reason]{.underline}.50 [It reaches]{.underline} just as
[far into]{.underline} the [corporeality and]{.underline} even
[sexuality]{.underline} of the human as it does into the intellect.51
[The]{.underline} forms of [**artificial computational order** it is
creating are **not extensions or imitations of human cognition** but
**something else entirely**]{.underline}. 52 [One **cannot interpret**
the]{.underline} strangeness of this mode of [production
**using**]{.underline} the received **[hermeneutic conceptual
categories]{.underline}**, derived as they are [from a critique of the
relations of production of nineteenth-century steam-powered
capitalism]{.underline}. Indeed, one sees now how incomplete Marx's
critique was and remains. Even his critical understanding of capitalism
is still thinking capitalism metaphorically as like a giant,
dysfunctional steam engine, set to blow at any moment from unregulated
internal pressures.53 **[Marx is not able to think critically about
information]{.underline}** in the contemporary sense of the concept
because it is not one that the forces of production of his time have yet
produced. Marx found what was absent in the theories of Capital in his
time. He lifted the veil between exchange and production and found the
exploited labor that makes it. He wrote the heresy that Capital is dead
labor--- congealed pink goo---and he went on to write from the point of
view of the labor that capital exploits. So: [let's go looking for what
is absent in]{.underline} theories of both [Capital and
information]{.underline} in our time. Let's find [that peculiar class
who own and control information]{.underline}. Let's find [the exploited
class or classes that make it and are subjected to it]{.underline}. In
vulgar terms: [the capitalist class eats our bodies, **the vectoralist
class eats our brains**]{.underline}. Returning this thought experiment
to the present, one might then be able to think the historical
specificity of the contemporary moment. This, after all, was
[Marx's]{.underline} great achievement. He [thought his
moment]{.underline}. His present did not look to him like his past. It
had novel features that called into being concepts adequate to the
situation. Which leaves us with the paradoxical and provocative thought
that [any theory in which **the present appears as**]{.underline} in
essence [the same]{.underline} as the past of **[Marx's
time]{.underline}**, only different in a few matters of appearance,
**[can't]{.underline}** really **[be]{.underline}** a
"**[Marxist]{.underline}**" one, as [such fidelity is]{.underline}
necessarily [a betrayal of his achievement]{.underline}. Debord: "And
**[theories are made to die in the war of time]{.underline}**."54
Perhaps [we can **leave**]{.underline} such **[theological questions to
the faithful]{.underline}**, who are in any case an embattled and
diminished band. [Instead]{.underline}, here is a research agenda: [what
are the **current forces of production**]{.underline}, and how can they
be understood (in a preliminary way) under a modest set of concepts?
[How do those]{.underline} forces of production [give rise to
contemporary forms of class power]{.underline}, and [how has that
power]{.underline} in turn [shaped]{.underline} the particular form
[those forces of production]{.underline} have taken? [At what points
might the subordinate classes,]{.underline} obliged to live within the
world those forces of production make in the interests of those ruling
class, [be able to assert agency]{.underline} and autonomy? **[What
other world is still possible]{.underline}**, given the damage this
general economy has done to the world, with the means that it has
hitherto developed?55

#### On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of State revoked his passport. Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum.[^4]

#### The vector consumes all -- US intellectual property laws allows the extraction of value from the hacker class by commodifying creativity and controlling freedom, pushing the world to extinction.

It is a strange thing, this mode of production. What Bernal and Richta
called [the scientific and technological revolution]{.underline} really
[did happen]{.underline}, and [in the West, not the East. But it was the
product of a]{.underline} weird kind of "[socialism]{.underline}." [It
came out of a]{.underline} **[wartime socialization of scientific and
technical power]{.underline}**. [Scientists and engineers]{.underline},
in academic and corporate laboratories, [**cooperated** with each
other]{.underline}. Their **[innovations weren't immediately patented,
they were shared]{.underline}**. [That laid the groundwork for
postwar]{.underline} developments in the [forces of
production]{.underline}. To some extent this "[socialism"
continued]{.underline}, [under the]{.underline} auspices of the
[Pentagon's Advanced Projects Research Agency]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} among other things [funded key work in
computation]{.underline}.52 If there was [a key innovation that came out
of this]{.underline} strange [western statesocialist
military---industrial complex]{.underline}, it [was **the technics of
information**]{.underline}. It took a while for the pieces to come
together. By the early twenty-first century, the odd thing is that the
[state-socialist sponsored scientific and technical effort]{.underline},
[made]{.underline} first [to defeat the Axis powers and]{.underline}
then to defeat [the Soviets]{.underline}, en[ded up being a way to
compete with Japanese industry]{.underline} abroad [and]{.underline} to
[defeat the working classes]{.underline} at home. [A]{.underline}
basically [**socialized research program** became **the means to
build**]{.underline} an infrastructure---what Benjamin Bratton calls the
stack, what I call **[the vector]{.underline}**---[for **a systematic
and global privatization of objects, subjects, and**]{.underline} the
**[information]{.underline}** in between them.53 [That]{.underline}
**[this was not an inevitable destiny]{.underline}** [of science and
technology]{.underline} [was masked by the **suppression of critical and
dissenting voices** among scientists themselves]{.underline}.
[Bernalism]{.underline}, or the Social Relations of Science movement
more broadly, [was **shut down in** the **red scare politics** of the
Cold War]{.underline}. In [the]{.underline} relative [absence of
that]{.underline} strand of [thinking]{.underline}, the available
[stories]{.underline} for accounting for this historical period have
[lacked]{.underline} a sense of the [class conflicts]{.underline}
internal to these new forces of production [and the extent to which they
were likely to transform capitalism]{.underline}, such as it was in the
late twentieth century, [into something else]{.underline}. [The
story]{.underline} that is [best known about science and technology
during the war is the Manhattan project and the atom bomb]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} perhaps [it was not the only piece]{.underline} of the
puzzle [that mattered]{.underline}. [The war in the Pacific
was]{.underline} probably [the biggest logistical operation ever
conducted]{.underline} up until that time. Robert
[McNamara]{.underline}, [who would]{.underline} later [run]{.underline}
the [Ford]{.underline} Motor Company and then the Pentagon, [was an
apprentice logistics]{.underline} [expert]{.underline} during the war.
[These were pioneering efforts to control]{.underline} the movement and
combination of incredibly [complex arrays of resources]{.underline}
across vast territories [using communication and
computation]{.underline}.54 [What started]{.underline} out [as the means
to beat the Axis powers]{.underline}, and then contain the Soviets, and
then to compete with Japanese industry, [was]{.underline} in the end
[the means to **globalize production**]{.underline}, [**exploit**
the]{.underline} newly available **[cheap labor of]{.underline}** the
People's Republic of **[China]{.underline}**, [and
**destroy**]{.underline} the power of **[organized labor]{.underline}**
within Italy, the United States, and [throughout]{.underline} much of
[the overdeveloped world]{.underline}. But there's a paradox attendant
to this. C[apital thought it was using]{.underline} some
[new]{.underline} kinds of [communication and computational power in its
struggle with labor, but]{.underline} in the end [the **capitalist
class** too ended up being **subsumed under that power**]{.underline}.
The capitalist class became a [subsidiary]{.underline} ruling class [to
the vectoralist class]{.underline}. **[Capital is dead; the Vector
lives]{.underline}**. [A capitalist class owns the means of
production]{.underline}, the means of organizing labor. **[A vectoralist
class owns the means of organizing the means of
production]{.underline}**. [The vector has a double form]{.underline}:
the form of vector [along which information is to be routed]{.underline}
(**[the extensive vector]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline} the form of
the vector [along which information can be stored and
computed]{.underline} (**[the intensive vector]{.underline}**). [A
vectoralist class]{.underline} also [owns and **controls the production
process** through **patents, copyrights, brands, trademarks, proprietary
logistical processes**]{.underline}, and the like. It is curious that if
one looks at the world's biggest [corporations]{.underline} these days,
a lot of their [power and property is in vectoral form]{.underline}.
[Many]{.underline} of them **[don't]{.underline}** actually **[make the
things they sell]{.underline}**. [They **control the production process
by owning and controlling the information**]{.underline}. Even when they
do still make the stuff, a quite remarkable amount of the
[valuation]{.underline} of the company [comes from portfolios of
**intellectual property**]{.underline}, or [proprietary **data about
their customers**]{.underline}, and so on. [Capital was subsumed under a
more abstract form of technical power]{.underline}. When considering the
vectoralist class, then, three further points suggest themselves. First,
[it seems to be able to extract value]{.underline} not just from labor
but [from]{.underline} what Tiziana Terranova calls **[free
labor]{.underline}**. 55 Even when you just stroll down the street, [the
phone]{.underline} in your purse or pocket [is reporting
data]{.underline} back [to some vectoralist entity]{.underline}. The
vectoralist class seems to be able to extract revenue out of qualitative
information in much the same way as banks extract it out of quantitative
information. Perhaps the exercise of power through control of
quantitative and qualitative information is characteristic of the same
ruling class. Second, [the vectoralist class subordinates]{.underline}
the old kind of ruling class, [a capitalist class]{.underline}, in the
same way that capitalists subordinated the old landlord class that
subjected rural production to commodi-fication through ground rent. In
that sense, [the rise of a vectoralist]{.underline} class
[is]{.underline} a [similar]{.underline} and subsequent development
[within intra-ruling class dynamics]{.underline}. [The vectoralist class
still sits atop a pyramid of exploited labor]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} it [depends]{.underline} also [on extracting a surplus
out of another]{.underline}, fairly [privileged but]{.underline} still
[subordinate]{.underline} class. I call it the **[hacker
class]{.underline}**. Bernal already had an inkling of this development
when he tried to articulate the interests of scientific workers in and
against capitalism, but this was not quite the hacker class yet. That
had to wait for the development of [sophisticated forms of
**intellectual property**]{.underline}, which [are]{.underline} in turn
[embedded in the design of the interface for the **creative
process**]{.underline}. [This **transforms**]{.underline} the
qualitative work of producing **[new]{.underline}** forms of
[**information**]{.underline} in the world **[into
property]{.underline}** that can be rendered equivalent in the market.
In short, a new class dynamic, between vectoralist and hacker, was added
to an already complex pattern of relations between dominant and
subordinate classes. Third, [the political economy of the former
West]{.underline} rather than the former East [was the one that was able
to develop the]{.underline} implications of the [scientific and
technical revolution]{.underline}, [in]{.underline} the form of [the
rise of the vectoralist class]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} it was
**[the state form of the former East that has prevailed in the former
West.]{.underline}** [**The vector** is]{.underline} not just a means of
transforming production. It is also [a way of **transforming state
power**]{.underline}. 56 [Data can be collected for]{.underline} the
purposes of a logistics of **[economic control]{.underline}**; data can
also be collected **[to run the surveillance and security apparatus of
the state]{.underline}**. The [western states]{.underline} too [had
their surveillance apparatus, but it was never as total as]{.underline}
those of [the East]{.underline}. [The new]{.underline}
[model]{.underline} worldwide [uses the vector to **realize the dreams
of the KGB**]{.underline} of old, an information state. This is what Guy
Debord called [the]{.underline} stage of the [integrated]{.underline}
[spectacle]{.underline}, **[combining the worst of the former East and
West]{.underline}**.57 [The West is now **the former
West**]{.underline}. [Its economy became something else]{.underline}.
**[It isn't capitalism any more---it's worse]{.underline}**. [It
**takes**]{.underline} even more **[control away from]{.underline}**
work **[life]{.underline}** and everyday life. [It
**expands**]{.underline} the **[exploitation of nature to]{.underline}**
possible **[extinction]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} certainly
[not]{.underline} the wonderful dream of [a "postindustrial
society]{.underline}," still less Bernal and Richta's [accelerationist
socialism]{.underline}. [It is a]{.underline} relatively [new
and]{.underline} more [elaborate]{.underline} form of [class
domination]{.underline}, one in more or less "peaceful coexistence" with
the Russian former East, whose global significance is reduced to that of
predatory oligarchy monopolizing a resource export economy. 58 The
Soviet Union paid a high price for not figuring out the role of
information and reaching a modus vivendi with its scientific workers.

#### Snowden has been variously called a traitor, a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a coward, and a patriot. U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done \"grave damage\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities. Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort \"to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\" His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government secrecy, and the balance between national security and information privacy.[^5]

#### The west refused Snowden and continuously produced propaganda to hide his revalations.

#### NATO security cooperation is the lynchpin of this western securitization -- justifications for NATO action are securitizations that produce anti-communist operations and imperial exploitation.

While the first research area dealt with representations of
'authoritarian regimes' that are by definition categorised as being
outside of the boundaries of 'the West', this research area focuses on
the transformation of **[NATO]{.underline}**, that [is]{.underline}, the
military alliance that is considered to be [the **institutional core
of**]{.underline} what we usually call '[**the West**']{.underline}
(e.g., Gress 2004; Brzezinski 2009). Obviously, **[transatlantic
security cooperation]{.underline}** [has been a classical theme in
IR]{.underline}, either from a realist vantage point, [where NATO
is]{.underline} primarily described as [a defence alliance subordinated
to national purposes]{.underline} (Waltz 2000: 18), [or]{.underline}
from a liberal perspective, where NATO is understood as [an alliance of
democracies]{.underline} (Risse-Kappen 1995: 4). In both perspectives,
however, [the dynamics of **security cooperation** between North America
and Europe **seem** **unproblematic** as long as the allies are
convinced of their **common interest** or their shared
values.]{.underline}

[NATO\'s]{.underline} (lasting) [ability to voice
in-/securities]{.underline} --- for example [a 'Soviet
threat']{.underline}, '[terrorism']{.underline}, [or 'new
challenges']{.underline} --- [directs our attention to highly
**institutionalised dynamics of securitisation**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}, as the subsequent analysis will show, [manifest
themselves as a **self-authorisation of 'the West'**]{.underline} in
order [to]{.underline} [defend its normative foundation]{.underline}.
Such a tendency towards self-authorisation has become visible in
different forms since the North Atlantic alliance was founded in 1949.
[During the Cold War, it]{.underline} primarily [enabled a]{.underline}
rather [deep **institutionalisation of military cooperation** with an
integrated command structure including US **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, as well as common [strategic planning and
defence exercises]{.underline}. [After the Cold War, **this project was
continued**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} it has
[certainly]{.underline} changed in [form]{.underline}. [**Out-of-area
operations** and]{.underline} the development of **[a globally active
alliance]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} one of [the most visible
expressions of such self-authorising practices]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} dynamics were [central to **re-constitute
NATO**]{.underline} during critical junctures [and have been
**productive of a highly self-confident Western alliance
today**]{.underline} (Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005; Behnke 2013).

[The North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}, signed in April 1949 by
representatives of nine Western European states, Iceland, Canada, and
the US, provided the Western alliance with a legal basis and outlined
the key principles of cooperation, that is, consultation (Article 4) and
collective defence (Article 5). Although the formulation of Article 5
was highly contested between the US and its European allies, it was
perceived as the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation
(Kaplan 2004: 4). In contrast to such a legal framing of Western
security cooperation, the preamble of the Treaty [invoked an
**inherently normative rhetoric**]{.underline} [when it stated that the
parties '**are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and
civilization of their people, founded on the principle of democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law'**]{.underline} (The North
Atlantic Treaty 1949). [The construction of unity based on a **common
culture** and]{.underline} even '**[civilisation']{.underline}** (rather
than merely a shared threat perception) [transferred military
cooperation]{.underline} and integration far beyond an interest-driven
alliance (e.g., Klein 1990; Jackson 2003, 2006a). During these formative
years of NATO, [one central aim]{.underline} of formulating 'strategic
concepts' [was to construct a common security interes]{.underline}t of
the US and Western European states [that was]{.underline} metaphorically
[framed in terms of an '**indivisibility of allied
security'**]{.underline}.Footnote6

Bearing these normative foundations in mind, [NATO]{.underline}
gradually [evolved as a cultural project]{.underline} that was
**[directed against communism]{.underline}** --- [which made the
**inclusion of an autocratic state** such as Portugal
possible]{.underline} --- [rather than as a community of democratic
states]{.underline} (Klein 1990; Jackson 2003; Sjursen 2004). [The
invoked]{.underline} **[narrative of shared norms]{.underline}**,
values, and a common heritage [**provided** a]{.underline} sufficiently
strong [**rationale for** **defending** the North Atlantic Area
**against any**]{.underline} potential **[threat]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [it]{.underline} also [legitimised taking **whatever
measures** were deemed '**necessary'** to defend its
members]{.underline}. '**[Forward defence']{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} '**[massive retaliation]{.underline}**' [turned out to
be]{.underline} such [legitimate means]{.underline}. Nevertheless, in
many ways the strength of Western rhetoric was also intended to polish
over and counterbalance many of the underlying political conflicts that
persisted throughout NATO\'s post-war history. As a matter of fact, over
the years it had become a standard formula in political discourse to
refer to [an **alliance in 'crisis'** as proof of its uniquely
transatlantic vitality]{.underline}. In this sense the [**invocation of
a normative foundation** of shared 'Western' values, heritage and
civilisation]{.underline} [**even against the background of internal
political dissent** was]{.underline} as much [a **securitising
move**]{.underline} as it was an expression of a particular 'Western'
structure of conflict. One could conclude that **[transatlantic security
cooperation was]{.underline}** **[only manageable]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** **[invoking]{.underline}** **[such a]{.underline}**
**[normative foundation of shared values, heritage, and
civilisation.]{.underline}**

The subsequent strategic concepts DC 6/1 (December 1952), MC 14/2 (May
1957) and the amended strategic guidelines were written with the
intention to both 'convince the USSR that war does not pay' (NATO 1950)
and to reassure the allies that continued and even intensified that
security cooperation was necessary. Changing strategic concepts, most
prominently from 'massive retaliation' to 'flexible response', restored
the reliability of mutual defence because of altered security
circumstances (e.g., Haftendorn 1996; Tuschhoff 1999; Kaplan 2004: 100).
Although the concept of 'flexible response' eventually satisfied all
allies and remained valid until the end of the Cold War, different
interpretations of deterrence and its operational implications persisted
(Daalder 1991: 41; Risse-Kappen 1995: 184--7). Once again a particular
structure of conflict among NATO allies was observable in the sense that
[although a 'crisis' occurred, references to the common heritage, shared
norms and values of the 'free world' restored sufficient coherence among
them]{.underline}. In this sense, the decision over **[West Germany\'s
membership]{.underline}** in 1955, **[the Suez Crisis]{.underline}** in
1956, **[the withdrawal of France]{.underline}** from the integrated
military command structure in 1966, or **[NATO\'s double track
decision]{.underline}** in 1979 [were all]{.underline} incidents of
[**alliance disruption** that]{.underline} nevertheless **[did not lead
to a break-up of the Atlantic alliance]{.underline}**. In these
situations **[strategic concepts]{.underline}** turned out to be crucial
in [**re-establishing coherence** and unity by **reaffirming the
authority of the alliance** and its **ability to
(re-)act**.]{.underline} The [strengthening of **consultation
mechanisms**]{.underline} in the 1950s, the formation of '**[Allied
Mobile Forces']{.underline}** (AMF) in the 1960s, or the deployment of
additional **[Pershing II missiles]{.underline}** in the 1980s embodied
the [**institutional consequences** of]{.underline} these [**strategic
re-orientations**.]{.underline}

With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, many commentators expected that
the Atlantic alliance would sooner or later vanish as well. Thus,
[NATO\'s post-Cold War strategies]{.underline} of 1991 and 1999
[were]{.underline} primarily [aimed at **justifying the institutional
continuity of the Western alliance**]{.underline} against the new
setting of a decreasing Eastern threat (e.g., Ringsmose and Rynning
2009: 5). At the beginning of the 1990s, 'Europe, whole and free' (The
Alliance\'s New Strategic Concept 1991) became the obvious new
rhetorical commonplace to legitimise a different future for NATO
compared with the fate of the Warsaw Pact. It opened up the possibility
of Eastern enlargement and paved the way for the institutionalisation of
a new relationship with Russia (Wallander 2000; Williams and Neumann
2000; Schimmelfennig 2003; Adler 2008; Pouliot 2008) as well as
initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean (Masala 2003).

In the same vein of institutional and geographical expansion, the
'out-of-area' debate in the mid-1990s rearticulated the necessity for a
political and military engagement far beyond alliance territory and
territorial defence.Footnote7 While the bipolar confrontation of the
Cold War had largely constrained the alliance\'s global military
engagement, 's[afeguarding the freedom, common heritage and
civilisation' now ascribed a **global mission** to NATO\'s
members.]{.underline} Instead of supporting a culture of self-restraint
and legal formalism, the [allies]{.underline} even
[intensified]{.underline} a tendency towards [**self-authorisation** in
**the name of defending human rights and the achievements of 'Western
civilisation'**]{.underline}. Disregarding United Nations' formal legal
provisions [in]{.underline} the case of **[Kosovo]{.underline}**,
**[NATO]{.underline}** itself **[became a]{.underline}** **[producer of
a common law]{.underline}** where **[the protection of human rights was
deemed more important than respecting state sovereignty and
non-intervention]{.underline}**. The specific formation of NATO\'s
strategic discourse made such 'humanitarian interventions' intelligible
as the new raison d'être. Public justifications for **[military
interventions in Serbia or Afghanistan]{.underline}**, for example,
[cited the **attack on 'Western' values** as a determining reason for
taking military action]{.underline}. Ultimately, in its statement on
terrorism, [the North Atlantic Council said]{.underline} that '[the
lives of **our citizens**]{.underline}, and **[their human rights and
civil liberties']{.underline}** [were threatened by
terrorism]{.underline} and reaffirmed that the allies 'condemn terrorism
in all its forms and manifestations. We, the 19 [NATO
Allies]{.underline}, [are determined to **combat this
scourge**]{.underline}. Our **[security requires no less']{.underline}**
(NATO 2001).Footnote8

During the Cold War, such a project of self-authorisation was primarily
realised by institutionalising an integrated command structure,
coordinated defence planning and common exercises. Today, **[the
rhetoric of unpredictable risks]{.underline}** and the global war on
terrorism **[assigns]{.underline}** an almost **[universal authority to
NATO]{.underline}**, in particular when '[the challenge is not just to
make our populations secure, but **feel secure'**]{.underline} (de Hoop
Scheffer 2009, emphasis added). 'Europe' and the 'transatlantic area' is
the endangered subject of NATO\'s strategic discourse
[justifying]{.underline} a durable and institutionally dense [military
cooperation]{.underline} of its member states [and a **nuclearisation**
of its defence strategy]{.underline}. Whenever allies pursued (national)
security policies without consultation, conflicts and crisis within the
alliance ensued. [It was **only through NATO** that 'the West' could
materialise its power position through a specific form of
self-authorisation]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline}, respectively
Western states, [presented]{.underline} '**[democracy', 'human rights',
the 'rule of law', and 'market economy' as normatively unquestioned
principles]{.underline}** they had already realised. Others had only one
choice: to **[comply or to resist]{.underline}**. The normative
attractiveness of 'the West', thus, also directs our attention to the
temptations of securitising practices where [a formalisation of IR
through law is marginalised by unilateral acts of
self-authorisation.]{.underline}

[**Data** form]{.underline} an increasingly **[essential element of
contemporary politics]{.underline}**, [as both]{.underline} **[public
and private actors extend claims of their legitimate control in diverse
areas]{.underline}** including health, security, and trade. This paper
investigates [**data governance** as a site of fundamental **normative
and political ordering**]{.underline} processes [that unfold in light
of]{.underline} ever-increasing inter- and **[transnational
linkages]{.underline}**. Drawing on the concept of jurisdictional
conflicts, the paper traces the evolution of data governance in three
cases of transatlantic conflicts as diverging definitional claims over
data. The paper argues that these [conflicts reveal]{.underline} varying
[conceptualizations of data linked]{.underline} to four [distinct
visions of the social world]{.underline}. First, a conceptualization of
[data]{.underline} as an individual rights issue [links human rights
with the promotion of sovereignty to]{.underline} a vision **[of data
governance as local liberalism]{.underline}**. Second, **[proponents of
a security partnership promote global security cooperation based on the
conceptualization of]{.underline}** **[data as a neutral
instrument]{.underline}**. Third, a conceptualization of [data as
an]{.underline} **[economic resource]{.underline}** is [linked to
a]{.underline} vision of the **[digital economy]{.underline}** [that
endorses]{.underline} **[progress and innovation with limited
regulation]{.underline}**. Fourth, a conceptualization of data as a
collective resource links the values of universal rights and global
rules to a vision of global protection.

[The]{.underline} ever-increasing relevance of the [internet has
contributed to the recognition of data as a key concern in social,
political, and economic lives.]{.underline} [How data are collected,
processed, and shared has significant implications for contemporary
politics in areas, such as security, health, democracy, and human
rights]{.underline} (van Puyvelde, Coulthart, and Hossain 2017; Davies
and Wenham 2020). [After the]{.underline} 2013 **[Snowden revelations of
mass surveillance by intelligence agencies around the
world]{.underline}** but [also]{.underline} following potential **[voter
manipulation in the Cambridge Analytica scandal]{.underline}** in 2018,
[data governance has experienced a "salience shock"]{.underline}
(Kalyanpur and Newman 2019). Data governance describes ordering
processes by actors including but not limited to states, international
organizations, local authorities, and private companies that relate to
the processing, transfer, sharing, and general use practices of digital
data. [Regulatory measures on the international, regional, and domestic
level have proliferated]{.underline}. Of the 132 countries that have at
least minimal data privacy laws in place, 55 countries have adopted such
legislation only in the last ten years (UNCTAD 2020). As even [tech
companies have increasingly called for regulation]{.underline} (Hern
2019), former European Commissioner Martine Reicherts has claimed that
["\[d\]ata protection is the new business model]{.underline}" (Reicherts
2014). While there seems to be convergence around common standards
(Bradford 2020), conflicts resulting from different approaches to the
governance of digital data have shaken particularly transatlantic
relations in the last decade (Farrell and Newman 2019). Actors face
significant incentives to avoid such conflicts. In 2013, the European
Centre for Political Economy estimated that a serious disruption in
transatlantic data flows could have a negative impact on the EU Gross
Domestic Product of between 0.8 and 1.3 percent (ECIPE 2013, 3). Yet,
overlapping claims of control have adversely affected the transatlantic
data transfer regime multiple times. For instance, in 2015 and again in
2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the
main transatlantic data sharing agreement for commercial transfers
exposing more than 5,000 businesses to legal uncertainty.

Despite copyleft's beneficial role in forming a valuable common stock of
software[, it remains problematic when the model is retrofitted back to
the domains of art and culture from which dissent against intellectual
property sprung.]{.underline} Cultural works, unlike software, are a
consumer good, not a tool for use in production, or a producer's [good.
Producer's goods, as mentioned earlier, are the assets used in
production, such as the tools and equipment required to produce consumer
goods sold for profit**. Capital demand is distinct from consumer
demand. Capital demand is the demand for producer's goods; consumer
demand is the demand for consumer goods**]{.underline}. Capitalism
doesn't require that a profit be made on the production of capital goods
because profits are made through the control of the circulation of
consumer goods[. Anything that decreases the cost of capital
consequently increases the potential profit that can be captured through
the sale of the goods**. Failure to understand the difference between
capital demand and consumer demand propagates the myth that the success
of free software can be a template for free culture.**]{.underline}
Under capitalism, only capital can be free. That's why software can be
free, but **[culture cannot be free without more fundamental shifts in
society]{.underline}**. [Art is not, in most cases, a common input to
production as software is. **Thus, the demand for it is consumer demand,
not capital demand.**]{.underline} There are certainly cases in which
art works could be considered productive inputs, such as sound effects,
clip art, music clips, and the like, and the tradition of artists
drawing on the work of their predecessors has been discussed at length
above[; however, when we discuss the economics of content-based works,
like poems, novels, films, or music, as well as entertainment-oriented
software titles such as games, we are not talking about producer's
goods, but consumer's goods**. Capitalist publishing firms and
entertainment industry giants will support the creation of copyleft
software in order to employ it in production.**]{.underline} [However,
in most cases, they will not support the creation of copyleft
art.]{.underline} Why would they, as art is a consumer good, and the
**[industry is not in the business of giving away consumer goods for
free.]{.underline}** They are in the business, however, of earning
profits by controlling the distribution of consumer goods. Like all
copyable, reproducible information, content-based works have no direct
exchange value, and, unlike software, they rarely have use value in
production either. Use value exists only among the fans of these works,
and, if owners of property cannot charge these fans money for the right
to copy, why would they fund the production? And if owners of property
will not support copyleft art, which is freely distributed, who will?
The answer is unclear. In some cases, institutions such as private and
state cultural funds will, but these can only support a very small
number of artists, and only then by employing dubious and ultimately
somewhat arbitrary selection criteria in deciding who does, and who does
not, receive such funding. The problem is obvious when attempting to
translate copyleft to cultural works. [If someone releases a novel under
a copyleft license, and Random House prints it and makes a profit off
the author's work, Random House has not violated copyleft as long as the
copyleft is passed down.]{.underline} To be 'free' means to be open to
commercial appropriation, since freedom, in the terms of copyleft, is
defined as the non-restrictive circulation of 41 information rather than
as freedom from exploitation[. It comes as no surprise that the major
revision in applying copyleft to the production of artworks, music, and
texts has been to permit copying, modifying, and redistributing as long
as it is non-commercial.]{.underline} **[Wu Ming, a group of
anti-intellectual property authors from Italy, claim it is necessary to
place a restriction on commercial use, or use for profit, to prohibit
the parasitic exploitation of cultural workers]{.underline}**. They
justify this restriction, and its divergence from the General Public
License version of copyleft, on the grounds that [the struggle against
exploitation and the fight for a fair remuneration of labor is the
cornerstone of the history of the left.]{.underline} Other content
providers and book publishers, for example Verso, have expanded this
restriction by claiming that copying, modifying, and redistributing
should not only be nonprofit, but also in the spirit of the original,
without explaining what this 'spirit' means. Indymedia Romania revised
its copyleft definition to make the meaning of 'in the spirit of the
original' clearer after repeated problems with the neo-fascist site
Alter media Romania, whose 'pranks' ranged from hijacking the
indymedia.ro domain to copying texts from Indymedia and lying about
names and sources. Indymedia Romania's restrictions include, not
modifying the original name or source because it goes against the desire
for transparency, not reproducing the material for profit because it
abuses the spirit of generosity, and not reproducing the material in a
context that violates the rights of individuals or groups by
discriminating against them based on nationality, ethnicity, gender, or
sexuality because that contravenes its commitment to equality. Other
versions of copyleft have tried to add further restrictions based on a
stronger interpretation of the 'left' in copyleft, based not on a
negative freedom from restrictions but on positive principles, like
valuing social co-operation above profit, non-hierarchical
participation, and non-discrimination. [The more restrictive definitions
of copyleft attempt to find an information common that is not just about
the free flow of information but sees itself as part of a larger social
movement that bases its commonality on shared leftist principles. In its
various mutations, copyleft represents a pragmatic, rational approach
that recognizes the limits of freedom as implying reciprocal rights and
responsibilities.]{.underline} These different restrictions represent
divergent interpretations about what these rights and responsibilities
should be[. Yet, given the poor economic conditions of most artists who
reserve full copyright, the prospect of non-commercial mutations of
copyleft improving the economic conditions of artists **seems
remote**.]{.underline} The chief advantage of reserving commercial
rights as an artist is the ability to license work to the entertainment
industry under other terms; as it is commercial, it doesn't qualify for
free access under the terms of a non-commercial license[**. However,
artists lack the resources to manufacture and distribute on a commercial
scale. Thus, they are in fact reliant on those who have the capital to
do so, and cannot bargain for anything more than their subsistence.** In
essence, selling their ideas is like other workers selling their
labor.]{.underline} This is illustrated in 'Music Artists' Earnings and
Digitisation: A Review of Empirical Data from Britain and Germany' by
Martin Kretschmer, Professor of Information Jurisprudence at Bournemouth
University, **[where he concludes that 'the creator has little to gain
from exclusivity']{.underline}**.41 Similarly, in his 2006 study
'Empirical Evidence On Copyright Earnings', Kretschmer states:
**['Earnings from non copyright, and even non-artistic activities, are
an important source of income for most creators']{.underline}**.42 This
study includes many startling figures. For example,the median payment
distributed by the Performing Right Society (UK) in 1994 to its
copyright holders was £84.43 [While non-commercial terms may provide a
way to integrate artists who produce free culture into an otherwise
proprietary entertainment industry, they do not challenge that
proprietary entertainment industry or address the embedded exploitation
in it.]{.underline} Non-commercial 42 terms are very problematic for
those in the socialist left who advocate for workers' self-organized
production, as these terms restrict the ability of non-capitalist
enterprises to reproduce such works. [Thus, such licenses are
detrimental not only to the interests of artists but to all workers, as
they are not compatible with the general objective of the socialist
left: the creation of a worker-controlled **economy. In order for
copyleft to mutate into a revolutionary instrument in the domain of
cultural production, it must become 'copy-far-left'**]{.underline}. It
must insist on workers' ownership of the means of production. The works
themselves must be a part of the common stock, and available for
productive use by other commons-based producers. **[So long as authors
reserve the right to make money with their works and prevent other
commons-based producers from doing so, their work cannot be considered
to be in the commons at all and remains a private work.]{.underline}** A
**[copyfarleft license must not restrict commercial usage, but rather
usage that is not based in the commons.]{.underline}** Specifically,
copyfarleft must have one set of rules for those who are working within
the context of workers' communal ownership, and another for those who
employ private property and wage labor in production. A copyfarleft
license should make it possible for producers to share freely and to
also retain the value of their labor product[. In other words, it must
be possible for workers to earn remuneration by applying their own labor
to mutual property, but impossible for owners of private property to
make profit using wage labor. Thus, under a copyfarleft license, a
worker-owned printing co-operative could be free to reproduce,
distribute, and modify the common stock as they like**, but a privately
owned publishing company would be prevented from having free
access**.]{.underline} In this way, copyfarleft remains free in the same
sense as copyleft, despite restrictions on proprietary redistribution.
Copyfarleft only prohibits subtraction from the commons, not
contributions to it. A copyfarleft license would allow commons-based
commercial use while denying the ability to profit by exploiting wage
labor. The copyleft non-commercial approach does neither, it prevents
commons-based commerce, while not effectively restricting wage
exploitation which requires a change in the distribution of wealth.
Copyleft provides a solid foundation for software in commons-based
productions[. Copyfarleft could potentially provide a workable
foundation for cultural works to also become part of the common stock
employed by independent producers. Only the promotion of a workers'
economy, not simply the prevention of commercial use, can change the
distribution of wealth]{.underline}. **[However, for copyfarleft to have
an impact, it would need to be employed within the context of a nascent
workers' economy that includes various forms of production, such as
cultural and material]{.underline}** (art as well as food, etc.). In the
absence of such an environment, copyleft and its various mutations have
little advantage for the majority of artists, for whom the prospects of
gaining financially by way of commercial licensing are negligible[**.
For these artists, anticopyright retains its strong appeal**.
Anticopyright is a gesture of being radical that refuses pragmatic
compromises and seeks to abolish intellectual property in its
entirety.]{.underline} Anticopyright affirms a freedom that is absolute
and recognizes no limits to its desire. While some mutations of copyleft
have multiplied restrictions, others have rejected any restriction at
all, including the single restriction imposed by the initial copyleft.
**[It is the movement around peer-to-peer file sharing that comes
closest to the gesture of anticopyright.]{.underline}** The best example
is the Copyriot blog by Rasmus Fleischer of Piratbyrån (Bureau of
Piracy), an anti-intellectual property think tank, and the one-time
founders of Pirate Bay, the best-known Bittorent site in the P2P
community. The motto of Copyriot 43 is 'No copyright. No license'. But
there is a difference from the older anticopyright tradition. [Fleischer
claims that copyright has become absurd in the age of digital technology
because it has to resort to all sorts of fictions, like distinctions
between uploading and downloading or between producer and
consumer]{.underline}, which don't actually exist in horizontal
peer-to-peer communication[. Piratbyrån rejects copyright in its
entirety, not because it was flawed in its inception, but because it was
invented to regulate an expensive, one-way machine like the printing
press, and no longer corresponds to the practices that have been made
possible by current technologies of reproduction]{.underline}. However,
despite the absurdity of the fictions on which copyright rests, [the
broader political context suggests that copyleft-inspired models also
have an important role to play. The outright rejection of the legal
environment is not always possible when practical considerations are
considered. **Building alternative ways of producing and sharing,
'building the new society within the shell of the old', requires us to
operate within the capitalist legal system where the logic of capture
and exploitation is embedded**]{.underline}. While space for defiant
gestures exist, we must also get on with the business of finding the
forms and structures required to build and expand the commons[. It seems
clear that restrictions such as those of copyleft and copyfarleft serve
to protect the commons and keep it free. So long as copyright continues
to exist, copyleftinspired licenses continue to beneeded in orderto
allow forintellectual freedom within the copyrightregime]{.underline}.
**[Only when workers have achieved their historical role of creating a
society without classes, can we create a truly free culture without
restrictions.]{.underline}**

#### We advocate for venture communism , a platform where material wealth can be shared and allocated to build free networks and free societies.

**[Venture communism provides a structure for independent producers to
share a common stock of productive assets, allowing forms of production
formerly associated exclusively with the creation of immaterial value,
such as free software, to be extended to the material
sphere]{.underline}**. Part of the apparatus that allowed the free
software community to grow and spread was the creation of copyleft, a
type of license that allows for the re-use of the software it covers, so
long as the derived works are also licensed under compatible terms. [By
releasing software under such licenses, **the work becomes a collective
stock for all free software developers**. The core innovation of
copyleft was to turn the copyright system against itself]{.underline}.
[The chief vehicle of asserting control under copyright is the license a
work is released under, which establishes the terms under which others
are permitted to use the copyrighted material.]{.underline} [**Copyleft
effectively hijacks the existing apparatus that enforces privilege over
intellectual assets, using the authority granted by the copyright
license to guarantee access for all, and require that this freedom is
passed on.** This is consistent with copyright laws, and dependent on
them, because without copyright and the institutions that protect it,
**there could be no copyleft.**]{.underline} [Venture communism requires
that this same freedom be extended to material productive
assets.]{.underline} [The chief vehicle for asserting control over
productive assets is the firm.]{.underline} [**Venture communism is
therefore based on a corporate form: the venture commune. Employing a
venture commune to share material property hijacks the existing
apparatus that enforces privilege, to instead protect a common stock of
productive assets that is available for use by independent producers**.
Legally, a venture commune is a firm, much like the venture capital
funds of the capitalist class. However, the venture commune has distinct
properties that transform it into an effective vehicle for revolutionary
workers' struggle.]{.underline} **[The venture commune holds ownership
of all productive assets]{.underline}** that make up the common stock
employed by a diverse and geographically distributed network of
collective and independent peer producers**[. The venture commune does
not coordinate production; a community of peer producers produce
according to their own needs and desires]{.underline}**. [The role of
the commune is only to manage the common stock, making property, such as
the housing and tools they require, available to the peer
producers.]{.underline} 24 [The venture commune is the federation of
workers' collectives and individual workers, and is itself owned by each
of them, with each member having only one share]{.underline}. In the
case that workers are working in a collective or co-operative, ownership
is held individually, by the separate people that make up the collective
or co-operative. Ownership in a venture commune can only be acquired by
contributions of labor, not property. Only by working is a share in the
commune earned, not by contributing land, capital or even money; only
labor. [Property is always held in common by all the members of the
commune, with the venture commune equally owned by all its members.
**Thus, each member may never accumulate a disproportionate share of the
proceeds of property.** Property can never be concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. The function of the venture commune is to acquire material
assets that members need for living and working, such as equipment and
tools, and allocate them to its members.]{.underline} The commune
acquires this property when requested to do so by a member of the
commune. [The members interested in having this property offer a rental
agreement to the commune, giving the terms they wish to have for
possession of this property]{.underline}. [The commune issues a series
of bonds to raise the funds required to acquire the property, which then
becomes collateral forthe bondholders.]{.underline} The rental agreement
is offered as a guarantee that the funds will be available to redeem the
bonds. **[Should this guarantee not be met, the property can be
liquidated with the proceeds going to the bondholders.]{.underline}**
This series of bonds are sold in a public auction setting. If the bond
sale clears, the commune acquires the property, and the rental agreement
is executed transferring possession to the renter[. The property returns
to the commune whenever those renting it no longer require it, or are
unable to meet the agreed terms, at which point the commune offers it
once again at auction to its members, who bid on new rental terms**. If
there is no more demand for the asset it is liquidated. After the bonds
that were issued to acquire an asset are fully redeemed, it becomes
fully owned by the commune.** The remaining rental income the property
earns is from then on divided up equally among all members of the
commune and paid out to them.]{.underline} Proceeds from liquidated
property are likewise divided. Because all the rent collected from
property rental is divided up evenly among the members of the commune,
those members who pay rent for property that is equal to the amount they
would receive in return essentially get to use an equal share of the
collectively owned property for free[. What **they pay in rent for the
property is equal to the rent they receive back as a member of the
commune**. **Members renting more than their per-capita share of the
collective property will pay more**, **and presumably be choosing to pay
because they are employing the property as a productive asset, and thus
earning enough to pay**.]{.underline} Conversely, [members using less
than their per-capita share receive more in payment than they pay in
rent, **thus being rewarded for not hoarding property.**]{.underline}
The main activities of the venture commune, managing bonds and rental
agreements, do not impose a high level of coordination and, just like
the computer networks that manage the allocation of immaterial goods,
are activities that are well suited for computerized automation. **[Many
venture communes could exist, and as they become interrelated, merge
together forming larger, and more stable and sustainable communities of
commons-based producers]{.underline}**. Any change that can produce a
more equitable society is dependent on a prior change in the mode of
production that increases the share of wealth retained by the worker.
[**The change in the mode of production must come first**. This change
cannot be achieved politically, not by vote, or by lobby, or by
advocacy, or by revolutionary violence, not as long as the owners of
property have more wealth to apply to prevent any change by funding
their own candidates, 25 their own lobbyists, their own advocates, and
ultimately, developing a greater capacity for counter-revolutionary
violence]{.underline}. [Society cannot be changed by a strike, not as
long as owners of property have more accumulated wealth to sustain
themselves during production interruptions.]{.underline} [Not even
collective bargaining can work, for so long as the owners of property
own the product, they set the price of the product and thus any gains in
wages are lost to rising prices**. Venture communism should not be
understood as a proposal for a new kind of society. It is an
organizational form with which to engage in social struggle. Venture
communes are not intended to replace labor unions, political parties,
NGOs and other potential vehicles of class conflict, but to compliment
them, to tilt the economic balance of power in favor of the
representatives of workers' class interest.**]{.underline} Without
venture communism, [these other organized forms are always forced to
work against opposition with much deeper pockets, and are **thus doomed
to endless co-option, failure and retreat**. The only way is to stop
applying our labor to property owned by non-producers and instead form a
common stock of productive assets]{.underline}. [Venture communism is
taking control of our own productive process, retaining the entire
product of our labor, forming our own capital, and expanding until we
have collectively accumulated enough wealth to achieve a greater social
influence than those that defend exploitation.]{.underline} This new
economic balance allows for change that is far greater than the modest
goals of venture communism. A truly free society would have no need for
copyleft, or venture communism; **[these are only practices around which
workers can unite towards the realization of their historic role of
building a classless society, a society of equals.]{.underline}**

\"Capital is dead\", Introduction)//gideon

Which punk rock goddess are you? I'm Kim Gordon. Or I was. Not happy
with that answer, I took the online quiz a few more times, until I got
Patti Smith. I don't know what company made that quiz, but I agreed to
give them access to a whole bunch of information in exchange for the
privilege of playing it, in order to learn what I already know, that I'm
more of a Patti Smith type than a Kim Gordon type. The quiz held my
attention for long enough to escape boredom, and it gave me something to
post on social media, presumably to snag other people's attention. Some
[people get rather freaked out about algorithms that seem to know so
much about us]{.underline}, although I always thought of privacy as a
bourgeois concept.1 [What is dystopian here may be]{.underline} less the
sharing of information than [the asymmetry of the sharing]{.underline}.
[If you are getting your media for free]{.underline}, this usually means
that **[you are the product]{.underline}**. [If the information is not
being sold to you]{.underline}, then it is [you]{.underline} who [are
being sold]{.underline}. This is something that those of us in media
studies have been teaching our students and telling the public since the
broadcast era.2 Back in the broadcast era, it was pretty simple. [You
listened to free radio]{.underline} or watched free television. In
[between the]{.underline} shows or the [songs would be
advertising]{.underline}. You were the product that was being sold, by
the broadcaster, to advertisers. Or rather, what [they sold]{.underline}
was [your attention]{.underline}.3 [In a time in which the quantity of
information was rising and its cost plummeting]{.underline}, [what was
still rare and valuable]{.underline} was (and [is]{.underline}) [your
**attention**]{.underline}. In the broadcast era it was hard to even
know whose attention a show gathered and whether any particular
advertising worked. The ad industry guru David Ogilvy reported one of
his clients claiming that half of his advertising worked and half of it
failed, but he did not know which half was which.4 A good deal of sn[ake
oil still goes into persuading ad buyers that advertisers have magical
means of persuasion that will]{.underline} galvanize people's attention,
lodge the brand in memory, and [mobilize people's desire
toward]{.underline} actually [buying the product or]{.underline}---same
thing really---[voting for the candidate]{.underline}. The evil genius
of the postbroadcast-era media is that it not only holds our attention,
it also records it. A lot more information can be extracted as to who we
are, what we like, and which punk rock goddess we want to be. A lot of
media consumers end up being quite shocked at just how much information
about themselves they are giving away, and for free.5 They had been
gulled into treating postbroadcast media as if it were some sort of free
public service, an illusion certain companies are quite happy to
perpetuate to their users but certainly not to their investors. To their
investors they tell a different story: that by giving away what looks
like a free service, [they can extract more information than they give
and]{.underline} that they can [monetize this asymmetry of
information]{.underline}.6 The old [culture industries]{.underline} had
[figured out how to]{.underline} **[commodify leisure]{.underline}**.7
The organized labor movement had struggled hard for free time for
working people. Capital was forced to compromise, but it found a way to
commodify leisure time as well as work time. The old culture industries
at least had to make products that held our attention. [In the
postbroadcast era]{.underline}, the culture industries are superseded by
the [vulture industries]{.underline}. They [don't even]{.underline}
bother to [provide]{.underline} any [entertainment]{.underline}. [We
have to entertain each other]{.underline}, [while they collect the
rent]{.underline}, and they collect [it on all social media]{.underline}
time, public or private, work or leisure, and (if you keep your FitBit
on) even when you sleep.8 Which gives new meaning to a slogan invented
by the Belgian surrealists: "[Remember, you are sleeping for the
boss!]{.underline}"9 [Not just]{.underline} our [labor]{.underline},
[not just]{.underline} our [leisure]{.underline}---[**something else is
being commodified**]{.underline} here: [our sociability,]{.underline}
our [common and ordinary life]{.underline} together, what you might even
call **[our communism]{.underline}**.10 Sure, [it's not a
utopian]{.underline} version of [communism]{.underline}.
[It's]{.underline} a very [banal and everyday]{.underline} one, it's our
love of sharing our thoughts and feelings with each other and having
connections to other people. But [still, most people seem rather alarmed
that their desire to share and be with each othe]{.underline}r, to reach
out to friends, to pass on cat pictures, even their desire to have
ferocious arguments with strangers, [is making someone else very, very
rich.]{.underline} That people who use the Internet are tracked and
monitored and turned into information is not even the half of it. If you
think your social media is spying on you, just [imagine what kind of
information your bank has on you]{.underline}. [There's a whole
political economy that runs on **asymmetries of information as a form of
control**]{.underline}.11 [It may even amount to]{.underline} **[a new
kind of class relation]{.underline}**. Sure, [there is still a landlord
class that owns the land]{.underline} under our feet [and a capitalist
class that owns the factories, but]{.underline} maybe now [there's
another kind of ruling class]{.underline} as well---one
[that]{.underline} owns neither of those things but instead **[owns the
vector along which information is gathered and used]{.underline}**.12
These days, not just everyone but [everything is tracked and monitored
and **turned into information**]{.underline}. If you order a package
from an online website, you can follow the delivery of the item through
its stages on its way to you. It's a consumer grade version of tracking
the movement of everything: animal, mineral, and vegetable. For these
purposes, even though you think you fall in the animal category, [you
are also being tracked]{.underline} as if you were a rock. The mineral
sandwich in your pocket, [your cellphone, is generating]{.underline}
[information]{.underline} about all of its movements. [Out of all of
this information about the habits and movements of people and things,
you can g**enerate predictions about future
movements**]{.underline}**.** Well, you can't do that: while you produce
this information, [it all ends up privately owned]{.underline} by some
information-centric company. You make the information, but like some
kind of info-prole, [you don't own the information you produce or the
means of realizing its value]{.underline}. [You **don't get to benefit
from its predictive power,** although you will likely **suffer the
downside when those predictions prove spurious**]{.underline}.
[Because]{.underline} this vast, [wonky information]{.underline} commons
that we are all producing [is privatized, it can be]{.underline} very
[hard to know how accurate or useful any of that information actually
is]{.underline}.13 Bullshit in = bullshit out. It becomes depressingly
familiar to learn that [**algorithms have been primed with racist and
sexist assumptions** about the people it is supposed to neutrally
observe]{.underline}.14 This is annoying at the level of consumer
profiling, but another thing entirely in the form of [algorithmic
policing]{.underline}.15 However, [i]{.underline}t'[s]{.underline} a
conversation frequently [sidetracked into the demand for a fairer
algorithm, **as if there could still be a neutral third
party**]{.underline} above our differences, from which to pray for not
much more than an equal right to be exploited by asymmetries of
information. These discriminatory aspects of the information political
economy need to be criticized and struggled over, but let's not lose
sight of the bigger picture. [That bigger picture is the information
political economy as a whole.]{.underline} Before focusing on what the
corporations who own and control information are doing to us, let's
[pause to look at the peculiarities of the information
itself]{.underline}.16 [Information is]{.underline} a rather
[strange]{.underline} thing. Contrary to the popular understanding,
there's **[nothing ideal or immaterial about it]{.underline}**.17
[Information only exists when there's a]{.underline} **[material
substrate of matter and energy to store, transmit, and process
it]{.underline}**. **[Information is part of a material
world]{.underline}**. But it's a strange part. The word information is
hardly new, but [the science of information is]{.underline} very
[new]{.underline}; it is a postwar creation.18 [Information is
now]{.underline} such a [pervasive]{.underline} organizing force that it
has seeped into our worldview. 19 What we think of as
"[technology]{.underline}" these days very often [means technologies
that instrumentalize information]{.underline}. These are specific kinds
of apparatus that gather, sort, manage, and process information so that
it can then be used to control other things in the world. [Information
technology is a]{.underline} sort of [meta-technology]{.underline},
designed [to observe, measure, record, control, and predict what things,
people, or indeed other information can or will or should
do]{.underline}. These technologies made information very, very cheap
and very, very abundant. [They gave rise to a]{.underline} strange kind
of [political economy]{.underline}, one [based]{.underline} not only on
a scarcity of things but also [on an excess of information]{.underline}.
This generated quite novel kinds of problems for those who had (or
aspired to) power: **[how to maintain forms of class inequality,
oppression, domination, and exploitation, based on something that in
principle is now ridiculously abundant]{.underline}.** My proposition in
this book is that [resolving this contradiction called into being **a
new mode of production**]{.underline}. **[This is not capitalism
anymore; it is something worse.]{.underline}** The dominant ruling class
of our time no longer maintains its rule through the ownership of the
means of production as capitalists do. Nor through the ownership of land
as landlords do. **[The dominant ruling class]{.underline}** of our time
**[owns and controls information]{.underline}**.

#### Capital is Dead. The myth of history must be disenchanted as critical theories fall into reproduced sameness -- we can't go to the archive and call it truth. Increasing abstraction of commodification of information has produced a new class relation -- the vectoralist and hacker classes are a layer-on-top, a piece of information that must be considered to avoid total environmental collapse. Make some Noise and generate a new form of thought for our times.

\"Capital is dead\", Introduction)//gideon

[Why is there so much resistance to]{.underline} even [thinking about
whether]{.underline} all [this is a component of a new mode of
production]{.underline}? I start in Chapter 1 with why **[we want to
believe this is capitalism even if we hate it]{.underline}**. If you
take a step back, this really does seem a bit odd. [Even its
opponents]{.underline} have [started to imagine that Capital is
eternal]{.underline}. Perhaps it's time to ask whether the concept of
[Capital]{.underline} has [ended up being]{.underline} rather [more of a
**theological** production than Marx would have intended]{.underline}.
Hence Capital is Dead proceeds along two lines at once. It makes a
minimally plausible case that the thesis of a new mode of production is
worth investigating, and at the same time it is a critical account of
how we got stuck trying to explain all emerging phenomena as if they
were always expressions of the same eternal essence of Capital. Most
**[Marxists]{.underline}** like to [think they have separated themselves
from religion]{.underline} [but]{.underline} have **[made a religion
of]{.underline}** this **[separation]{.underline}**.35 If Capital is to
function as a historical concept, then the question of how and when it
ends has to be an open one. Where we seem to have ended up is with a not
very logical but still emotionally compelling way of thinking: [since
communism has not prevailed, this must still be capitalism]{.underline}.
The reality and the language of the present are anchored in an imaginary
future. The challenge is to [disenchant this myth of
history]{.underline} without losing the ability to think of historical
time as having other possibilities.36 [Critical theories of the culture
industry tend to stop short of thinking through the extent to
which]{.underline} **[the production of critical theory itself is now a
minor genre within the culture industry]{.underline}**. 37 It has some
of the characteristic hallmarks: [a repetition of received
ideas]{.underline}, [narrative forms that resolve in predictable ways, a
culture of exegesis that reproduces sameness]{.underline}. **[Critical
theory becomes hypocritical theory]{.underline}**. And so in Chapter 1,
I try to combine the critical impetus of Marx with approaches to writing
drawn from the historic avant-gardes that attempt to break from such
habits, which treat writing as a more open-ended material practice.
Perhaps [the writing of critical theory texts is part of the same
information political economy as everything else.]{.underline} Perhaps
[the]{.underline} distinctive [property form of the information
commodity saturates such objects]{.underline} as it does so many other
things. Perhaps [treating the archive of such texts as the archive of
private property is part of the problem]{.underline}. In Chapter 1, I
advocate another relation to the archive, to writing, one advanced by
the situationists: détournment. It works and plays as if writing were a
practice of a literary communism.38 After looking at habits of belief
and practices of writing, Chapter 2 elaborates on the thought experiment
that this may not be capitalism any more, but something worse. Here I
restate in condensed form an argument I first made in A Hacker Manifesto
(2004), updated to take account of the further unfolding of the
tendencies of this peculiar mode of production.39 Here I assign its
features some temporary names: I call the emerging ruling class [the
vectoralist class]{.underline}, because their class power [derives from
ownership and control of the vector of information]{.underline}. The
vector of information includes the capacity [to transmit, store, and
process information. It is the material means for
assembling]{.underline} so-called [big data and realizing its predictive
potential]{.underline}. The vectoralist class owns and controls
[patents]{.underline}, which [preserve monopolies on]{.underline} these
[technologies]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} owns or [controls the
brands and celebrities that galvanize attention. It owns the logistics
and supply chains that keep information in its proprietary
stacks]{.underline}. One thing that is distinctive about an information
political economy is the way [it instrumentalizes difference rather than
sameness]{.underline}. The farmer and worker produce units of
commodities that are equivalent within their kind. What I call [the
hacker class has to produce difference out of sameness.]{.underline} It
has to [make information that has enough novelty to be recognizable as
intellectual property,]{.underline} a problem that landed property or
commercial property does not have. [By hacker class I mean everyone who
produces new information out of old information]{.underline}, and not
just people who code for a living[. Part of the struggle]{.underline} of
our time [is to see a **common class interest** in all kinds of
information making]{.underline}, whether in the sciences, technology,
media, culture, or art. [What we all have in common is producing new
information but not owning the means to realize its value]{.underline}.
And yet the way we go about this is not quite the same thing as labor,
just as being a worker is not quite the same thing as being a farmer. As
is much clearer from Marx's political writings than from Capital, [there
are always many subordinate classes, just as there can be more than one
ruling class]{.underline}.40 [Modes of production are multiple and
overlapping]{.underline}. Chapter 3 asks whether developments in the
forces of production changed the relations of production and threw up a
new kind of ruling class with different interests. But this is not a
story where the forces of production are outside of historical struggle
and simply develop on their own. On the contrary, [the forces of
production take a form determined by a series of class struggles as
well]{.underline}. Who are the agents to that struggle? What role do
scientists and engineers play? Could things have turned out otherwise?
To even ask this involves questions about the selective tradition within
which we think about the twentieth century. 41 [What we imagine
happened]{.underline}, and who we imagine are the committed writers who
struggled in and against it, [is a picture mutilated by the Cold
War]{.underline}. 42 [The scientific left was stripped from the
picture]{.underline}. [They were Communists]{.underline} or fellow
travelers. [Their legacy has been suppressed, even on the
left]{.underline}. Here I present [the current state of the forces of
production not as some]{.underline} supposedly [inevitable
outcome]{.underline} of the metaphysics of technics [but]{.underline} as
[the result of a lost struggle over the form of technology and the labor
of creating new information in **scientific and technical
fields**]{.underline}. The first time something like [a
transnational]{.underline} farmer, worker, and hacker
[alliance]{.underline} was even [posited]{.underline} was [in the
thirties.]{.underline} It [was subsumed into the global struggle against
fascism and into Soviet realpolitik]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it
[was defeated (on both sides) by the Cold War.]{.underline} [One of the
consequences]{.underline} of defeat [is the **unchecked acceleration**
of more and more **abstract forms of commodification**]{.underline},
reaching from land to labor to information. [The instrumentalization of
information enables]{.underline} all of [the earth to appear as a
resource to be mobilized under the control of information]{.underline},
but where that control is based on [information]{.underline} that
[treats everything]{.underline}, [including information itself, as a
commodity]{.underline}. This might not be the commodity in its classical
form, as Marx thought it in the middle of the nineteenth century. 43
**[The commodity form is not eternal]{.underline}**. Commodification now
means not the appearance of a world of things but the appearance of a
world of information about things, including information about every
possible future state of those things that can be extrapolated from a
quantitative modeling of information extracted from the flux of the
state of things, more or less in real time.44 [A commodity today
appears]{.underline} as [nothing but a vector]{.underline},
[as]{.underline} a [potential fulfilled through the interface of
your]{.underline} phone or tablet or [computer]{.underline}. Looking
closely at the forces of production is not quite the same thing as the
study of technology. The difference is that the former asks questions
about agency, and in particular class agency. 45 Chapter 4 brings us to
a broader consideration of questions of class. Here, we look at what
distinguishes Marxist approaches to class from other sociological
theories. Once we have a means of analyzing class not just as a category
but as forms of antagonism, we can ask whether [new]{.underline} kinds
of [class relations may be emerging]{.underline}. [A class
antagonism]{.underline} may arise [out of]{.underline} relations of
[property]{.underline}, [authority]{.underline}, [or
expertise]{.underline}.46 If we combine thinking about emerging forces
of production with attention to class, we can ask whether the
[production of information as a force of production]{.underline} also
**[modifies class relations]{.underline}**. The information vector is
clearly connected to new kinds of property, authority, and expertise.
While based in patent and copyright, intellectual property as a suite of
near private property rights in all kinds of novel information is a
relatively new development.47 The evolution of these legal forms both
responds to and further enables changes in the forces of production.
Information also gave rise to new kinds of authority. **[We just don't
live in Foucault's Panopticon. It's far worse.]{.underline}** Whole new
fields of expertise have emerged quite recently, reshaping the
university and turning [the university itself into a site for managing
risk in the production of intellectual property]{.underline}. 48 Chapter
4 is a slice through the social formation, showing its workings in cross
section. Chapter 5 is a speculation on its genesis. It always seems
strange to me that people who imagine they are thinking like Marxists
offer a strictly idealist view of recent history: everything has changed
because of ideas, and those ideas are "neoliberal." These then become
policy and law through the agency of political actors.49 This seems to
me to betray every last principle of a materialist view of history. The
irony is that in order to think a materialist history in a really quite
"orthodox" way, one is forced to think in a heretical manner in relation
to received ideas on the intellectual left. The very same forces of
production that enable this unprecedented mobilization of the world in
the service of control through information also enable a science of the
earth which shows conclusively that [continuing to misvalue the whole of
the world can't go on]{.underline}. Sooner or later (but probably
[soon]{.underline}er), **[it will crash the whole climate system of the
planet]{.underline}**.50 Chapter 6 looks for ways to think about how
[the transformation of Capital]{.underline} beyond itself, [into
Vector]{.underline}, [comes in contact with]{.underline} the very thing
it lacks the means to properly know[: the earth as the home from which
it has expelled us]{.underline}. There are two classic ways to think
about capitalism being superseded by another mode of production. [Either
capitalism accelerates]{.underline} its movement [to the point of
qualitative transformation]{.underline}; [or the
proletariat]{.underline} that it produces as its own antagonist [negates
it from within]{.underline}.51 The problem is that [both of these are
merely social theories]{.underline}, or at best, social-technical
theories. [Neither puts history]{.underline} back [in the
context]{.underline} of natural history, and in the era [of the
Anthropocene]{.underline}, of [climate disruption and much
else]{.underline}, that is the **[information]{.underline}** that
**[must be included in our thinking]{.underline}** if it is to be at all
timely. 52 Chapter 6 adds two other kinds of historical narration into
the mix. The first extrapolates from natural history, looking for ways
we can learn about forms of organization of matter, energy, and
information that are adaptable and enduring. [Extrapolation is not
reductionist, its key proposition is that very different kinds of form
are possible at different scales of organization]{.underline}.
Extrapolation opens the door to creative and speculative ways of
producing collaborative knowledge across very different fields and
assembling corresponding social movements. [It's a way for the hacker
class to think and act as a class, producing]{.underline} not only
[collaborative knowledge]{.underline} but also experimental prototypes
of [another way of life]{.underline}. [The counterpoint]{.underline} to
this [is]{.underline} what I call [inertia]{.underline}. [How is it that
despite all the evidence that it is on a suicide mission]{.underline},
**[the current mode of production keeps accelerating toward
failure]{.underline}**? **[Why won't it change course]{.underline}**?
Where extrapolation stresses the possible connections between natural
history and social history, inertia stresses the difference. [We act in
and against a world that remains other to us]{.underline}. [Reduced to
**nothing but users**]{.underline}**,** and [our actions forced into the
commodity form]{.underline}, [our collective work and play produces a
world over and against us]{.underline}, one [that]{.underline} massively
[persists in its own habits of functioning]{.underline}.53 Worse,
[collective]{.underline} human [labor]{.underline} made a world for a
ruling class that [keeps making]{.underline} not only itself but us [in
its image]{.underline}. Extrapolation opens exciting possibilities for
thinking and acting collaboratively to build another civilization, here
in the ruins of this one. [Inertia is a sobering reminder of how hard
that is going to be]{.underline}. I conclude Capital is Dead with a
commentary on Raoul Peck's film The Young Karl Marx (2017). What I
stress there is how [Marx]{.underline} and his closest comrades [changed
the language and style of the progressive movements of their
time]{.underline}. T[hey freed themselves from received ideas, from
selective tradition,]{.underline} even [from radical selective
tradition]{.underline}. In vulgar terms: [they were punks]{.underline}.
**[Radicals can be the most conservative of people when it comes to
textology, or faith in the exegesis of the written word from the archive
as a form of knowledge]{.underline}**.54 [We have to produce and defend
knowledge]{.underline} in the face of a dominant ideology [that insists
that those texts are either useless or dangerous]{.underline}. (That it
is an ideology is clear from its insistence in these incompatible
faults). Wanting [to **move on from those cherished texts** is assumed
to be an attack on what they stood for]{.underline}. Sometimes the
moment comes to summon your inner punk rock goddess and **[do things
differently]{.underline}**. **[Make some noise]{.underline}**. **[Our
knowledge-production methods might have become a bit too genteel for the
times]{.underline}**. It may at least be a better way to channel one's
rage than ordering Patti Smith albums on Amazon. Chapter 7 defends
vulgar Marxism for its closeness to the everyday and to emerging
technics of cultural and critical production. Here I look at four kinds
of vulgar thinking, two from (or about) the twenties and two from the
sixties. These are vulgarians who know something about how developments
in the forces of production change the space of possibility for daily
life and daily struggle. Unlike more genteel kinds of critical theory,
they detect mutations in historical forms because they are not bound to
residual and archaic forms of cultural work. They are already multiple
and diverse, in terms of race, sex, sexuality, as the vulgar includes
all of those excluded or marginalized within genteel institutions. [For
years I was]{.underline} one of what the so-called alt-right calls [a
"cultural Marxist]{.underline}," [interested]{.underline} mostly [in
what happens in the political and cultural superstructures of modern
society, rather than in the technical and economic base.]{.underline}
However, [trying to understand culture will lead]{.underline} you
[to]{.underline} understanding [media]{.underline}, which will lead you
to try [to]{.underline} figure out some things about
[technology]{.underline}. Then it turns out that the genteel forms of
**[Western Marxist thinking]{.underline}** taught in universities for
several generations [now are **not good at understanding how the forces
of production actually work**]{.underline}.55 That requires some actual
technical knowledge and experience, or at least a willingness to concede
that others may know about such things and to learn from them. The
production of [counterhegemonic knowledge can]{.underline} really [only
be comradely and collaborative]{.underline}.56 We have to [start
from]{.underline} the [tensions]{.underline} apparent in the present and
freely adapt the textual resources from the past to that situation. This
might work better than starting with fidelity to the texts or events of
the past and ignoring anything in the present that does not conform to
them.57 I read Peck's film as celebrating a will to transform even this
closely cherished radical language in the interests of comprehending a
present historical time in terms that enable it to appear as actionable,
transformable. In that sense, it's a work of art that should give us
courage to not just repeat the received ideas, even those of dear old
Karl, but to embark on the collaborative production of a knowledge of
the present that might help lead us out if it.

#### The technocratic elite don't own the means of production anymore -- they own the vectors of information which we interact with every day, allowing for the constant extraction of surplus information from 'free labor'.

\"Capital is dead\", Introduction)//gideon

It is not just tech companies, however. As an example, [let's look at
a]{.underline} company that is hardly thought of as a tech sector
marvel, but which happens to be the largest private employer in the
United States: [Walmart]{.underline}.24 It's a company most would think
of as a retailer. [Walmart]{.underline} became famous both for selling
very cheap consumer products and also for its ruthless exploitation of
its workers and suppliers. On closer examination it [is more of a
logistics company]{.underline}, which succeeded also through using
information to organize the flows of goods and labor through its
distribution system. It was an early adopter among retailers of
computerization. It even bought its own satellite to more efficiently
manage its own data. Early on, founder [Sam]{.underline} [Walton
found]{.underline} likely [locations]{.underline} for stores [by
scouting from his own private plane]{.underline}, but this soon gave way
to a "data-driven" approach.25 [Walmart's infrastructure has a hub and
spoke form]{.underline}, with box stores clustered around distribution
centers. What is less well known is that [it has]{.underline} almost
**[as many data centers as physical distribution centers]{.underline}**,
and they are about as large. [The parts that the consumer
sees]{.underline}---the big box stores, the endless trucks on the
road---[are a **physical expression of a computerized logistical system
that determines where they will be and what they will do**]{.underline}.
It takes about as much infrastructure to organize the information as it
does to organize the distribution of the physical stuff that ends up on
the shelves, and with good reason: [those data centers have to analyze
all of the products and labor in motion and predict, out of every
possible combination, what disposition of goods and labor should come
next, and at every moment]{.underline}. [Those who shop there
generate]{.underline} a fair amount of [the information that drives the
company]{.underline}. [It is an **asymmetrical exchange**]{.underline}.
You get a cheap pack of twelve toilet rolls. [Walmart gets to add
information about your actions into a predictive model that governs its
business decisions]{.underline}. [Those who work for Walmart are
exploited labor]{.underline}. [So]{.underline} too [are]{.underline}
[those]{.underline} all the way [down the supply chain]{.underline} to
the factories and farms. And yet **[on top of that is something
else]{.underline}**: the extraction not just of physical labor from the
bodies of workers, but **[the extraction of information]{.underline}**
from shoppers [that Walmart does not even pay in exchange]{.underline}.
It is this additional process---this information extraction process
---that interests me. It turns out not to be unique to "tech," but
rather an [increasingly common "business model]{.underline}," and one
[not]{.underline} all that well [described by]{.underline} classical
[models of capitalism]{.underline}. Maybe [there are new forms of
exploitation, inequality, and asymmetry as a layer **on top of** the old
ones we're more used to]{.underline}. Let's take a look at the second
largest private employer in the United States: Amazon. It sells a
product called Echo, which you put in your home somewhere so it can spy
on you with its seven directional microphones. Some people are rather
suspicious of this, but somehow the [Amazon]{.underline} brand convinces
many that this is okay. The [Echo]{.underline} connects you to Alexa, an
artificial intelligence whose objective is to learn your habits, needs,
and desires---and service them. Over time it will get better at
servicing you with information and products, and it will add what it
learns from you to the matrix of what it knows about everybody. Your
job, for which you are not getting paid, is to train a machine to know
what the "human" is when seen entirely from the perspective of
consuming.26 Echo and Alexa also [hide from you everything that mediates
between your enunciation of a desire and Amazon's fulfillment of
it]{.underline}. [Echo is the **top layer of**]{.underline} what
Benjamin Bratton calls **[the stack]{.underline}**.27 Your desire has to
be parsed into a form a machine can understand; that's the job of this
interface layer. 28 The interface also positions you in relation to it,
and to the rest of the stack, as a particular kind of subject: you are a
user. Let's say you are a user who wants a book. You say: "Alexa, order
me a copy of Capital by Karl Marx." Once you confirm that this is what
you really want, this [information]{.underline} [will pass]{.underline}
[as]{.underline} if it were [a vector]{.underline}, a particular kind of
line, [through]{.underline} a whole other series of [layers of stack
infrastructure, which will return this product to you]{.underline},
either immediately (if it is an e-book) or in a day or two (if it is a
physical object). [Each]{.underline} such [expressed desire becomes a
unique vector]{.underline} [through]{.underline} a [layered space that
can fulfill an almost infinite number of desires]{.underline}, [so long
as they]{.underline} all [take the form of a user asking an interface to
satisfy a demand with a commodity]{.underline}. It does not really let
you want or be much else.29 Your desire becomes a vector that will pass
through many more layers of the stack. Bratton calls these the address,
city, cloud, and earth layers. The address layer knows where you are,
and it knows where the book that you want is, and it can calculate the
optimal return vector to get one to the other to fulfill this desire.
The city layer is where the physical part of the infrastructure resides.
There is a warehouse, somewhere.30 There is a server farm, somewhere;
there are Amazon offices that design and manage and sell all this
stuff---somewhere. The cloud layer connects all these sites and many
others together and performs the operations on the information gathered
from all of them not only to fulfill orders and manage every vector, but
also to learn from the aggregate of all of these actions and predict how
else to extract information from them.31 The earth layer is that from
which the resources and energy to make and run this whole vast edifice
to the digitized commodity are extracted.32 Those resources are fed into
sites of production that will make that book you ordered, or the
t-shirt, or the sex toy, or whatever. These sites of production too can
be anywhere. A sophisticated logistics tracks and manages the flows of
energy, labor, resources, and finished products through them.33 The
sites are usually where labor is cheap, exploitable, and held captive by
borders and where there are few environmental regulations, but where
there is a functional infrastructure of transport and shipping to move
the resources and labor to the factory and the products out to some
gated community nation in the overdeveloped part of the world where
people get to order books or phones or Echos from Amazon. Container
loads of those products sit, probably not for very long, in a warehouse
where workers known as pickers dash about retrieving the products to
meet the orders without even the time to stop for a toilet break, as all
of their movements are tracked and measured in real time.34 Certainly,
[a lot of what just happened]{.underline} here [could be called
capitalism]{.underline}. [Labor was corralled into factories and made to
work long hours to make stuff.]{.underline} Other [labor drove
trucks]{.underline} or sat in call centers answering calls from irate
users whose stuff did not arrive. [But]{.underline} maybe [there is
something else here]{.underline} as well. [Not just the exploitation of
labor]{.underline} through the owning and controlling of the forces of
production, [but also the **extraction of**]{.underline} what you might
call **[surplus information]{.underline}**, out [of]{.underline}
individual [workers and consumers]{.underline}, in order t[o build
predictive models which further subordinate all activity to
the]{.underline} same [information political economy]{.underline}. One
where [you are nothing but a user]{.underline}, and [everything you do
within hearing range of Echo,]{.underline} or [every
movement]{.underline} you make [with your cellphone]{.underline}, or
[everything]{.underline} you do [on your laptop]{.underline}, or
everything recorded of you or about you as you go about your daily life,
[is captured by a vector and fed into computation to figure out how
better to use you for the greater glory of Amazon, Google, Apple or some
other company]{.underline}, [owned and controlled by a]{.underline} new
kind of [ruling class]{.underline}, **[the vectoralist
class]{.underline}**. To the vector the spoils.

#### It\'s worse than capitalism -- a self-consuming, ever accelerating system eats our brains instead of our bodies. Data asymmetry from internet searches, DNA lookups, banks, retail, and mapping software aggregates a vectoral power that is at the root of technological problems, financialization, neoliberalism, and biopolitics. This cannot be understood with genteel high theory -- The 20^th^ century is long gone

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 2: Capitalism---or Worse?)//gideon

So how is this worse than capitalism? [The vectoral infrastructure
throws]{.underline} all of [t**he world into**]{.underline} **[the
engine of commodification]{.underline}**, meanwhile **[modifying the
commodity form itself]{.underline}**. [There is nothing that can't
be]{.underline} tagged and [captured through information]{.underline}
about it and considered a variable in the simulations that drive
resource extraction and processing.26 Quite simply, [we have run out of
world to commodify.]{.underline} And now [commodification
can]{.underline} only [cannibalize its own means of
existence]{.underline}, both natural and social. It's like that Marx
Brothers film where [the train runs out of firewood, so the
carriages]{.underline} themselves [have to be]{.underline} hacked to
pieces and [fed to the fire]{.underline} to keep it moving, [until
nothing but the]{.underline} bare [bogies are left]{.underline}.27 It is
worse also in that rather than some acephalous multitude, they are
complex class alliances and conflicts at play. 28 The trickiest part of
it is the politics of [the hacker class]{.underline}, which after all is
the class most of us here reading and writing this stuff belong to. Yes,
it appears as a "privileged" class, among those whom Bruce Robbins calls
the beneficiaries of global relations of exploitation.29 And it is a
class that [has a]{.underline} very [hard time thinking its common
interests]{.underline}, [because the kinds of new information its
various subfractions produce are all so different]{.underline}. We have
a hard time thinking what the writer and the scientist and artist and
the engineer have in common. Well, [the vectoral class does not have
that problem]{.underline}. What all of us make is [intellectual
property]{.underline}, which from its point of view [is]{.underline} as
[equivalent and]{.underline} as [tradable]{.underline} as pink goo. [The
hacker class experiences]{.underline} extremes of a [**winner-take-all**
outcome of its efforts]{.underline}. On the one hand, [fantastic careers
and]{.underline} the spoils of some simulation of the old bourgeois
lifestyle; on the other hand, [precarious]{.underline} and part-time
[work]{.underline}, [start-ups that go bust]{.underline}, and the making
routine of our jobs by new algorithms---designed by others of our very
own class. [The hacker class]{.underline} was supposed to be a
privileged one, shielded from proletarianization by its creativity and
technical skill. But it too [can be made casual and
precarious]{.underline}. A controversial ad campaign for the website
[Fiverr embodied]{.underline} all [these contradictions]{.underline}. It
played on the desire to quit one's lousy job and become a boss, by
offering the pleasure of subjecting others to the tyranny one feels as a
precarious creative or technical employee these days. [The ads promise a
way to hire]{.underline} versions of your old self who are
"[doers]{.underline}." The most notorious ad showed a black and white
picture of a hollow-cheeked, sad-eyed young woman staring directly at
the viewer: "You eat a coffee for lunch. You follow through on your
follow through. Sleep deprivation is your drug of choice," it reads,
concluding: "You might be a doer." Another slogan was "Nothing like a
safe, reliable paycheck to crush your soul." And "How much did you make
for your boss today?" The one I most often saw defaced read "White
Collars Can Come With Leashes." The slogans appear under pictures of [a
"diverse" workforce]{.underline}, of course: the algorithm is in theory
very **[tolerant about who it exploits]{.underline}**. [The old dream of
labor, that it could organize itself, is supposed to be
dead]{.underline}. **[There can be no dream of the hacker class to
self-organize]{.underline}** in any way, whether like labor or in some
other form. Such desires are unspeakable, even if they keep erupting in
all sorts of interesting ways. Sanctioned desire is neatly summed up in
the image and slogan of a cellphone company: "Boss Revolution." The
image is of a raised fist, with a cellphone in it, in red[. **The only
desire** permissible **is to become a boss**]{.underline}, like Don
Draper. [This has not stopped]{.underline} some interesting and
promising signs of hacker self-organization in technical and creative
industries, from the [unionization of creatives at Vice Media to the
Google walkout to refusal to work on border control or military projects
across the tech industry]{.underline}. 30 Baby steps, to be sure; it is
always a tough argument to propose common interests among subordinate
classes. [Counter-hegemony is hard. Hackers]{.underline}, like workers
or farmers, [are distracted by]{.underline} particular and [local
interests]{.underline}. As with other subordinate classes, [class
consciousness is rare]{.underline} among hackers. [Most]{.underline} of
us [are]{.underline} rather [reactionary]{.underline}, even in the
nontechnical trades. But then [class consciousness is always a rare and
difficult thing]{.underline}. Unlike other identities, [it has to be
argued contrary to appearances]{.underline}. The feeling of [belonging
to a class rarely extends beyond appearances]{.underline}. It appears
that one is a "creative" or working in "tech," for example. There could
be a myriad of such classes. As we shall see in Chapter 4, this [self-
understanding of class restricts itself to appearances and
masks]{.underline} not an essence but [a structural question as to how
one's efforts end up being commodified and who reaps]{.underline} most
of [the benefit]{.underline} of that. The received ideas within which
one is asked to think about one's identity don't help when it comes to
thinking how one is located within an information political economy, one
where the hidden side of appearances is not eternal essence, just things
one usually doesn't see---the forces of production. [To come into an
awareness of class is to speak another language]{.underline}. It is to
**[refuse the terms that are given and seek other terms]{.underline}**,
other concepts. This can be difficult. I can tell you from experience:
the American college students that I meet cannot even pronounce
[bourgeoisie]{.underline}, let alone conceptualize it. Everything it
once meant culturally [has evaporated]{.underline}. [The outward
signs]{.underline} and styles [of the ruling class don't look
bourgeois]{.underline}. Our newstyle overlords only wear suits when
called before Congress; otherwise [they wear discreetly expensive
t-shirts]{.underline}. You don't see them cutting ribbons at factory
openings. They don't preach hard work and thrift; they preach
creativity, mindfulness, and ethical consumption. The bourgeois culture
with which generations of Marxist aesthetics had a love---hate
relationship is effectively extinct. The ruling class is not what it
used to be. Maybe it needs another name. What is even harder is to name
those whose location in the political economy of information is the
making of new information. It isn't exactly labor, as it's not the same
thing every day; it's a different thing every day. [Output is not
quantifiable]{.underline} in increments, although that won't stop the
vectoralist class from trying. One popular attempt to describe them (us)
was as [the creative class?]{.underline}31 More radical approaches have
called what we do immaterial labor or postfordist labor, and us the
cognitariat?32 But [there's something]{.underline} a bit [mystifying
about the language of creativity]{.underline}, something a bit idealist
about the immaterial, something backward looking about just adding a
modifier, and something of a rationalist bias in the category of
cognition, given that the management of feelings can be part of our job
description, too.33 [I opted to call us the hacker class. Twenty years
ago, that was]{.underline} perhaps too [romantic]{.underline} a term, on
the border of legality, outside the logic of commodification.34 [Now it
has]{.underline} more exclusively [criminal associations]{.underline}.
If anything, **[it's an index of how much the vectoralist class has
succeeded]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} all but
[inconceivable]{.underline} now [that there could be an]{.underline}
open-ended, playful, [experimental approach to making the
new]{.underline} appear [out of the old in]{.underline} techniques of
[information that would not be]{.underline} entirely [contained with the
commodification and control of the information vector]{.underline}. But
just [as the industrial working class retained a utopian feeling about
what labor should be]{.underline} like from craft labor, so too [it is
possible to hold]{.underline} onto [a feeling about what it's like to
make elegance appear that wasn't there before]{.underline} with a
technique for transforming information, and to do it on one's own time,
[with one's own goals and objectives]{.underline}.35 [That is what it
might mean to hack]{.underline}. Some of the more compelling scenes in
both Mad Men and Halt and Catch Fire try to find a televisual language
for these joyful moments, caught though they are, as the narrative arc
reminds us, within the commodification of information. [To think that
one's class is the hacker class might]{.underline} now [be]{.underline}
not unlike [repurposing]{.underline} the word queer, or any of the other
negatively charged terms that those so designated reclaim with
pride---just [as Marx and Engels reclaimed the word
communist]{.underline} from its denouncers in the opening poetic gambit
of the Manifesto. [That was]{.underline} an artful bit of
**[détournement]{.underline}**. They refunctioned found language from
the common store, deleted false meaning, pasted in fresh ones. **[To
clear a space for thought is to work in and against language, to put
some pressure on it]{.underline}**. What if we took a more daring,
modernist, defamiliarizing approach to writing theory? [What if we asked
of theory as a genre that it be as interesting]{.underline}, as strange,
[as]{.underline} poetically or [narratively rich as]{.underline} we ask
our [other kinds of literature]{.underline} to be? [What if we treated
it **not as high theory**, with pretentions to legislate or
interpret]{.underline} other genres, [**but as low theory**,
as]{.underline} something [**vulgar, common**, even]{.underline} a bit
[rude]{.underline} ---[having no greater or lesser claim to speak of the
world than any other]{.underline}?36 It might be more fun to read. It
might tell us something strange about the world[. It might]{.underline},
just might, [enable us to act]{.underline} in the world otherwise. A
world in which the old faith in History is no more, but where there are
histories that still might be made--- in a pinch. [The end of the
dominance of capitalism]{.underline} as a mode of production [is not a
subject that has received]{.underline} much useful
[attention]{.underline}. [For its devotees, it has no end]{.underline},
as it is itself the end of History. 37 [For its enemies, it can end only
in Communism]{.underline}. If Communism---a state that exists mostly in
the imaginal realm, [always deferred into the future]{.underline}---has
not prevailed, then this by definition must still be the reign of
Capital. Let's pause for a moment over the ideological freight attached
to this poetic conceit and its consequences: **[the present is
defined]{.underline}** mostly **[in terms of a hoped-for negation of
it]{.underline}**. [Some theology]{.underline}! [If capitalism is to be
of any use as a historical concept]{.underline}, then [the question of
its end has to remain]{.underline} an [open]{.underline} one. The
thought experiment as to whether it may already have been surpassed by
another dominant mode ought at least to be one that can be posed. [The
concept of Capital is theological]{.underline} precisely to [the extent
that questions of its]{.underline} possible [surpassing]{.underline} by
other exploitative modes of production [remain off limits]{.underline}.
How then can a concept of capitalism be returned to its histories? By
abandoning the duality of its essence and appearance. [Theories of the
eternal quality of Capital's essence]{.underline}, its unity and
identity through time, tend to [focus on the]{.underline} analysis of
the [relations of production]{.underline}. One can extract from Marx's
Capital a quite remarkable theoretical armature that appears in the
negative through the critique of the theological concepts of bourgeois
political economy. This conceptual armature is so robust that [there are
few phenomena that resist interpretation as surface appearances of these
concepts when posited as a hidden essence. Two things **slip from
view**]{.underline} in this procedure. First, [that **the bourgeois
political economy**]{.underline} that Marx took as the object of
critique [i**s now itself a museum piece**]{.underline}.38 Second, that
in this focus on the relations of production, **[the forces of
production receive very little attention]{.underline}**. [We
don't]{.underline} spend [enough time on how the brain-fryer
is]{.underline} a [different]{.underline} machine [from the meat
grinder]{.underline}. This is something of a problem, as surely the
dynamism of those forces of production under capitalism was one of the
salient points of the theory in the first place. But [where **the
relations of production can be understood theoretically**, **the forces
of production cannot**]{.underline}. [They **don't lend themselves to an
abstract, conceptual overview by a master thinker within a genteel high
theory**. They can]{.underline} really [only be known through the
**collaborative production** of a critical theory sharing the
experiences of many fields]{.underline}. [That would include those with
a **knowledge of information technology, artificial intelligence, supply
chain management, material science, computational biology**, and much
else]{.underline} besides. [We're]{.underline} way [past]{.underline}
the [steam engines]{.underline} that Marx was sketching in his
notebooks.39 Is it not possible, then, that there have been sufficient
transformations in the forces of production to break out of the fetters
of a strictly capitalist mode of production? There are two versions of
this question. One is looking for a theological justification for this
appearance of something new as finally putting an end to the more
troubling aspects of capitalism for vectoralist class apologetics. But
the more salient version of the question might be to [ask whether what
has emerged]{.underline}, in addition to and laminated on top of a
capitalist mode of production, [is something]{.underline} qualitatively
[different]{.underline}, but [which generates new forms of class
domination]{.underline}, new forms of the extraction of surplus, even
new kinds of class formation. The emergence of [information as a
material force of production]{.underline} looked for a while like it
[might escape the confines of existing relations of production
and]{.underline} that it could [negate existing property
forms]{.underline}. (I return to this topic in Chapter 4). It looked for
a while as though [the one thing that]{.underline} really [could form
the basis of the commons was information]{.underline}. [It blew apart
the]{.underline} old [culture industry]{.underline}. Producers of
information started to think not just about their craft or trade
interests but about a class interest. Or so it looked early in the
twenty-first century when I wrote A Hacker Manifesto. What I did not
anticipate was the emergence of a whole other technique for the capture
of creation. While there are still elements among the ruling class that
want to confine creation within ever stricter forms of private property,
some took the opposite tack. [Rather than police or restrict free
creation]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} other [strategy]{.underline}
[was to move its capture to a]{.underline} more [abstract
level]{.underline}. [The production of information can be
**outsourced**]{.underline} to free labor, [to people who work but
**need not**]{.underline} even [**be paid**, and the aggregate value of
their]{.underline} production of [information can then be]{.underline}
captured and treated as a resource that can be
**[monetized]{.underline}**.40 [This]{.underline} [new]{.underline} kind
of [ruling class does not appropriate]{.underline} a quantity of
[surplus value so much as **exploit an asymmetry of
information**]{.underline}. **[It gives]{.underline}**, sometimes even
**[as a gift]{.underline}**, **[access to]{.underline}** the location of
a piece of **[information]{.underline}** [for which you are
**searching**]{.underline}.41 [Or]{.underline} it lets you [assemble
your own]{.underline} **[social network]{.underline}**. [Or]{.underline}
it lets you [perform a]{.underline} particular **[financial
transaction]{.underline}**. [Or]{.underline} it [gives]{.underline} you
**[coordinates]{.underline}** on the planet and what can be found at
that location. [Or]{.underline} it will even [tell you]{.underline} some
things [about your]{.underline} own **[DNA]{.underline}**.
[Or]{.underline} it will [provide a]{.underline} logistical
[**infrastructure**]{.underline} for your small business. [But while you
get that]{.underline} [little]{.underline} piece of
[information]{.underline}, **[this ruling class gets all of that
information in]{.underline}** the **[aggregate]{.underline}**. **[It
exploits the asymmetry between the little you know and the aggregate it
knows]{.underline}**---an aggregate it collects [based on information
you were]{.underline} [obliged to "volunteer]{.underline}." In practice,
[this]{.underline} emergent [ruling class]{.underline} of our time
[insists on the confinement of]{.underline} particular acts of [creation
within the property form and access to collective creative
activity]{.underline}, [from which to harvest information]{.underline}
in the aggregate. [This is the vectoralist class.]{.underline} If the
capitalist class owns the means of production, **[the vectoralist class
owns the vectors of information]{.underline}**. They own the extensive
[vectors of **communication**]{.underline}, which **[traverse
space]{.underline}**. They own the intensive [vectors of
**computation**,]{.underline} which **[accelerate time]{.underline}**.
They own the **[copyrights]{.underline}**, the [**patents**,
and]{.underline} the **[trademarks]{.underline}** that
**[capture]{.underline}** attention or assign
**[ownership]{.underline}** to novel techniques. They own the
[logistic]{.underline} [systems]{.underline} that [manage]{.underline}
and monitor [the disposition and movement of any resource]{.underline}.
They own the [financial instruments that stand in for]{.underline} the
[value]{.underline} of every resource and that can be put out on markets
to crowdsource the possible value of every possible future combination
of those resources. They own [the algorithms that rank and
sort]{.underline} and assign particular [information]{.underline} in
particular circumstances. [This **vectoralist class comes to
dominate**]{.underline} [not just subordinate classes, but]{.underline}
**[other ruling classes as well]{.underline}**. Just as capital came to
dominate landed property, subsuming its control over land in a more
abstract and fungible property form, so too [the vectoralist class has
**subsumed and outflanked capital**]{.underline} in a more abstract
form. The capitalist class finds itself at a disadvantage. [Owning the
means of production]{.underline}, labor materialized into capital in the
sense of plant and equipment, [is]{.underline} a [rigid and
long-term]{.underline} investment. [Owning]{.underline} and controlling
[the vector]{.underline}, the hack of new information materialized into
patents, copyrights, brands, proprietary logistics. It [is more
abstract, flexible, adaptive]{.underline}. It is not more rational, but
it is more abstract. The vectoralist class monopolizes the crossroads
where information traffics, feeding like Michel Serres's parasite on the
buzz of information and noise at crucial junctures.42 The most obvious
aspect of vectoral rule in everyday life is its monopoly of attention,
although it is not reducible to this. As Yves Citton notes,
[in]{.underline} a world awash in [digital data]{.underline}, [what is
rare is]{.underline} the [attention]{.underline} paid to it.43
[**Commanding attention** through the ownership and control of brands,
celebrities and media "properties" is the]{.underline} public face, the
[**disintegrating spectacle,** of vectoral economy.]{.underline} 44 In
part, [this descends from]{.underline} what was formerly [the culture
industry]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} it is [no longer an industry
apart, commodified leisure. It's now integrated into the whole of
production and consumption.]{.underline} This brief sketch of the
supersession of capitalism as a dominant mode has the advantage of
enabling many of the features of contemporary life that are often
treated as separate to appear as aspects of the same historical
development. [The **rise of technology, financialization, neoliberalism,
and biopolitics** appear as **effects of the same transformation** of
the forces of production]{.underline}, putting pressure on the relations
of production, to the point where what bursts forth is a new ruling
class formation. In the usual historical narrative, [by the end of the
seventies]{.underline}, the forces of [labor]{.underline} had [fought
capital to a standstill]{.underline} in the overdeveloped world.45 In
this story, [financialization and neoliberalism come to the rescue.
**But how**?]{.underline} [**What** material means **made
financialization** even **possible**]{.underline}? What underlying
social forces enabled neoliberal ideas to even appear plausible as
policy instruments? [Why does this **coincide with the**]{.underline}
apparent **[birth of "tech"]{.underline}** as an
**[industry]{.underline}** sector? In the thought experiment I am
sketching, all of [these developments fit together]{.underline} in a
novel way. [The capitalist class was searching for a way out of
the]{.underline} impasse of confronting the [demands of
labor]{.underline} at a time when improvements of the old means of
production no longer yielded much by way of a productivity increase.
[The capitalist class]{.underline} thought it [found a way out by
**replacing labor with the vector**]{.underline} and escaping along it.
**[Globalization, deindustrialization, and outsourcing]{.underline}**
would [enable]{.underline} it [to be **free from the power of labor to
block the flows of production**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} same
information [vector]{.underline} [would enable]{.underline} not just a
more abstract and flexible kind of production, but also of
[consumption]{.underline}, [through the financialization of everyday
life]{.underline}.46 Workers as producers found their jobs had moved
elsewhere; [workers as consumers found their purchasing power
restored]{.underline}--- at least [temporarily]{.underline}. **[Here's
the twist]{.underline}**: [what]{.underline} at first [appeared to
assist capital to defeat labor]{.underline} in the overdeveloped world
[was]{.underline} also **[a defeat for capital]{.underline}**. The
[novel]{.underline} forces of [production]{.underline} that enabled this
outflanking of labor [became]{.underline} themselves the new
[dominant]{.underline} forces of production. [Power over the value chain
moves]{.underline} from the ownership and control of the means of
production [to ownership and control of the vectors]{.underline} of
information. Whole new industries arose, as did whole new
corporations---the so-called tech sector. But actually [**all
corporations** become]{.underline} increasingly **[organized
around]{.underline}** the ownership and control of
**[information]{.underline}**. [Control over]{.underline} the value
chain through ownership of the [information]{.underline} vector
[extends]{.underline} even **[into life itself]{.underline}**. This is
not the least reason, incidentally, [that it is no longer helpful to
posit the vitalism of living labor against capital as dead
labor]{.underline}. 47 [Not capital but **the vector enters the flesh**
and commands it]{.underline}, and not just as meat, but also **[as
information]{.underline}**, [through **monitoring**]{.underline} its
states, through **[modifying]{.underline}** its functions [with
drugs]{.underline} that alter chemical signals, through [**patenting**
aspects of life as design]{.underline}.48 [What is at stake is neither a
bios nor a polis but a regime of property in information extending into
the organism]{.underline}. [The novel forces of production]{.underline}
as they have emerged in our time [are]{.underline} [also forces of
reproduction]{.underline} [and]{.underline} forces of
[circulation]{.underline}. [The power of the vectoralist class is
not]{.underline} [cognitive]{.underline}; [nor]{.underline} is it a
power over the general [intellect]{.underline}.49 [It
thrives]{.underline} just as well [on noise]{.underline}, on
volatility[, on bad information as it does on]{.underline} any kind of
[intelligence or reason]{.underline}.50 [It reaches]{.underline} just as
[far into]{.underline} the [corporeality and]{.underline} even
[sexuality]{.underline} of the human as it does into the intellect.51
[The]{.underline} forms of [**artificial computational order** it is
creating are **not extensions or imitations of human cognition** but
**something else entirely**]{.underline}. 52 [One **cannot interpret**
the]{.underline} strangeness of this mode of [production
**using**]{.underline} the received **[hermeneutic conceptual
categories]{.underline}**, derived as they are [from a critique of the
relations of production of nineteenth-century steam-powered
capitalism]{.underline}. Indeed, one sees now how incomplete Marx's
critique was and remains. Even his critical understanding of capitalism
is still thinking capitalism metaphorically as like a giant,
dysfunctional steam engine, set to blow at any moment from unregulated
internal pressures.53 **[Marx is not able to think critically about
information]{.underline}** in the contemporary sense of the concept
because it is not one that the forces of production of his time have yet
produced. Marx found what was absent in the theories of Capital in his
time. He lifted the veil between exchange and production and found the
exploited labor that makes it. He wrote the heresy that Capital is dead
labor--- congealed pink goo---and he went on to write from the point of
view of the labor that capital exploits. So: [let's go looking for what
is absent in]{.underline} theories of both [Capital and
information]{.underline} in our time. Let's find [that peculiar class
who own and control information]{.underline}. Let's find [the exploited
class or classes that make it and are subjected to it]{.underline}. In
vulgar terms: [the capitalist class eats our bodies, **the vectoralist
class eats our brains**]{.underline}. Returning this thought experiment
to the present, one might then be able to think the historical
specificity of the contemporary moment. This, after all, was
[Marx's]{.underline} great achievement. He [thought his
moment]{.underline}. His present did not look to him like his past. It
had novel features that called into being concepts adequate to the
situation. Which leaves us with the paradoxical and provocative thought
that [any theory in which **the present appears as**]{.underline} in
essence [the same]{.underline} as the past of **[Marx's
time]{.underline}**, only different in a few matters of appearance,
**[can't]{.underline}** really **[be]{.underline}** a
"**[Marxist]{.underline}**" one, as [such fidelity is]{.underline}
necessarily [a betrayal of his achievement]{.underline}. Debord: "And
**[theories are made to die in the war of time]{.underline}**."54
Perhaps [we can **leave**]{.underline} such **[theological questions to
the faithful]{.underline}**, who are in any case an embattled and
diminished band. [Instead]{.underline}, here is a research agenda: [what
are the **current forces of production**]{.underline}, and how can they
be understood (in a preliminary way) under a modest set of concepts?
[How do those]{.underline} forces of production [give rise to
contemporary forms of class power]{.underline}, and [how has that
power]{.underline} in turn [shaped]{.underline} the particular form
[those forces of production]{.underline} have taken? [At what points
might the subordinate classes,]{.underline} obliged to live within the
world those forces of production make in the interests of those ruling
class, [be able to assert agency]{.underline} and autonomy? **[What
other world is still possible]{.underline}**, given the damage this
general economy has done to the world, with the means that it has
hitherto developed?55

#### The rationalization of information has created a new class relation -- power comes from surveillance and quantification. We sit in desks and fill in excel documents for hours under the guise of 'technical freedom', our information commodified. As long as the vector is owned by the few, propped up by both sides who attempt to analyze and justify using the outdated language of marx, the system won't change.

My question here would be: [why would one think, if this has already
given rise to more than one kind of rationalization of class antagonism
that overlapped and interfered with each other, that it would not give
rise to another]{.underline}? [The farmer--landlord antagonism arose out
of]{.underline} the antagonism between [serfs and the
nobility]{.underline}. 26 Serfs lost their lands by force or debt and
fled to the cities, while a rationalization of agricultural production
led to the expansion of a surplus that might feed urban populations, who
would become urban workers, in an antagonistic relation to capitalists.
And [yet landlords and capitalists]{.underline} also had interests that
[contradicted each other]{.underline}. But did rationalization stop,
with the creation of classes of farmer and worker? [What happens when
the **production**]{.underline}, not of food or products, but **[of new
information itself becomes rationalized]{.underline}**? Weber did not
have a lot to say about labor, but where he did, it was in terms of work
discipline. Employers are free to hire and fire. Workers lack ownership,
but workers are responsible for their own social reproduction. These are
the conditions under which indirect compulsion operates. But it raises
the problem of how to get maximum labor effort. Wright: "running
throughout Weber's work is the view that rationalization has perverse
effects that systematically threaten human dignity and welfare."27 But
Weber does not integrate interest in labor discipline and domination
into the category of class. Here we need a bit of Marx, for whom, as
Wright says, "exploitation infuses class analysis with a specific kind
of normative concern."28 Exploitation steers research to questions of
class as relational in both exchange and production. "Weber's treatment
of work effort as primarily a problem of economic rationality directs
class analysis towards a set of normative concerns centered above all on
the interests of capitalists: efficiency and rationalization."29
Wright's synthesis of Marx and Weber makes exploitation fundamental even
as it makes particular use of the idea of opportunity hoarding as that
which defines the "middle class." From there one could build up a
picture of [the United States as highly polarized by
exploitation]{.underline}, a country where [middle class opportunity
hoarding is being eroded by]{.underline} what he calls [neoliberalism
and deindustrialization]{.underline}. I think this can be understood
more clearly in terms of [new forces of production]{.underline} that
[instrumentalize and rationalize information]{.underline}, [giving rise
to new property forms and]{.underline} hence [new class
relations]{.underline}, [including an **antagonistic relation between a
hacker class tasked with making novelty out of
information**]{.underline} (the condition of it becoming property)
**[and a vectoralist class that owns or controls the vector of
information control and domination itself]{.underline}**. [The
separation of the vectoralist--hacker class antagonism from the
capitalist--worker antagonism emerges out of the development of the
forces of production]{.underline}, [which generated a]{.underline}n
extensive and intensive [rationalization]{.underline}---
[or]{.underline} better yet, **[abstraction---of the production of
information]{.underline}**. As Adorno and Horkheimer pointed out in
their own synthesis of Marx and Weber, the **[rationalization of means
serves irrational ends]{.underline}**, not least in [treating nature as
a mere thing to be exploited in the same manner as the working
class]{.underline} is exploited, thr[ough the subordination of
everything to the commodity form]{.underline}.30 [Each successive form
of class]{.underline} rule [may be more abstract]{.underline} than those
it subsumes, [but it isn't more rational]{.underline}. [The antagonism
internal to the vectoralist--hacker class relation has all three
components]{.underline} of a class relation: [property, authority, and
expertise]{.underline}. [It emerges]{.underline} in the first instance
[out of a]{.underline} **[rationalization of]{.underline}** so-called
**[intellectual property law]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline}
increasingly [encloses]{.underline} **[information in]{.underline}**
something close to **[a private property right]{.underline}**.
[Vectoralist domination]{.underline} over all subordinate classes [is
sustained by the automation of relations of authority]{.underline},
which take the form of **[pervasive surveillance and
quantification]{.underline}**---a **[rationalization of]{.underline}**
all aspects of **[human activity]{.underline}**. Domination through
expertise turns out to be an interesting and subtle question. The rise
of the vectoralist class changes the kinds of [credentials
that]{.underline} appear to [have value]{.underline} for class power.
These [became increasingly technical]{.underline} in nature. Access to
such qualifications appears to offer the possibility of class mobility.
Here the perspectives of Weber and Durkheim are useful supplements.
[Opportunity hoarding through control of access to elite credentials
sustains social closure]{.underline} and the exercise of occupational
power through expertise. Since both men and women, not to mention women
of color, sometimes have elite credentials in the formal sense, their
exclusion ends up being enforced by more old-fashioned means of
authority and domination, [through the "toxic work
environment]{.underline}." A lot more could be said about that. Here I
simply add the possibility of an additional axis of class antagonism, in
addition to property, authority, and expertise. This is what we might
call [the technical dimension of class antagonism]{.underline}, where it
[is built into the form of the information vector itself]{.underline}.
This has many aspects, from the design of [algorithms determining credit
to]{.underline} the development of [object-oriented programming
environments, which allow]{.underline} for [the rationalization of the
production of component parts of programming by a dispersed and
disempowered hacker class while preserving central control of
proprietary code]{.underline}. Rather than domination or exploitation,
this form of class antagonism emerges out of asymmetries of information
and protocols of selective access and control.31 Forms not only of class
but also of [**gendered and racialized discrimination** have migrated
from relations of property, authority, and expertise and have been
encoded as]{.underline} technical (or [**algorithmic**) forms of
**power**]{.underline}. 32 [Thinking about class antagonism today
might]{.underline} then [require]{.underline} two steps. For the first,
we are indebted to Wright: Durkheim's interest in the moves of the game
and Weber's interest in the rules of the game can be folded into Marx's
larger perspective, on the changing of the game itself. But for the
second step, we are on our own: [in the absence of faith in the leap
into a gamespace without domination and exploitation]{.underline}, [we
have to]{.underline} **[reimagine the possibilities of action for
subordinate classes]{.underline}**. Wright speaks in very measured terms
of the normative aspect of Marx's project. He does not name the trope
toward which its heliotropism tends: Communism. But his analysis of
class rests nonetheless on it as a "hidden god."33 Wright maintains the
faith in the absence rather than the presence of possibility in either
its revolutionary or reformist forms. I think we might have to
**[reimagine the normative goal itself]{.underline}**, [based on the
combined experiences of the farmer, worker, and hacker as subordinate
classes]{.underline}. [What is the just means of making and distributing
matter, energy, and information]{.underline}? That might then inform
strategies and tactics for changing the vectoralist game. But [in the
meantime]{.underline}, [we might have to make do with struggles over the
rules of the existing gamespace]{.underline} and over the everyday lives
of players, hustlers, and grinders making their moves, as the vulgar
blues language of the times---from hip hop to trap---would have it.34
Besides reaching out to those indebted to more classical approaches of
Durkheim and Weber, Wright addresses prominent contemporary social
theorists who try to offer original perspectives. Here I'll take sides
with Wright against some of the most widely known alternative social
theories--- Thomas Piketty, Guy Standing, and Wolfgang Streek---while
introducing their perspectives into the thought experiment that this is
no longer capitalism but something worse. Thomas Piketty deserves credit
for putting inequality back on the agenda as more than a mere problem of
unequal opportunity. 35 His empirical work shows that [the sharp rise in
income of the top 10% is really that of the]{.underline} 1% or even the
**[.1%.]{.underline}** A fair bit of this came from [the rise of **super
salaries** rather than income on capital]{.underline}. The CEO "class"
is setting its own pay. Here I would want to inquire as to how, in a
political economy running on information, the capacity to control (but
not exactly own) the means of production accrues to a class that
presents itself as the celebrities of information control itself.
[**Commanding attention** becomes a form of **class
power**]{.underline}. The technicalities of Piketty's work centers on
the capital:income ratio as a way of measuring the value of capital
relative to total income of economy. As Wright says, "Piketty's basic
argument is that this ratio is the structural basis for the distribution
of income between owners of capital and labor: all other things being
equal, for a given return on capital, the higher this ratio, the higher
the proportion of national income going to wealth holders."36 As growth
declines, the capital:income ratio rises. There's a rise in the weight
of inherited wealth, while concentrations of income also rise. It's the
worst of both worlds: a rentier "class" plus a CEO "class" of
appearance-peddlers carving up the world between them at the expense of
everyone else. Picketty starts out with a class analysis but loses it
once he gets into the empirical work, where he treats CEO income as
return on labor, as most income tables do. Wright: "In the modern
corporation many of the powersof-capital are held by top executives....
They occupy what I have called contradictory locations within class
relations ... They exercise their capitalist-derived power within the
class relations of the firm to appropriate part of the corporation's
profits for their personal accounts."37 But is their power really
"capitalist-derived," or is it now something else? Something like a
joint managing of appearances between those who represent a firm to the
market and the market that is supposed to value it. But [how to value a
company when so much of its asset base takes the form of
information]{.underline}? [A corporation today is among other things a
**brand**, a slew of **patents**, a **logistical process**, a corral of
**expert hackers** turning out new **intellectual
property**]{.underline}. [How can **information** be **turned into
value**, and an **opportunity** to be **hoarded**, when **there
aren't**]{.underline} really **[private languages]{.underline}**, [and
**information is**]{.underline} in principle [a **nonrivalrous
good**]{.underline}?38 Piketty does not separate out real estate from
capital, yet there might be good reasons to do so. Landlords and
capitalists are already different kinds of ruling classes with
overlapping but not identical interests. Ground rent and profit are not
the same kinds of surplus extraction. [Landlords]{.underline},
perversely, may [benefit from the rise of the vector]{.underline} in
ways Capital does not. As Matteo Pasquinelli says, today's
[landlords]{.underline} (often with giant global property portfolios)
[increase their rents by extracting the information value that the
presence of the hacker class produces]{.underline}.39 On the one hand,
attracting so-called creatives or techies to a neighborhood drives out
working class and non-white tenants. On the other hand, the [new
residents add layers of information]{.underline} to the place [that can
be recuperated as value to sell]{.underline} it to bankers and lawyers
and drive out mere hacker class tenants in turn. **[Gentrification is
but a step to aristofication.]{.underline}** One could think further
here about Ricardo's ancient tension between ground rent and profit, but
with the focus shifted from the rural to the urban and the monopoly
rents to be extracted from urban locations.40 Guy Standing is the name
most associated with the now widely discussed idea of the precariat as a
class rather than just a bad life chance.41 He offers a
three-dimensional definition of class, as structured by relations of
production, relations of distribution, and (interestingly) relations to
the state. He identifies seven classes: plutocracy, salariat, proficians
(professional + technician), working class, precariat, unemployed, and
lumpen-precariat. The precariat have insecure jobs. Their sources of
income other than wages are disappearing. They become less citizens of
the state and more like mere denizens. Not only are their jobs
precarious, they are vulnerable within relations of distribution and
marginal to the state. The precariat includes people bumped out of
working class communities and families who experience a relative
deprivation in relation to a real or imagined past. It also includes
migrants and asylum seekers for whom the present is absent. The
precariat increasingly includes people falling out of an educated middle
class---think academic adjunct labor---who lack a future. For Standing
this makes a potentially "dangerous class." Marxists might think of the
precariat as workers who (in Weberian terms) experienced poor life
chances. Standing thinks there are antagonisms between the precariat and
the working class. But do the precariat and workers have distinct
interests? Maybe not.42 Maybe they can share an interest in changing the
game (although one might want to say more here about how workers and the
precariat might have different interests about the rules and moves of
the game). Unionization, for example, can secure some sort of steady
work for the workers in the union, but whether it benefits those outside
of it is an open question. Wolfgang Streeck argues, in a Durkheimian
vein, that capitalism works better when there are constraints on
rational, self-interested action, based on trust, legitimacy, and
responsibility. 43 The wrinkle Wright introduces is to argue that [the
level of **constraint on self-interest** that is **optimal for
capitalists** is **below** that which is **optimal for workers**.
Capital seeks to **remove constraints to augment its power** even **past
the point where these are economically inefficient**]{.underline}.
Wright: "[The zeal to dismantle the regulatory machinery of
capitalism]{.underline} since the early 1980s [was driven by a desire to
**undermine the conditions for empowerment** of interests opposed to
those of capitalists]{.underline}---[**even if doing so meant
under-regulating capitalism** from the point of view of **long-term
needs of capital accumulation.**]{.underline}"44 One could see this a
bit differently by [separating]{.underline} out [the interests of the
capitalist and vectoralist class]{.underline}. [The regulatory
regime]{.underline} emerging in the last quarter century **[favors the
mobility of information]{.underline}**, and not just finance, [as a
means of coordinating economic activity transnationally]{.underline},
[at the expense]{.underline} not just of workers but [of]{.underline}
those forms of [capitalist enterprise tied to physical]{.underline}
plant and [infrastructure]{.underline}, and thus with an interest in
local, regional, or national relations of trust, legitimacy, and
responsibility. We can read Wright's conclusion against the grain:
"**[Enlightenment of the capitalist class to their long-term
interests]{.underline}** in a strong civic culture of obligation and
trust **[is not enough]{.underline}**; **[the balance of
power]{.underline}** also **[needs to be changed]{.underline}**. And
[since this shift]{.underline} in balance of power [will be costly to
those in privileged positions]{.underline}, [it will only occur
through]{.underline} a process of [mobilization and
struggle]{.underline}."45 [What if those capitalists tied
to]{.underline} actually [producing things]{.underline} in a particular
place already [know this, but]{.underline} they have [lost
power]{.underline} [to a]{.underline} quite [different]{.underline} kind
of [ruling class]{.underline}, [which operates at a **higher level of
abstraction**]{.underline}, or in Weberian terms, at a new stage of
rationalization? [They own or control the information about things,
rather than the things themselves]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}
not inherently more rational, but it is [more abstract]{.underline}, and
hence [more powerful]{.underline}. To imagine new kinds of class
compromise might require a rethink about which classes could compromise.
Since there appears to be no way to change the game, Wright looks to
those who wanted to change the rules within the game, such as Walter
Korpi and Gøsta Esping-Anderson, Scandinavian social democratic
inheritors of Ernst Wigforss.46 But [one has to ask if it's possible to
revive social democratic strategies]{.underline} from the era of the
great national manufacturing industries [in an era where the information
vector]{.underline} greatly [lowers the cost of geographic dispersal and
puts]{.underline} the old [capitalist manufacturing firms]{.underline}
and regions [in direct competition with each other]{.underline} on a
global scale. [Wright advocates for]{.underline} some salutary
[counterhegemonic strategies]{.underline}, [based in]{.underline}
geographic [rootedness]{.underline}, local [public goods]{.underline},
[and worker's cooperatives]{.underline}. [But one has to wonder
**whether such things are**]{.underline} all that
**[viable]{.underline}** (at least as traditionally conceived),
[given]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} forces of production drive
increasingly [abstract relations of production]{.underline}, [which
appear]{.underline} then [as **transnational legal and treaty forms
protecting information as private property**]{.underline}. Trebor Scholz
proposes a form of platform cooperativism as a more contemporary
approach.47 [The vectoralist stack needs to be countered with a
**counterstack on the infrastructural level**]{.underline}. Wright:
"[Changes in technology]{.underline} may [make the anchoring of
capitalist production in locally rooted]{.underline}, [high
productivity]{.underline} small and medium size [enterprises more
feasible]{.underline}."48 One might call this the Brooklyn-effect, after
the boom in small business, even manufacturing, there.49 But while the
actual products have some connection to locality, such [**localism
relies on an** **information infrastructure** or vector stack **owned
and controlled by the vectoralist class**]{.underline}: [**Google,
Amazon, Paypal**, and so forth all **get their cut**.]{.underline}
[Their power may take the form of a **vectoral
infrastructure**]{.underline} that [enables them to **extract
information asymmetries**]{.underline} [from **both capital and** from
**subordinate classes** and to **accumulate asymmetric information**
about all of these activities now **subordinated to the
vector**]{.underline}. Thus, where Wright says, "I assume that an exit
from capitalism is not an option in the present historical period,"50 I
think we have to question that assumption, but not in a good way. Maybe
[this is already not capitalism, but something worse.]{.underline} It's
not just a rentier bubble of speculation spooling out of the "real
economy."51 [One **could no longer know**]{.underline} in advance
**[which part of it is real]{.underline}** at all---and perhaps one
never could. [This is an era not just of]{.underline} socalled
neoliberalism's "aggressive affirmation and enforcement of [private
property rights]{.underline}"52 [but o]{.underline}f the creation of
[**new** forms of **private property** and **new antagonistic
relations** over it,]{.underline} [particularly in]{.underline} the form
of **[intellectual property]{.underline}**. [There's a lot to be said
for]{.underline} the way Wright subsumes [rival social
theories]{.underline} as collaborators within the larger frame of a
fairly traditional Marxist sociology. But perhaps [that]{.underline} in
turn [has to be put]{.underline} back [in contact with a]{.underline}
more **[vulgar attention to the transformation of the forces of
production]{.underline}**, and in particular [how **information
emerges** as both a **technical and social force**]{.underline}. One
could then, as a further step, [bring this perspective together
with]{.underline} [the study of the metabolic rift, wherein the
instrumentalizing of information]{.underline} [mobilizes
the]{.underline} whole [planet as a **rationalized sphere of resource
extraction**]{.underline} under the sign of exchange value.53 To the
point where this **[abstraction of the vector becomes]{.underline}**
completely **[irrational, threatening to take the whole planet down with
it.]{.underline}** Maybe [we need an]{.underline} **[asocial
science]{.underline}** [that rethinks whether one]{.underline} can even
[conceive of the social as a separate domain of analysis at
all]{.underline}. On the one side, the social meshes seamlessly with
information technology; on the other, it depends on planetary scale
resource mobilization causing catastrophic metabolic rifts. One might be
in need of an even "bigger" conceptual framework within which to rest
Wright's partial synthesis as a component part (a question I'll return
to in Chapter 6). [One might think]{.underline} again [also
about]{.underline} the kinds of **[social forms and tactics of class
existenc]{.underline}**e. Particular groups of [workers and hackers now
have to]{.underline} [negotiate]{.underline} a far more temporary sense
of **[employment existence]{.underline}**. [The vector]{.underline} is
nothing if [not a platform for making]{.underline} all [human activity
**interchangeable and replaceable**]{.underline}. Here Wright's
signature concept of contradictory class locations can be thought on
both its intended structural level and as a good guide to understanding
everyday experience. An example, as Angela McRobbie has observed, is
working class women who will try to work in the fashion industry despite
low pay, long hours, and precarious employment because they don't want
jobs, they want to be creative.54 [They **want to be hackers, not
workers**]{.underline}. [Whole industries]{.underline} now
[function]{.underline} [on the promise of creative activity]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} effect a **[bait and switch]{.underline}**. [The real
job is **labor**]{.underline}, often even manual work, and for women in
particular often affective labor, where the job is really just keeping
clients happy. Something similar happens in the tech industry in
so-called **[start-up culture]{.underline}**. It employs hackers in the
narrower, more Durkheimian sense of the word, [people who
code]{.underline}. (Even here, [a lot]{.underline} of it may [turn out
to be labor in]{.underline} the sense of repetition and the
[filling-in]{.underline} of software-generated [forms]{.underline}
already [created and designed and]{.underline} indeed [owned by someone
else]{.underline}.) [The promise]{.underline}, however, [is that the
hacker can become the owner]{.underline}. The bait and switch is **[the
lure of becoming part of the ruling class]{.underline}**. [The
**risks**]{.underline} of enterprise [are disproportionately **shifted
onto the hacker** while the **rewards** disproportionately **return to
that**]{.underline} fraction of the **[vectoralist class]{.underline}**
known as venture capital. Some parts of the hacker class are offered a
possible escape into the vectoralist class at the price of increased
precarity that rarely comes to pass. Most find themselves constrained by
routines that turn them more into wage labor. People working in fields
that are "creative" or "tech" live with Durkheimian senses of "class" as
a constant. Everything is about groups defining collective identities in
all sorts of slippery ways. A less common topic is a Weberian one about
[opportunity hoarding]{.underline}. There are constant eruptions of
anger and attention to inequalities [derived from access to
credentials]{.underline}, for example. Or we could attend to how
[**sexual harassment** drives women off the path]{.underline} in
particular workplaces, or how certain [industries **systematically
exclude people of color**]{.underline}. [These are]{.underline}
important conversations and indeed [issues to fight]{.underline}.55
[What's less common is to think this]{.underline} **[within a larger
concept of class]{.underline}**. [Class has]{.underline} Wright's three
dimension (property, authority, expertise) and now a fourth: [the power
of information asymmetry. Race and gender oppressio]{.underline}n now
[connect to all four dimensions of class]{.underline}. The immediate
problem is that [the other ways of thinking]{.underline} class
[categorize people into clusters]{.underline}. [They are]{.underline}
indeed [things that **the vector of information**]{.underline}
technology **[can track and manage]{.underline}**. [It can tell you
**how many women earn how much money**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
[**how many employees** report]{.underline} being something other than
**[white]{.underline}**. **[Class]{.underline}** in the Marxist sense
**[is harder to make palpable]{.underline}**. First, class means
**[class antagonism]{.underline}**. It['s **not a category, it's a
relation**]{.underline}. [One th]{.underline}at sometimes [connects not
individuals but]{.underline} what Gerald Raunig and others call
[dividuals]{.underline}, [units of being smaller]{.underline} than an
individual.56 It turns out that individuals can indeed be further
divided. One could think of class locations as including contradictory
ones if one thinks of the people located by class as individuals. Or you
could think of classes as quite neatly creating locations for dividuals,
which don't always correspond to the individuals of which they are
parts. In this manner, [the tension people feel about parts of their
existence, as worker and hacker]{.underline}, or hacker and aspirational
vectoralist (and so on), [can be made sense of]{.underline} another way.
Second, [if class locates dividuals rather than
individuals]{.underline}, it's no surprise that [the way people think
about]{.underline} their experience of [class i\[s\]]{.underline} often
[conflicted]{.underline}. What I would call [**vectoral culture**
encourages everyone to imagine that they are **entrepreneurs of the
self**]{.underline}, playing the stakes of their own animal spirits in
the great casino of life.57 Twenty years of hip-hop lyrics have
articulated a sophisticated range of thoughts and feeling about what
that's like. [One's]{.underline} public [self]{.underline} [is supposed
to be **a hard-charging boss**]{.underline}. As Cardi B. raps, "I'm a
boss you a worker bitch."58 What it means [to be a **boss** is now
**modeled on the vectorialist** rather than the capitalist
class]{.underline}. It's about **[accumulating asymmetric relations of
information]{.underline}**. It is about **[commanding and monopolizing
attention]{.underline}**. It's about **[monetizing
appearances]{.underline}**. [The thing to **aspire to own** is **a
brand**]{.underline}, [starting with **the branded self**]{.underline}
and branching out from there. If this is the public face the subaltern
has to adopt, whether worker or hacker, the private feelings it masks
may be something else altogether. Failure to live up to your own
personal brand is understood through languages that are medical,
therapeutic, or "spiritual."59 [This is a **world of boredom, anxiety,
depression, lack of focus, lack of will**]{.underline}. [It can
take]{.underline} a lot of [pharmaceutical
management]{.underline}---legal and illegal---[to produce the public
face]{.underline} of today. 60 To the extent that there is a language
about power that can address these experiences, [it negotiates
perspectives from critical race theory and feminism]{.underline}, as it
should, [but]{.underline} often **[stops short of a language of
class]{.underline}**. [That language]{.underline}, against which these
others struggled to find room, has [atrophied as vectoral
power]{.underline} [has **subsumed capitalist power**]{.underline} as
its subordinate form. **[The language of class analysis]{.underline}**
(in the Marxist sense) **[appears outdated, because it
is]{.underline}**. [It **no longer includes**]{.underline} **[all
the]{.underline}** **[classes in contention]{.underline}**. [If we think
synchronically about]{.underline} a matrix of [antagonistic classes that
includes emerging ones,]{.underline} then **[capitalism can be returned
to historical thought from its holiday in eternity.]{.underline}**

It is a strange thing, this mode of production. What Bernal and Richta
called [the scientific and technological revolution]{.underline} really
[did happen]{.underline}, and [in the West, not the East. But it was the
product of a]{.underline} weird kind of "[socialism]{.underline}." [It
came out of a]{.underline} **[wartime socialization of scientific and
technical power]{.underline}**. [Scientists and engineers]{.underline},
in academic and corporate laboratories, [**cooperated** with each
other]{.underline}. Their **[innovations weren't immediately patented,
they were shared]{.underline}**. [That laid the groundwork for
postwar]{.underline} developments in the [forces of
production]{.underline}. To some extent this "[socialism"
continued]{.underline}, [under the]{.underline} auspices of the
[Pentagon's Advanced Projects Research Agency]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} among other things [funded key work in
computation]{.underline}.52 If there was [a key innovation that came out
of this]{.underline} strange [western statesocialist
military---industrial complex]{.underline}, it [was **the technics of
information**]{.underline}. It took a while for the pieces to come
together. By the early twenty-first century, the odd thing is that the
[state-socialist sponsored scientific and technical effort]{.underline},
[made]{.underline} first [to defeat the Axis powers and]{.underline}
then to defeat [the Soviets]{.underline}, en[ded up being a way to
compete with Japanese industry]{.underline} abroad [and]{.underline} to
[defeat the working classes]{.underline} at home. [A]{.underline}
basically [**socialized research program** became **the means to
build**]{.underline} an infrastructure---what Benjamin Bratton calls the
stack, what I call **[the vector]{.underline}**---[for **a systematic
and global privatization of objects, subjects, and**]{.underline} the
**[information]{.underline}** in between them.53 [That]{.underline}
**[this was not an inevitable destiny]{.underline}** [of science and
technology]{.underline} [was masked by the **suppression of critical and
dissenting voices** among scientists themselves]{.underline}.
[Bernalism]{.underline}, or the Social Relations of Science movement
more broadly, [was **shut down in** the **red scare politics** of the
Cold War]{.underline}. In [the]{.underline} relative [absence of
that]{.underline} strand of [thinking]{.underline}, the available
[stories]{.underline} for accounting for this historical period have
[lacked]{.underline} a sense of the [class conflicts]{.underline}
internal to these new forces of production [and the extent to which they
were likely to transform capitalism]{.underline}, such as it was in the
late twentieth century, [into something else]{.underline}. [The
story]{.underline} that is [best known about science and technology
during the war is the Manhattan project and the atom bomb]{.underline}.
[But]{.underline} perhaps [it was not the only piece]{.underline} of the
puzzle [that mattered]{.underline}. [The war in the Pacific
was]{.underline} probably [the biggest logistical operation ever
conducted]{.underline} up until that time. Robert
[McNamara]{.underline}, [who would]{.underline} later [run]{.underline}
the [Ford]{.underline} Motor Company and then the Pentagon, [was an
apprentice logistics]{.underline} [expert]{.underline} during the war.
[These were pioneering efforts to control]{.underline} the movement and
combination of incredibly [complex arrays of resources]{.underline}
across vast territories [using communication and
computation]{.underline}.54 [What started]{.underline} out [as the means
to beat the Axis powers]{.underline}, and then contain the Soviets, and
then to compete with Japanese industry, [was]{.underline} in the end
[the means to **globalize production**]{.underline}, [**exploit**
the]{.underline} newly available **[cheap labor of]{.underline}** the
People's Republic of **[China]{.underline}**, [and
**destroy**]{.underline} the power of **[organized labor]{.underline}**
within Italy, the United States, and [throughout]{.underline} much of
[the overdeveloped world]{.underline}. But there's a paradox attendant
to this. C[apital thought it was using]{.underline} some
[new]{.underline} kinds of [communication and computational power in its
struggle with labor, but]{.underline} in the end [the **capitalist
class** too ended up being **subsumed under that power**]{.underline}.
The capitalist class became a [subsidiary]{.underline} ruling class [to
the vectoralist class]{.underline}. **[Capital is dead; the Vector
lives]{.underline}**. [A capitalist class owns the means of
production]{.underline}, the means of organizing labor. **[A vectoralist
class owns the means of organizing the means of
production]{.underline}**. [The vector has a double form]{.underline}:
the form of vector [along which information is to be routed]{.underline}
(**[the extensive vector]{.underline}**), [and]{.underline} the form of
the vector [along which information can be stored and
computed]{.underline} (**[the intensive vector]{.underline}**). [A
vectoralist class]{.underline} also [owns and **controls the production
process** through **patents, copyrights, brands, trademarks, proprietary
logistical processes**]{.underline}, and the like. It is curious that if
one looks at the world's biggest [corporations]{.underline} these days,
a lot of their [power and property is in vectoral form]{.underline}.
[Many]{.underline} of them **[don't]{.underline}** actually **[make the
things they sell]{.underline}**. [They **control the production process
by owning and controlling the information**]{.underline}. Even when they
do still make the stuff, a quite remarkable amount of the
[valuation]{.underline} of the company [comes from portfolios of
**intellectual property**]{.underline}, or [proprietary **data about
their customers**]{.underline}, and so on. [Capital was subsumed under a
more abstract form of technical power]{.underline}. When considering the
vectoralist class, then, three further points suggest themselves. First,
[it seems to be able to extract value]{.underline} not just from labor
but [from]{.underline} what Tiziana Terranova calls **[free
labor]{.underline}**. 55 Even when you just stroll down the street, [the
phone]{.underline} in your purse or pocket [is reporting
data]{.underline} back [to some vectoralist entity]{.underline}. The
vectoralist class seems to be able to extract revenue out of qualitative
information in much the same way as banks extract it out of quantitative
information. Perhaps the exercise of power through control of
quantitative and qualitative information is characteristic of the same
ruling class. Second, [the vectoralist class subordinates]{.underline}
the old kind of ruling class, [a capitalist class]{.underline}, in the
same way that capitalists subordinated the old landlord class that
subjected rural production to commodi-fication through ground rent. In
that sense, [the rise of a vectoralist]{.underline} class
[is]{.underline} a [similar]{.underline} and subsequent development
[within intra-ruling class dynamics]{.underline}. [The vectoralist class
still sits atop a pyramid of exploited labor]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} it [depends]{.underline} also [on extracting a surplus
out of another]{.underline}, fairly [privileged but]{.underline} still
[subordinate]{.underline} class. I call it the **[hacker
class]{.underline}**. Bernal already had an inkling of this development
when he tried to articulate the interests of scientific workers in and
against capitalism, but this was not quite the hacker class yet. That
had to wait for the development of [sophisticated forms of
**intellectual property**]{.underline}, which [are]{.underline} in turn
[embedded in the design of the interface for the **creative
process**]{.underline}. [This **transforms**]{.underline} the
qualitative work of producing **[new]{.underline}** forms of
[**information**]{.underline} in the world **[into
property]{.underline}** that can be rendered equivalent in the market.
In short, a new class dynamic, between vectoralist and hacker, was added
to an already complex pattern of relations between dominant and
subordinate classes. Third, [the political economy of the former
West]{.underline} rather than the former East [was the one that was able
to develop the]{.underline} implications of the [scientific and
technical revolution]{.underline}, [in]{.underline} the form of [the
rise of the vectoralist class]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} it was
**[the state form of the former East that has prevailed in the former
West.]{.underline}** [**The vector** is]{.underline} not just a means of
transforming production. It is also [a way of **transforming state
power**]{.underline}. 56 [Data can be collected for]{.underline} the
purposes of a logistics of **[economic control]{.underline}**; data can
also be collected **[to run the surveillance and security apparatus of
the state]{.underline}**. The [western states]{.underline} too [had
their surveillance apparatus, but it was never as total as]{.underline}
those of [the East]{.underline}. [The new]{.underline}
[model]{.underline} worldwide [uses the vector to **realize the dreams
of the KGB**]{.underline} of old, an information state. This is what Guy
Debord called [the]{.underline} stage of the [integrated]{.underline}
[spectacle]{.underline}, **[combining the worst of the former East and
West]{.underline}**.57 [The West is now **the former
West**]{.underline}. [Its economy became something else]{.underline}.
**[It isn't capitalism any more---it's worse]{.underline}**. [It
**takes**]{.underline} even more **[control away from]{.underline}**
work **[life]{.underline}** and everyday life. [It
**expands**]{.underline} the **[exploitation of nature to]{.underline}**
possible **[extinction]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} certainly
[not]{.underline} the wonderful dream of [a "postindustrial
society]{.underline}," still less Bernal and Richta's [accelerationist
socialism]{.underline}. [It is a]{.underline} relatively [new
and]{.underline} more [elaborate]{.underline} form of [class
domination]{.underline}, one in more or less "peaceful coexistence" with
the Russian former East, whose global significance is reduced to that of
predatory oligarchy monopolizing a resource export economy. 58 The
Soviet Union paid a high price for not figuring out the role of
information and reaching a modus vivendi with its scientific workers.

Century)//gideon

All of this takes as a given the transmission of Marx common to
nonMarxist and even post-Marxist philosophers and other humanities or
social science scholars and the not very different approach of rather
scholastic party functionaries of Marxism's "classical" period.48 There
are other readers of Marx, and some of them are poets, or who read as
poets do. [Modern poets]{.underline}, [less interested in the meaning of
the texts]{.underline} (the always deferred signified) [than in the
signs themselves]{.underline} (the materiality of the signifier).49 [One
that has been of particular use]{.underline} to me [is]{.underline}
something that is much less a method of reading and more a procedure for
writing: [what Guy Debord called **détournement**]{.underline}.50 The
word includes the sense of the detour, [the turning aside]{.underline},
a hijacking [but also a seduction]{.underline}. Debord: "[The device of
détournement **restores**]{.underline} all [their **subversive qualities
to past critical judgments that have congealed into respectable
truths**]{.underline} ... The defining characteristic of this use of
[détournement is]{.underline} the [necessity for distance to be
maintained toward whatever has been turned into an official
verity]{.underline} ... Ideas improve. The meaning of words has a part
in this improvement. [Plagiarism is necessary]{.underline}, [progress
implies it]{.underline}. Staying close to an author's phrasing,
plagiarism exploits his expressions, erases false ideas, replaces them
with correct ideas ... [Détournement is the antithesis of
quotation]{.underline}, [of a theoretical authority]{.underline}
invariably [tainted if only because it has become quotable]{.underline},
[because it is now a fragment torn away from its context, from its own
movement]{.underline} ... [Détournement is]{.underline}, by contrast,
[the fluid language of anti-ideology]{.underline} ... Détournement
founds its cause on [nothing but its own truth as critique at work in
the present]{.underline}."51 [Debord's writing]{.underline} itself [is
a]{.underline} brilliant détou[rnement of Marx and
Lautréamont]{.underline} (and much else), one [that generated a
style]{.underline} (and some fresh concepts) [for]{.underline}
understanding [the historical moment of the mid-twentieth
century]{.underline}. Marx: "The wealth of those societies in which the
capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as an immense
accumulation of commodities ..." Debord: "The whole life of those
societies in which modern conditions of production prevail presents
itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles."52 And so, once more,
comrades, [if we would become critics of our times!]{.underline} Let's
[try some more détournement to **produce**]{.underline} some
[**different language** out of that which comes down to us, **rather
than trying to interpret the eternal essence of the text as if we could
reproduce it as more of the same**]{.underline}. To practice the style
of [negation today requires the negation of some old
styles]{.underline}. But how do we broach the question of style in Marx?
For Keston Sutherland Capital needs readers rather than "curators of
concepts."53 [Capital is written in clashing styles, aimed at a
readership Marx knew to be divided by class]{.underline}. [To the
bourgeois]{.underline} reader, aping genteel sensibilities, [Marx
addresses himself as a satirist]{.underline}, writing at the expense of
the myths the bourgeois lives by. For instance, Sutherland claims that
Marx's famous overture on the fetish character of the commodities has
been "influentially mistranslated" in accounts that try to master the
text by extracting its concepts.54 [Commodity fetishism is not a
misapprehension of the commodity]{.underline}. 55 Marx is saying
something about the making of the commodity itself. Human labor is not
just abstracted into a homogenous quantity in the commodity form. [Labor
gets minced and boiled into]{.underline} Gallerte: aspic, meat jelly. Or
in today's terms into something like what appears in those truly
disgusting online videos that show the extrusion from some machine of
that major ingredient of hamburgers: [pink goo.]{.underline} Sutherland:
"[The living hands, muscles and nerves of the wage laborer are mere
'animal substances,' ingredients for the feast of the
capitalist]{.underline}."56 [Marx's]{.underline} image of what happens
to **[labor is not a genteel conceptual abstraction but a vulgar image
from industrial butchery.]{.underline}** "[The object of Marx's
satire]{.underline} on abstract human labor [is not the worker reduced
to a condiment but the bourgeois consumer who eats him for
breakfast]{.underline}."57 [Capital is "a work of
sustained]{.underline}, aggressively [satirical détournement in which
the risks and failures of style are arguments in themselves, irreducible
to theoretical proposition.]{.underline}"58 Elsewhere, Marx détourns
phrases from Dante, Goethe, and Shakespeare, erasing false ideas,
replacing them with correct ones. [The fetish character of commodities
is a détournement of a work of racist ethnography by Charles De
Brosse]{.underline}.59 [In]{.underline} the [De Brosse]{.underline}
source text, [the]{.underline} genteel and [enlightened reader
is]{.underline} first [astonished that]{.underline} stupid
"[savages]{.underline}" [worship fetishes, but disciplines
this]{.underline} astonishment [into knowledge]{.underline}. [In
Marx]{.underline} it is the reverse. [The commodity appears]{.underline}
at first as something [rational]{.underline} and known to the genteel
sensibility, [but on closer inspection is]{.underline} quite
[astonishing]{.underline}. It is [we]{.underline}, gentle reader, who
[are stupid before the fetish]{.underline}. There is no reconciliation
to this strange thing. [It has to be abolished]{.underline}. To write
after Marx is not to claim a genteel mastery of concepts alone. Where I
would press on (which Sutherland very likely wouldn't) is to suggest
that [one way to restore]{.underline} a certain [vulgar energy to
writing might be to take]{.underline} Marx's tactics of [détournement
and apply them to the concepts of eternal Capital]{.underline} that have
been extracted from Capital itself [in]{.underline} certain [genteel
readings and perpetuated as a kind of myth]{.underline}. The truth of
the matter is that **[Marxist writing itself became
ideological]{.underline}**. Its acquiescence to the sense of capitalism
being eternal is one sure sign of this. **[Hence the necessity of the
gesture, the thought experiment, of declaring]{.underline}**: **[Capital
is dead]{.underline}**. It is dead [like God before it]{.underline}, and
as with that discovery**, [to announce this is treated in the
"marketplace of ideas" as madness]{.underline}**. The corpus of [Marx is
read within a textology of transmission]{.underline},
[using]{.underline} scholastic [protocols of quotation, exegesis, and
interpretation descended from]{.underline} those developed for
[religious texts]{.underline}.60 And so not surprisingly **[Marxism
became a minor form of (protestant!) religion]{.underline}**---one of
the boring ones, with long sermons and much commentary on scripture.
[**To interrupt these habits** requires **not another reading of Marx,**
promising to peel away the false and reveal the true
essence]{.underline}. Rather, **[it takes another style of
writing]{.underline}**. [Détournement does not care about]{.underline}
the [self-identity of the textual corpus or the eternal
spirit]{.underline} hidden [within]{.underline}. [It takes what it finds
useful]{.underline} or amusing [for]{.underline} composing the textual
expression of **[the present situation]{.underline}**. [Judged **in
relation to the sacred scriptures it will**]{.underline} of course
**[appear as heretical, mad, wrong, or vulgar]{.underline}.** This is a
poetics that intends to differ from the material it appropriates.
[Détournement is no]{.underline} [respecter of private property or
public propriety]{.underline}. [It has no interest in those who claim
Marx]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} for that matter
[Debord]{.underline}) [as their patrimony]{.underline}, as the field
they alone are warranted or patented to cultivate and trade. [Our
task]{.underline}, in the thought experiments gathered here[, is to
appropriate from the Marxist tradition for the composition
of]{.underline} frankly Frankensteinian [monster-texts whose only
interest is in being **anti-ideological tactics**]{.underline}, in
[pointing]{.underline} from within the combinatory of terms [to the
**limits of**]{.underline} what Flaubert called **[received
ideas]{.underline}**.61 There's not much choice but to work with
received ideas, but th[ere's more than one way to select from
tradition.]{.underline} So let's think about the present on these terms:
[what if,]{.underline} rather than start at the beginning, [one started
at the end]{.underline}? The **[capitalism story always starts in the
past]{.underline}**, with the birth of capitalism, [**and imagines
a**]{.underline} destiny, a **[teleology]{.underline}**, **[wherein the
present must be some continuum from that past]{.underline}**.62 [This
must be some modification of the essence of the thing]{.underline}.
Let's do it the other way around. **[Let's first describe the
present]{.underline}, [then]{.underline}** secondarily **[figure out
where it came from]{.underline}**. This may even, in the end, involve
modifying our understanding of capitalism's pasts. [Any attempt to
describe the present in its own language is]{.underline} more than
[likely to end up reproducing the language of its ruling
class]{.underline} at best, or at worst the left-over language of
obsolete ruling classes. [Hence]{.underline} the method of
[détournement]{.underline}, [appropriating received ideas,
but]{.underline} also [erasing and correcting]{.underline}. Let's [pick
a Marx text to détourn. Rather than start where Marx]{.underline} more
or less [ended]{.underline}, [with Capital]{.underline}, let's [start
where his "mature" work]{.underline} began, with the Preface to the
Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. 63 [Let's **start not
with capitalism**, as if we could just assume that is what this still
is]{.underline}. Let's **[start with]{.underline}** Marx's sketch of
**[how to think about modes of production]{.underline}**. I have only
modified it slightly. [In]{.underline} the [social-technical
production]{.underline} of their existence, [humans]{.underline}
inevitably [enter into definite relations]{.underline}, which are
[independent of their desires]{.underline}, namely [relations of
production]{.underline} appropriate to a given stage in the development
of their material forces of production (and reproduction). [**The
totality of** these **relations of production constitutes the economic
structure of society**, the infrastructure, **on which arises a legal,
political and cultural superstructure.**]{.underline} The mode of
production of material life conditions the general process of social,
political, and cultural life. It is not the ideologies of humans that
determine their social-technical existence, but [their
**social-technical existence**]{.underline} that [**determines their
ideologies**. Accidents happen in]{.underline} the course of [historical
development]{.underline}. [The forces of production come into conflict
with]{.underline} the [existing relations of production]{.underline}
or--- this just says the same thing in legal terms---with the property
relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto.
From forms for the development of the productive forces, [these
relations turn into their fetters]{.underline}. [Then
begins]{.underline} an era of [transformation of]{.underline} the
[superstructures]{.underline}. The [changes in the]{.underline} forms of
[social-technical metabolism lead]{.underline} sooner or later [to the
transformation of the]{.underline} whole immense
[superstructure]{.underline}. In studying such transformations, [it
is]{.underline} always [hard to distinguish between]{.underline} the
[material transformation]{.underline} of the conditions of production,
which can be determined with the methods of a social science, [and
the]{.underline} legal, political, religious, artistic, or
philosophic---in short, the [mythic or ideological forms]{.underline} in
which humans sense and feel this conflict and fight it out. [Just as one
does not judge an individual by a Facebook profile]{.underline}, so [one
cannot judge]{.underline} such a period of [transformation by its
myths]{.underline}. On the contrary, [these myths must be explained from
the contradictions of material life]{.underline}, from the
[conflict]{.underline} existing [between the social-technical forces of
production and the relations of production]{.underline}. [No social
order is]{.underline} ever [destroyed before all the productive
forces]{.underline} for which it is sufficient [have been
developed]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} more [abstract]{.underline}
relations of [production never replace older ones before the material
conditions]{.underline} for their existence [have matured]{.underline}
within the framework of the old society. [Social-technical]{.underline}
forms of [organization]{.underline} thus usually [set]{.underline}
themselves [only]{.underline} such [tasks]{.underline} as [they are able
to solve]{.underline}, [since]{.underline} closer examination will
always show that **[the problem itself arises only when the material
conditions for its solution are already present]{.underline}** or at
least in the course of formation. In broad outline, [the ancient,
feudal, despotic, capitalist, and vectoralist modes of production may be
designated as **epochs**]{.underline} [marking]{.underline} the
extension of [the exploitation of nature by]{.underline}
social-technical forms of **[increasing abstraction]{.underline}.** [The
capitalist mode of production was imagined to be **the last antagonistic
form of the social process of production**.]{.underline}
**[Marx]{.underline}** [thought]{.underline} that "[the prehistory of
human society]{.underline} accordingly [closes with this social
formation]{.underline}."64 On that, [he **was mistaken**]{.underline}.

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 7: Four Cheers for Vulgarity!!!!)//gideon

As a way of counterprogramming against genteel Marxism, I want to look
at some peculiar instances of the vulgar kind: two about the twenties,
two from the sixties. Andrey Platonov (who was that rare thing, the
great modernist writer with proletarian origins) wrote a masterpiece,
Chevengur, which can be read as many things.22 My attention here is to
its vulgar Marxist side. It's an allegorical counter-history of the
Soviet Union from the October Revolution through the civil war until the
New Economic Policy, but seen from the points of view of characters who
are not even proletarian. They are orphans. This is not history from
below but history from below the below. Chevengur does not present the
October Revolution from the point of view of the edicts issued from the
center, but from their noisy, incoherent reception in the provinces.
[Platonov's characters perform]{.underline} their own
[détournement]{.underline} [of Soviet Marx-speak]{.underline}. Far from
revolution as the figurative locomotive of history, actual locomotives
collide head-on due to confused signaling. This world is not in
transition between modes of production as there is hardly any production
at all. There is hardly a working class in Platonov, but there are
comrades. The [comrades]{.underline} are those who [face the same
dangers]{.underline}, [the same exposure to the relentless,
disorganizing inertia of exposure to the world]{.underline}.23 [Humans
and machines, plants and animals can all be comrades]{.underline}. [All
wear away into nothingness in time. The revolution is supposed to
harness all these energies, organize them, inform them, and in the
process render them productive]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} the
tension in Platonov is that [hardship and poverty first make
comrades]{.underline}. [Safety and surplus feed the soul and stimulate
private demands]{.underline}. [The problem is to restore comradeship
beyond the minimal threshold]{.underline} of survival and scarcity.
There [can be no end of history]{.underline} in Platonov's world,
[because nature never lets up]{.underline}, [is never
conquered]{.underline}, is never providence. [Time wears everything
away]{.underline}. [**Communism is**]{.underline} always and **[only a
horizon]{.underline}**, a minimal line [between a blank sky and an empty
land]{.underline}. [Platonov's]{.underline} [characters live on through
**secondary ideas**]{.underline}, which can be made actual in the here
and now. 24 They work on [**food security** or]{.underline} on
**[irrigation]{.underline}**, as Platonov did himself during the famine
years of the civil war. Platonov sticks close to the point of view of
those whose work it is to hoe the fields, to run the railways, those who
find their own ways to be comrades. [Platonov's vulgar Marxism
is]{.underline} neither total revolutionary leap nor social democratic
gradualism. It's **[a practice of everyday life]{.underline}.** The
movement between genteel and vulgar Marxism plays out strongly in the
work of [Angela Davis.]{.underline} She studied philosophy with Herbert
Marcuse in the sixties but was also a militant in the Black Liberation
Movement. Davis: "If I still retained any of the elitism which almost
inevitably insinuates itself into the minds of college students, I lost
it all in the course of the \[Black Panther Party\] political education
sessions."25 I want to focus on her study of Black women blues singers
of the twenties.26 What she [hears]{.underline} in the recordings of Ma
Rainey and Bessie Smith is [a **Black working class
sensibility**]{.underline}, [appearing through fissures within
patriarchal language]{.underline}. Black working class culture had
little access to writing and publishing, but [through its blues singers
it did find a way to leave a recorded]{.underline} trace of its oral
[language]{.underline}, [even if at the time few heard it outside of
Black proletarian culture]{.underline}. Davis: "As music entered its age
of mechanical reproduction, blues were deemed reproducible only within
the cultural borders of their site of origin."27 [Slave
society]{.underline} had [controlled sexual relations between Black
people]{.underline}. The [abolition]{.underline} of slavery
[revolutionized Black]{.underline} personal [relationships]{.underline}.
[Questions of Black sexuality could not be addressed
through]{.underline} [musical forms of]{.underline} the
[slavery]{.underline} era. Its spirituals invoked a possible world of
collective redemption, at once otherworldly and temporal. It was sacred
universe, all-embracing, an imagined community of hope. It was less
religion as the opium of the people, and more the heart of a heartless
world, to give two of Marx's alternate formulations (the first a
détournement from Heine).28 Out of the frustrated hopes of emancipation
came a more exclusively upward-looking redemption in the form of gospel
music and a lowly, earthy one, in the blues. God and the Devil found
their separate forms, with the Devil having dominion over matters of
love and sex. It was not the secular nature of the blues that drew
church ire, but their sacred quality. [**Blues** women created a space
to **preach about sexuality outside of male-dominated** church
**culture**]{.underline}. In the blues, love is not idealized. Freely
chosen sexual love is a mediation between emancipation from slavery and
new forms of class oppression. Very little in the blues is about
marriage and domesticity. [Blues women were disinterested in the cult of
motherhood and **deal frankly** with **abuse and
abandonment**]{.underline}. [They announce female desire, and it crosses
the public--private distinction. They affirm an emotional community and
Black humanity. They are frank about **lesbian and gay
existence**]{.underline}. [The blues are]{.underline} not a politics,
but for Davis they are [a **cultural preparation for the political
movement**]{.underline} to which her own lifelong activism belongs.
[They anticipate the feminist principle]{.underline} that the personal
is political. They [counsel financial independence]{.underline} for
women and prefer men who work to parasitic ones. [And if all else fails,
move on]{.underline}. They touch on natural disasters, such as floods,
and what that experience means for oppressed and invisible communities.
The blues are also frank about sex work and the risks of prosecution and
prison. [They are the music of those]{.underline} among the
[subordinate]{.underline} classes who experience the repressive state
apparatus as often as the ideological one. Davis: "[Women's blues
contested black bourgeois notions of 'high' culture that belittled
working class popular music]{.underline}."29 Upwardly mobile and urban
Black culture distanced itself from blues culture. Billie Holiday, the
study of whom concludes Davis's book, brought the blues sensibility into
her interpretations of the white popular song that displaced the blues.
Holiday's work is a détournement of white culture industry material to
her purposes. Davis does the same [for critical theory]{.underline}.
[She appropriates]{.underline} from her teacher Herbert Marcuse the
concept of [the aesthetic]{.underline} dimension [but makes it more
vulgar]{.underline}. 30 Here it is [the low art of the blues where
aesthetics creates the form in which the overcoming of everyday
experience can become palpable]{.underline}. [The world]{.underline}
made over [in]{.underline} the form of [art can be recognized as an
aspect of reality distorted by reality]{.underline}. [Blues songs are
**collective property**, the commons]{.underline}.31 [Davis **makes the
aesthetic dimension collective and vulgar**]{.underline} [and connects
it to the African practice of the naming of things as a kind of
power]{.underline}. **[Art]{.underline}** (and one might add theory)
does not achieve greatness by transcending its milieu, but rather [is at
its best when it]{.underline} opens a dimension within it, [**brings
people to solidarity with each other** and the world, **while refusing
the happy ending**]{.underline}---as Holiday does with "Strange Fruit."
For Angela Davis, her sustained encounter with the vulgar took the form
of her long involvement with the politics of prison abolition,
particularly for and with working class Black women within the prison
industrial complex.32 For Pier Paolo Pasolini, it was more a matter of
sexual taste that led him to spend his nights with the raggazi di vita,
the lively lads, of subproletarian Rome.33 If for Adorno it was high
culture that could preserve a moment before capitalist commodification,
for Pasolini it was low---not the remnants of a genteel world, but a
peasant one. [Pasolini]{.underline}---poet, novelist, and
journalist---[was a militant worker in the written
language]{.underline}. One of his many interests was [the vulgar
tongue]{.underline}. Then he moved [into cinema]{.underline} and
rethought his whole practice. It's his writings on cinema that are my
focus here.34 These [took as their starting point the linguistic and
semiotic theory popular]{.underline} at the time [and made their own
vulgar sense]{.underline} out of it. He started by [making a distinction
between]{.underline} what he calls **[spoken-written]{.underline}**
language **[and spoken-only language]{.underline}**.
**[Spoken-written]{.underline}** Italian [is an **artifact of the
superstructures**, of **education**, literature,
**administration**]{.underline}. **[Spoken-only]{.underline}** language
in the Italy of the sixties still [included]{.underline} its [numerous
dialects]{.underline}. [These remain]{.underline} from [**premodern**
forms of social production]{.underline}. [Spoken-only language
is]{.underline} the language of **[the base.]{.underline}** Its American
equivalents might include the spoken-only Black English that emerged out
of slavery and that for Davis is incorporated into the recorded sound of
the blues. [Spoken-only]{.underline} language **[mediates between labor
and nature]{.underline}**. The rise of what Pasolini calls
[neo-capitalism]{.underline} [changes this]{.underline}. From it comes a
series of [new technical languages of the base]{.underline}. They [don't
come from the ideological apparatuses]{.underline} of school, church,
literature, and so forth. It's [the factories]{.underline} that [become
the unifiers of language]{.underline}. Their form of [communication
is]{.underline} not necessarily rational, but it is more [abstract
and]{.underline} more [efficient]{.underline}. These [new languages of
the base replace spoken-only]{.underline} languages [with]{.underline}
ones derived not from the ideological superstructures but from
**[audiovisual technology]{.underline}**. [They emerge out]{.underline}
of [the forces of production]{.underline}. [What drives neo-capitalism,
and]{.underline} hence [its modifications of language, is an **internal
revolution**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [external]{.underline}
revolution, the [**negation of capitalism by the subordinate classes,
did not come to pass**.]{.underline} Pasolini grasps a key point here:
[that the working class failed to transform capitalism **does not mean
that nobody else did**]{.underline}. Among the effects of this internal
revolution is a [**transformation of languages** from the base
up]{.underline}, which **[succeeded]{.underline}**. [The attempt
by]{.underline} the [external revolution]{.underline} [to **occupy the
ideological apparatuses** and **build a counterhegemonic culture** from
the superstructures down]{.underline} [had]{.underline} already [been
superseded]{.underline}. [Genteel Marxism is **marooned in outmoded
superstructures**]{.underline}. [The new hegemonic language
was]{.underline} actually [that of]{.underline} what Pasolini calls [a
neo-bourgeoisie]{.underline}, owners of the forces of production out of
which these languages emerge. [**Technical languages**
replace]{.underline} obsolete spo[ken-only ones as the language **of
production**]{.underline}. They also [displace]{.underline} the literary
and administrative [languages of the national-cultural
superstructure]{.underline}. [A new kind of vulgar tongue]{.underline}
[displaces]{.underline} both an old one and an obsolete form of [genteel
language]{.underline}. [Pasolini]{.underline} changed his tactics to
meet this situation. His essays on language [are written in]{.underline}
the new technical language of [semiotics]{.underline}---how advertising
copy writers will henceforth be trained---[rather than]{.underline} in
the old [rhetorical forms]{.underline}. But his main response is cinema.
He sees [**cinema** **as a technical language that is not dependent on
the national-cultural preoccupations of the
superstructure**]{.underline}. [Cinema is the]{.underline} common [dream
of technocrat and technical worker]{.underline} (although he was perhaps
not attentive to the internal contradiction between those two kinds of
emerging class subject).35 His intervention in cinema is to
[make]{.underline}, from the base up and using technical language, **[a
replacement for spoken-only language]{.underline}**. He made [mythic
films, in and against neo-capitalism, using its own
techniques]{.underline}. One thing that is distinctive about
[neo-**capitalism**]{.underline} is that it mass [produces subjects
in]{.underline} much [the same way]{.underline} as [it]{.underline} mass
[produces objects]{.underline}.36 It makes [consumers]{.underline} to
[go with]{.underline} its [products]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in
doing so will more and more [**bypass** the]{.underline} old
[**superstructures in** the role of **subject formation**]{.underline}.
Pasolini's project is to work in and against the new modes of the
production of such subjects. [**To the genteel** Marxist **everything
becomes textual**; **to Pasolini** **everything becomes
cinematic**]{.underline}. **[Reality has its own
language]{.underline}**, and it is [that of **cinema**]{.underline}.
**[Human perception is]{.underline}** like [a **short cut from the
language of the real**]{.underline} itself. [**Cinema is** the written
**language** and **reality is** a "**spoken**" language]{.underline}.
Both human [**perception** **and** individual **films are** orderings,
**cut from the real**]{.underline}. [Collective **human action is a
cinema**]{.underline} already, **[of the real]{.underline}**, [and an
individual **life is a film**]{.underline}. [In neo-**capitalism**,
mechanical reproduction **becomes the**]{.underline} common form of
"**[spoken]{.underline}**" **[everyday life]{.underline}**. [Action
until now had been spoken]{.underline} only, [cinema makes it
written]{.underline}. **[Reality is a cinema of nature]{.underline}**.
Everyday [life is a]{.underline} continuous [sequence]{.underline} shot
[that]{.underline} [ends with a cut, with death]{.underline}. [Cinema is
a way to write these shots]{.underline}, edit them, [and]{.underline}
[combine their points of view]{.underline}. The possibility of [an
objective "take" on the real is between]{.underline} the
[shots]{.underline}. [The objective extends beyond the
subjective]{.underline} point of view[, in art as well as
science]{.underline}. [Editing does for film what death does for
life]{.underline}. [Both introduce]{.underline} the possibility of
**[meaning]{.underline}**. [Cinema, which wants to be false, can't help
being real]{.underline}. But [the real is a nonhuman
mystery]{.underline}, and is [inescapable]{.underline}. All
**[communication is sacred, giving meaning to the real]{.underline}**.
[Cinema cuts into]{.underline} the [continuous time]{.underline} of the
real, [giving it meaning]{.underline}. [Films, like lives, are
mortal]{.underline}. [But **cinema is immortal**]{.underline} [and
sacred]{.underline}. Cinema is [**bound to life**.]{.underline}
[Pasolini was **queer for**]{.underline} time, for **[the raw, vulgar,
sacred time of the world]{.underline}**. [Only the genteel make a fetish
of language and make **language itself sacred**]{.underline}. This is
Pasolini's vulgar Marxist heretical empiricism, his distance from both
genteel Marxism and from the (for him equally genteel) avant-garde.37 As
with the genteel Marxisms, [Pasolini extracts his worldview from
his]{.underline} own [labor]{.underline} process. At least in his case,
[working in cinema]{.underline} and mass media [gave him insight into an
emerging moment in the development of capitalism]{.underline}, one
[where]{.underline} perhaps [it was starting to become something else,
driven by an internal revolution]{.underline} among its ruling classes,
the external challenge to its power by labor having failed. He struggled
in and against the audiovisual forces of cultural production of his time
and tried to open a vulgar, common, aesthetic dimension within it that
looked back to premodern, precommodified forms of everyday life. But
this recourse to the archaic did not make him a subtle reader of
emerging class antagonisms and alliances, and for that I want to turn to
our fourth vulgarian, his contemporary [Asger Jorn.]{.underline} Jorn['s
Marxism is]{.underline} not that of either the working class or the
genteel writer. He was an [art]{.underline}ist. [His was a socialism
that is neither utopian nor scientific, but experimental]{.underline}.
Jorn thought the sources of [aesthetic creation]{.underline} were
popular and was in his own way quite content to call himself a vulgar
Marxist.38 He developed a novel vulgar Marxism as a critique of some of
the more prevalent kinds of vulgar Marxism that I examined earlier. He
thought that (vulgar) Marxists left something out of the equation of
labor with value. [Jorn restored a role for nature]{.underline}, for
[materiality]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} also for producers of
[form]{.underline}, for what he jokingly called [a creative
elite.]{.underline} [The term is ironic]{.underline}. [**Artists** are
the opposite of a power elite]{.underline}.39 [In a commodity economy,
they **have no power**]{.underline}. [Art is supposed to give form to
the social practices of life, but in a commodity economy, **art is cut
off from life and becomes a special**]{.underline} kind of
[**commodity** instead]{.underline}. Where Pasolini was disturbed by the
expansion of wealth under neocapitalism, Jorn saw no expansion of wealth
at all. What has value in Jorn is difference, whereas commodity
production just makes more and more sameness. **[Capital has
impoverished the world]{.underline}**. Far from being a critique, Marx's
scientific socialism reduces the complexity and difference of form to a
rational essence. [Marx lacks a]{.underline} sense of the [materiality
of forms]{.underline} (or one might add, information: [the form of
materiality is information]{.underline}). [Marxism is]{.underline} all
too often [reduced to a dialectic of form and essence]{.underline}. [The
essence of value is labor]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} for Jorn,
[form is not a container for a content or essence]{.underline}.
Bourgeois thought sees only exchange, and [Marx lifts the veil and shows
how value is produced]{.underline} before it is exchanged. [Jorn lifts
another veil, revealing]{.underline} not those who fill the form with
content, but [those who change]{.underline} those [forms and produce
difference itself]{.underline}. **[Capital]{.underline}** **[alienated
labor from creation]{.underline}**, separating the production of content
from the differentiation of forms. Actually existing [socialist
economies did not solve the problem, with their obsession with
increasing quantities of production]{.underline} alone. Rather than the
party (or its philosophers) bringing class consciousness from without,
[Jorn wants a **horizontal relation between artist and
worker**]{.underline}. Jorn drew a distinction between the materialist
worldview and the materialist attitude to life.40 He thought Marx had
the former but not the latter. A Marxism in rude health needs both. [A
materialist attitude to life would be **open-ended and experimental**,
but also **collective and practical**]{.underline}. While he generally
through artists had been cut off from the role of form giver, [the
blues]{.underline} as Davis presents it m[ight be the kind of
materialist attitude to life that is also form giving]{.underline}. But
where [for Davis]{.underline}, [such a form]{.underline}
[negates]{.underline} everyday [experience and opens the possibility of
a politics]{.underline}, [for Jorn]{.underline} [form]{.underline}
[can]{.underline} also [affirm everyday experience]{.underline} and give
a new shape to it. [His conception of historical change has
a]{.underline} directly [aesthetic dimension]{.underline}. Drawing
together all four of our instances of the vulgar, [what I suggest is
this]{.underline}: first, **[an orientation toward the intractable
difficulties of organizing the world through labor]{.underline}**
(Platonov); second, **[a feeling for the sources of social change
directly in the mediated experience of the most marginalized and
oppressed]{.underline}** (Davis); third, **[a practice of working in and
against the technical forms of the time]{.underline}** (Pasolini);
[and]{.underline} fourth, **[thinking one's own everyday creative
experience, when it involves the production of novel forms, as not that
of labor, but as that of another kind of subordinate
class]{.underline}** (Jorn). [This]{.underline} ([affirmative,
experimental, collaborative]{.underline}) [vulgar]{.underline} [Marxist
approach]{.underline} then [reveals genteel Marxism as formed by its own
habits]{.underline} of work. [Genteel Marxism was]{.underline} mostly [a
product of]{.underline} forms of [textual study]{.underline},
[in]{.underline} traditional fields such as [philosophy, history, and
literature]{.underline}. [It projects the norms of that labor as
metaphors onto the world]{.underline}. **[Written language is not a good
medium in which to grasp the intractability of the world]{.underline}**,
the practico-inert. [Nor is it good on]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
subtle **[affective dimension]{.underline}** [of everyday culture and
is]{.underline} in particular [not a good place from which to understand
how]{.underline} traditional [textual forms were superseded
by]{.underline} the development of [media technics]{.underline} itself.
[Genteel Marxism **withdrew into the superstructures.**]{.underline} It
found itself overvaluing traditional forms, in a pastoral husbanding of
bourgeois styles. It found itself [favoring notions of the political
or]{.underline} the [cultural that the internal revolution of commodity
production had rendered]{.underline} [residual]{.underline}. And not
least, [genteel Marxism locks onto]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
received [idea that this is in essence still capitalism]{.underline},
with capitalism's temporary relations of class domination erected into
an absolute. Two things remain rather hastily elided, even if they are
sore points that keep coming up. One is the relation of genteel
Marxists, trained in the writerly techniques (be they of literature,
philosophy, or law), with others trained in practices of creating and
verifying information that are not writerly. [How is the writerly
connected]{.underline} (or not) [to the technical fields or to
competence in media other than the written and spoken word]{.underline}?
In what way [is writing as a competence a]{.underline} mark of a certain
kind of [gentility]{.underline} itself? The Man of Letters leaves it to
somebody else to type them and post them.41 His inheritors can't even
put up their own blog posts in WordPress. [The other]{.underline} elided
[problem is the writerly intellectual's relation to the working
class]{.underline}. [Being in the party of the working class or a fellow
traveler]{.underline} of it [appears to solve this]{.underline} problem,
for genteel Marxists as different as Lukács, Sartre, and Althusser.
[Another]{.underline} solution, derived from Lukács, [is to be **the
custodian of**]{.underline} the [**totality**.]{.underline} The
[genteel]{.underline} Marxist [becomes the spokesman for
History]{.underline} itself. One can also find this solution in Jameson,
Karatani, or Žižek, and in a particularly elegant form in Paolo Virno.42
A frequent gesture is to [make the connection between]{.underline} the
genteel authority of the writerly, particularly as that authority is
shaped [by the university or]{.underline} by [a high literary
culture]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [the authentic mission of labor
at the expense of other]{.underline} kinds of [information production
practice]{.underline}. [The philosophical or]{.underline} the
[literary]{.underline} is then the guarantee of some critical acumen
that the genteel bestows upon labor as a kind of noblesse oblige. But
the key thing for our purposes is that this [has a double
effect]{.underline}. The first is this cathecting onto the destiny of
labor of something foreign to it, [a genteel learnedness]{.underline}.
The second is [the reciprocal use of this imaginary connection to labor
to claim to possess something that other kinds of intellectual labor
lack]{.underline}. [The genteel Marxist claims to know and negate
bourgeois culture and]{.underline} then [to represent it]{.underline}
metaphorically [to the working class]{.underline}. By identifying
metaphorically with labor as a whole, [Marxist intellectuals evade the
question of their own class]{.underline} location and the extent to
which it may be shared with others whose immediate labor processes are
otherwise quite different. The [metaphoric inversion impedes the
possibility of thinking metonymically]{.underline}, that they are just a
part of some other subaltern class. Thus, [it is]{.underline} often
[**hard to forge links between the** literary or philosophical **Marxist
intellectual and progressive movements** in fields that are technical or
scientific]{.underline}---[that]{.underline} other and (in many ways
[more important]{.underline}) [fraction of the hacker
class]{.underline}. This may be particularly detrimental at a time when
all [fractions of the hacker class face]{.underline} similar
[problems]{.underline}. Our **[work is made routine]{.underline}**, is
**[deskilled]{.underline}**, becomes **[precarious and
casualized]{.underline}**. [It is **absorbed into** the]{.underline}
same [logics of **vectoral power**]{.underline}. **[We can't practice
solidarity]{.underline}** among our own class. We are [deduced
to]{.underline} belonging to little (Durkheimian) [groups,
hoarding]{.underline} our (Weberian) [opportunities]{.underline}. This
is particularly worrying at a time when both the [humanities and the
sciences are under attack by]{.underline} new kinds of
[**irrationalism** fostered and funded by regressive sections of the
ruling class such as the fossil fuel industry]{.underline}. At the same
time, they ([we]{.underline}) [find our **creative and productive
activities**]{.underline} more and more [**subordinated
to**]{.underline} forms of **[information management]{.underline}** and
control, which may indeed be more abstract ways of organizing hacker
activity but are by no means more rational. It has also made it
difficult to keep abreast of developments in the forces of production.
[It takes]{.underline} actual [technical knowledge or situated
experience to understand how these things work]{.underline}.
[That]{.underline} knowledge [tends to be specialized]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} [takes]{.underline} a whole practice of
**[collaborative intellectual labor]{.underline}** [to pool]{.underline}
such [knowledge]{.underline} [and understand]{.underline} the shape of
the forces of [production]{.underline} as they emerge[, in
terms]{.underline} [other than those favored by the ruling
class]{.underline}. This is a major front in the politics of knowledge
of today. [And so]{.underline}: **[four cheers for vulgar
Marxism]{.underline}**!!!! [Four rather than three, as the vulgar is
always a little excessive]{.underline}.43 [Four cheers for]{.underline}
these [four vulgar Marxist writers]{.underline}, [although they are also
much more than that]{.underline}. [Opening up the **vulgar wing of the
archive**]{.underline} again [might open]{.underline} some more plural
[pathways]{.underline} through which [to think from past to present,
**to inhabitable futures**]{.underline}. [Marxism needs to
be]{.underline} [vulgar]{.underline} again, but perhaps [in a different
way]{.underline}. The [leading]{.underline} edge of
[development]{.underline} of the forces of production [is not the
industrial system]{.underline} any more.44 [They develop]{.underline}
now [across]{.underline} a wide range of [science and engineering
fields]{.underline}. The development of [new forces of
production]{.underline} has for some time now not been left to chance,
but [is]{.underline} itself [organized in a]{.underline} whole parallel
[regime of commodification]{.underline}. Put simply, **[the worker is
subsumed into the manufacture of sameness]{.underline}; [the hacker is
subsumed into the production of difference]{.underline}**. It turns out
that [genteel Marxists belonged to a minor branch of the
latter]{.underline}, as a subculture.

[The existence of 'copy rights' predates 18th century notions of the
author's right to ownership]{.underline}.26 From the [16th to the 17th
century royal licenses gave exclusive rights to certain publishers to
print particular texts.]{.underline} In 1557, [an exclusive printing
monopoly was granted through a Royal Charter to a London guild of
printers, the Stationers' Company, because it assured Crown control over
which books were published or banned]{.underline}. The first copyrights
were publisher's rights to print copies, emerging out of the ideological
needs of absolutist monarchies to control knowledge and censor dissent.
[After the Licensing Act expired in 1694, the monopoly of the
Stationers' Company was threatened by **provincial booksellers, the
so-called 'pirates' from Ireland and Scotland**]{.underline}. 29 The
Stationers' Company petitioned Parliament for a new bill [to extend
their copyright monopoly]{.underline}. But this was a different England
from 1557, different from the Parliament that had executed King Charles
I in 1649, abolished the monarchy and installed a republic under
Cromwell,restored the monarchy with Charles II, overthrew James II in
the Revolution of 1688, and, in 1689, passed the first decree of modern
constitutional sovereignty, the Bill of Rights. [**This was now John
Locke's** England. The philosopher John Locke was among the chief
architects of the liberal state **and the ideology of private
property**.]{.underline} To Locke, property was an extension of one's
ownership of oneself. Since you own yourself, you therefore own what you
produce. [The right to property is created by labor. The English
Parliament now took a view consistent with this outlook, and The Statute
of Anne, enacted in 1709 by Parliament, proved to be a hard blow against
the Stationers' Company.]{.underline} [The Statute **declared authors,
not publishers, to be owners of their works** and limited the copyright
term to 14 years for new books and 21 years for existing
copyrights]{.underline}. The Statute, which was subtitled 'An Act for
the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in
the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies, During the Times Therein
Mentioned', created a marketplace for knowledge through competition[.
The Statute's aim was not to create an author's copyright, **but to
break the Stationers' Company's monopoly.**]{.underline} [**The
principal players**, in what the press hailed as the great cause of
literary property, **were not authors**. Publishers sued each otherin
the courts, invoking the author's rights as a pretextin their battle for
economic power. The notion ofthe author as an originator, with a
naturalright to own theirideas, may have been invented by artists and
philosophers**, but it was publishers who profited**.]{.underline}
**[Laws are not made by poets but by states, and states exist to enforce
economic privilege,]{.underline}** adopting whatever legitimizing
philosophical framework they find convenient at any given time. [The
Statute of Anne codified the capitalist form of the author-publisher
relationship. Authors had a right to own the products of their labor in
theory, but since they created immaterial ideas and lacked the
technological means to produce books**, they had to sell their rights to
another party with enough capital to exploit them**.]{.underline} In
essence, it was no different than any other sale of labor[. The
exploitation of the author was embedded in the intellectual property
regime from its inception. There are important **differences between
intellectual property and physical property.**]{.underline} Physical
property is scarce and finite, **[while intellectual property can be
copied, often costs almost nothing to reproduce, and can be used
simultaneously by anyone with a copy. It is exactly this characteristic
of unlimited reproducibility that requires the copyright regime to make
information into property]{.underline}**. In the long term, the exchange
value of any reproducible good is driven towards its reproduction cost
by competition. Since there are few barriers to reproducing an
information asset, it can have no exchange value beyond the labor and
resources required to reproduce it. In other words, information has no
long-term exchange value of its own. Thus, owners of this property
(again, not to be confused with the producers) need laws to prevent this
reproduction. [**Only by making it illegal for others to reproduce the
information can owners extract rent for the right to copy. Intellectual
property, including copyright, is an extension of the structure of
property to immaterial assets and information. Copyright is a legal
construction** that tries **to make** certain kinds **of immaterial
wealth behave like material wealth** so that they can be owned,
controlled, and traded. In]{.underline} any system of property,
musicians can no more retain ownership ofthe product oftheir labor than
can workers at a textile sweatshop. **[The system of private control of
the means of publication, distribution, promotion and media production
ensures that artists and 30 all other creative workers can earn no more
than their subsistence.]{.underline}** Whether you are a biochemist, a
musician, a software engineer, or a filmmaker**[, you have signed over
all your copyrights to property owners before these rights have any real
financial value, for no more than the reproduction costs of your
work]{.underline}**. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, nineteenth century French
socialist and the first person to call himself an 'anarchist', famously
argued that property is theft. [According to this logic, if property is
theft, than intellectual property is fraud. Property is theft not in a
strictly legal sense, since the laws of the liberal capitalist state are
the foundations of property.]{.underline} Property is theft in the
philosophical sense, as in the Lockean concept of property as an
extension of self-ownership, meaning that it is intrinsically unjust to
take what you have not produced. Proudhon, like Thompson and Hodgskin
before him, argues that the owner of property has no legitimate claim to
the product of those who put their property to productive use.27 Without
recourse to force, property owners could not extract any more than the
reproduction costs of the instruments they contribute to the productive
process. **[A capitalist class, then, could not exist without denying
workers independent access to the means of production.]{.underline}** In
the words of American Individualist Anarchist Benjamin Tucker, 'the
lender of capital is entitled to its return intact, and nothing more'.28
Since common lands were previously not property, when the peasants of
the pre-industrial age were denied access to common land by new
enclosures, it can be said that their land was stolen. Furthermore,
**[because they were forced into wage labor as a result of this
expropriation, the institution of property itself is an institution of
theft]{.underline}**. But if physical property can be stolen, can
intelligence orideas be stolen? If yourland is stolen, you cannot use it
anymore, except on the conditions set by its new private owner. If
ownership of an idea is analogous to the ownership of material property,
it should be subject to the same conditions of economic exchange,
forfeiture, and seizure. And if seized, it would then cease to be the
property of its owner. But if your idea is used by others, you have not
lost your ability to use it, so what is really stolen? **[The
traditional notion of property, as something that can be possessed to
the exclusion of others, is irreconcilable with something as intangible
as an idea]{.underline}**. Unlike a material object, which can exist in
only one place at a given time, ideas are infinite and non-exclusive.
**[A poem is no less a poet's poem, despite its existence in the
memories of a thousand others.]{.underline}** Every expression is an
extension of a previous perception[. Ideas are not original, they are
built upon layers of knowledge accumulated throughout history. Out
ofthese common layers artists create works that have their unmistakable
specificities and innovations.]{.underline} **[All creative works
reassemble ideas, words, and images from history and their contemporary
context]{.underline}**. Before the 18th century, poets quoted their
ancestors and sources of inspiration without formal acknowledgement, and
playwrights freely borrowed plots and dialogue from previous sources
without attribution. [Homer based the 'Iliad' and the 'Odyssey' on oral
traditions that dated back centuries. Virgil's 'Aeneid' is lifted
heavily from Homer. Shakespeare borrowed many of his narrative plots and
dialogue from Holinshed.]{.underline} This is not to say that the
concept of plagiarism didn't exist before the 18th century, but its
definition shifted radically[. The term plagiarist (literally,
kidnapper) was first used by Martial in the 1st century to describe
someone who kidnapped his poems by copying them whole and circulating
them under the copier's name]{.underline}. Plagiarism was a false
assumption of another's work. But if a new work had similar passages or
identical expressions to earlier ones, **[it was not considered such a
false assumption, as long as the new work had its own aesthetic
merits.]{.underline}** After the invention of the creative genius
,practices of collaboration, ap- 31 appropriation and transmission were
actively forgotten. [The accusations of plagiarism]{.underline} directed
at Coleridge, Stendhall, Wilde and T.S.[Eliot for including expressions
from their predecessors in their works reflected a modern redefinition
of the term in accordance with modern notions of authorship and
exclusive property]{.underline}. **[Ideas are viral. They couple with
other ideas, change shape, and migrate into unfamiliar
territories.]{.underline}** **[Regimes of intellectual property restrict
the promiscuity of ideas and trap them in artificial enclosures,
extracting exclusive benefits from their ownership and control.
Intellectual property is fraud, a legal privilege to falsely represent
oneself as the sole 'owner' of an idea, expression or technique and to
charge a tax to all who want to perceive, express or apply this
'property' in their own productive practice]{.underline}**. [It is not
plagiarism that dispossesses an 'owner' of using an idea, it is
intellectual property, backed by the invasive violence of a state that
dispossesses everyone from the use of their common culture.]{.underline}
The basis for this dispossession is the legal fiction of the author as a
sovereign individual who creates original works out of the wellspring of
his imagination and thus has a natural and exclusive right to ownership.
[Foucault unmasked authorship as a functional principle that impedes the
free circulation, manipulation, composition, decomposition, and
recomposition of knowledge]{.underline}.29 The author-function
represents a form of despotism over the proliferation of ideas[**. The
effect of this despotism, and of the system of intellectual property
that it shelters and preserves, is that it robs us of our cultural
memory, censors our words, and chains our imagination to the law**. And
yet artists continue to be flattered by their association with the myth
of the creative genius, turning a blind eye to how **it is used to
justify their exploitation and expand the privilege of the
property-owning elite. Copyright pits author against author in a war of
competition for originality**. Its effects are not just economic;
copyright also naturalizes a certain process of knowledge production,
de-legitimizes the notion of a common culture, and cripples social
relation]{.underline}s[. Artists are not encouraged to share their
thoughts, expressions and works, or to contribute to a common pool of
creativity. Instead, they are compelled to jealously guard their
'property' from others who they view as potential competitors, spies and
thieves lying in wait to snatch and defile their original
ideas]{.underline}. This is a vision of the art world created in
capitalism's own image, a capitalism that seeks to appropriate the
alienated products of its intellectual and creative workers**[. Joost
Smiers, Professor Emeritus of Political Science ofthe Arts atthe Utrecht
School of the Arts,]{.underline}** is among those who insist on **[the
abolition of copyright]{.underline}**. He argues [that copyright
centralizes media ownership by giving large media conglomerates an
anti-competitive advantage that damages the position of
artists.]{.underline} [Artists would gain more from a level playing
field consisting of a larger number of publishers competing for their
services, than from the exclusivity of copyright]{.underline}.30
Professor Smiers has a valid point regarding the market inefficiency of
copyright. Copyright should be abolished. However, there is no reason to
believe it will be abolished. Copyright is far from the only market
inefficiency in the contemporary capitalist market. [Without market
inefficiencies, capital would be unable to capture any more than its own
reproduction cost in any branch of industry**. The elimination of
competition is central to the logic of capitalism**. Without unfair
advantages, a capitalist class of owners could not accumulate wealth and
there could be no capitalism.]{.underline} Smiers is correct in his
criticism of copyright, he is also correct when he goes further and
**[denounces copyright as a form of censorship]{.underline}**. [However
as with all political ideas, the abolition of copyright can only be
implemented when those who support it can overcome the wealth of those
who oppose it. **This is not currently the case**]{.underline}. [32 The
private ownership of ideas over the last two centuries has not managed
to eradicate the memory of a common culture, or the recognition that
knowledge flourishes when ideas, words, sounds and images are free for
everyone to use.]{.underline} Ever since the birth of the proprietary
author, different individuals and groups have challenged the
intellectual property regime and the 'right' it gave to some private
individuals to 'own' creative works while preventing others from using
and re-interpreting them. [In his 1870 'Poesies', a pair of texts
discovered and revered by Surrealists Louis Aragon and André Breton,
Uruguayan-born French poet Comte de Lautreamont called for a return of
impersonal poetry, a poetry written by all.]{.underline} **['Plagiarism
is necessary',]{.underline}** **[Lautreamont stated, 'progress depends
on it. It sticks close to an author's phrase, uses his expressions,
deletes a false idea, replaces it with a true one']{.underline}**.31 His
definition subverted the myth of individual creativity used to justify
property relations, in the name of progress, where the myth ofindividual
creativity in factimpeded progress through the privatization of culture.
**[The natural response was to re-appropriate culture as a sphere of
collective production without acknowledging artificial enclosures of
authorship.]{.underline}** Lautremont's phrase became a benchmark for
the 20th century avant-gardes. **[Dada rejected originality and
portrayed all artistic production as recycling and
reassembling,]{.underline}** from Duchamp's ready-mades to Tzara's rule
for making poems from cut-up newspapers, to the photomontages of Höch,
Hausmann and Heartfield. **[Dada also challenged the idea of the artist
as solitary genius, and of art as a separate sphere, by working
collectively to not only produce art objects and texts, but also media
hoaxes, interventions at political gatherings and demonstrations on the
street. Its assault on artistic values was a revolt against the
capitalist foundations that created them.]{.underline}** The ideas of
Dadaism were systematically developed into a theory by **[the
Situationist International (]{.underline}**SI). The SI acknowledged that
the practice of detournement, putting existing artworks, films,
advertisements and comic strips through a detour, or recoding their
dominant meanings, was indebted to Dadaist practices, but with a
difference. They **[saw Dada]{.underline}** as a negative critique of
dominant images (one that depended on the easy recognition of the image
being negated) and defined detournement as a positive reuse of existing
fragments simply as elements in the production of a new work.
Detournement was not primarily an antagonism to tradition;rather[, it
emphasized the reinvention of a new world from the scraps of the old.
And implicitly, revolution was not primarily an insurrection against the
past but a way of learning to live in a different way by creating new
practices and forms of behavior.]{.underline} [**These forms of behavior
included collective writings, which were often unsigned, and an explicit
refusal of the copyright regime by attaching the labels 'no copyright'
or 'anticopyright' to their works, along with the directions for use,
such as: any of the texts in this book may be freely reproduced,
translated or adapted even without mentioning the source.**
Digitalization has proven to be much more of a threat to conventional
notions of authorship and intellectual property than the plagiarism
practiced by radical artists, or critiques ofthe author by
poststructuralisttheorists.]{.underline} **[The computer dissolves the
boundaries essential for the modern fiction of the author as a solitary
creator of unique and original works.]{.underline}** [**Ownership
presupposes a separation between texts, and between the author and
reader**. The artificiality of this separation is becoming more
apparent. On mailing lists, newsgroups and open publishing sites, the
transition from reader to writer is natural, and the difference between
original texts vanishes as readers contribute commentary and incorporate
fragments of the original in their response without the use of
quotations]{.underline}. Attempts to copyright online writing appear
increasingly absurd, as such, texts are often col- 33 electively
produced and immediately multiplied. As online information circulates
without regard for the conventions of copyright, the concept of the
proprietary author really seems to have become a ghost of the past.
**[Perhaps the most important effect of digitalization is that it
threatens the traditional benefactors of intellectual property since
monopolistic control by book publishers, music labels and the film
industry is no longer necessary as]{.underline}**

Despite copyleft's beneficial role in forming a valuable common stock of
software[, it remains problematic when the model is retrofitted back to
the domains of art and culture from which dissent against intellectual
property sprung.]{.underline} Cultural works, unlike software, are a
consumer good, not a tool for use in production, or a producer's [good.
Producer's goods, as mentioned earlier, are the assets used in
production, such as the tools and equipment required to produce consumer
goods sold for profit**. Capital demand is distinct from consumer
demand. Capital demand is the demand for producer's goods; consumer
demand is the demand for consumer goods**]{.underline}. Capitalism
doesn't require that a profit be made on the production of capital goods
because profits are made through the control of the circulation of
consumer goods[. Anything that decreases the cost of capital
consequently increases the potential profit that can be captured through
the sale of the goods**. Failure to understand the difference between
capital demand and consumer demand propagates the myth that the success
of free software can be a template for free culture.**]{.underline}
Under capitalism, only capital can be free. That's why software can be
free, but **[culture cannot be free without more fundamental shifts in
society]{.underline}**. [Art is not, in most cases, a common input to
production as software is. **Thus, the demand for it is consumer demand,
not capital demand.**]{.underline} There are certainly cases in which
art works could be considered productive inputs, such as sound effects,
clip art, music clips, and the like, and the tradition of artists
drawing on the work of their predecessors has been discussed at length
above[; however, when we discuss the economics of content-based works,
like poems, novels, films, or music, as well as entertainment-oriented
software titles such as games, we are not talking about producer's
goods, but consumer's goods**. Capitalist publishing firms and
entertainment industry giants will support the creation of copyleft
software in order to employ it in production.**]{.underline} [However,
in most cases, they will not support the creation of copyleft
art.]{.underline} Why would they, as art is a consumer good, and the
**[industry is not in the business of giving away consumer goods for
free.]{.underline}** They are in the business, however, of earning
profits by controlling the distribution of consumer goods. Like all
copyable, reproducible information, content-based works have no direct
exchange value, and, unlike software, they rarely have use value in
production either. Use value exists only among the fans of these works,
and, if owners of property cannot charge these fans money for the right
to copy, why would they fund the production? And if owners of property
will not support copyleft art, which is freely distributed, who will?
The answer is unclear. In some cases, institutions such as private and
state cultural funds will, but these can only support a very small
number of artists, and only then by employing dubious and ultimately
somewhat arbitrary selection criteria in deciding who does, and who does
not, receive such funding. The problem is obvious when attempting to
translate copyleft to cultural works. [If someone releases a novel under
a copyleft license, and Random House prints it and makes a profit off
the author's work, Random House has not violated copyleft as long as the
copyleft is passed down.]{.underline} To be 'free' means to be open to
commercial appropriation, since freedom, in the terms of copyleft, is
defined as the non-restrictive circulation of 41 information rather than
as freedom from exploitation[. It comes as no surprise that the major
revision in applying copyleft to the production of artworks, music, and
texts has been to permit copying, modifying, and redistributing as long
as it is non-commercial.]{.underline} **[Wu Ming, a group of
anti-intellectual property authors from Italy, claim it is necessary to
place a restriction on commercial use, or use for profit, to prohibit
the parasitic exploitation of cultural workers]{.underline}**. They
justify this restriction, and its divergence from the General Public
License version of copyleft, on the grounds that [the struggle against
exploitation and the fight for a fair remuneration of labor is the
cornerstone of the history of the left.]{.underline} Other content
providers and book publishers, for example Verso, have expanded this
restriction by claiming that copying, modifying, and redistributing
should not only be nonprofit, but also in the spirit of the original,
without explaining what this 'spirit' means. Indymedia Romania revised
its copyleft definition to make the meaning of 'in the spirit of the
original' clearer after repeated problems with the neo-fascist site
Alter media Romania, whose 'pranks' ranged from hijacking the
indymedia.ro domain to copying texts from Indymedia and lying about
names and sources. Indymedia Romania's restrictions include, not
modifying the original name or source because it goes against the desire
for transparency, not reproducing the material for profit because it
abuses the spirit of generosity, and not reproducing the material in a
context that violates the rights of individuals or groups by
discriminating against them based on nationality, ethnicity, gender, or
sexuality because that contravenes its commitment to equality. Other
versions of copyleft have tried to add further restrictions based on a
stronger interpretation of the 'left' in copyleft, based not on a
negative freedom from restrictions but on positive principles, like
valuing social co-operation above profit, non-hierarchical
participation, and non-discrimination. [The more restrictive definitions
of copyleft attempt to find an information common that is not just about
the free flow of information but sees itself as part of a larger social
movement that bases its commonality on shared leftist principles. In its
various mutations, copyleft represents a pragmatic, rational approach
that recognizes the limits of freedom as implying reciprocal rights and
responsibilities.]{.underline} These different restrictions represent
divergent interpretations about what these rights and responsibilities
should be[. Yet, given the poor economic conditions of most artists who
reserve full copyright, the prospect of non-commercial mutations of
copyleft improving the economic conditions of artists **seems
remote**.]{.underline} The chief advantage of reserving commercial
rights as an artist is the ability to license work to the entertainment
industry under other terms; as it is commercial, it doesn't qualify for
free access under the terms of a non-commercial license[**. However,
artists lack the resources to manufacture and distribute on a commercial
scale. Thus, they are in fact reliant on those who have the capital to
do so, and cannot bargain for anything more than their subsistence.** In
essence, selling their ideas is like other workers selling their
labor.]{.underline} This is illustrated in 'Music Artists' Earnings and
Digitisation: A Review of Empirical Data from Britain and Germany' by
Martin Kretschmer, Professor of Information Jurisprudence at Bournemouth
University, **[where he concludes that 'the creator has little to gain
from exclusivity']{.underline}**.41 Similarly, in his 2006 study
'Empirical Evidence On Copyright Earnings', Kretschmer states:
**['Earnings from non copyright, and even non-artistic activities, are
an important source of income for most creators']{.underline}**.42 This
study includes many startling figures. For example,the median payment
distributed by the Performing Right Society (UK) in 1994 to its
copyright holders was £84.43 [While non-commercial terms may provide a
way to integrate artists who produce free culture into an otherwise
proprietary entertainment industry, they do not challenge that
proprietary entertainment industry or address the embedded exploitation
in it.]{.underline} Non-commercial 42 terms are very problematic for
those in the socialist left who advocate for workers' self-organized
production, as these terms restrict the ability of non-capitalist
enterprises to reproduce such works. [Thus, such licenses are
detrimental not only to the interests of artists but to all workers, as
they are not compatible with the general objective of the socialist
left: the creation of a worker-controlled **economy. In order for
copyleft to mutate into a revolutionary instrument in the domain of
cultural production, it must become 'copy-far-left'**]{.underline}. It
must insist on workers' ownership of the means of production. The works
themselves must be a part of the common stock, and available for
productive use by other commons-based producers. **[So long as authors
reserve the right to make money with their works and prevent other
commons-based producers from doing so, their work cannot be considered
to be in the commons at all and remains a private work.]{.underline}** A
**[copyfarleft license must not restrict commercial usage, but rather
usage that is not based in the commons.]{.underline}** Specifically,
copyfarleft must have one set of rules for those who are working within
the context of workers' communal ownership, and another for those who
employ private property and wage labor in production. A copyfarleft
license should make it possible for producers to share freely and to
also retain the value of their labor product[. In other words, it must
be possible for workers to earn remuneration by applying their own labor
to mutual property, but impossible for owners of private property to
make profit using wage labor. Thus, under a copyfarleft license, a
worker-owned printing co-operative could be free to reproduce,
distribute, and modify the common stock as they like**, but a privately
owned publishing company would be prevented from having free
access**.]{.underline} In this way, copyfarleft remains free in the same
sense as copyleft, despite restrictions on proprietary redistribution.
Copyfarleft only prohibits subtraction from the commons, not
contributions to it. A copyfarleft license would allow commons-based
commercial use while denying the ability to profit by exploiting wage
labor. The copyleft non-commercial approach does neither, it prevents
commons-based commerce, while not effectively restricting wage
exploitation which requires a change in the distribution of wealth.
Copyleft provides a solid foundation for software in commons-based
productions[. Copyfarleft could potentially provide a workable
foundation for cultural works to also become part of the common stock
employed by independent producers. Only the promotion of a workers'
economy, not simply the prevention of commercial use, can change the
distribution of wealth]{.underline}. **[However, for copyfarleft to have
an impact, it would need to be employed within the context of a nascent
workers' economy that includes various forms of production, such as
cultural and material]{.underline}** (art as well as food, etc.). In the
absence of such an environment, copyleft and its various mutations have
little advantage for the majority of artists, for whom the prospects of
gaining financially by way of commercial licensing are negligible[**.
For these artists, anticopyright retains its strong appeal**.
Anticopyright is a gesture of being radical that refuses pragmatic
compromises and seeks to abolish intellectual property in its
entirety.]{.underline} Anticopyright affirms a freedom that is absolute
and recognizes no limits to its desire. While some mutations of copyleft
have multiplied restrictions, others have rejected any restriction at
all, including the single restriction imposed by the initial copyleft.
**[It is the movement around peer-to-peer file sharing that comes
closest to the gesture of anticopyright.]{.underline}** The best example
is the Copyriot blog by Rasmus Fleischer of Piratbyrån (Bureau of
Piracy), an anti-intellectual property think tank, and the one-time
founders of Pirate Bay, the best-known Bittorent site in the P2P
community. The motto of Copyriot 43 is 'No copyright. No license'. But
there is a difference from the older anticopyright tradition. [Fleischer
claims that copyright has become absurd in the age of digital technology
because it has to resort to all sorts of fictions, like distinctions
between uploading and downloading or between producer and
consumer]{.underline}, which don't actually exist in horizontal
peer-to-peer communication[. Piratbyrån rejects copyright in its
entirety, not because it was flawed in its inception, but because it was
invented to regulate an expensive, one-way machine like the printing
press, and no longer corresponds to the practices that have been made
possible by current technologies of reproduction]{.underline}. However,
despite the absurdity of the fictions on which copyright rests, [the
broader political context suggests that copyleft-inspired models also
have an important role to play. The outright rejection of the legal
environment is not always possible when practical considerations are
considered. **Building alternative ways of producing and sharing,
'building the new society within the shell of the old', requires us to
operate within the capitalist legal system where the logic of capture
and exploitation is embedded**]{.underline}. While space for defiant
gestures exist, we must also get on with the business of finding the
forms and structures required to build and expand the commons[. It seems
clear that restrictions such as those of copyleft and copyfarleft serve
to protect the commons and keep it free. So long as copyright continues
to exist, copyleftinspired licenses continue to beneeded in orderto
allow forintellectual freedom within the copyrightregime]{.underline}.
**[Only when workers have achieved their historical role of creating a
society without classes, can we create a truly free culture without
restrictions.]{.underline}**

#### We advocate for venture communism , a platform where material wealth can be shared and allocated to build free networks and free societies.

**[Venture communism provides a structure for independent producers to
share a common stock of productive assets, allowing forms of production
formerly associated exclusively with the creation of immaterial value,
such as free software, to be extended to the material
sphere]{.underline}**. Part of the apparatus that allowed the free
software community to grow and spread was the creation of copyleft, a
type of license that allows for the re-use of the software it covers, so
long as the derived works are also licensed under compatible terms. [By
releasing software under such licenses, **the work becomes a collective
stock for all free software developers**. The core innovation of
copyleft was to turn the copyright system against itself]{.underline}.
[The chief vehicle of asserting control under copyright is the license a
work is released under, which establishes the terms under which others
are permitted to use the copyrighted material.]{.underline} [**Copyleft
effectively hijacks the existing apparatus that enforces privilege over
intellectual assets, using the authority granted by the copyright
license to guarantee access for all, and require that this freedom is
passed on.** This is consistent with copyright laws, and dependent on
them, because without copyright and the institutions that protect it,
**there could be no copyleft.**]{.underline} [Venture communism requires
that this same freedom be extended to material productive
assets.]{.underline} [The chief vehicle for asserting control over
productive assets is the firm.]{.underline} [**Venture communism is
therefore based on a corporate form: the venture commune. Employing a
venture commune to share material property hijacks the existing
apparatus that enforces privilege, to instead protect a common stock of
productive assets that is available for use by independent producers**.
Legally, a venture commune is a firm, much like the venture capital
funds of the capitalist class. However, the venture commune has distinct
properties that transform it into an effective vehicle for revolutionary
workers' struggle.]{.underline} **[The venture commune holds ownership
of all productive assets]{.underline}** that make up the common stock
employed by a diverse and geographically distributed network of

not coordinate production; a community of peer producers produce

the commune is only to manage the common stock, making property, such as
the housing and tools they require, available to the peer
producers.]{.underline} 24 [The venture commune is the federation of
workers' collectives and individual workers, and is itself owned by each
of them, with each member having only one share]{.underline}. In the
case that workers are working in a collective or co-operative, ownership
is held individually, by the separate people that make up the collective
or co-operative. Ownership in a venture commune can only be acquired by
contributions of labor, not property. Only by working is a share in the
commune earned, not by contributing land, capital or even money; only
labor. [Property is always held in common by all the members of the
commune, with the venture commune equally owned by all its members.
**Thus, each member may never accumulate a disproportionate share of the
proceeds of property.** Property can never be concentrated in fewer and
fewer hands. The function of the venture commune is to acquire material
assets that members need for living and working, such as equipment and
tools, and allocate them to its members.]{.underline} The commune
acquires this property when requested to do so by a member of the
commune. [The members interested in having this property offer a rental
agreement to the commune, giving the terms they wish to have for
possession of this property]{.underline}. [The commune issues a series
of bonds to raise the funds required to acquire the property, which then
becomes collateral forthe bondholders.]{.underline} The rental agreement
is offered as a guarantee that the funds will be available to redeem the
bonds. **[Should this guarantee not be met, the property can be
liquidated with the proceeds going to the bondholders.]{.underline}**
This series of bonds are sold in a public auction setting. If the bond
sale clears, the commune acquires the property, and the rental agreement
is executed transferring possession to the renter[. The property returns
to the commune whenever those renting it no longer require it, or are
unable to meet the agreed terms, at which point the commune offers it
once again at auction to its members, who bid on new rental terms**. If
there is no more demand for the asset it is liquidated. After the bonds
that were issued to acquire an asset are fully redeemed, it becomes
fully owned by the commune.** The remaining rental income the property
earns is from then on divided up equally among all members of the
commune and paid out to them.]{.underline} Proceeds from liquidated
property are likewise divided. Because all the rent collected from
property rental is divided up evenly among the members of the commune,
those members who pay rent for property that is equal to the amount they
would receive in return essentially get to use an equal share of the
collectively owned property for free[. What **they pay in rent for the
property is equal to the rent they receive back as a member of the
commune**. **Members renting more than their per-capita share of the
collective property will pay more**, **and presumably be choosing to pay
because they are employing the property as a productive asset, and thus
earning enough to pay**.]{.underline} Conversely, [members using less
than their per-capita share receive more in payment than they pay in
rent, **thus being rewarded for not hoarding property.**]{.underline}
The main activities of the venture commune, managing bonds and rental
agreements, do not impose a high level of coordination and, just like
the computer networks that manage the allocation of immaterial goods,
are activities that are well suited for computerized automation. **[Many
venture communes could exist, and as they become interrelated, merge
together forming larger, and more stable and sustainable communities of
commons-based producers]{.underline}**. Any change that can produce a
more equitable society is dependent on a prior change in the mode of
production that increases the share of wealth retained by the worker.
[**The change in the mode of production must come first**. This change
cannot be achieved politically, not by vote, or by lobby, or by
advocacy, or by revolutionary violence, not as long as the owners of
property have more wealth to apply to prevent any change by funding
their own candidates, 25 their own lobbyists, their own advocates, and
ultimately, developing a greater capacity for counter-revolutionary
violence]{.underline}. [Society cannot be changed by a strike, not as
long as owners of property have more accumulated wealth to sustain
themselves during production interruptions.]{.underline} [Not even
collective bargaining can work, for so long as the owners of property
own the product, they set the price of the product and thus any gains in
wages are lost to rising prices**. Venture communism should not be
understood as a proposal for a new kind of society. It is an
organizational form with which to engage in social struggle. Venture
communes are not intended to replace labor unions, political parties,
NGOs and other potential vehicles of class conflict, but to compliment
them, to tilt the economic balance of power in favor of the
representatives of workers' class interest.**]{.underline} Without
venture communism, [these other organized forms are always forced to
work against opposition with much deeper pockets, and are **thus doomed
to endless co-option, failure and retreat**. The only way is to stop
applying our labor to property owned by non-producers and instead form a
common stock of productive assets]{.underline}. [Venture communism is
taking control of our own productive process, retaining the entire
product of our labor, forming our own capital, and expanding until we
have collectively accumulated enough wealth to achieve a greater social
influence than those that defend exploitation.]{.underline} This new
economic balance allows for change that is far greater than the modest
goals of venture communism. A truly free society would have no need for
copyleft, or venture communism; **[these are only practices around which
workers can unite towards the realization of their historic role of
building a classless society, a society of equals.]{.underline}**

[Financialization was spectacularly **enhanced by high-speed computer
networks**, which became critical mechanisms **for the newly created
speculative markets**, and no small amount of financial
chicanery]{.underline}.47 But **[financialization's encouragement of
surveillance capitalism went far deeper]{.underline}**. [Like
advertising and national security, **it had an insatiable need for
data**.]{.underline} [Its profitable expansion relied heavily on the
securitization of household mortgages; a vast extension of credit-card
usage; and the growth of health insurance and pension funds, student
loans, and other elements of personal finance. Every aspect of household
income, spending, and credit was incorporated into massive data banks
and **evaluated in terms of markets and risk**. Between 1982 and 1990
the average debt load of individuals in the United States increased by
30 percent and with 18 MONTHLY RE V I E W / July- A ugust 2014 it the
commercial penetration into personal lives. As]{.underline} Christian
Parenti wrote in his 1991 book, The Soft Cage, "the records produced by
credit cards, bankcards, discount cards, Internet accounts, online
shopping, travel receipts and health insurance all map our lives by
creating digital files in corporate databases."48 By 2000, as [Michael
Dawson reported in The Consumer Trap, nearly all major corporations in
the United States **were building huge databases, and were linked to
data mining enterprises.**]{.underline} "Symmetrical Research was
advertising services such as its Advanced Analytic Solutions, which
promised corporate clients '**[the power of one of the world's most
advanced marketing data analytics teams,]{.underline}** with proprietary
tools enabling the statistical analysis of...\[data of the size of\] the
35 terabyte Mastercard data set.' A terabyte...is one trillion units of
computerized information."49 [The largest data broker in the United
States today**, the marketing giant Acxiom** has **23,000 computer
servers processing in excess of 50 trillion data transactions
annually**]{.underline}. [It keeps on average some 1,500 data points on
more than 200 million Americans,]{.underline} in the form of "digital
dossiers" on each individual, **[attaching to each person a
thirteen-digit code that allows them to be followed wherever they go,
combining online and offline data on individuals]{.underline}**. Much of
the data is now gleaned from social media, such as Facebook. [**Acxiom
organizes this information into "premium proprietary behavioral
insights."** Each person is also placed in one of seventy lifestyle
clusters, focusing particularly on class, spending habits, and
geographical location.]{.underline} **[Acxiom sells this data (giving
varying access to its data banks) to its customers, which include twelve
of the top fifteen credit-card issuing companies; seven of the top ten
retail banks; five of the top ten insurance companies; six of the top
ten brokerage firms; eight of the top ten media/telecommunication
companies; seven of the top ten retailers; eleven of the top fourteen
global automakers; and three of the top ten pharmaceutical
firms.]{.underline}** Its clients include about half of the largest
one-hundred corporations in the United States. Since September 2001
**[Acxiom has worked closely at sharing data with the FBI, the Pentagon,
and Homeland Security]{.underline}**. In 2001, **[Acxiom appointed
General Wesley Clark, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander in Europe
in the Kosovo War and a future U.S. presidential candidate, to its board
of directors.]{.underline}** [**The company paid Clark over \$800,000 as
a lobbyist, primarily in relation to the Department of Defense and
Homeland Security**. Through Clark, Acxiom began working with
Poindexter's DARPA-based TIA, helping set up the technological systems
**for total surveillance of the U.S. and global
population**]{.underline}.50 Ov e r vi e w 19 CBS's 60 Minutes reported
in March 2014 that clicking on the New York Times website can mean that
more than a dozen third parties are "on the page that are essentially
tracking your movements[." Most of the 50 million people who downloaded
the "Brightest Flashlight Free" app on to their smartphone did not
recognize that "the companies that gave them to you for free were using
the apps to track your every movement and pass it along to other
companies." The iPhone app "Path Social," which was ostensibly designed
to help people share photos and memories with their friends, tapped into
user's digital address books and contact lists, taking all of that
information.]{.underline} The data broker firm Epsilon has a marketing
database containing more than 8 billion consumer transactions. The data
broker firm Choicepoint, now part of the data giant Elsevier, maintains
17 billion records on businesses and individuals, which it has sold to
around 100,000 clients, including numerous government agencies.51
Financial institutions themselves sell such data. Forbes magazine wrote
in 2013 that "in most aspects of our lives[, companies and marketers can
freely collect details about us and sell to whomever they like **without
restriction."**]{.underline} However, financial institutions, it pointed
out, were legally prohibited in most cases from directly selling such
information. Nevertheless, [Forbes explained that many financial
institutions do market their data in various ways, and some **27 percent
violate all aspects of the legal regulations**]{.underline}.[52
Financialization---or the long-term growth of speculation on financial
assets relative to GDP---meant the intrusion of finance into all aspects
of life, requiring new extensions of surveillance and information
control as forms of financial risk management]{.underline}. [As the
economy became more financialized, it became increasingly vulnerable to
financial meltdowns]{.underline}, **[increasing risk perceptions on the
part of investors and the perceived need for risk management, encryption
of data, and security.]{.underline}**

Aaron Swartz story seems like the government punishing a kid who was
trying to download books. But instead, it was but the US government
making a case, against all those who dare to challenge the data
supremacy, and the finical surveillance. It is a warning to those all.
And thus. We must destroy it.

national security concerns]{.underline}**. [McConnell, who had left his

prefigure a new possible form of cyberwar aimed at dragging reeling
markets down further using short-selling, options, and swaps---a kind of
"force multiplier" in military-speak]{.underline}. Hackers using
malicious codes to crash or jam whole networks can mobilize Botnets or

extraordinarily vulnerable to attack**: "the average \[offensive\]

ubiquitous surveillance. **The premise of the system is that there is no

commercial system of media content production, especially journalism, is

monopolistic corporate entities readily cooperate with the repressive
arm of the state in the form of its military, intelligence, and police
functions. The result is to enhance enormously the secret national
security state, relative to the government as a whole**. Edward
Snowden's revelations of **the NSA's Prism program**, together with
other leaks, have shown a pattern of a tight interweaving of the
military with giant computer-Internet corporations, **creating what has
been called a "military-digital complex**]{.underline}."61 Indeed,
Beatrice Edwards, the executive director of the Government
Accountability Project, argues that what has emerged is a
"government-corporate surveillance complex."62 [This extends beyond the
vast private contractor network to "secret collaboration" with the main
Internet and telecom companies]{.underline}.63 Notable examples of
partly cooperative, partly legally coerced sharing of data include: • A
2009 report by the NSA's inspector general leaked by Snowden stated that
the NSA has built collaborative relationships with over "100
companies."64 • [**Microsoft provided the NSA with pre-encryption "back
door" access to its popular Outlook.com email portal**, to its Skype
Internet phone calls and chat (with its 663 million global users), and
to SkyDrive, Microsoft's cloud storage system (which has 250 million
users).]{.underline} The Snowden files show that **[Microsoft actively
collaborated with the NSA]{.underline}**. Glenn Greenwald writes:
"Microsoft spent 'many months' working to provide the government easy
access to that \[the SkyDrive\] data." The same was the case for Skype,
while in the case of Outlook. com it took only a few months for the
Microsoft and the NSA working together to ensure the NSA's complete
access.65 Ov e r vi e w 23 **[• The NSA paid \$10 million to the
computer security company RSA to promote a back door to encryption

random numbers for encryption with RSA inserting it into its software
tool Bsafe, which had been designed to enhance security in personal
computers and other digital products.66 • **[AT&T voluntarily sold
metadata on phone calls to the CIA for over \$10 million]{.underline}**
a year in connection with the latter's counterterrorism
investigations.67 • **[Verizon (and likely AT&T and Sprint as well)
provided the NSA with metadata on all calls in its (their)
systems,]{.underline}** both within the United States and between the
United States and other countries. Such metadata has been supplied to
the NSA under both the Bush and Obama administrations.68 • **[Microsoft,
Google, Yahoo, and Facebook turned over the data from tens of thousands
of their accounts on individuals every six months to the NSA and other
intelligence agencies, with a rapid rise in the number of accounts
turned over to the secret government]{.underline}**.69 In 2012 DARPA
Director Regina Dugan left her position to join Google. During her
period as director, DARPA had been at the forefront of drone research,
presenting the first prototype demonstrations in the early 1990s.
**[However, the outgrowth of this in the deployment of General Atomic
Aeronautical System's Predator drones in warfare did not occur until the
late 1990s in the Kosovo War, with Clark as the Supreme Allied
Commander.]{.underline}** The first use of such drones for global,
extra-territorial assassination, outside a field of war---[now a staple
of Obama's "anti-terrorism" strategy---took place in 2002.70 In the
opening years of this century DARPA extended its research to developing
drones that could be used for mobile wi-fi capabilities.]{.underline}
Dugan's switch to Google in the private sector---at a time when she was
under governmental investigation for giving hefty DARPA contracts to
RedX, a bomb-detection corporation that she had co-founded and partly
owned---was connected to Google's interest in developing high-altitude
drones with wi-fi delivering capabilities[. In 2014 Google announced
that it was buying Titan Aerospace, a U.S.-based start-up company for
building drones which cruise at the very edge of the atmosphere.
Facebook meanwhile bought the UK corporation, Ascenta, which specializes
in making high-altitude solar drones. **Such drones would allow the
spread of the Internet to new areas. The goal was to capitalize on a new
military technology and create larger global Internet monopolies, while
expanding the military-digital complex**.]{.underline}71 24 MONTHLY RE V

military expenditures at about \$1 trillion annually; and FIRE (finance,
insurance, and real estate) expenditures at approximately \$2.5
trillion.72 In the digital age, these three sectors of the political
economy, each of which arose parasitically on the production base of the
economy, were increasingly connected in a web of technology and data
sharing. [As the most advanced technologies (usually military developed)
went private, many of those involved in the warfare economy, such as
DARPA's Dugan,]{.underline} were in a position to exploit the knowledge
and connections that they had accumulated by shifting to the private
sector, crossing fairly easily from one system of security and
surveillance to another. [A kind of linguistic convergence mirrored the
centralized structure of monopoly-finance capital in the age of
**digital surveillance with "securitization" increasingly standing
simultaneously for a world dominated by: (1) financial derivatives
trading, (2) a network of public and private surveillance, (3) the
militarization of security-control systems, and (4) the removal of
judicial processes from effective civilian control.**]{.underline}

#### Human Zoo

"The world might, in fact, be transformed into a human zoo, a zoo so
intelligently managed that its inhabitants are not aware that they are
there merely for the purposes of observation and experiment"

\- J.D. Bernard

#### Biotariat

"We, the Biotariat, hold no human truths to be self-evident,
acknowledging rather that all humans are mutually dependent on
unacknowledged life forms, that they are endowed by their genealogy with
certain heavy responsibilities, that among these are the Biosphere, the
Solar Commune and the mutual furtherance of Peaceful Symbiosis. That to
secure these responsibilities, alliances are assembled among humans,
deriving their lasting vitality not just from human wills but from the
continuation of all species. That whenever any form of Corporation
becomes destructive of these ends, it is the duty of the people to alter
or to liquidate it, and to institute new formations and alliances,
laying its prospects on such principles and organizing its powers in
such forms as to the best of their Scientific Understanding shall seem
most likely to effect their safety and happiness. Sustainability,
indeed, requires that Corporations long established should not be
changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience
hath shewn, that humans are more disposed to suffer, while Global
Warming appears inevitable, than to take up arms against the forces to
which they are accustomed. But when a long slick of Industrial Pollution
and Technological Innovation, pursuing invariably the same Profit Motif,
evinces a design to bring them unto species extinction, it is their
responsibility, it is their duty, to throw off such Corporations, and to
provide new regulative frameworks for future Symbiosis."

CA would harvest profiles from Facebook to identify the most persuadable
voters and send them targeted messages to move them to action. Getting
access to this data was far too easy. 300,000 users were breached,
resulting in 50 million accounts having their information scraped. Wylie
concluded, to "change politics, you need to change culture".

This is the story of a man named Stanley. Stanley worked for a company

simple: he sat at his desk in Room 427 and he pushed buttons on a
keyboard. Orders came to him through a monitor on his desk telling him
what buttons to push, how long to push them, and in what order. This is
what Employee #427 did every day of every month of every year, and
although others may have considered it soul rending, Stanley relished
every moment that the orders came in, as though he had been made exactly
for this job. And Stanley was happy.

Stanley waited. Hours passed. Then days. Had years gone by? He no longer
had the ability to tell. But the one thing he knew, for sure, beyond any
doubt, was that if he waited long enough, the answers would come.

#### Edward Snowden

Edward Joseph Snowden is an American former computer intelligence
consultant who leaked highly classified information from the National
Security Agency when he was an employee and subcontractor. His
disclosures revealed numerous illegal global surveillance programs, many
run by the NSA and the Five Eyes Intelligence Alliance with the
cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments.

Snowden gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he
was involved, and tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal
channels but was ignored. On May 20, 2013, Snowden flew to Hong Kong
after leaving his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii, and in early June he
revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.

On June 21, 2013, the United States Department of Justice unsealed
charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of
1917 and theft of government property, following which the Department of
State revoked his passport. Russia later granted Snowden the right of
asylum.

Snowden has been variously called a traitor, a hero, a whistleblower, a
dissident, a coward, and a patriot. U.S. officials condemned his actions
as having done \"grave damage\" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities.
Snowden has defended his leaks as an effort \"to inform the public as to
that which is done in their name and that which is done against them.\"
His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance, government
secrecy, and the balance between national security and information
privacy.

On September 2, 2020, a U.S. federal court ruled in United States v.
Moalin that the U.S. intelligence\'s mass surveillance program exposed
by Snowden was illegal and possibly unconstitutional. The name of the
program -- PRISM.

something like, "Segal, I might seem a little cynical or misanthropic
sometimes, but don't worry: Whenever I encounter a problem, I always try
to identify the utility-optimizing solution to it." He'd taken to
calling himself an "applied sociologist." And --- always wearing a white
hat --- he was trying to hack the whole world for the better[. [**Online
grass-roots rabble-rousing** is the foundation]{.underline}]{.mark} [for
two organizations Aaron helped start --- first, the Progressive Change
Campaign Committee and, later, Demand Progress. So when **[prosecutors
leveled trumped-up charges against him]{.mark}** two years ago **[for
allegedly]{.mark} using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
computer network to [download too many academic articles from the
cataloguing service JSTOR]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- and as they wielded
the threat of decades in prison as a cudgel to try to beat a plea out of
him --- there was nothing surprising about how Aaron responded. With my
help, he started an Internet petition in support of the little guy ---
this time, himself. [And according to the
[report](https://www.textise.net/showText.aspx?strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fswartz-report.mit.edu%2Fdocs%2Freport-to-the-president.pdf)
MIT recently released about its role in the prosecution, that petition,
as it met the **authoritarianism and petty vindictiveness of [U.S.
Attorney Carmen Ortiz and her deputie]{.mark}**[s,]{.mark} might have
**[effectively cost Aaron his life]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [The report
reads: "The prosecutor said that the straw that broke the camel's back
was that when he indicted the case, and allowed Swartz to come to the
courthouse as opposed to being arrested, [Swartz]{.mark} used the time
to [post a **'wild Internet campaign'** in an effort to drum up
support]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This [**was a 'foolish' move** that moved
the case '**from a human one-on-one level to an institutional
level**.']{.underline}]{.mark} [[The lead prosecutor said that on the
**institutional level cases** are harder to manage both internally and
externally]{.underline}.]{.mark}" House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee Chairman Darrell Issa has already written a letter to Attorney
General Eric Holder demanding another briefing on the case in light of
this stunning finding from MIT's report. As he wrote, ["The [suggestions
**that prosecutors did in fact seek to make an example out of Aaron
Swartz because** **Demand Progress exercised its First Amendment
rights**]{.mark} in publicly supporting him raises new questions about
the Department's handling of the case."]{.underline} And that is but one
of many elements of the case that should raise eyebrows. [Aaron's
defense team has already accused prosecutors of withholding key evidence
during the course of the pretrial proceedings]{.underline}. We suspect
there's more to come, as a protective order covering the bulk of the
evidence is set to be lifted in coming weeks, and the Secret Service has
begun to release a trickle of
[documents](https://www.textise.net/showText.aspx?strURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wired.com%2Fthreatlevel%2F2013%2F08%2Fswartz-foia-release%2F)
that illuminate that agency's involvement in the investigation (which
the Secret Service took over shortly after Aaron's arrest). [Our
interest in what they might reveal is only heightened by various
attempts by MIT and the DOJ to slow the release of and compel redactions
to those documents.]{.underline} In addition to the House oversight
committee, **[other offices are also closely tracking the case, with
Sens. John Cornyn and Al Franken having secured a briefing on the case
in the spring.]{.underline}** Ever with a heavy heart, we look forward
to working with them to achieve a fuller accounting of the prosecution
after Congress returns from break. Aaron's legacy deserves no less.

#### Kafka -- The Trial

"They\'re talking about things of which they don\'t have the slightest
understanding, anyway. It\'s only because of their stupidity that
they\'re able to be so sure of themselves."

"But I'm not guilty," said K. "there's been a mistake. How is it even
possible for someone to be guilty? We're all human beings here, one like
the other." "That is true" said the priest "but that is how the guilty
speak"

\[H\]e realized at once that he shouldn\'t have spoken aloud, and that
by doing so he had, in a sense, acknowledged the stranger\'s right to
oversee his actions (1.1)

\[T\]here can be no doubt that behind all the pronouncements of this
court, and in my case, behind the arrest and today\'s inquiry, there
exists an extensive organization \[...\] And the purpose of this
extensive organization, gentlemen? It consists of arresting innocent
people and introducing senseless proceedings against them, which for the
most part, as in my case, go nowhere. Given the senselessness of the
whole affair, how could the bureaucracy avoid becoming entirely corrupt?
(3.27)

After all, our department, as far as I know, and I know only the lowest
level, doesn\'t seek out guilt among the general population, but, as the
Law states, is attracted by guilt and has to send us guards out. That\'s
the Law. What mistake could there be? (1.1)

\[Y\]ou\'ve misunderstood me; you\'re under arrest, certainly, but
that\'s not meant to keep you from carrying on your profession. Nor are
you to be hindered in the course of your ordinary life. (1.8)

\[I\]t\'s in the nature of this judicial system that one is condemned
not only in innocence but also in ignorance. (4.1)

"\[Y\]ou can\'t defend yourself against this court, all you can do is
confess. Confess the first chance you get. That\'s the only chance you
have to escape, the only one. However, even that is impossible without
help from others, but you needn\'t worry about that, I\'ll help you
myself.\" (6.3)2

Progress had always been made, but the nature of this progress could
never be specified. (7.2)

And you should talk less in general; almost everything you\'ve said up
to now could have been inferred from your behavior, even if you\'d said
only a few words, and it wasn\'t terribly favorable to you in any case.
(1.7)

One such superstition, for example, is that many people believe they can
predict the outcome of the trial from the face of the defendant, and in
particular from the lines of his lips. Now these people claimed that
according to your lips, you were certain to be convicted soon. (8.4)

Just don\'t attract attention! Keep calm, no matter how much it seems
counter to good sense. (7.2)

\[I\]f I\'d behaved sensibly, nothing more would have happened,
everything else would have been nipped in the bud. (2.5)

\[I\]t was not impossible that he might receive some form of decisive
and acceptable advice from \[the prison chaplain\], something that might
show him, for example, not how to influence the trial, but how to break
out of it, how to get around it, how to live outside the trial. (9.13)

\"You mustn\'t pay too much attention to opinions. The text is
immutable, and the opinions are often only an expression of despair over
it.\" (9.16)

\"No,\" said the priest, \"you don\'t have to consider everything true,
you just have to consider it necessary.\" \"A depressing opinion,\" said
K. \"Lies are made into a universal system.\" (9.16)

Logic is no doubt unshakable, but it can\'t withstand a person who wants
to live. (10.9)

Before the law sits a gatekeeper. To this gatekeeper comes a man from
the country who asks to gain entry into the law. But the gatekeeper says
that he cannot grant him entry at the moment. The man thinks about it
and then asks if he will be allowed to come in later on. "It is
possible," says the gatekeeper, "but not now." At the moment the gate to
the law stands open, as always, and the gatekeeper walks to the side, so
the man bends over in order to see through the gate into the inside.
When the gatekeeper notices that, he laughs and says: "If it tempts you
so much, try it in spite of my prohibition. But take note: I am
powerful. And I am only the most lowly gatekeeper. But from room to room
stand gatekeepers, each more powerful than the other. I can't endure
even one glimpse of the third." The man from the country has not
expected such difficulties: the law should always be accessible for
everyone, he thinks, but as he now looks more closely at the gatekeeper
in his fur coat, at his large pointed nose and his long, thin, black
Tartar's beard, he decides that it would be better to wait until he gets
permission to go inside. The gatekeeper gives him a stool and allows him
to sit down at the side in front of the gate. There he sits for days and
years. He makes many attempts to be let in, and he wears the gatekeeper
out with his requests. The gatekeeper often interrogates him briefly,
questioning him about his homeland and many other things, but they are
indifferent questions, the kind great men put, and at the end he always
tells him once more that he cannot let him inside yet. The man, who has
equipped himself with many things for his journey, spends everything, no
matter how valuable, to win over the gatekeeper. The latter takes it all
but, as he does so, says, "I am taking this only so that you do not
think you have failed to do anything." During the many years the man
observes the gatekeeper almost continuously. He forgets the other
gatekeepers, and this one seems to him the only obstacle for entry into
the law. He curses the unlucky circumstance, in the first years
thoughtlessly and out loud, later, as he grows old, he still mumbles to
himself. He becomes childish and, since in the long years studying the
gatekeeper he has come to know the fleas in his fur collar, he even asks
the fleas to help him persuade the gatekeeper. Finally his eyesight
grows weak, and he does not know whether things are really darker around
him or whether his eyes are merely deceiving him. But he recognizes now
in the darkness an illumination which breaks inextinguishably out of the
gateway to the law. Now he no longer has much time to live. Before his
death he gathers in his head all his experiences of the entire time up
into one question which he has not yet put to the gatekeeper. He waves
to him, since he can no longer lift up his stiffening body. The
gatekeeper has to bend way down to him, for the great difference has
changed things to the disadvantage of the man. "What do you still want
to know, then?" asks the gatekeeper. "You are insatiable." "Everyone
strives after the law," says the man, "so how is that in these many
years no one except me has requested entry?" The gatekeeper sees that
the man is already dying and, in order to reach his diminishing sense of
hearing, he shouts at him, "Here no one else can gain entry, since this
entrance was assigned only to you. I'm going now to close it.

\[Continued Later\]

The man has come to the law for the first time and the doorkeeper is
already there. He\'s been given his position by the law, to doubt his
worth would be to doubt the law.\" \"I can\'t say I\'m in complete
agreement with this view,\" said K. shaking his head, \"as if you accept
it you\'ll have to accept that everything said by the doorkeeper is
true. But you\'ve already explained very fully that that\'s not
possible.\" \"No,\" said the priest, \"you don\'t need to accept
everything as true, you only have to accept it as necessary.\"
\"Depressing view,\" said K. \"The lie made into the rule of the
world.\"

Who was that? A friend? A good person? Somebody who was taking part?
Somebody who wanted to help? Was he alone? Was it everyone? Would anyone
help? Were there objections that had been forgotten? There must have
been some. The logic cannot be refuted, but someone who wants to live
will not resist it. Where was the judge he\'d never seen? Where was the
high court he had never reached? He raised both hands and spread out all
his fingers.

But how can I be under arrest? And how come it\'s like this?\" \"Now
you\'re starting again,\" said the policeman, dipping a piece of
buttered bread in the honeypot. \"We don\'t answer questions like
that.\" \"You will have to answer them,\" said K. \"Here are my
identification papers, now show me yours and I certainly want to see the
arrest warrant.\" \"Oh, my God!\" said the policeman. \"In a position
like yours, and you think you can start giving orders, do you. It won\'t
do you any good to get us on the wrong side, even if you think it
will---we\'re probably more on your side that anyone else you know!\"
\"That\'s true, you know, you\'d better believe it,\" said Franz,
holding a cup of coffee in his hand which he did not lift to his mouth
but looked at K. in a way that was probably meant to be full of meaning
but could not actually be understood. K. found himself, without
intending it, in a mute dialogue with Franz, but then slapped his hand
down on his papers and said, \"Here are my identity documents.\" \"And
what do you want us to do about it?\" replied the big policeman, loudly.
\"The way you\'re carrying on, it\'s worse than a child. What is it you
want? Do you want to get this great, bloody trial of yours over with
quickly by talking about ID and arrest warrants with us? We\'re just
coppers, that\'s all we are. Junior officers like us hardly know one end
of an ID card from another, all we\'ve got to do with you is keep an eye
on you for ten hours a day and get paid for it. That\'s all we are. Mind
you, what we can do is make sure that the high officials we work for
find out just what sort of person it is they\'re going to arrest, and
why he should be arrested, before they issue the warrant. There\'s no
mistake there. Our authorities as far as I know, and I only know the
lowest grades, don\'t go out looking for guilt among the public; it\'s
the guilt that draws them out, like it says in the law, and they have to
send us police officers out. That\'s the law. Where d\'you think
there\'d be any mistake there?\" \"I don\'t know this law,\" said K.
\"So much the worse for you, then,\" said the policeman. \"It\'s
probably exists only in your heads,\" said K., he wanted, in some way,
to insinuate his way into the thoughts of the policemen, to re-shape
those thoughts to his benefit or to make himself at home there. But the
policeman just said dismissively, \"You\'ll find out when it affects
you.\" Franz joined in, and said, \"Look at this, Willem, he admits he
doesn\'t know the law and at the same time insists he\'s innocent.\"
\"You\'re quite right, but we can\'t get him to understand a thing,\"
said the other.

**TW -- violence / suicide (not gory)**

"It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had
wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable."

K. knew clearly now that it was his duty to seize the knife as it
floated from hand to hand above him and plunge it into itself. But he
didn\'t do so \[...\] He could not rise entirely to the occasion, he
could not relieve the authorities of all their work; the responsibility
for this final failure lay with whoever had denied him the remnant of
strength necessary to do so. (10.9)

But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K.\'s throat, while
the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it there,
twice. As his eyesight failed, K. saw the two gentlemen cheek by cheek,
close in front of his face, watching the result. \"Like a dog!\" he
said, it was as if the shame of it should outlive him.

#### The discourse of crisis justifies the extension of governance -- the future is invented to structure the present, but the present cannot define the future. There is No Future -- envisioning one as truth is an act of hegemonic domination that controls us for profit.

**Nelson 20** (Ceci Nelson. Ill Will, \"No Future! Cybernetics and the
Genealogy of Time
Governance\", 11/15/2020, https://illwill.com/no-future, accessed on
7/8/2022)//gideon

The idea of "**[policing the future]{.underline}**" [has]{.underline}
today [become]{.underline} such [a central feature of the cultural
unconscious of western governance]{.underline} that we are scarcely even
aware of it. Where did this idea come from? What is its genealogy? In
the following article, Ceci Nelson re-reads the history of cybernetics
through the entanglement of time and governance. As social turbulence
and ecological collapse intensified across the 20th century, [the
**projection of the future** played an increasingly central role in the
**reproduction of the existing order**]{.underline}, [by
allowing]{.underline} [**technocratic overseers** to **predict and
navigate** the dynamics of **social fragmentation** over which
they]{.underline} themselves [preside]{.underline}. In this context,
Nelson argues, [the **management of time** became a central feature of
how **power attempts to legitimize, sustain, and extend** contemporary
forms of **governance, hegemony, and domination**.]{.underline}

Crisis as Permanent Condition

**[Crisis constitutes the prevailing discourse of
modernity]{.underline}**. [We are]{.underline} repeatedly [warned of the
**economy's destabilization**]{.underline} and [the **collapse of** the
**financial markets**]{.underline}; **[democracy and liberalism are in
crisis]{.underline}**, we're told; [the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [is **fucked**]{.underline} by Brexit, they say;
[we fear]{.underline} the **[destruction of the
environment]{.underline};** sport events are regularly drowned-out by
[warnings of **terrorism**]{.underline}; politicians again and again
exclaim [the "**refugee crisis**"]{.underline}; all the while, new
[**emergency laws** transform this **state of crisis into a perpetual
and normalized state of being**]{.underline}. [We get used
to]{.underline} the [increased]{.underline}, **[reactive national
security]{.underline}**. [The West is **submerged in
crisis**]{.underline}, as if it were **[living through an unending
apocalypse]{.underline}**. [The **prophecy of crisis**]{.underline}
[implies]{.underline}, however, that we expect or [hope for a different
social condition]{.underline} to come afterwards, [whether it be
punishing destruction or redemptive happiness]{.underline}.

[Crises are]{.underline} always inherently [bound to **visions of the
future**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} tend to [change our
**perception of time**]{.underline}: [they make us **believe that the
future can be controlled** and directed]{.underline} from its current
position in[to a different direction]{.underline}. [We hope]{.underline}
that [decisions]{.underline} made [in the present will **guarantee a
better future**]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline} in contrast to what
seems evident, **[the future does not emerge from the present---the
present is deduced from the future]{.underline}**. That is to say that
[the]{.underline} [**present** is **retrospectively construed** **from**
projections about **the future**]{.underline}; [the **future is invented
to structure the present**]{.underline} accordingly. Still, [a vision of
the future is **not**]{.underline} the **[real]{.underline}** future,
[but]{.underline} merely [one]{.underline} possible or [desired
future]{.underline}. In this sense, [the future is an **abstraction of
the world**]{.underline} as it presently exists---it is [an **ideal to
be realized**]{.underline}. Even though time goes by, [we **never
arrive** at the future]{.underline}; we merely step from one present to
the next. What does this imply for the relationship between crisis and
temporality? This insight leads us to our central hypothesis: **[There
is no future! Envisioned futures are created solely for the sake of
justifying decisions]{.underline}** made **[in the
present]{.underline}**, and thereby **[legitimizing]{.underline}** the
**[defense of the existing order]{.underline}**. **[Political visions
arise]{.underline}** in order [to **rule the present**]{.underline},
just as economic utopias are pronounced in order to make us tighten our
belts. [The **coming collapse**]{.underline} of the system [is
**discussed**]{.underline} publicly **[merely]{.underline}** in order
**[to sustain it]{.underline}**; [with reference to the urgency of
measures to be taken]{.underline} to curtail a crisis, [opposing and
counter-hegemonic envisioned futures are blocked and
suppressed]{.underline}. [The **crisis** is]{.underline} declared
**[permanent]{.underline}** in order [to]{.underline} maintain a stable
course of events and **[prevent]{.underline}** [deeper and **more
radical changes**]{.underline}; the [repetition of]{.underline} such
[declarations **justifies technocratic regulation**]{.underline} and
increased **[repression and surveillance]{.underline}**---after all, [it
is easier]{.underline} and more legitimate [to reduce people's
freedom]{.underline} to act [when they are in a state of]{.underline}
constant [panic]{.underline}. In short, the [repeatedly **proclaimed
states of emergency ar**e part of **a strategy to govern
time.**]{.underline}

It is for this reason that [we must]{.underline} **[abandon the idea of
the apocalypse]{.underline}**. Our [resistance must interrupt the flow
of events]{.underline} conjugated by the utopias of those in power. We
must [**pierce** through **the state of emergency** and **expose the
apocalypse** as the **perpetual reproduction of the existing
order**]{.underline} that it is. The fact is, [these
**discourses**]{.underline}---crisis, the state of emergency, and our
unending apocalypse---[are **part of the** same
**strategy**]{.underline}: we are not governed in crisis, **[we are
governed by means of crisis]{.underline}**. [Only when]{.underline} it
is declared as such does [a crisis properly become]{.underline} a
[crisis]{.underline}; and only once a problem is understood as
omnipresent and pervasive [does it truly become a crisis]{.underline}.
[Not only does the]{.underline} repetitive [cry of "emergency"
**desensitize** people]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} also [obscures
which]{.underline} of all the various [ongoing catastrophes]{.underline}
might [require changes that **run against the grain of existing global
power structures**]{.underline}. The situation in [Syria]{.underline},
for example, [has become a perpetuum]{.underline} mobile [of destruction
for the preservation of power]{.underline}, a perpetual recurrence of
chaos. [We must ask:]{.underline} **[who profits from
crisis]{.underline}**? **[Why do we live in the never-ending state of
emergency]{.underline}? [And how does this influence our perception of
the future]{.underline}**?

#### Projections of the future represent a western expansionism that suppresses real problems for fake crises -- that's what caused genocide in the Americas. Technology inherently interferes with the current of time through defuturization

**Nelson 20** (Ceci Nelson. Ill Will, \"No Future! Cybernetics and the
Genealogy of Time
Governance\", 11/15/2020, https://illwill.com/no-future, accessed on

The Genealogy of Time Management as a Dominant Mode of Governance

[The]{.underline} cultural [unconscious of the West is marked by
an]{.underline} [absence of]{.underline} any [openness to the
future]{.underline}. [The future is]{.underline} not taken as it comes,
but is [formed and planned]{.underline}. [This planning is]{.underline}
of course [uneven]{.underline}, and what is lauded as a [utopian ideal
by some is]{.underline} lived as a [dystopian nightmare for
others]{.underline}. [How has it come]{.underline} to be [that humans
believe themselves able to influence]{.underline} and determine [the
future]{.underline}? When one retraces the cultural history of the West,
from the early modern era into our present one, two things stand out:
first, that [the **concept of the future** has been constitutive for the
**development and expansion of the Western world**]{.underline}; second,
that [this]{.underline} concept [underwent a historical shift in the
modern era]{.underline}, such that **[the future now takes precedence
over the present.]{.underline}**

The idea [that the future]{.underline} as we envision it [acts
recursively on the]{.underline} order and [development of the present
came into prominence in the early modern period]{.underline}. In 1516,
Thomas More's Utopia was published at the same time as [**conquerors**
were]{.underline} being [driven to **imagine**]{.underline} possible
future [**utopias** **through**]{.underline} the **[expansion of their
territorial dominion]{.underline}**. The **[conquerors of "the New
World"]{.underline}** were not merely technically [superior]{.underline}
to the conquered "Indians," but also [in]{.underline} regards to [their
ability to **imagine something different**]{.underline} than that which
was given, well-tried, and passed on. By conquering Central America,
Cortes took the liberty to freely dispose over these peoples' concept of
time. He prepared himself for the transformation of a world, in which no
calendars predicted this event. The Aztecs did not expect this attack,
and ignored all warnings. This conquest was not simply a sign that an
existing utopia was being pursued at all costs, but also that [a
**transformative hegemonic culture** had developed,]{.underline} one no
longer content to adapt to the world, but [which was]{.underline}
[seeking]{.underline} instead [to change the world according to their
ideals]{.underline}. In the 16th century, [the]{.underline} possible and
**[imagined]{.underline}** thus [began to **dominate the
given**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the [real]{.underline}. If the
expansion of Occidental culture served to differentiate the Old and the
New, this was also because the climate of [colonized
regions]{.underline} near the equator rhythmically [deviated from the
four seasons]{.underline} that had structured human activities on the
Old Continent in Europe. As the cyclical began to lose its power, [the
future was no longer]{.underline} seen as an act of
[providence]{.underline}. [Western culture twisted free of]{.underline}
the [recurrence]{.underline} of events, as [humans began to]{.underline}
[conceptualize themselves as the **masters of their own
future**]{.underline}.

![A map of a city Description automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.9398140857392825in"
height="3.9398140857392825in"}

Thereafter, [our understanding of **time was**]{.underline} repeatedly
re-conceptualized and "**[corrected]{.underline}**." For example, the
concept "[before Christ]{.underline}" [became]{.underline} generally
[accepted only in the 18th century]{.underline}. [Time]{.underline}
began to lose its fixed starting point, and now seemed [to extend
backwards and forwards into eternity]{.underline}. With time understood
as [unified and standardized, the future was now]{.underline}
transformed into [an open and unlimited continuum]{.underline}. The next
important break in time was the concept of the modern era itself: by
[focusing on the contemporary]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} term
[creates a]{.underline} clear [line demarcating our "enlightened"
present from the "backward]{.underline}ness" of the [past]{.underline}.
As the linear notion of time came to the fore, [the cyclical
understanding of time was rendered]{.underline} increasingly
[obsolete]{.underline}. [Technological innovations enabled time to be
measured and structured]{.underline} differently, as happened when
[factory lights suppressed the]{.underline} dichotomy between [night and
day]{.underline}. Because they usurp the control over time from the
forces of nature, **[technology always interferes in the current of
time]{.underline}**.

[As a consequence of industrialization, mechanization, colonial
expansion and]{.underline} the fight for [world domination]{.underline},
19th century [Western culture was marked]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
an atmosphere of [constant transformation]{.underline}, [which
would]{.underline} eventually [sediment into a deep conviction that
**human progress was**]{.underline} something **[akin to a natural
law]{.underline}**. [The **future** was]{.underline} no longer
understood as a cyclical iteration of what had already been, but rather
as [a **temporal object**]{.underline} of intention and desire, [in
which the **promises of progress could be realized**]{.underline}. This
view was held, among others, by Karl Marx. Classical modernity equated
time with chronology, as if a single path connected the past to the
present, and would lead us into the future. [Enlightenment rationality
propagated the illusion of a "better society" that could be reached by
following this linear path]{.underline}. The transformation of the
fabric of time was an intervention that [made the **future synonymous
with progress**]{.underline}. [**Modernization** became a **normative
force**]{.underline}---or as the futurist and advocate of postindustrial
society Daniel Bell explains, "one of the hallmarks of modernity is the
awareness of change, and the struggle to control its direction and
pace."

In order to control the problems resulting from this constant impulse
towards innovation and perpetual competition, a new science was
developed: that of social engineering. [Social engineering was designed
to stabilize]{.underline} social [relationships]{.underline}, while
[warding-off opposition and conflicts between the poor and the
rich]{.underline}. The aim was [to integrate and "normalize" all agents
through behavioral training and punishment]{.underline}. Social
engineering was closely related to the [Taylorism]{.underline} that
[emerged]{.underline} out of the effort to theorize the rationalization
of the work processes, and which was associated with the principle of
"[saving time]{.underline}" [by]{.underline} fragmenting, measuring-out,
and [optimizing actions]{.underline}, and which continues to this day.
Following the temporal needs of production, [technology is used to
**speed up**]{.underline} both **[work]{.underline}** processes **[and
time]{.underline}** in order [to **produce greater
profits**]{.underline} for capitalists. Michael Ende published a book in
1973 on the consequences of this historical development, entitled Momo,
or the strange story of the time-thieves and the child who brought the
stolen time back to the people. Its story depicts how humans are tricked
into believing that time can be gained by increasing output efficiency.
Ende describes how a bureaucratic apparatus is created to manage
society's organization of time. Yet because this apparatus always
demands more time from the people in order to save even more, the level
of stress continuously increases. The people don't even notice that the
time they supposedly saved or originally intended to gain had evaporated
into thin air. The moral of the story is simple: **[the management of
time is a method to rule over people]{.underline}**.

The birth of nihilism originates out of the death of the past. With
World War II, the West lost its historical awareness. A new philosophy
was developed out of the ashes which affirmed that "an aftermath is a
beginning, not an ending." Since it is the tendency of war to destroy
the economy while revolutionizing technology, their conclusion is often
accompanied by an acceleration of time. The chaos of 1945 was seen by
many as a moment of opportunity, and provoked a glut of new concepts
promising to manage policy by simplification and structuring. The
theoretical frameworks of Game Theory, Cybernetics, Rational Choice
Theory, Operations Research and Systems Analysis were tested in wartime
situations before later being applied to civil society. [The
promise]{.underline} offered by these concepts [was]{.underline} related
to the dominant [Western utopia]{.underline} in the postwar period: the
desire [to build a new society]{.underline}, to [regulate and control
humanity]{.underline}, and to [balance global powers]{.underline} by
[transforming social institutions and the world into a **rational and
efficient machine**]{.underline}. What unified these frameworks was the
attempt both to rationalize politics and to control, plan and shape the
future through decisions in the present.

[World War II]{.underline} led to the greatest crisis of governance in
the 20th century. It [fueled the West's]{.underline} deep [conviction
that a desired, envisioned future can be brought about through decisions
and actions in the present. A change within]{.underline} the meaning of
[time]{.underline} was central to the installation of this idea: [the
relation between present and future was inverted]{.underline}. **[For
the future to be governed, its openness is reduced to a scenario that
can be controlled]{.underline}** in the here and **[now]{.underline}**.
[This process is]{.underline} called **[defuturization]{.underline}**,
which forms the dominant conceptualization of time in the present era.
To grasp how defuturization was created, we first analyze the reciprocal
relationship between prediction and course correction. After doing so,
we consider why the future is so often conceptualized as a threat.

Extending the Present with "Limits"

Filled with excitement for technology, the 1960s were characterized by
reciprocal accusations of evil between the East and the West.
Newspapers, science and sci-fi pushed the image of a calculable future:
North America worked on a space station from which it hoped to survey
the entire world, while the Soviet Union let a dog fly around the planet
to test whether or not it was possible to survive in the
extraterrestrial universe. Such widespread optimism was based on
benefits like regular wage increases, full employment, on innovations
like lasers, computers and antibiotics, private indications of happiness
such as the purchase of cars and refrigerators, and on achievements like
the automation of factories. The positive worldview was thus based on
the understanding that progress and prosperity would be beneficial to
all, that anyone could start as a dishwasher and end up a millionaire.
However, by end of the decade, the satisfaction and economic security of
the people had turned to recalcitrance, as people no longer accepted
everything the government had to offer them, nor their explanation for
the past; the revolts had begun.

In 1968, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) held a debate on long-term changes affecting political and
economic stability. The debate took place against a backdrop of a shift
in popular sentiment that had become increasingly skeptical of unlimited
economic growth, job security and the welfare state. The modern optimism
regarding progress had long since begun to break down. The conception of
time was now once again drastically transformed: as the future lost much
of its appeal, the present was further extended. The nation states lost
authority and yielded to the governance of supranational and
globally-networked technocratic corporations.

In our epoch, **[governance no longer lies in the
government]{.underline}**: [there is no]{.underline} more [centralized
power]{.underline}. Instead, [**domination** has **spread**]{.underline}
itself **[out]{.underline}**, [the world]{.underline} has [consolidated
itself into a "**network society**" that integrates]{.underline} every
last inch of [the planet]{.underline} and tethers the peripheries.
Today, [the role of the state is solely to support and defend this
"network."]{.underline} The [fear of instability and the wish to plan
the future]{.underline} provoked by World War II [led to]{.underline}
the formation of supranational organizations like
**[NATO]{.underline}**, [UNO, the IMF, World Bank and OECD]{.underline},
[who]{.underline} [sought to **reconstruct the Western
order**]{.underline} and establish a counterbalance to the Soviet Union.
However, these institutions only became influential in a real sense
after the political and economic turmoil of the 1970s. Since then,
[domination]{.underline} has not only [globalized]{.underline}, it has
also gradually hybridized and became informal: [the **votes of experts**
were **a new way for decision-makers to justify their
actions**]{.underline}. The Club of Rome, the World Economic Forum, or
the Mont Pèlerin Society all strive to obtain [a panoptic view of the
economy and politics that]{.underline} would [allow]{.underline} their
[stakeholders to take a proactive role in governing the
globe]{.underline}. The origin of their **[power lies in the notion that
one needs elite thinkers to oversee the minions]{.underline}**.

![](media/image2.jpeg){width="3.01825678040245in"
height="3.5955413385826773in"}

With the empowerment of this decentralized infrastructure the question
of "democratic" legitimacy arose and became crucial, but could be left
unresolved due to the priority of arguments concerning urgent practical
needs. The end of monetary fixation initiated by the Breton Woods
agreement combined with the oil crisis that same year represented the
beginning of a new epoch, a change of circumstances: firstly, a
challenge to Western and Soviet dominance arose in the middle east; and
secondly, since public attention had shifted away from technological
innovation towards raw materials, the oil crisis became associated with
the beginning of the debate on resource scarcity. Here we find one more
illustration of how [crisis is used as a mechanism to discipline the
population: humans were declared to be consumers responsible for helping
to regulate the crisis. Saving energy became everybody's duty, even if
the fact that resource consumption still increases represented an
obvious contradiction.]{.underline}

What effects did this political and economic instability---as well as
the changes in the mode of governance it provoked---have on the
conception of time? The criticism of the idea of linearity represents a
turning point: the idea of growth had been questioned, and the need for
limits had been put forth; the peril presented by the possibility of a
future troubled by resource scarcity led to an extension of the present.
The future was over.

Consequently, [defuturization meant drawing out, protracting, and
elongating the present in order to ward off the apocalypse]{.underline}.
[Western governance]{.underline} had [begun to fear its own
destruction]{.underline}. While the impact of technologically oriented
utopias had made themselves felt by the middle of the century, by the
onset of the 1970s we have lived in a continual revival of [the
apocalypse]{.underline}. In the Christian tradition the apocalypse is
the end of time. Yet as a prediction that never takes place, it serves
[solely as an instrument to discipline the mind]{.underline}. Today, its
function has been replaced by an **[endless governmental reproduction of
disaster scenarios]{.underline}**. In order to keep the apocalypse at
bay, [the **present** is **frozen** in a **self-preserving,
self-regulating system.**]{.underline}

But a system is a form and not a conception of time. A system is
composed of individual components that are hardly negligible on their
own, components that interact with each other. A system stabilizes
itself through the reaction between its parts. To become more powerful,
it must integrate more components, control the infrastructure and the
information flow, and reduce the reaction time between its parts. These
decentralized and informal modes of governance were theoretically
anticipated by a second generation of cyberneticians: Humberto Maturana
and Heinz von Foerster. These theorists drew upon the idea of "dynamic
systems". We are familiar with the cliché that, because "everything is
connected and interacts with everything else", a butterfly flapping its
wings in China might cause a hurricane in the United States. The idea is
that dynamic systems are determined by rules, however their
chronological development is not foreseeable, since they have neither
end nor beginning. As a steering or "piloting" paradigm, cybernetics was
flexible enough to integrate the system approach. Cybernetics theorizes
systems as fundamentally self-preservative or autopoietic. **[An
autopoietic system]{.underline}** is not based on a linearity between
past, present, and future; rather, the process of self-regulation lasts
from the moment the system is unbalanced to the moment it finds
equilibrium. John von Neumann illustrates the cybernetic interpretation
of the problem concerning nonlinear systems by the maxim, "all stable
processes we shall predict; all unstable processes we shall control."
The theory of self-regulated systems no longer aims to determine the
course of action and eliminate possibilities for change. Instead, these
[possibilities are included in the system itself, and only technocratic
authorities on a higher level are able (or "legitimized") to observe and
regulate them.]{.underline}

The relation between this reformation of cybernetics and the shift in
our perspective on time becomes apparent from the jargon of the Club of
Rome, a futurist association founded in 1968. Its founding members, who
were at the same time officials of the OECD, were frustrated by the
long-winded debates required by government bureaucracies. Presciently
anticipating the post-growth debates to come in the 1970s, the Club of
Rome pushed for an immediate change of course in global politics. Its
leading visionary, Hasan [Özbekhan]{.underline}, [argued
that]{.underline} rather than being left to take shape randomly, [the
world's development should be planned rationally]{.underline}.
[Institutions]{.underline} should be created which would take over the
control function for all efforts [aimed at the future]{.underline},
which he called the "look-out." These superordinate and farseeing
institutions would not only define what possible futures there are, they
would also propose paths towards their realization. Özbekhan criticized
the fact that the existing international organizations neither met these
requirements, nor did they have the political legitimacy to make the
necessary decisions. He proposed a network of independent experts who
would have the rights and freedoms to forge links and to enter into
relations with all sectors of society. Seen in retrospect, Özbekhan's
proposals preceded those of the Club of Rome, which aimed to become a
private body in the aforementioned sense---namely, a loose alliance of
futurists, but with a different interpretation of time than the
futurists before: [they extended the present.]{.underline}

The Club of Rome's publication, "Limits to Growth", adapted Özbekhan's
idea of a world in balance. Here again, [mathematical simulations
legitimize]{.underline} these [forecasts]{.underline}. Even though their
rhetoric originated in the same fear of a contingent future that had to
be controlled, the Club of Rome reconceptualized the idea of
defuturization: in 1972, "Limits" implied a transition from growth to
equilibrium, the latter being understood as a state of balance and
equality between opposing forces. The report recommends that this
equilibrium be achieved by balancing positive and negative feedback
loops. In their conclusion, and in accord with the emphasis on the
timeless state of self-regulative autopoiesis, [the Club of Rome
suggested]{.underline} "[a controlled]{.underline}, orderly [transition
from growth to global equilibrium]{.underline}." [The]{.underline}
prophesied **[transition never happened]{.underline}**---nevertheless,
the [futurists' ambitions to control the future proved **integral
to**]{.underline} forging the idea of [**self-regulating neoliberal
ideology**]{.underline} informing the regime of governance under which
we currently exist. The long recession in the 1970s made the authority
of a specialized class of experts socially acceptable, as well as the
previously unpopular idea of an autopoietic system which "we're all a
part of". The permanent revival of "the crisis" in which we are
submerged today has its origins in the 1970s: ever since this fearful
turn, [we have found ourselves in a **permanent and self-preserving
crisis**]{.underline}. **[Neoliberalism]{.underline}** not only
[**generates** itself from **out of crisis**, it **grows alongside
it**]{.underline}. **[Crisis is fundamental to the self-preservation of
capitalism]{.underline}**. Capitalism as a mode of governance is a
historical given, and that's why we call it "a system".

"Defuturization", or the Relevance of the Present

[During the first industrial revolution]{.underline}, amidst the rampant
enthusiasm for progress, public [focus was drawn away from the
present]{.underline}. [Work]{.underline} was said [to serve
the]{.underline} flourishing of [civilization in a]{.underline} far,
[far away future]{.underline} somewhere beyond the grey horizon. [The
bourgeoisie's focus on progress]{.underline} and modernity [glorified
the future]{.underline}, and [the present was]{.underline} seen as [a
transient and uninteresting threshold]{.underline}. After belief in the
final triumph of reason was abandoned following World War I, and
[considering]{.underline} the possibility of the world's complete
destruction by [nuclear war]{.underline} after World War II,
[the]{.underline} originally [positive connotations of the
future]{.underline} [were destroyed]{.underline}. What became of the
future after this disenchantment? By facing the fact that nuclear war
could gravely affect society for generations, and possibly even wipe out
the existence of humans completely, [the meaning of time began to
change]{.underline}. Gradually, the sense of time began to differ from
that of classical modernity, when people in the West had been governed
by hope. Before Hiroshima, the future could be seen as a positive
horizon towards which humanity was progressing. [With the advent of
nuclear wars]{.underline} and their destructive potential, [it
became]{.underline} absolutely [necessary to]{.underline} **[rule out
certain outcomes from future possibilities]{.underline}**. As Günther
Anders notes, this human-made scenario risked turning the future into a
game of Russian roulette, and "because the effects of what we do today
will remain, we already reach the future; the future is already present
in a pragmatic sense."

[With the darkening nuclear fate of humankind]{.underline} on the
horizon, [the future receded behind a veil of uncertainty]{.underline},
[leaving the present to take on]{.underline} an increasingly crucial
[relevance]{.underline}. In place of the Enlightenment ideal of the
perfectibility of human beings, the [sciences now concern themselves
with the attempt to]{.underline} [**control** a menacing
and]{.underline} essentially [open-ended **future**]{.underline}.
[Despite]{.underline} the **[evident failures]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}** the **[linear]{.underline}** conception of
**[time]{.underline}**, rather than calling our teleological beliefs
into question, [postwar epistemology]{.underline} spliced and [shortened
the duration of time into]{.underline} apparently measurable
[steps]{.underline}. In order to plan and decide, [**diversity and
complexity** had to be **reduced** to factors that could be controlled
here and now]{.underline}; the [focus]{.underline} consequently shifted
away from reason, [towards]{.underline} **[regulation]{.underline}** and
feedback control. The war created new opportunities for those aspiring
to actively reshape society. Scientists and engineers volunteered to
help by reducing uncertainties, effectively policing the future through
a technique the German systems theorist Niklas Luhmann would refer to as
defuturization.

Since Antiquity, Western philosophy and theology had confronted the
limits of human logic to account for possible future events. According
to Luhmann's reading, although modern society had become inordinately
complex, it was still possible to reduce all possible futures through a
procedure of defuturization. Since the future is characterized by a lack
of knowledge and by contingency, [defuturization can systematically
decrease]{.underline} this [openness by applying a binary
code]{.underline}; thus, [a future event becomes]{.underline} seen as
[either possible or not]{.underline}. As Luhmann concluded, "the theory
of time has to transform its vague idea that 'everything is possible in
the long run', one based on a chronological conception of time, into a
concept of [temporal structures]{.underline} [with limited possibilities
of change]{.underline}." The perspective of [defuturization relies
neither on]{.underline} knowledge based in [experience]{.underline},
wherein we trust in the recurrence of events, [nor]{.underline} on an
[experiment]{.underline}-based approach that constructs universal
"natural" laws from observation---both of which had constituted the
methodological foundations of epistemology between the 17th and 19th
centuries. In the 20th century, **[prognosis and
forecasting]{.underline}** instead [crept to the forefront]{.underline},
approaches that were made possible by advances in mathematics and
statistics.

As the priority shifted to predicting an uncertain future, a new group
of people began to take charge. Authority at the drawing board suddenly
fell to young scientists and managers rather than to aging war veterans.
A wealth of past [experience was]{.underline} suddenly [worth less than
the ability to **calculate the probable future**]{.underline}. The young
technocrats understood forecasting as a scientific based method of
policy advising, and claimed that neither experience nor the
conventional methods could predict the consequences of political
decisions. The very definition of cybernetics, for example, combines a
complex relationship to temporality with an obsessive interest in
prediction. Instead of thinking of time as a fixed form or a priori
category, as Immanuel Kant had understood it, cybernetics instead
rationalizes it down to its central unit of measurement. Norbert Wiener,
who coined the term, had worked on the analysis of times-series while
developing a mathematical theory of prediction that was utilized during
World War II for the construction of an anti-aircraft predictor. Wiener
calculated the future positions of airplanes with the help of a
statistical correlation between a row of time-points. With this
calculation, the military should be able to determine when and where one
must shoot in order to hit a specific enemy bomber. In this sense,
[cybernetics]{.underline} was developed as a method of [steering present
actions towards a desired result in the future]{.underline}. Prognosis
is not to be confused with the prediction of possibilities: the aim of
cybernetics is to define targets and delineate the course that leads to
them in a process of feedback.

![](media/image3.jpeg){width="4.934758311461067in"
height="2.0396237970253717in"}

Prognosis and course correction stand in a reciprocal relationship,
perpetually and incrementally adjusted as one moves forward
step-by-step. Norbert Wiener based his principles on a theory that
actually called the linear conceptualization of time into question,
namely, the theory of relativity. Postmodern intellectuals interpreted
this theory as a proof that everything is relative and everything is
possible. Without a doubt, the theory of relativity led to the
destabilization of a universal and homogeneous understanding of time.
Far more important, however, was how the [discovery of time's relativity
spurred the ambition to control, regulate and shape it.]{.underline}

In the 1960s, cybernetician Hasan Özbekhan remarked that [no preceding
era had]{.underline} ever [been so obsessed with the
future]{.underline}. That there exists a large number of different
possible futures to choose from became a central tenet of the fields
that would comprise the [futurology]{.underline} (also known as future
studies) that [became]{.underline} so extremely [important]{.underline}
at the time. The devastation wrought by [the war gave rise to the
**management of the future through rational, scientific
methods**]{.underline}, marking a shift [toward the **paradigm of
defuturization**]{.underline}. [The logic]{.underline} behind these
methods [was]{.underline} [by no means peaceful]{.underline};
**[futurology and the nuclear arms race share common
roots]{.underline}**. John von Neumann invented the equilibrium strategy
of mutually-assured destruction based on Game Theory, and Herman Kahn
wrote essays on alternative scenarios of nuclear war, defending war with
the same self-evident rhetoric that some of his contemporaries defended
free love.

[Futurology's]{.underline} primary [achievement was]{.underline} the
creation of [technological prognosis]{.underline}. The results were
intended to overcome a division in public discourse: [positive visions
of]{.underline} the future [glorified technics]{.underline}, while
[negative visions]{.underline} warned [of]{.underline} a takeover by
[cyborgs and artificial intelligence]{.underline}. To overcome wild
speculations, [futurists]{.underline} [interviewed experts]{.underline},
asking them when particular inventions or milestones would be possible,
for example, living on the moon. [Their **failed forecasts** are a
testimony to the **limits of the ability to reduce an open future
through defuturization**]{.underline}. Claus Koch (a contemporary of
Herman Kahn, John von Neumann, and Hasan Özbekhan) put it well: in
futurology's conclusions, only the silhouettes of the present appear.

[The]{.underline} actual **[present has]{.underline} [proven these
prognoses]{.underline}** to be **[false]{.underline}**: by the year 2000
[there were **no artificial moons**]{.underline} to give us daylight,
and no **[interplanetary space flights]{.underline}**, [even though both
were predicted]{.underline}. The [futurists **predicted neither** the
**energy crises** nor the **environmentalist movement**]{.underline};
[they didn't envisage the collapse of the **Soviet Union**, couldn't
forecast the relevance of **computers**, misjudged pop**ulation
growth**, and neither of the nuclear disasters in **Chernobyl nor
Fukushima** show up in their reports]{.underline}. You don't have to be
a rocket scientist to know how absurd it is that the conceptual ideas of
prediction were increasingly integrated into the political sphere, or
that prognosis became a widely established practice. What system
theorist, government advisor, and OECD consultant Erich Jantsch said in
the 1960s remains essentially true: "[technological
forecasting]{.underline} and planning [have a]{.underline} natural and
inherent [tendency toward]{.underline} fuller [integration]{.underline},
which, in the 1970s, may possibly result in the disappearance of
forecasting as a distinguishable discipline." The explanation for this
disappearance is as follows: the [futurists were employed as planning
strategists]{.underline}, and [military think tanks
provided]{.underline} the methodological [knowledge]{.underline} needed
to carry out prediction and planning. After World War II, the military
apparatus was diminished and the **[futurists became the
employers]{.underline}**. Some went back to
**[university]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} remained in **[think
tanks]{.underline}** where they fine-tuned their methods of prognosis. A
considerable portion of them went into **[government]{.underline}**,
where academic expertise became a highly respected value, while others
went on to manage large **[corporations]{.underline}** [like Ford and
General Motors]{.underline}. Robert McNamara did both, well before he
became head of [the **World Bank**]{.underline}. This is how the early
scientific attempts to control nuclear risk by **[calculating the
future]{.underline}** eventually [became a **major part of our
predominant power structure.**]{.underline}

In sum, [time developed a new meaning]{.underline} by the middle of the
20th century. [As]{.underline} [fear of an incalculable future
deepened,]{.underline} provoking a collapse of the modern era's
eschatological destiny, the cybernetic idea, which posits [that control
can be retroactively adjusted]{.underline} after a goal is set,
[brought]{.underline} with it [the practice of **structuring the
future** into manageable segments]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline}
gradually **[correct deviations]{.underline}**. [Yet]{.underline} the
use of formal [models is by no means]{.underline} a
[neutral]{.underline} way of depicting the future. **[Simplifications
are not accurate]{.underline}** representations, but are undeniably
[marked by **political assumptions** and can be subject to
manipulation]{.underline}. **[Statistics]{.underline}** play a key role
within strategies aiming to govern the future, since they [offer a
framework for **legitimating decisions in the present**.]{.underline} In
their hopes of stabilizing power structures and the economy, rulers rely
on such methods of [calculation to eliminate undesirable]{.underline}
possible [futures]{.underline}. The goals they set for the future
[operate like a feedback loop]{.underline}, meaning that in the final
analysis, [political **prognoses are**]{.underline} not [deemed **true
because**]{.underline} they are correct, but rather because massive
[**resources are deployed in** the service of **making them
correct**]{.underline}. Thus, [aren't **prognoses**]{.underline} merely
**[rhetorically-clad formulations of a pre-existing goal designed to
steer politics toward a desired future]{.underline}**?

Where Are We Now?

[The collapse of the Eastern Bloc in]{.underline} 1990 [was meant to be
the end of history]{.underline}, the obsolescence of all utopian
thinking. [All hope]{.underline} was placed [in the triumph of
capitalism]{.underline}. If we say "**[no future]{.underline}**", this
[should be understood as **a refusal of both this restriction and of
defuturization**]{.underline}---**[we do not want to]{.underline} [give
control over the past, present, and future to experts and those in

solutions]{.underline}"---clearly **[a fascist statement]{.underline}**.
What else do these backlashes signify? How can we explain the recent
return to the nation-state, as evidenced by "Brexit" no less than the
Covid pandemic, which signal an obvious crisis in the conception of
supranational governance? [Instead of accepting this reality as the
consequence of our contemporary global politics, we should ask ourselves
how the **frameworks of crisis can be broken down
entirely**]{.underline}. How can [we oppose the current mode of crisis
governance]{.underline}? For this, [it is **not sufficient to** simply
**announce, as an abstract imperative, the need to discard Western
conceptions of time**]{.underline}, whether [by defining time in a
different way, or]{.underline} else [nihilistically refusing all

**develop a strategy**]{.underline}, one capable [of
generating]{.underline} new **[pluralist forms of life and discourses,

Journal: The knowledge to which you allude presupposes a reassessment of
the current form of knowledge. Is there a field that is best suited to
take this critical look? B. Stiegler: In fact, **[every academic field
is critical]{.underline}** in this respect: [an academy should develop
and **safeguard**]{.underline} these [**critical**
**spaces**]{.underline}, and **[philosophy must lead the critical
debate]{.underline}** **[given that this debate]{.underline}** **[always
spreads into other disciplines]{.underline}**. To grasp its relevance in
the un-knowing (inscient) consciousness of the Anthropocene era, I
insist that [we must study]{.underline} what I have called \"[doubly
epokhal redoubling]{.underline},\" which constitutes the dynamic of
epiphylogenesis and the tertiary retentions that result from it through
the process of exosomatization. To confront these issues today, [we have
to revisit]{.underline} the history of [the production of
knowledge]{.underline} based on the founding principles of Greek
philosophy, and before that the ideas of the pre-Socratics insofar as
they generated the organization of the politeia, and after that, of
theology, which profoundly reconfigured the Greco-Roman heritage. In
1158, 70 years after its founding, the university of Bologna began to
form the matrix that would emancipate itself and the clerics from papal
domination, through the independence guaranteed to them by the
Authentica habita that emperor Frederick Barbarossa promulgated the same
year. This matrix would engender -- alongside Oxford firstly, then the
Sorbonne -- the model that Kant would later critique in The Conflict of
the Faculties. With the University of Berlin, which created the
department of philosophy in the wake of Kant's text, as with the École
normale supérieure created by the National Convention during the
Revolution, then with the Grandes écoles founded by Napoleon, then
through the educational and scientific policies of Jules Ferry, [the
**university** was to **serve** the interests of **industrial
modernization**,]{.underline} and therefore of the economy (what the
Romans, devising the concept of the otium, called the negotium), but
[always under **state control**]{.underline}. Ever since [the hegemonic
entrenchment first]{.underline} of neoliberal, then ultraliberal, and
now **[libertarian]{.underline}** thinking -- which combines the
ultraliberalism of the \"conservative revolution\"
**[with]{.underline}** the [**disruptive technologies** that
**proletarize the state itself**]{.underline}, literally
[**disintegrating** the connective tissue that
**education**]{.underline} in the skholeion [maintained with
politics]{.underline} from Ancient Greece to the present (see
Henri-Irénée Marrou) -- [the **university** is well on the way **toward
privatization**]{.underline}, i.e. also toward defunctionalization and
refunctionalization (redefinition of its functions). Both abroad and in
France, more or less pitiful attempts to conform to this model fail
regularly, leading to the collapse of an academic culture that was a
model for centuries, and which has literally been demolished. This is
the result of the tide that Jean-François Lyotard saw coming 40 years
ago in The Postmodern Condition. I believe, however, that the herd
instinct in this matter has been disastrous, for France and more
generally for Europe: to a large extent because Europe has not
understood that it is not Europe anymore -- it has become a colony on
the road to underdevelopment, and [the **question** many ask is whether
it **will remain within the American sphere** (with or without
NATO)]{.underline} or whether China will finally seize it for itself.
But I am still hoping that Europe will \"wake up,\" and this is also
what drives the work of the Institut de recherche et
d'innovation, pharmakon.fr, and the Internation/Genève 2020
collective. We must try to think (penser) these questions through,
care-fully think (panser) them through. Before anything [this means
trying to reconsider what is happening to knowledge in the 21st
century]{.underline}, [concerning both its
\"**production**]{.underline}\" (i.e. scientific institutions -- in the
broad sense of the word science, irreducible to the computational and
narrow-minded mechanicism that is currently ultra-dominant) [and its
**transmission**]{.underline}, at a time when knowledge is required (cf.
Greta Thunberg) in order to \"save humanity\" from [what its adulterated
knowledge, transformed and distorted into information]{.underline} (i.e.
[models of **calculability**]{.underline}), has brought about, as even
[the value of this knowledge is put into question]{.underline} (this is
what we call post-truth). [A]{.underline}n absolutely **[disastrous
ideology]{.underline}** -- but one that is perfectly in sync with the
short-sighted objectives of the negotium of high finance -- has finally
managed to impose on the more or less muddled state of French public
opinion (from the \"elites\" to the \"bottom of the pecking order\") the
doxa according to which [**complete calculability** is the condition of
science and, more generally, of any form of knowledge]{.underline}. But
[on the contrary]{.underline}, its [openness to what]{.underline} always
[**exceeds any calculation** is what makes a domain of knowledge
know]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} also what [makes it]{.underline}
make, allowing it to [fight against entropy]{.underline}. This is what
Alfred North Whitehead called the function of reason. What burst forth
from the 18^th^ century, from the Enlightenment in Europe and America,
was at once a product of humanism, the Reformation, the
Counter-Reformation, and the Academies -- with their origins in the
Republic of Letters -- that led to printing, the successive
proliferation of libraries, and the emergence of gazettes. The Académie
de Dijon, in whose competition Rousseau participated, is one example.
Why has digital reticulation not instigated a renewal of the academic
system descended from Plato's academy by way of those in Dijon and
elsewhere, and by way of the universities and faculties as they have
transformed themselves over the last millennium? Because exosomatization
\"abhors a vacuum,\" and because [philosophy]{.underline} has [made that
vacuum possible]{.underline}. [The time has come to wake
up]{.underline}. We must [ask ourselves these questions at a time when
**the place and the role of fields of knowledge and their
institutions**]{.underline} -- the family is one such institution --
**[are at the heart of vital issues that dominate the
Anthropocene]{.underline}** era. [What can the **academy, the university
and their collective knowledge** do in this era?]{.underline} And [what
do they know]{.underline} about this era? It is therefore incumbent on
us to envision the future of what we must see as the academic system --
in the sense that, since the 19th century, it is impossible to separate
the disciplinary, didactic and pedagogical training of primary and
secondary school teachers from research and coursework in the
university. The academic system, such as it became established in France
at the end of the 19th century (and in a more or less similar fashion
throughout the world), must first be considered as what constitutes the
institutional reality of what I have called the \"doubly epokhal
redoubling,\" the second period of this double redoubling to be precise,
as the first was one of a technological shock brought about by
exosomatization. I will briefly summarize the argument underlying this
concept. Every human society is firmly based upon a technical system
that transforms itself regularly. Ever since the Industrial Revolution,
this transformation has been systemically underpinned by the economic
war in which the industrial and national capitalisms are engaged. Every
time the technical system is transformed on that systemic scale (in
Bertrand Gille's sense of the technical system) the adjustments that had
previously been established between it and the social systems (in the
sense of Gille and Niklas Luhmann) are put into question, triggering a
noetic reconstitution that appropriates the new technical system while
creating new circuits of transindividuation, i.e. new knowledge -- in
academia as well as in the empirical practices that characterize what
consequently forms an epistēmē. On the other hand, we should bear in
mind that this whole system, which was first developed out of the
fundamentals of Western philosophy -- first Greco-Roman, then Christian
-- and later from modern philosophy and what Marx called German
idealism, is as a result based upon a repression of the question of
technics -- German ideology, however, asserts that this is its starting
point. With the arrival of industrial society, the academic system had
to train producers who were capable of playing various roles in
production, from the proletarian to the engineer and the banker, up to
the head of the firm: it had to train a \"national elite.\" And what was
true of production was equally true of the army, the legal and medical
systems, the arts, etc., who had to deal with constant technological
change. This responsibility to train producers, which was assigned to
the academic system, had at one time belonged to craftsmen's guilds. In
addition, a trained citizenry was then required to guarantee national
unity, above and beyond the borders of European France. This was a
crucial issue for Jules Ferry, a colonial and colonialist issue: not
only did the unity of the colonial empire have to be produced, but there
had to be unity among the regions of the national territory and fewer
\"particularities,\" with the \"universal\" as the operator of what,
however, laid the groundwork for the homogenization of the marketplace.
Concerning all of these new arrangements and the way they came to be,
which deserves closer study, I would like to outline an overall
perspective on their consequences in the Anthropocene era, emphasizing
first of all that the academic system has been, in a clearly un-knowing
way, the primary operator. The result is that in today's \"post-truth\"
context, what prevails is a feeling, if not of uselessness, at least of
inefficiency and of disrepute: a fundamental sense of unease in the
academic system, whether in primary, secondary and high schools or in
the universities. In various texts, I have tried to demonstrate that
this unease has been engendered by a situation in which the programming
industries (both audiovisual and algorithmic) are now competing with the
programming institutions that form the academic system. This means, on
the one hand, that children no longer have the necessary attention span
to be ready to listen, and on the other -- but this is less widely
admitted and obviously hard to say and to accept -- the teachers are
themselves massively affected by this competition. This is just as true
of the parents, who don't always tolerate being told that: and many of
us are parents as well. The result is that attention, and consequently
the sense of responsibility, grows ever weaker -- and this is also what
Greta Thunberg says to her elders, i.e. to us. In fact, the whole
problem is what is going on in the academic field in the broadest sense.
When the name of the TV show Star Academy is more or less the symptom of
a functional disintegration of knowledge (academic or otherwise),
effectively, at the end of the Anthropocene era, all that has therefore
become illegitimate. [The]{.underline} **[legitimacy of the academy has
crumbled]{.underline}** [under the influence of]{.underline} [analogic
and numeric technologies whose implementation is]{.underline} entirely
[beholden to the programming industries]{.underline}, [while we ask the
programming institutions to adapt]{.underline} more and more [to these
industries and their informational and communicational
models.]{.underline}

What I hope to have demonstrated here are [the]{.underline} **[deep
rhetorical links]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}
**[neoliberalism]{.underline}**, **[globalisation]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[militarisation]{.underline}** [in terms
of]{.underline} 'security' and the personal, political, economic, and
cybernetic deployments of '**[security' in communication]{.underline}**.
By 'rhetorical' I mean [a conscious and concerted effort of
**communication aimed at working up the attitudes and actions of
people**]{.underline} en masse (Graham, 2017). A quote by Thomas L.
Friedman will do to set the tone of my summary: [The **hidden hand** of

[technologies need a strong power that]{.underline} [promotes those
ideas by example and protects those ideas by winning on the
battlefield]{.underline},' says the foreign policy historian Robert
Kagan. (Friedman, 1999, p. 84) [There are many internal
paradoxes]{.underline} and contradictions at the core of the
neoliberalism--globalism-- militarism nexus. All turn on notions of
security at one or more points, but more importantly, all are integral
parts of a communicative complex through which [**fear** is propagated
as a primary **political means of** **motivating people**]{.underline}
(Graham & Luke, 2003; Graham, Keenan, & Dowd, 2004). Hermann Goering put
it as plainly as possible: Why, of course, **[the people don't want
war]{.underline}** . . . Why would some poor slob want to risk his life
in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his
farm in one piece. Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither
nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is
understood. But, after all, [it is the **leaders of the country who
determine the policy** and it a simple matter to **drag the people
along**]{.underline}, whether it is a democracy or a fascist
dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship . . . voice or
no voice, can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is
easy. All you have to tell [them is they are being attacked and
**denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism** exposing the country
to danger. It works the same way in any country]{.underline}. (Goering,
1938; cited in Gilbert, 1947, pp. 278--279)

Once again I want to emphasize here that in order [to make responsible
decisions about technology]{.underline}, [one must be aware that
**technology**]{.underline}, [as well as the conceptual system on which
it is based]{.underline}, **[can only be problematized from
within]{.underline}**. This is precisely what the search for the points
of opacity of technology allows us to do -- [stepping **out of a
conceptual system** by continuing to **use its concepts** while at the
same time **demonstrating their limitations**]{.underline} (Derrida,
1980). This process of [the **problematization of technology** is
**creative, productive and politically meaningful**]{.underline}. In
fact, it shows that, since not everything in technology can be thought
or fully conceptualized within one consistent framework, and since
points of opacity always remain, [technology]{.underline} also always
[brings]{.underline} about [unexpected consequences]{.underline}.
Perhaps [the most important point of opacity]{.underline} that emerges
from such a problematizing reading [is the conceptualization of
technology in terms of instrumentality]{.underline}. As we have seen, a
sustained [attempt to define software as instrumental]{.underline} can
be found in Software Engineering. Such a definition [presupposes **that
software is controllable**]{.underline}, [that its development and uses
can be planned and]{.underline} that the [risks]{.underline} and
consequences implicit in software can be [foreseen]{.underline}. Broadly
speaking, [this]{.underline} concept of software [is based on the
Aristotelian idea that technology is a tool that must be
mastered]{.underline} by humans to pursue certain ends -- a concept that
constitutes the foundation of the general understanding of technology in
the Western philosophical tradition. Consistently with this Aristotelian
line of thought, not only is [software]{.underline} defined as a tool in
Software Engineering, but it [is]{.underline} also [conceptualized in
terms of binary oppositions]{.underline} (for instance the one between
[technology and society]{.underline}) and [its development is
articulated in **linear terms**, as a **controllable sequence of
step**s]{.underline}. This philosophico-technical conjuncture is what,
in the words of Timothy Clark, Derrida understands as [the '**complicity
of technology with metaphysics'**]{.underline} (Clark, 2000: 248). And
yet, as the thinkers of 'orginary technicity' have shown, [**technology
cannot be fully conceptualized** within the Aristotelian
framework]{.underline} (Beardsworth, 1996).10 In fact, the
[understanding of software as a tool is continuously undone by the
unexpected consequences]{.underline} brought about by software -- which
must be excluded and controlled in order for software to reach a point
of stability but which at the same time remain necessary to its
development.11

#### The judge is the audience of securitization -- a neg ballot legitimizes capital, and an aff ballot is the only way to solve -- interaction between the speaker and audience creates reality

From ST certain core assumptions can be elicited relevant to the process
of collective securitization. To that end, we draw upon CS, still the
most influential (and debated) contribution to the securitization
literature. Two considerations dictated our choice. First, given the
near absence of securitization scholarship in relation to NATO an
underlying task of this article is to establish the appropriateness of
ST as such. There is no unified or 'grand theory' of securitization upon
which we can call in this respect,26 but CS occupies the 'city-centre'
of securitization scholarship. Its foundational concepts thus have a
justified claim to be the starting point of application.27 Second, the
'neighbourhoods' of ST (to continue the analogy) are less suited to the
object of our concern. The so-called Paris School, for instance, does
not view securitization primarily through rhetorical performance,28 a
weakness in the case under consideration given that the rupture in
NATO-Russia relations from 2014 was occasioned most obviously by a
marked shift of discourse. In its original formulation, CS viewed ST as
having a twofold purpose. First, ST explained how issues moved from the
realm of 'normal' politics to the realm of security where the state
could bypass democratic discourse and procedure. Second, ST isolated the
mechanisms whereby such a move was enacted. **[Securitization is
initiated by a speech act, a 'securitizing move]{.underline}**'
**['through which an intersubjective understanding is constructed within
a political community to treat something as an existential threat to a
valued referent object, and to enable a call for urgent and exceptional
measures to deal with the threat]{.underline}**.'29 The alternative,
desecuritization process, shifts 'issues off the "security" agenda and
back into the realm of public political discourse and "normal" political
dispute and accommodation.'30 Three issues---state-centrism, threat
construction, and audience role--- have been contested within ST. Our
preliminary purpose here is to set up the CS approach as relevant
despite these concerns. The further amendments necessary for a theory of
collective securitization are then considered in the next section. The
first issue revolves around [the 'Westphalian straitjacket']{.underline}
that [embeds the CS in **Euro-centric understandings** of state capacity
and which **privileges the role of authoritative governing elites** in
threat definition]{.underline}.31 This charge of state-centrism is only
partially justified. Barry Buzan and Ole Wæver have argued that the CS
is 'not dogmatically state-centric in its premises' even if for
'contingent, empirical reasons \[...\] securitization theory is \[...\]
somewhat state-centric in its findings.' 32 In fact, a not insignificant
literature exists informed by ST in which both inter-governmental and
non-governmental actors are given due consideration.33 In a recent
intervention, [ST has been explicitly applied to NATO]{.underline},34
and there is a body of work of longer-standing which, informed by
[ST]{.underline}, [regards NATO through a discursive
lens]{.underline}.35 [These]{.underline} studies [are not]{.underline},
however, [about collective securitization]{.underline}, insofar as
[they]{.underline} simply [swap]{.underline} one actor ([the
state]{.underline}) [for]{.underline} another ([an
international]{.underline} or non-governmental
[organization]{.underline}) as the focus of analytical attention. What
interests us, rather, is [the neglected question of how a **group of
states undertakes securitization in concert**]{.underline} and how, at
the international level, that process is expressed and
institutionalized. [CS]{.underline} initially [held]{.underline} out
[this]{.underline} possibility [in relation to the EU]{.underline}. 36
We see no reason why [it can]{.underline}not [be extended to
NATO]{.underline}. As for threat construction, [the initial]{.underline}
and influential [claim of the CS was that the speech act itself
constituted 'security' not the 'something more real' which the act
described]{.underline}.37 [Such a position is now]{.underline} seen as
**[untenable]{.underline}**. **[The speech act is not separate from
reality]{.underline}**; **[it only interprets it in a particular
way]{.underline}**.38 **[What]{.underline}** [**threats** become subject
to **securitization** is]{.underline}, in fact, [a matter of **political
choice**]{.underline}. 39 Both national and system-wide dynamics are
relevant here. States will of necessity respond to threats which impact
upon them directly (when their territorial integrity, national identity
or constitutional order is infringed). Acting collectively in the face
of such threats cannot be excluded (acts of solidarity are possible),
but collective securitization is more likely to occur when a threat has
a systemic referent (impinging upon international and collective
identities, or the rules and norms governing interstate interactions).40
[NATO's character as a military alliance bound by a mutual defence
pledge and as a community of norms means it embraces both these
dynamics]{.underline}. The third contested issue concerns the precise
relationship between the securitizing actor and its audience. [In their
original formulation]{.underline}, Buzan, Wæver and de Wilde suggested
'**[an issue is securitized only if and when the audience accepts it as
such]{.underline}**.'41 [The act of acceptance]{.underline}, however,
[was left unexplore]{.underline}d thus [leaving the audience
marginalized as an analytical category]{.underline}. 42 [More
recently]{.underline}, Wæver has argued that **[securitization involves
political interaction between both actor and audience]{.underline}**
[through which]{.underline} **[agreement is reached on what constitutes
the source of insecurity]{.underline}**.43 Viewing securitization in
this manner has two advantages. First, it points to [a
process]{.underline} that [is **ongoing**]{.underline}, one that
[entails **dialogue**]{.underline}, **[negotiation and compromise rather
than a single, unidirectional transaction by the securitizing
actor]{.underline}**. Here, [the audience becomes **more than a passive
recipient** of a securitizing move; it **empowers that move** and may
even initiate it.]{.underline} This process within an international
organization we define as recursive interaction: repeated bargaining
procedures and substantive exchanges between a security actor (the
organization) and its audience (the organization's constituent members)
over the content and form of threats as well as the policy responses
appropriate to mitigating them. In collective securitization this means
the audience takes on a particular form and meaning; it is not external
to the securitizing actor but constitutive of it. Second, an active
understanding of audience helps explain policy choice: why some issues
(and not others) are securitized and, thus, why certain policies are
formulated in response.44 The outcome here remains dependent on the
balance of positional power between actor and audience. In a national
setting the former will always have an advantage (even in democracies)
given its association with government and access to the resources of the
state. The latter (whether defined as public opinion, the electorate,
political elites, or interested minorities) will be more constrained in
its ability to mobilize political resources. Collective securitization
(particularly in the military sector) gives rise, however, to a quite
different dynamic: the empowering audience is itself comprised of states
and the securitizing actor (i.e. NATO) does not enjoy default positional
power. Such a dynamic affirms the need to take the role of audience, and
recursive interaction, seriously.

This chapter introduces the poststructuralist perspective on
international relations (IR). It outlines the epistemological and
ontological fundament of poststructuralist thinking and introduces key
concepts, notably discourse. This chapter aims to show that [the way we
talk about the world, about ourselves and others matters]{.underline}.
It employs a particular focus on issues and examples that relate to the
military -- a domain that for long has been dealt with from more
traditional IR perspectives. It seeks to encourage to look at those
issues from a different, more critical, angle. It touches upon questions
like: Can we ever be fully secure or do we need threats? How did the
Global War on Terror become thinkable? What is the relationship between
humanitarian interventions and identity? By presenting key contributions
to the poststructuralist body of literature in IR, this chapter traces a
poststructuralist perspective on issues of international relations,
notably the state and foreign policy, security and threats. It
encourages to scrutinize them critically and gives an overview of how to
employ this theoretical perspective for empirical discourse analyses in
practice. [When]{.underline} former US President Donald [Trump met
with]{.underline} his Russian counterpart Vladimir [Putin in Helsinki in
2018, he]{.underline} suddenly [found himself confronted with the
**power of discourse**]{.underline}. [As a response to a journalist's
question on whether]{.underline} he believed US intelligence agencies'
accusations that [Russia was meddling in United States' Presidential
elections]{.underline}, [Trump replied]{.underline}: "\[President
**[Putin]{.underline}**\] just **[said it's not Russia]{.underline}**.
\[...\] **[I don't see any reason why it would be]{.underline}**"
(Foreign Policy, 2018). His siding with Putin was met with a fierce
backlash across the political spectrum in the United States, including
in his own party. The [**Western discourse** about Russian
disinformation had produced a clear view on who was the **perpetrator**
-- **Russia** -- and who was the **victim** -- the **United
States**]{.underline}. Irrespective of the actual circumstances of the
US elections, this [**discourse** **made Trump's comment**]{.underline}
virtually **[unsayable]{.underline}** -- [forcing him to]{.underline}
awkwardly [deny his remark]{.underline} only one day later (Baumann,
2020: 303; Landler & Haberman, 2018). [There is an]{.underline}
**[intimate link between foreign policy and how we talk about ourselves
and others]{.underline}**. This is the terrain of poststructuralists in
international relations. This terrain offers profound and critical
insights to anyone seeking to make sense of international relations,
including those in the military who are implicated in them on the
ground. This chapter seeks to map this theoretical terrain by, first,
introducing the basic tenets of the poststructuralist perspective. It
will, secondly, trace poststructuralism's entry into the field of
international relations (IR) by means of discussing "the state" and,
thirdly, the poststructuralist take on "security." A final section will
offer a brief guide to methodology, illustrating how to devise
theory-driven analyses in practice. How can we as researchers make sense
of the world? Poststructuralism has emerged in part as a response to a
more traditional research philosophy that informs other IR theories,
such as Realism or Liberalism, as outlined in the preceding chapters
(see chapters "Realist International Relations Theory and the Military"
by B. Schmidt, this volume; "Liberal International Relations Theory and
the Military" by S. Silverstone, this volume). The poststructuralist
perspective on the world is different from the maybe more intuitive one
adopted by those, often deemed positivist, theories. [Positivist
theories rest on the assumption that researchers have unmediated access
to the "outside world." They presume that they can uncover "reality,"
objectively describe, and formulate true statements about
it.]{.underline} Positivism is [an epistemological
position]{.underline}. Epistemology is a branch of the philosophy of
science which deals with the study of knowledge. It concerns questions
like what is recognized as knowledge and how it can be acquired (see
chapter "Philosophy of Military Sciences" by A.M. Sookermany, this
volume). [Poststructuralists take issue]{.underline} with such a
positivist epistemology. They dispute positivists' claim of unmediated
access, [arguing]{.underline} that the [researcher cannot take an
entirely neutral position]{.underline}. Our
**[observations]{.underline}** of the world [are always **mediated by
our interpretations** of it]{.underline}. [Our **knowledge** of the
world is thus not an objective truth but instead **depends on how we
subjectively perceive it**]{.underline}, how we, in theoretical terms,
[construct it.]{.underline} Take [the]{.underline} basic [realist claim
that states strive for security]{.underline}. This claim, realists
argue, is an apt description of "reality." They do not question the
underlying assumptions informing this claim such as how we come to think
of notions as "the state" or "security" in the first place.
Poststructuralists take a step back, questioning the meaning of such
notions and arguing that our understandings of them are fundamental for
how we see the world and, consequently, how we act in it. [What does it
mean to be secure]{.underline}? [What is the threat to be secure
from]{.underline}? Just as a stone can be understood as a building
block, a war memorial, or a weapon depending on the context, another
country does not constitute a threat in itself. Whether we apprehend
another country as threatening to us depends on our subjective
interpretation of it. This critical stance towards a positivist
epistemology also has implications for poststructuralism's ontology, a
different branch of the philosophy of science. Ontology is the study of
being. It concerns questions of what is deemed to exist, what is taken
into account, and what can be studied (see chapter "Philosophy of
Military Sciences" by A.M. Sookermany, this volume). According to
poststructuralists, what [we should study]{.underline} -- that is what
is ontologically significant -- [is]{.underline} not the world out there
as it is because we can never know that. Instead, we should pay
attention to [our interpretations]{.underline} of it. [It is our
subjective understandings of the world -- the meaning that we attribute
to things]{.underline} like, for example, another country -- [that are
relevant for how we act]{.underline}. Poststructuralists'
anti-foundationalist ontology -- assuming that there is no hard
foundation for our knowledge "out there" -- thus sheds light on meaning
and interpretation, on how they come into being and how they change. But
[how do meaning and interpretation come into being]{.underline}? This is
where poststructuralists' central concept comes in:
**[Discourse]{.underline}**. Poststructuralists attribute to
**[language]{.underline}** a central role [in the production of
meaning]{.underline}. **[The way we talk about things affects how we
understand them]{.underline}**. [Discourses define]{.underline} what we
perceive as "[normal" or "natural]{.underline}," what we take as a given
and how we look at the world. [They determine **what is
sayable**]{.underline} -- **[even imaginable]{.underline}** -- in a
given context. Hence, poststructuralists argue, as researchers we must
study language in order to understand what interpretations guide
peoples' actions. Poststructuralists have developed an intricate idea of
how meaning and interpretations are produced in discourse. The
poststructuralist understanding of language goes back to an earlier
structuralist one formulated in linguistics notably by Ferdinand de
Saussure (1857--1913). According to Saussure, language is a system of
differences. Things do not have a meaning in themselves; the meaning
attributed to them is the result of linking a thing (what structuralists
call a "sign") to some things and differentiating it from others.
Discourses in international politics would link "security," for example,
to "peace" and differentiate it from "danger" and "war." It is through
such grids of signification that we make sense of the world. Jacques
Derrida (1930--2004), an important contributor to poststructuralist
thought, has taken this structuralist understanding of language further
by arguing that the grid of signification is inherently unstable
(Derrida, 1978). The relations of linking and differentiation between
signs are not fixed but always in motion and transforming. This is why
the meaning that we attribute to things can change. In international
politics, for example, [the notion of "security" has profoundly
transformed after the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. Since then, its
scope has been extended significantly to cover also nonconventional
contexts other than war, such as natural disasters or terrorism. In its
1999 Strategic Concept, for example, NATO extended its traditional
notion of security tightly linked to "defense" to also recognize "the
importance of political, economic, social and environmental factors" as
aspects of security (NATO, 1999). Until today, [there are heated
political disputes about what should be seen as a threat]{.underline},
ultimately also changing the meaning of "security." From Derrida's claim
that meaning is inherently unstable does not follow, however, that
meaning also is always transforming. Poststructuralists show how
discourses strive to fix meaning around a given structure. By
articulating something in a certain way, discourses create relationships
of sameness and difference and thereby structure the grid of
signification. The discourse on the Global War on Terror, for example,
has for two decades now linked "the West" to notions of rationality,
benignancy, morality, and civilization while differentiating it from
"the terrorist," which again was connotated with notions of
irrationality, evil, and barbarism (Buzan & Hansen, 2009: 243--246).
Derrida has shown how [Western discourses are organized around **binary
oppositions**]{.underline}. [Such hierarchical]{.underline} oppositions,
or [dichotomies]{.underline}, like [man/woman, culture/nature,
or]{.underline}, with reference to our example, [morality/barbarism are
powerful]{.underline} signposts in the discursive structure. This
structuring may appear to us as natural and just "as it is." Yet,
Derrida has pointed out that [any organization of dichotomic terms is
not a neutral one but inherently political and normative]{.underline}.
Most importantly, he has shown that [there is no necessity]{.underline}
to any such organization. While [discursive structures can become very
stable and enduring]{.underline} -- think about the persistence of
gender roles in Western societies or the Global War on Terror -- **[they
can never be ultimately fixed.]{.underline}** This is a fundamental
claim of all poststructuralists: **[No interpretation of the world, no
meaning that we attach to it is a necessary one.]{.underline}** No
interpretation is God-given or otherwise determined. [It is **just one
of many** **possibilities**]{.underline}. This is what
poststructuralists call contingency, and it is contingency which makes
poststructuralism a profoundly critical project. It encourages us to
look beyond the established order that we take for granted in our
everyday life. The fact that such orders -- like gender roles, for
example -- are often treated as "objective" knowledge illustrates what
poststructuralists refer to as the power/knowledge nexus. Power and
knowledge, poststructuralists argue, are inextricably linked. This
understanding of power as productive goes back to Michel Foucault
(1926--1984). It points to the fact that discourses establish a
seemingly natural order, define what counts as "knowledge," and
construct the meanings and identities through which we make sense of
ourselves and the world (Foucault, 1977, 1990). Let's take a look again
at the previous example of gender, which has been at the center of
poststructuralist feminist studies (see, for example, Shepherd, 2008).
Think of the implications the acceptance of seemingly "objective" gender
roles had in the past and continuing today. This illustrates the
productive power of discourse. To criticize any form of such "objective"
knowledge opens up the possibility to question what seems natural to us.
Another concept that for long has remained unquestioned at the center of
IR theorizing is "the state." The poststructuralist critique of this
concept will form the point of departure for the next section.
Poststructuralism entered the IR literature during the 1980s in the
context of the Second Cold War. Critical interventions by Richard Ashley
(1988), Rob Walker (1993), James Der Derian and Michael Shapiro (1989)
targeted how conventional approaches theorized international politics in
a seemingly neutral and static way. Poststructuralists argue that the
purportedly unchanging eternal truths formulated by those approaches
need to be understood rather as the mirror image of a particular period
in time (the modern period of sovereign states) and place (the West)
(cf. Walker, 1993). This model, however, has become so entrenched that
it presents itself to us as an accurate and neutral description of
"reality"; and as such it has a profound impact on the analysis and
formulation of foreign policy. A major driver behind this new critical
perspective on international relations was a discontent with the role of
the then prevalent conception of the state. Poststructuralists do not
question the centrality of states for today's international politics per
se (Hansen, 2014: 176) in the same way as liberals and others have
argued, for example, for a more global or more individual focus. What
poststructuralists take issue with is the uncritical "taken-for-granted"
attitude of traditional IR theories, such as Realism or Liberalism.
Representatives of those theories, so the poststructuralist contention
goes, present their view on the world as some kind of "timeless wisdom"
(Buzan, 1996) -- without engaging critically with the underlying core
assumptions that inform those views. For realists, for example, the
sovereign state is understood in abstraction from the individual as a
unitary and rational actor who, following Hobbes' state of nature, finds
itself in an environment of anarchy without a centralized ordering
power. This notion of the state is at the center of realist thinking and
therefore plays an unprecedented role for how those scholars explain
international politics. Poststructuralists dig deeper. Inspired by
French poststructuralist philosophers like Derrida and Foucault, they do
not take such assumptions at face value. They scrutinize, instead, how
our understandings of "the sovereign state" affect how we make sense of
international relations in the first place. This was the point of
departure for some of the early influential poststructuralist
interventions into IR, notably the works by Ashley (1987, 1988) and
Walker (1990, 1993, 1997). They illustrate that the common understanding
of the state rests on a dichotomy of sovereignty inside and anarchy, as
its opposite, outside. Sovereignty and anarchy -- the national and the
international -- are thus understood to be mutually constitutive, that
is to say they both exist only as the other's opposite. This reading of
dichotomous structures reveals further binary oppositions, for example,
between a rational inside and an irrational outside, between
order/chaos, security/insecurity, justice/lawlessness, effective
institutions/fragile alliances, and others. Consequently, "however
normal politics is understood, inter-state politics may be presented as
its negation" (Walker, 1990: 15). Ashley and Walker show how
[contemporary discourses perpetuate this dichotomy]{.underline} over and
over again and [thereby produce an understanding of **the state as
natural and objective**]{.underline} -- [which]{.underline} they
maintain **[it is not]{.underline}**. By tracing the evolution of the
concept of sovereignty back to its roots in the seventeenth century,
Walker (1990) shows that **[the sovereign state is only one of several
possible forms for organizing a political community]{.underline}**.
Other forms, such as hierarchical empires built on socioeconomic order
from God, the Emperor, and the church, all the way down to subordinate
individuals, do not seem natural in our contemporary world. Today, its
[**seeming objectivity** makes the **sovereign state in contemporary
discourses the unchallenged and unquestioned form of political
organization**]{.underline}, and [it is **hard for us to think beyond
it**]{.underline}. In this way, **[dominant discourses have a strong
impact on how we think and talk]{.underline}**. Consequently, most of
traditional IR theorizing unfolds within the confines of this modern
discourse on the sovereign state and thereby reproduces it. By
uncovering the origin and working of this discourse (that is, by showing
its contingency, see above), Ashley and Walker deconstruct the
traditional notion of the sovereign state. Fleshing out the dichotomies
upon which it builds and how they are perpetuated in discourse, they
show that the sovereign state is not a neutral description of "the world
as it is," but that it is inherently normative and ideological. Walker
(1990) further demonstrates that the inside/outside dichotomy that
sustains the dominant notion of the sovereign state is also inextricably
linked to a notion of identity -- that is, how we perceive ourselves.
Talking about the sovereign state, he argues, implies a boundary between
a community inside and Others outside. For poststructuralists, identity
is a central concept because it tells us not only how someone -- for
example, a state -- perceives itself. More importantly, it also tells us
what perspective it takes on the world. Understanding a subject's
identity is to understand how they view the world and thus illuminates
why a subject acts in a certain way. To fully appreciate this argument,
we require a broader context. As the inside/outside dichotomy suggests,
the poststructuralist conception of identity is inherently relational. A
"Self" always defines itself in relation to "Others." Such a Self can
be, for example, a state. France is France because it is not India,
Brazil, or Germany. For poststructuralists, a state can be regarded as
an actor in international relations because it speaks as a subject and
articulates in its foreign policy a notion of "we-ness" -- which
poststructuralists term a notion of Self. The fundamental question for
poststructuralists is: Who speaks (Epstein, 2011)? That also means,
however, that poststructuralists need not limit their analyses to states
as relevant actors. While the state remains the dominant form of Self in
international politics, poststructuralists also take into account any
other Self that is discursively articulated -- for example, the European
Union as a union of sovereign states or the Catalans as an ethnic group
with a strong sense of identity. Crucially, a Self is always defined
through its relations to Others. William Connolly (2002) writes that
"identity requires difference to be, and it converts difference into
otherness in order to secure its own self-certainty" (p. 64). Identity
does thus not differ from any other discursive structure that, as
outlined above, is the result of processes of linking and
differentiation. Take the example of NATO. [**NATO's identity** as a
Western military alliance]{.underline} during the Cold [War was
**fundamentally shaped by its opposition to the Soviet
Union**]{.underline} (Klein, 1990). After the Soviet Union ceased to
exist, NATO's identity inevitably changed. Michael Williams and Iver
Neumann (2000) point out how [NATO's self-understanding transformed
during the 1990s]{.underline} from one of military defense
[towards]{.underline} one of [cultural or civilizational unity based on
common values]{.underline}. Suddenly [the **major Other** in the
discourses of NATO's]{.underline} official [documents]{.underline} and
declarations [**shifted from** an]{.underline} external [**Soviet threat
to "instability,"** defined as the absence of those declared **common
values**, notably democracy.]{.underline} The poststructuralist notion
of identity as relational helps to understand how an actor perceives
Others and, hence, what kind of foreign policy they might formulate
towards them. Have you ever heard that a certain foreign policy-move --
such as a troop deployment, a peacekeeping mission, or an intervention
-- was justified by saying that "it is in our interest"?
Poststructuralists argue that to speak of "the national interest," as
many realists frequently do, only makes sense if we understand what
decision-makers consider to be in the interest of the state (Weldes,
1996). "Interests -- 'national' or other -- are never a priori given,"
but always the interests of someone. "It follows that we cannot know
what someone's interests are unless we know who that someone is"
(Ringmar, 2002: 131). Studying identity discourses is to understand the
specific interpretation of the world, that decision-makers might hold.
Based on this worldview, different foreign policies may be considered
detrimental or beneficial. This relationship between identity and
foreign policy, however, is not a one-way road with the former
determining the latter. Since poststructuralists assert that no meaning
or identity is ever already given nor ultimately fixed -- as posited by
rationalist approaches -- identity is also the result of discursive
practices such as foreign policy. Identity and foreign policy are thus
linked in both ways: Their relationship is performative, which means
that they are mutually constitutive. Identity discourses facilitate and
limit the formulation of particular foreign policies. Those discursive
structures determine more or less rigidly what is doable, sayable, or
imaginable. At the same time, foreign policies in turn have an impact on
how we talk about Others and ourselves. [Take]{.underline}, for example,
[the]{.underline} Global [War on Terror]{.underline}: Speaking of Iran,
Iraq, and North Korea in his 2002 State of the Union address, then US
President George W. [Bush stated that "States]{.underline} like these
[and their terrorist allies constitute an **axis of evil**,]{.underline}
[arming to **threaten the peace** of the world]{.underline}"
[whereas]{.underline} **[America will bring "lasting peace," "liberty
and justice"]{.underline}** (Bush, 2002). Referring to terrorism and the
"axis of evil," [Bush]{.underline} [**discursively constructs a
"civilized" Self** in differentiation from this "**threatening"
Other**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} **[representation]{.underline}**
-- a theoretical term for how something is depicted, talked, or written
about in discourse -- of those countries as "axis of evil" [forms the
**discursive background**, against which **the War on
Terror**]{.underline} becomes intelligible and [**can be**
**justified**]{.underline}. At the same time, this discursive background
also came into being and was perpetuated through the foreign policy
practices it facilitated. [This performative construction]{.underline}
of the War on Terror, however, [is an ongoing process and can never be
complete]{.underline}. Emile Simpson (2014) states that the War on
Terror at least partly constitutes "[a continuous effort to shape
worldwide political perceptions according to the West's security
interests]{.underline}." Because discourses can never ultimately be
fixed, however, [the War on Terror "\[lacks\] a clear end
point]{.underline}, as perceptions continuously evolve" (p. 19). The
intimate relationship between identity and foreign policy highlights the
centrality of interpretations and shared understandings for making sense
of international relations. This forms the background for the topic of
the next section "Security and Threat." When talking about security,
notions of threat and danger take center stage. In international
relations, threat and danger are inextricably linked to war and
conflict. As outlined in Carsten Roennfeldt's introductory chapter to
this book section, much of IR's purpose has traditionally been to avoid
war and conflict. But what is threatening? What is dangerous? Given that
those questions have provoked war and conflict, determined the
deployment of troops, or forged alliances, they should not be taken
easily. A poststructuralist approach to those questions is hence
entirely different from a rationalist one (cf. Rønnfeldt, 2021, this
"International Relations and Military Sciences" volume). Rationalists,
including proponents of traditional IR theories like Realism and
Liberalism, understand security largely in materialist terms, focusing,
for example, on military capabilities (Walt, 1991). They further assume
that matters of security can be assessed objectively (Hansen, 2006:
29--30; Buzan & Hansen, 2009: 142--143). Arnold Wolfers (1952), a
prominent realist, for example, claims that an "actual or objective
state of danger" can -- at least retrospectively -- be precisely
evaluated (p. 485). [Poststructuralists]{.underline} adopt a different
perspective on security. They [do not deny the reality of war and
conflict. Nor do they deny the existence of obvious and immediate
threats to our well-being]{.underline}, such as the danger of being run
over by a car or the potentially deadly consequences of being hit by a
bullet. As the discussion of the term "security" above suggests,
however, poststructuralists argue that [what is perceived as a threat is
**not something that can be objectively measured**]{.underline}. Quite
to the contrary: Whether we consider something [danger]{.underline}ous
[is always an interpretation]{.underline}. To call something or someone
[a **threat**]{.underline} to security [should]{.underline} therefore
[**not** be merely accepted as an **objective observation** but
understood]{.underline}, instead, [as a **normative
claim**]{.underline}. Are troops crossing the border an aggressive
attack, a liberation, or maybe part of a peacekeeping operation? [Was
Crimea]{.underline} in 2014 [annexed by or reunited with
Russia]{.underline}? [The dominant discourses]{.underline} on this event
might [diverge]{.underline} substantially [in Kyiv and
Moscow]{.underline}. David Campbell, an early representative of
poststructuralism's entry into IR, writes that "\[[danger\] is not an
objective condition]{.underline}. It (sic) [is not a thing which exists
independently of those to whom it may become a threat]{.underline}"
(1992: 1). What **[security]{.underline}** is, is fundamentally tied to
our perspective on the world and [can]{.underline} therefore **[never be
discussed in separation from who we are]{.underline}**. Walker (1997)
asserts that our understanding of [security is derived from]{.underline}
an idea of "**[who or what it is that needs to be
secured]{.underline}**" (p. 68). Talking about security in the context
of international relations therefore inevitably reasserts a certain
identity. **[Discourses of security]{.underline}**, however, not only
constitute and reaffirm who we are. They also **[define who or what the
threatening Other is]{.underline}** from which we need to be protected.
[They **establish categories of Self and Other, friends and
enemies**]{.underline}. Do you remember from the last section that
identity is relational? Poststructuralists assert that security
discourses are central for constructing such Others to which the Self
relates. A seminal study on the construction of enemies during the Cold
War was presented by Campbell in his book Writing Security (1992).
According to him, threat and danger are a fundamental necessity for the
state to exist. [The state]{.underline}, Campbell argues, [relies on the
**articulation of outside threats** against which it can **define the
inside**]{.underline}. From this perspective, the Cold War was much more
than a military confrontation between two superpowers. On the US side,
it was a process through which discourses on the dangers of communism
and the Soviet threat continuously (re)produced a particular US
identity. Campbell also shows how those discourses of threat and danger
served to discipline dissident elements within the country. Discursively
linking those "internal Others" to an external threat delegitimizes
their cause and justifies their persecution. Campbell goes as far as to
say that ["\[should\] the **state project of security be successful** in
the terms in which it is articulated, the **state would cease to
exist**]{.underline}." (p. 12). His argument thus suggests that the West
would suffer from a major identity crisis after the collapse of its
radical Other, the Soviet Union. At the time, poststructuralism was
grabbling with the question of whether states need enemies (Buzan &
Hansen, 2009: 218), and the changing security discourses produced a more
nuanced understanding of it. [With the **Gulf War**]{.underline} of
1990--1991 and the **[conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo]{.underline}**,
[the theme of]{.underline} **[military interventions]{.underline}** in
other states [became more pronounced]{.underline}. Was Campbell's notion
of the radical threatening Other still apt to make sense of those new
contexts? In her book Simulating Sovereignty (1995), Cynthia Weber
analyzes how [justifications for such interventions have evolved over
time]{.underline}. She finds that [the **discourses legitimizing
interventions** frequently invoke "**the people**," which must be
**protected from their own government**]{.underline}. Similar to NATO's
shifting self-understanding after the Cold War as illustrated above,
Barry Buzan and Lene Hansen (2009) argue that the increasing prevalence
of the humanitarian intervention-discourse in the 1990s also changed the
identity of "the West." Poststructuralist studies now identified as the
central Other not the radical threat anymore that Campbell found during
the Cold War. Instead, the discourses invoked the "humanitarian 'victim'
in need of a 'rescue'," which depoliticized and thereby helped to
legitimize Western interventionist policies (pp. 219--220). All this is
to show that poststructuralists have a deep interest in security. They
are not concerned, however, with security as an objective state like
rationalists such as realists and liberals would have it. They are
interested, instead, in understanding how security discourses bring into
existence an understanding of ourselves and Others, friends and enemies.
When dealing with conflicts, this poststructuralist approach cautions us
to be aware that there is certainly more than one "objective"
interpretation of it. When engaging with complex settings, such as
Afghanistan, one should therefore be wary of a simple division into
friends and enemies. This is because others implicated in the conflict
-- the broader public, nongovernmental actors, neighboring states, or an
international audience -- might have different interpretations of it
and, possibly, identify different threats or draw the friend-enemy line
differently. The same act, for example, a counterinsurgency operation,
can be perceived vastly differently by different audiences, because
different discourses will offer different frameworks for making sense of
the operation. Poststructuralists suggest that an awareness of the
different discourses prevalent within a conflict is crucial for those
analyzing or engaging with it -- at a policy, strategic, or tactical
level. "Securitization" theory offers another insightful perspective on
security. While not a poststructuralist approach in the narrow sense,
securitization theory points our attention to security dynamics that are
equally interesting to poststructuralists, namely the role of language
and representation in and for international politics. Securitization has
sparked a broader discussion in the field of IR. A distinction, for
example, is often made between a "Copenhagen School" and a more
sociologically oriented "Paris School" (cf. Wæver, 2004). The former can
be traced in particular to Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, and Jaap de Wilde's
Security: A New Framework For Analysis (1998). Buzan et al.'s point of
departure is the widening security agenda since the 1970s and 1980s
(Wæver, 2004: 8). This widening was a reaction to the narrow focus on
military matters during the Cold War (Fierke, 2015: 1--2). While
generally sympathetic to that move, Buzan et al. (1998) pose the
question of what it means that nonmilitary issues, for example,
environmental, economic, or social phenomena, were increasingly framed
as problems of security. Irrespective of the sector, they argue, this
framing follows the same underlying logic. This is what Buzan et al.
term "securitization": An issue is presented -- for example, by a
politician -- as an existential threat that requires emergency measures
and this claim is accepted as such by the audience. Such an issue could
be the amassing of foreign troops at the border, environmental
pollution, or migration. Think of the role the alleged -- and later on
never found -- Weapons of Mass Destruction of the Hussein-Regime played
in public discourse prior to the Iraq war in 2003 (cf. Donnelly, 2013).
In the 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush said "By seeking weapons of
mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They
could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match
their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the
United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be
catastrophic." (Bush, 2002). Bush clearly insinuates that doing nothing
would pose an existential threat to the United States and therefore
suggests to act accordingly. Securitization is not unproblematic,
however. Because "'Security' is the move that takes politics beyond the
established rules of the game" (Buzan et al., 1998: 23), securitization
withdraws an issue from the usual political process. The justification
of exceptional measures through security thwarts the careful
deliberation of an issue and may even circumvent established democratic
procedures and institutions. Consequently, in order to soberly weigh and
evaluate delicate issues from various perspectives, Buzan et al. (1998)
argue in favor of desecuritizing them: "the shifting of issues out of
emergency mode and into the normal bargaining process of the political
sphere" (p. 4). Securitization theory, just like poststructuralists,
treats security primarily as a matter of subjective interpretation:
"'Security' is \[...\] a self-referential practice, because it is in
this practice that the issue becomes a security issue---not necessarily
because a real existential threat exists but because the issue is
presented as such a threat" (Buzan et al., 1998: 24). This underlines
the role shared interpretations play for foreign and security policies.
Consequently, the task of the researcher "is not to assess some
objective threats that 'really' endanger some object to be defended or
secured; rather, it is to illuminate the processes of constructing a
shared understanding of what is to be considered and collectively
responded to as a threat." (p. 26). The next section will outline in
greater detail how we as researchers can shed light on such discursive
dynamics in the context of international relations. The preceding
sections introduced the poststructuralist perspective on international
relations. For many, this perspective is not the most intuitive and
accessible one. Once you come to realize, however, the role subjective
interpretations play in international politics, you will recognize how
powerful a poststructuralist inquiry into their constitution and working
can be. But how can you make this theoretical perspective work for your
empirical analysis? This section will outline some methodological
considerations when studying discourse. It will first clarify the
research logic of poststructuralist inquiries before presenting the
method of poststructuralist discourse analysis (For an overview of
different traditions of discourse analysis, see Jørgensen and Phillips
(2002)). Like any inquiry in our field, let us start this methodological
intro with the research question. Unlike more traditional, rationalists
IR theories like Realism or Liberalism, poststructuralists do not ask
research questions that follow a causal why-logic, such as "why does
country A attack country B"? This kind of question requires the
identification of distinct causes that can explain a given outcome. Such
a causal description can only make sense within a positivist framework
that, as you will remember, is built on the assumption of objective
knowledge about the world. Poststructuralists, on the other hand, are
concerned with how the meaning and identities that form the context of
our actions are constituted and how they change. Poststructuralist
inquiries shed light on the particular discursive structures that
facilitate certain practices -- or policies -- make them thinkable and
doable within a given discursive context. In short, they analyze
discourse in order to understand its "implications \[...\] for the way
we think and act in the contemporary world" (George, 1994: 191).
Poststructuralist research questions therefore follow a how
possible-logic. An example could be: "How does country B come to be
represented as a threat in country A's foreign policy discourse?" An
answer to this question can help to understand how a conflict between
country A and B becomes possible in the first place. Importantly,
poststructuralists always keep in mind that there is no necessity to any
given discourse and that it is only one of many possibilities. As you
will remember, this is called the "contingency" of discourse. Even if in
our view the representation of country B as threatening seems "natural"
or "objective," poststructuralists will maintain that this is just one
of many possible interpretations and that no discourse is constituted
irrevocably. This is where deconstruction comes in: The seeming
objectivity of a discourse is unmasked by showing how this particular
discourse works, for example, what dichotomies sustain the
representation of country B as threatening. Whether country B has come
to be understood as a friend or a foe will facilitate vastly different
policy options. To analyze a given discourse thus also means to
"\[consider\] the manifest political consequences of adopting one mode
of representation over another" (Campbell, 1992: 4). To sum up,
discourse analysists seek to capture how meaning is discursively
produced and how it changes, as well as the implications of one
particular discourse over other possible ones. Against this background:
How to carry out a discourse analysis in practice? Because
poststructuralists are interested in profoundly understanding a given
context, their analyses are based first and foremost on qualitative
data. This could be any text, such as a speech, an interview, or a
newspaper article. A close investigation thereof is aimed at
understanding the underlying discursive structure, "how signs are linked
and juxtaposed, how they construct Selves and Others, and how they
legitimize particular policies" (Hansen, 2006: 41). While every
articulation forms part of discourse and therefore lends itself for
analysis, understanding discourse as producing shared understandings
suggests taking into account a broader set of texts (Milliken, 1999:
233). But how many? And when to stop? To this, Jennifer Milliken (1999)
responds that an "analysis can be said to be complete (validated) when
upon adding new texts \[...\], the researcher finds consistently that
the \[discursive structures\] she has generated work for those texts"
(p. 234). There is no ready-made template for how to carry out a
poststructuralist discourse analysis. As a "problem-driven" approach
(Howarth, 2005), every discourse analysis ought to be tailored to the
research interest in question. Lene Hansen's book Security as Practice
(2006) constitutes a comprehensive guide to discourse analytical
research designs. She highlights four parameters in particular that
should be taken into account when devising an empirical analysis (pp.
65--82). In order to illustrate how to approach discourse analytical
inquiries, the following paragraph will provide a simplified overview of
Hansen's four parameters. A promising research design will take each of
them into account. As with every methodology, this requires you to take
many informed decisions and to justify your choices. An empirical
inquiry must, first, specify whose discourses it focusses on. Are you
looking at the foreign policy discourse of one or more Selves? Who is
speaking (cf. Epstein, 2011)? Are you focusing on one or more states or
other foreign policy subjects? A second parameter to be determined is
what event the respective discourse is about. This could be any issue in
international politics: A conflict such as the ongoing crisis in Ukraine
or a topic like climate change. An example: Analyzing Russia's foreign
policy discourse on the events in Ukraine, how it represents the Russian
Self, the Ukrainian, and the Western Others can be helpful for
understanding how this discourse facilitated certain Russian foreign
policies towards Ukraine and how it precluded others. A concise
analysis, thirdly, requires a clarification of where to look for a
specific discourse. What is the discursive arena of interest? Are you
taking into account only the Russian government's official rhetoric, or
are you broadening the scope of your study by also including the wider
foreign policy debate as articulated by other political figures or in
the media? To study media discourses can be helpful in order to gauge
the room of maneuver politicians find themselves in. After all, this
constitutes the discursive context in which policy-makers formulate,
explain, and justify foreign policies. For an even broader inquiry, it
might also be insightful to consider discourse as articulated in
cultural sources (see, for example, Der Derian, 1992, and Shapiro, 1988,
1990). A final parameter Hansen (2006) points out is the temporal
dimension of an inquiry, the when. What time frame are you taking into
account? Are you looking at one particular moment, or are you comparing
different periods? To pick up the example above, you could focus your
analysis of Russian foreign policy discourse on key moments in the
Ukraine crisis, such as the Maidan protests or the annexation of Crimea.
Alternatively, you could also choose a more long-term perspective to
illuminate how representations, for example, of Ukraine or "the West,"
have evolved over time in the Russian discourse. To trace the
development of a specific representation or concept is to study its
"genealogy." Foucault has coined this notion as "history of the
present." A genealogical inquiry seeks "to show 'descent' and
'emergence' and how the contingencies of these processes continue to
shape the present" (Garland, 2014: 371; cf. Foucault, 1984: 76--100).
The aim is thus to show that what now may be taken for granted has not
always been understood in this way but is, in fact, the outcome of a
series of forgotten struggles in the past that might as well have turned
out differently. Some groups of people might have had a greater impact
in this process because others were marginalized or not allowed to
speak. A famous example of a genealogical inquiry is provided by Edward
Said's book Orientalism (1978). Said traces how the representations of
"the Orient" have evolved in Western European intellectual discourses
since the eighteenth century. He shows how those representations, that
continue to impact the Western perception of the East, were discursively
constructed in contrast to a superior "occidental" Self, thereby
simultaneously reflecting and perpetuating European racism and
imperialism. As such, a genealogical inquiry not only illuminates what
changes and/or continuities a certain concept underwent and how our
present thinking came about. Importantly, by exposing how the productive
power of discourses established seemingly objective meanings and
identities, it is a reminder that much of the understandings that guide
our thinking and acting today are a contingent outcome of the past, and
it therefore encourages us to question them. This chapter aimed to show
that [discourse]{.underline} -- the way we talk about the world, about
ourselves and others -- matters. It [brings into being our understanding
of the world and as such cannot be separated from our thinking and
acting]{.underline}. [Discourses construct what is]{.underline}
considered "[natural" or "objective]{.underline}." The poststructuralist
project does not accept those established orders as "natural" and points
to the contingency of discourse, that is, of any meanings and
identities. This poststructuralist approach has also encountered
criticism. [Two]{.underline} often [articulated critiques merit
a]{.underline} quick critical [review]{.underline}. The
[first]{.underline} one concerns [poststructuralism's
epistemology]{.underline} -- as you remember, this philosophical term
[concerns]{.underline} the question of [what counts as
knowledge]{.underline}. [Representatives]{.underline} of traditional
approaches have [accused poststructuralists]{.underline} and other
so-called reflectivists (cf. Rønnfeldt, 2021, this volume) [of lacking
"a coherent research program]{.underline}" (Keohane, 1988: 379) that
would meet scientific standards. This judgement is shortsighted,
however, because [poststructuralists take issue with those standards in
the first place]{.underline}. Robert [Keohane and others]{.underline}
thus [fail to acknowledge the divergent epistemological positions
poststructuralists take on what counts as knowledge.]{.underline} A
[second]{.underline} line of criticism (cf. Brown, 1994) [takes issue
with poststructuralists' anti-foundationalist ontology]{.underline}. As
you will remember, poststructuralists claim that there is no hard
foundation for our knowledge "out there" and that the meaning we attach
to things is a discursive construction instead. [Critics]{.underline}
have [dismissed such a worldview as "relativist" or "nihilistic" and
claimed]{.underline} that [it rids one of the ability to distinguish
right from wrong. This]{.underline} accusation, however, [mistakes
poststructuralists' rejection of transcendental foundations as a
wholesale rejection of the fact that things do exist]{.underline}. For
example, [poststructuralists do not question or reject the existence of
"the state" as a contemporary form of political organization.
They]{.underline} simply [point out that "the state" is a **contingent
result of historical processes** that could]{.underline} as well [have
taken **different turns**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} therefore
[should be regarded as **one possibility**]{.underline} of many
[**instead of a** **neutral description**]{.underline} of simply "how it
is." [Poststructuralists' mission]{.underline}, so to say, [is not to
eliminate a certain way of thinking, but to highlight that]{.underline}
**[this particular way of thinking is not God-given or
neutral.]{.underline}** Poststructuralism has much to offer for anyone
interested in and working with international affairs, military
professionals included. Its analytical approach reminds us that there is
no objective, no God-given, foundation to our understandings of the
state, threats, foreign policy, and other aspects of international
relations. Instead, the meaning individuals attach to the world and
their respective behavior are shaped by and at the same time shape the
discourses that they are implicated in. From the point of view of the
military, [special attention ought to be paid to **discourses of
security**]{.underline}. It is [through discourses of
security]{.underline} that the use of [**armed force is**]{.underline}
typically **[justified]{.underline}**. [Whether or not
something]{.underline}, for instance another state, a militant
organization, or migration, [is perceived as a threat has far-reaching
consequences for a country's foreign policy decisions.]{.underline} Like
any foreign policy discourse, **[talking about security is intimately
linked to how we see the world and what policies we deem
appropriate]{.underline}**. [It is]{.underline} therefore [important to
keep in mind that "**threats" are**]{.underline} no objective
conditions, but **[normative, political representations]{.underline}**.
Instead of taking them at face value, poststructuralists argue, we as
researches should ask how those discourses work to structure,
facilitate, and, at the same time, limit our thinking and acting within
the established order. [There is no escape from discourse, but being
aware of how they work is a precondition for being critical about them
and questioning seemingly objective "truths."]{.underline}

[Tightly connected to the]{.underline} new **[global regimes of
information production, ownership, and control]{.underline}** [is that
there is **no functional world order**]{.underline}. Any notion of the
possibility of a [rapprochement between]{.underline} [the global power
blocs looks]{.underline} more [remote]{.underline} than ever. [The
international influence of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has diminished]{.underline}, [China's economic power has continued to
grow]{.underline} and it has asserted that the South and East China Seas
are within its 'sphere of influence'---a claim supported by its
construction of military bases on several islands in the region,
combined with the continual expansion of its navy. [**Russia** has
exposed itself as **a disruptive force** of national
security]{.underline} in, and beyond, Eastern Europe. Meanwhile [the
**Middle East** remains a centre of instability]{.underline}, and [the
power of **the E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [has
**weakened**]{.underline}. More broadly, [recoil from globalisation is
underway, evident in a widening **schism between the Global North and
South**]{.underline} as cultural and political communities of the South
increasingly embrace the post-postcolonial project of decoloniality.
Layered onto this situation is, and has been, the rise of
**[insurgencies]{.underline}**, **[asymmetrical conflict]{.underline}**,
**[proxy wars]{.underline}**, plus a gradual [increase of **nuclear**
arms **proliferation**]{.underline}, with as mentioned signs of a new
nuclear arms race beginning. Added to the outlined dangers has been the
[transformation in the nature of war]{.underline}. First of all [it
is]{.underline} [no longer confined to discernable military
confrontation and is]{.underline} now [arriving in **hybrid
forms**]{.underline} [including]{.underline} **[cyber
aggression]{.underline}**, the **[militarisation of
space]{.underline}**, the use of **[social media as]{.underline}** an
agent of **[political disruption]{.underline}**, the many internal wars
the United States has waged on its own people ([the wars on drugs,
poverty, crime, and terror]{.underline}), [and]{.underline} now the
uneven **[militarisation]{.underline}** of the COVID19 pandemic. De
facto, [a condition of]{.underline} low-level [global
conflict]{.underline} now [pertains]{.underline} in which [there are
multiple overt 'hot-spots']{.underline} where conflict threatens.
Effectively, **[the war/peace binary no longer holds]{.underline}**. As
Fry writes in his forthcoming book, '[war has become a plural, complex
and unstable category]{.underline}, while [peace]{.underline} now [lacks
coherence]{.underline}, definition and strategic practices adequate to
the demands of the multiple and extremely complex contexts in which it
is employed. As for the relation of war and peace it is now by no means
a natural union in binary opposition. [The relation is]{.underline}
actually more appropriately seen as **[aporetic]{.underline}**' (Fry,
2020a: viii--ix). Second, the dangers of '**[dwelling in the age of
the]{.underline}** (post-)**[Anthropocene]{.underline}**' [are projected
to **become**]{.underline} more **[severe]{.underline}**. For instance,
there is already substantial evidence showing that **[climate
change]{.underline}** [will cause]{.underline} the [breakdown
of]{.underline} many **[agricultural systems]{.underline}** (thus
[making **food security**]{.underline} [a]{.underline} far more
[critical concern]{.underline}) with some regions becoming unlivable
(which is already the case in parts of central China), [and
**displace**]{.underline} tens, or even [**hundreds of
millions**]{.underline} of people (especially from the river delta
regions of the planet). Increasing **[competition]{.underline}** between
nations [over]{.underline} **[natural resources]{.underline}** also
poses major dangers. In sum, this means that [**climate change will**
**dramatically increase the likelihood of**]{.underline} large- and
smallscale regional **[conflicts]{.underline}**. It also posed a major
challenge to the yet to be renamed 'humanities' as a changed climate
transforms ways of life, cultural practices, diet, moods, and much more.

Hence, framing the birth of neoliberalism was a reaction to what many of
the colloquium participants saw as a failure of completion for
19th-century liberalism; for them it was the result of insufficient free
trade. Additionally, neoliberalism was a response to militarism, and
specifically the impending violence that would later come to be known as
World War II, and which would be seen as the product of authoritarian
governments whose nationalist populism was based in militaristic
display, rhetoric, and intent. The colloquium was also in part a
response to the massification of society, central planning,
protectionism, and state intervention into previously unregulated
aspects of life. Naturally its members stood opposed to
authoritarianism, with more than one of the colloquium participants
suggesting that liberalism ought to be altogether discarded as a
terminology in favour of 'individualism.' Other terms besides
neoliberalism that were in contention among colloquium participants as
the name for this new character include 'neo-capitalism,' 'constructor
liberalism,' 'ordoliberalism,' 'left liberalism,' and 'positive
liberalism' (Reinhoudt & Audier, 2018, p. 6). [The great hypocrisy
in]{.underline} the underpinning assumptions of
[neoliberalism]{.underline}, at least as they were realised during the
course of the colloquium, [is the idea that liberalism had been
responsible for '**a century of peace**.' Any idea of a 'peaceful' 19th
century must]{.underline} of course [ignore the]{.underline} **[massive
violence]{.underline}** associated [with]{.underline}
[19th-century]{.underline} **[colonialism]{.underline}** [and the
**greatest organised slaughter of people in history**]{.underline}, at
least up to the First World War, that took place [during the American
Civil War]{.underline}. [Rougier]{.underline} implicitly
[notes]{.underline} the productive aspects of [colonial violence when he
says]{.underline} that [the '**merit of liberalism is to increase** the
dynamism of **production**. Yet]{.underline}, nowadays, this
[vibrancy]{.underline} [seems **slowed**]{.underline} down **[by the
halt of colonial expansion']{.underline}** (in Reinhoudt & Audier, 2018,
p. 139). Even more explicitly, he says that On the one hand, the
doctrine of liberalism has been the economic policy \[la politique
économique\] of the nineteenth century; on the other hand, [the
application of this policy has transformed the]{.underline} face of the
[world]{.underline}. It has been accompanied: 1. [By the **settling of
the white race outside of Europe**]{.underline}; 2. By the **[growth of
the white population]{.underline}**. Today, the expansion of the white
race is almost finished. A nation has to wrest its colonies from another
one. (p. 139) Not to put too fine a point on it, [**neoliberalism** was
**brought into the world as**]{.underline} an idea informed in no small
part by intense **[Eurocentricity, outright racism, eugenics, and a
blindness to]{.underline}** any kind of **[damage]{.underline}**,
whether human or otherwise, inflicted upon countries outside Europe,
including the United States, [whether through]{.underline} **[civil
strife or rampant colonialism.]{.underline}**

#### Intellectual monopoly capitalism is the new wedge splitting our world

**Rikap 21**

Science and Technology, 4-7-2021, \"Intellectual monopoly capitalism and
its effects on development,\" MR Online,
<https://mronline.org/2021/05/04/intellectual-monopoly-capitalism-and-its-effects-on-development/>,
DOA July 21st, 2022)

[What is new with contemporary (global) leading
corporations]{.underline}? [If gigantic monopolies are a repeated
phenomenon in capitalism's history, **why all the fuss we see every day
regarding high concentration?**]{.underline} [Leading corporations of
the 21st **century are intellectual monopolies**]{.underline}. [These
are firms that rely on a permanent and **expanding monopoly over
portions of society's knowledge**.]{.underline} A recent joint OECD and
European Union report shows that the [top 2000 corporations in business
expenditure in research and development (BERD) concentrated 60% of total
IP5
[1](https://mronline.org/2021/05/04/intellectual-monopoly-capitalism-and-its-effects-on-development/#edn_1)
patents between 2014 and 2016 (Dernis et al., 2019).]{.underline} How
did this happen if [intellectual rents enjoyed by the innovator were
supposed to disappear once the rest of the industry adopts the new
technique?]{.underline} [They disappeared if the secret was broken, the
patent expired, or when another firm innovated, overcoming the
innovating firm's advantage**. Knowledge is cumulative and those
innovating have a greater absorptive capacity to keep
innovating**]{.underline}. [Aided by a more stringent and global
intellectual property regime, the continuous reinforcement of knowledge
monopolies has led to a perpetuation of the core, maximizing rentiership
over time]{.underline}. Intellectual monopolies may not monopolize the
markets they operate, which can even be competitive markets like
Amazon's marketplace, where Amazon sells its products with millions of
other sellers[**. Their monopolistic condition relies on their capacity
to significantly and systematically monopolize knowledge**, which
generally--but not always--contributes to market
concentration.]{.underline} [What we are witnessing **is the climax of a
process that began almost half a century ago with the formation of
global value chains (GVC) led by multinational corporations that
retained the exclusive knowledge on how to integrate the supply chain.
It**]{.underline} was also in the 1970s that the [big pharma blockbuster
drug model emerged signalling a turning point in terms of intellectual
property and rents]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the initial policy
transformations that paved the way for intellectual monopoly capitalism
also date from the 1980s and continued during the 1990s (from the
Bayh-Dole Act to the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights followed by free trade agreements, bilateral investment treaties,
and regional pacts that installed a global intellectual property
regime).]{.underline} Yet, it was not until this century[, in particular
after the advancements in deep learning and neural networks that
unleashed big data based innovations that the consequences of
**intellectual monopoly capitalism became apparent**]{.underline}. To
acknowledge them, I suggest thinking of innovation, as any process based
on human labour, not only from its implications but also as a social
relation of production[**. In other words, innovating always has a
twofold meaning.** One looks forward and starts when the innovation is
achieved, thus studying the effects of innovation as an accomplished
result. The subordination of complementors in digital platforms (such as
third-party sellers in e-commerce) as well as of outsourced firms in GVC
exemplify how innovations (or more broadly intangibles), once
monopolized, are used to subordinate other organizations]{.underline}.
The other approach looks backward and delves into the social relations
of production that take place in order to innovate. **[This is
innovation as a process. In contemporary capitalism, this process
increasingly takes place as networks, organized and planned by
intellectual monopolies.]{.underline}** Intellectual monopolies are not
only--nor mainly--a result of giant corporations' in-house R&D[**. Their
knowledge monopoly is based on appropriating and monetizing knowledge
results from their multiple innovation networks organized as modularized
knowledge steps in charge of different organizations** (from start-ups
to public research organizations and universities).]{.underline}
[Intellectual monopolies also outsource innovation steps by actively
engaging in open access or open science initiatives (including
open-source software in the case of tech giants), monetizing knowledge
commons.]{.underline} In this context, what is the fate of the rest of
the firms--which are **[the overwhelming majority of the industrial
landscape--and how do they manage to remain profitable while
subordinating to intellectual monopolies? How are science and technology
transformed in this context? What are the implications for research
universities and other public research organizations?]{.underline}**
**[What is the place of the peripheries as profits concentrate in a
handful of corporations from core countries? What is the role played by
those core countries' states in the emergence and spread of intellectual
monopoly?]{.underline}** To answer these questions[, I elaborate on the
concept of **predation,** initially defined by Veblen
(1899]{.underline}) as a direct relation of
**[spoliation]{.underline}**. **[Predation contributes to explaining the
higher concentration of intangible assets by intellectual
monopolies.]{.underline}** [Intellectual monopolies predate knowledge
from other organizations. Innovation in capitalism has thus grown as a
power relationship]{.underline}. ["Inventors" (those actually working on
intellectual monopolies' innovations) **will at most receive a minor
payment** in comparison with the rents amassed by the intellectual
monopoly that surveilled the whole process. As a result of this division
of intellectual labour, the **industrial landscape is split between
corporations that control production, distribution, and consumption by
controlling innovation processes and a myriad of organizations whose
best alternative is to subordinate.**]{.underline} Meeting the world's
predators In our epoch, intangibles assets' rise cannot be understood
without considering the-highly asymmetric-digital economy. Its five
leading corporations represent over 25% of the S&P 500. The combined
market capitalization of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft
(GAFAM) is even above Japan's 2019 GDP. As well as their counterparts
from China, GAFAM concentrate profits and (tangible and intangible)
capital based on monetizing knowledge and data. **[Their continuous
innovations rely on their exclusive access to big data sources, thus
predating society by curtailing access to an input that was socially
constructed.]{.underline}** Furthermore, [they analyse data with
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that, more often than not, were
developed by other organizations. They use that data to orient their
business and innovate based on customized models that are **capable of
predicting and shaping each individual's behaviours with the greatest
existing accuracy.**]{.underline} Although at the forefront of this new
stage, intellectual monopoly capitalism goes beyond digital industries.
Big pharmaceuticals are another paradigmatic example. Furthermore,
[companies from the most diverse industries are becoming intellectual
monopolies. **From State Grid Corporation of China** (SGCC), China's
state-owned utility company, **to BlackRock's financial data
monopoly**]{.underline}. Depending on the diversity of knowledge
management techniques and on the multiplicity of monopolized
technologies, intellectual monopolies differ in scope. Some are focused
on narrow niches--such as Siemens' dominance of AI for life and medical
sciences inventions or SGCC's lead in AI-related inventions for energy
management (World Intellectual Property Organization, 2019[). Meanwhile,
GAFAM and its Chinese counterparts expand their power, dominating
general-purpose technologies. All in all, **intellectual monopoly
capitalism can be conceived as the stage in capitalism where capital
accumulation** (and distribution**) is led by a core of intellectual
monopolies that base their accumulation** (and power) **on their
permanent and expanding monopoly (**and assetization) **of predated
knowledge**]{.underline}. By synthesizing the common traits of these
cases, I argue that intellectual monopoly capitalism capital
accumulation is increasingly driven (and hampered) by rent-seeking and
predation[**. Intellectual monopolies sabotage society by privately
monetizing intangible goods; they are--simultaneously- capitalists,
rentiers, and predators.** The more their rents grow, **the more the
rest of the world will be deprived of access to knowledge** and of a
greater portion of the total value produced]{.underline}. [Intellectual
monopolies are also the corporations leading the rankings of offshored
retained earnings and declare profits in tax havens, further favouring
their shareholders by minimizing paid taxes.]{.underline} This points to
the entangled connection between an accumulation strategy based on
rentiership and predation that results in levels of earnings and
financial strength that allow to further expand rents, this time by
participating in financial markets. [Intellectual Monopolies maximize
their appropriation of wealth ultimately at the expense of workers of
all the subordinate firms but also including their own workers. Workers'
differentiation under intellectual monopoly capitalism **results in a
majority with earnings below what they need to reproduce themselves and
their families**]{.underline}. To tilt the scale, unions must regain the
power they lost in Western countries and gain the power they never had
in Asia. **[A global organization of labour is required]{.underline}**.
However, this is much easier said than done. The effects of intellectual
monopoly capitalism on the peripheries [The persistently **uneven
distribution** of innovation in the world **is a structural truth
worsened by intellectual monopoly capitalism**]{.underline}.
[Intellectual monopolies originate in core countries, in particular in
the United States, **but their effects are spread all over the
world**]{.underline}.

Yet, [to treat **democratic values or human rights**]{.underline}, for
instance, [**as attributes** that **specific societies possess** or
acquire is to **conceal the intersubjective construction of these
concepts** and to **ignore their** productive, even **hegemonic
power**]{.underline}. This is the reason why Iver Neumann and Michael
Williams have proposed that [constructivist analyses of NATO\'s
enlargement should consider the alliance\'s self-description as a
'**democratic security community'**]{.underline} not as an unproblematic
fact but [as]{.underline} a way of [exercising **symbolic
power**]{.underline}. [Claiming a democratic identity]{.underline} can
then be interpreted as a political practice that [assigns **legitimacy
to NATO\'s actions** and]{.underline} at the same ti[me structures the
realm of possibilities for acceptable Russian
self-conceptions]{.underline}. Hence, [the '**capacity to claim such
identities**, and to **grant and deny them to others**, is a source of
**social power**]{.underline}**'** (Williams and Neumann 2000: 364).

[An approach that treats]{.underline} references to common [Western
values as evidence for an alleged reality]{.underline} --- the existence
of [a transatlantic security community]{.underline} --- [risks
committing an **essentialist fallacy**]{.underline} [by taking
the]{.underline} invocation of these [depictions at face
value]{.underline}. One problematic consequence of such an account is
that [it becomes methodologically impossible to distinguish between a
political assertion of 'shared values' and its performative
effects]{.underline}. Assuming an already existing transatlantic
security community with certain 'shared values' and [a '**collective
identity'** tends to **reify prevalent notions of political
discourse**]{.underline} instead of interpreting them as an element in
processes of social construction. In our view, [claims to a **democratic
identity of NATO** or public commitments to **human rights**
constitute]{.underline} a valuable body of empirical material that
social scientists ought to be interested in. However, instead of
treating them as evidence for an alleged 'Western' identity, we suggest
treating them as [a **distinct and powerful move in a political
struggle**]{.underline} (Jackson 2006b). Invocation of **'[Western
values']{.underline}** [or **a 'democratic identity'** can]{.underline}
[then be interpreted with regard to their **performative effects** and
**institutional consequences**.]{.underline}

Thus, instead of presupposing the existence of an Atlantic security
community, we are interested in reconstructing processes of community
formation, that is, processes that lead to the evolution, reproduction
and transformation of an inter-state political space commonly described
as 'the West' (e.g., Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005). Just like
Deutsch and his colleagues, we assume that [**political orders** are
integrated via the **construction and reproduction** of a **sense of
community** in **complex and non-linear dynamic
processes**]{.underline}. However, in contrast to the initial work on
security communities, which focused on measuring the quantity and
density of transactions, we propose that [the emergence and the
reproduction of a sense of community should be studied by focusing on
the productive power of representations in contingent processes of
signification]{.underline}. As these [processes of community formation
are open ended and non-linear, they can be **reconstructed from within**
by interpreting how **contentious references to 'the West' operate in
political discourse**.]{.underline}

In a nutshell, [the **re-constitution of a transatlantic community** is
based on an **idealisation of**]{.underline} distinct [**value**
**commitments** and the consequent **normative demarcation from
authoritarian states such as China and Russia**.]{.underline} What is
often described in static terms as the '**[cohesion' of transatlantic
relations]{.underline}** [proves to be a process of
**self-affirmation**]{.underline} [that relies on the **construction of
fundamental differences**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the **[moral
de-legitimation of the 'non-West'.]{.underline}** This finding confirms
postcolonial and poststructuralist analyses of how Eurocentric patterns
of thought shape the relations between 'the West' and its Other(s). In
this sense, the attitudes and patterns of interpretation at work in
processes of 'Western' community formation are just one further episode
to deal in a self-righteous way with differences in world politics. In
the relations towards [China and Russia]{.underline}, however, an
important aspect is added to the equation. Both [are regarded as
powerful countries]{.underline}, a fact [that apparently makes it more
delicate when they fail to adopt liberal democracy]{.underline} [as the
**superior model** of political rule]{.underline}. The
[refusal]{.underline} by the Chinese and Russian governments [to
acknowledge such **universalist claims** makes them appear]{.underline}
as [incalculable or]{.underline} even [hostile]{.underline} opponents.

**[China]{.underline} [apparently]{.underline}** [is about to **surpass
liberal countries** in economic development without the anticipated
democratic reforms taking place.]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**
in turn [is attributed with the potential to **provoke Eastern European
countries** militarily or blackmail them economically]{.underline}. When
the prospects for a transformation of these countries seem to diminish,
the self-confidence of North American and European elites easily turned
into the fear that precious normative achievements may be in danger and
must be defended against possible assaults. Thus, when it comes to China
and Russia, [the]{.underline} already present [sense of
superiority]{.underline} [combines with diffuse fears of a shrinking
material power]{.underline} basis [for **projecting allegedly universal
norms and institutions**]{.underline}. As a result, [a morally superior
but materially declining 'West' is called upon to safeguard the liberal
international order before it falls prey to 'rising' authoritarian great
powers.]{.underline} T[his is the case-specific pull
towards]{.underline} the **[securitisation]{.underline}** pole. The
normative demarcation vis-à-vis unpredictable and morally questionable
authoritarian great powers engender a latent confrontational posture
against these states. As long as they have not transformed into liberal
democracies, their moves tend to be observed with fearful scepticism.

In sum, [a strong sense of superiority]{.underline}, which is
[semantically linked to the notion of 'the West', provides the basis for
**diffuse threat scenarios in transatlantic discourse on 'authoritarian
great powers'**]{.underline}. The idea **[that]{.underline}**
**[non-Western others might propose acceptable alternatives to existing
rules and institutions is hard to reconcile with the self-conception of
European and North American elites]{.underline}** as representing the
vanguard of the political and moral development of humankind. This
self-conception predisposes these elites to interpret those [Chinese and
Russian positions]{.underline}, which [run counter to]{.underline} such
pretensions either as 'challenges' for the stability of [the 'liberal
international order' or even as potential long-term security threats to
'the West' as a community of values.]{.underline}

#### NATO security cooperation is the lynchpin of western securitization -- justifications for NATO action are securitizations that produce anti-communist operations and imperial exploitation

While the first research area dealt with representations of
'authoritarian regimes' that are by definition categorised as being
outside of the boundaries of 'the West', this research area focuses on
the transformation of **[NATO]{.underline}**, that [is]{.underline}, the
military alliance that is considered to be [the **institutional core
of**]{.underline} what we usually call '[**the West**']{.underline}
(e.g., Gress 2004; Brzezinski 2009). Obviously, **[transatlantic
security cooperation]{.underline}** [has been a classical theme in
IR]{.underline}, either from a realist vantage point, [where NATO
is]{.underline} primarily described as [a defence alliance subordinated
to national purposes]{.underline} (Waltz 2000: 18), [or]{.underline}
from a liberal perspective, where NATO is understood as [an alliance of
democracies]{.underline} (Risse-Kappen 1995: 4). In both perspectives,
however, [the dynamics of **security cooperation** between North America
and Europe **seem** **unproblematic** as long as the allies are
convinced of their **common interest** or their shared
values.]{.underline}

[NATO\'s]{.underline} (lasting) [ability to voice
in-/securities]{.underline} --- for example [a 'Soviet
threat']{.underline}, '[terrorism']{.underline}, [or 'new
challenges']{.underline} --- [directs our attention to highly
**institutionalised dynamics of securitisation**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline}, as the subsequent analysis will show, [manifest
themselves as a **self-authorisation of 'the West'**]{.underline} in
order [to]{.underline} [defend its normative foundation]{.underline}.
Such a tendency towards self-authorisation has become visible in
different forms since the North Atlantic alliance was founded in 1949.
[During the Cold War, it]{.underline} primarily [enabled a]{.underline}
rather [deep **institutionalisation of military cooperation** with an
integrated command structure including US **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}, as well as common [strategic planning and
defence exercises]{.underline}. [After the Cold War, **this project was
continued**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} it has
[certainly]{.underline} changed in [form]{.underline}. [**Out-of-area
operations** and]{.underline} the development of **[a globally active
alliance]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} one of [the most visible
expressions of such self-authorising practices]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} dynamics were [central to **re-constitute
NATO**]{.underline} during critical junctures [and have been
**productive of a highly self-confident Western alliance
today**]{.underline} (Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005; Behnke 2013).

[The North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}, signed in April 1949 by
representatives of nine Western European states, Iceland, Canada, and
the US, provided the Western alliance with a legal basis and outlined
the key principles of cooperation, that is, consultation (Article 4) and
collective defence (Article 5). Although the formulation of Article 5
was highly contested between the US and its European allies, it was
perceived as the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation
(Kaplan 2004: 4). In contrast to such a legal framing of Western
security cooperation, the preamble of the Treaty [invoked an
**inherently normative rhetoric**]{.underline} [when it stated that the
parties '**are determined to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and
civilization of their people, founded on the principle of democracy,
individual liberty and the rule of law'**]{.underline} (The North
Atlantic Treaty 1949). [The construction of unity based on a **common
culture** and]{.underline} even '**[civilisation']{.underline}** (rather
than merely a shared threat perception) [transferred military
cooperation]{.underline} and integration far beyond an interest-driven
alliance (e.g., Klein 1990; Jackson 2003, 2006a). During these formative
years of NATO, [one central aim]{.underline} of formulating 'strategic
concepts' [was to construct a common security interes]{.underline}t of
the US and Western European states [that was]{.underline} metaphorically
[framed in terms of an '**indivisibility of allied
security'**]{.underline}.Footnote6

Bearing these normative foundations in mind, [NATO]{.underline}
gradually [evolved as a cultural project]{.underline} that was
**[directed against communism]{.underline}** --- [which made the
**inclusion of an autocratic state** such as Portugal
possible]{.underline} --- [rather than as a community of democratic
states]{.underline} (Klein 1990; Jackson 2003; Sjursen 2004). [The
invoked]{.underline} **[narrative of shared norms]{.underline}**,
values, and a common heritage [**provided** a]{.underline} sufficiently
strong [**rationale for** **defending** the North Atlantic Area
**against any**]{.underline} potential **[threat]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [it]{.underline} also [legitimised taking **whatever
measures** were deemed '**necessary'** to defend its
members]{.underline}. '**[Forward defence']{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} '**[massive retaliation]{.underline}**' [turned out to
be]{.underline} such [legitimate means]{.underline}. Nevertheless, in
many ways the strength of Western rhetoric was also intended to polish
over and counterbalance many of the underlying political conflicts that
persisted throughout NATO\'s post-war history. As a matter of fact, over
the years it had become a standard formula in political discourse to
refer to [an **alliance in 'crisis'** as proof of its uniquely
transatlantic vitality]{.underline}. In this sense the [**invocation of
a normative foundation** of shared 'Western' values, heritage and
civilisation]{.underline} [**even against the background of internal
political dissent** was]{.underline} as much [a **securitising
move**]{.underline} as it was an expression of a particular 'Western'
structure of conflict. One could conclude that **[transatlantic security
cooperation was]{.underline}** **[only manageable]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** **[invoking]{.underline}** **[such a]{.underline}**
**[normative foundation of shared values, heritage, and
civilisation.]{.underline}**

The subsequent strategic concepts DC 6/1 (December 1952), MC 14/2 (May
1957) and the amended strategic guidelines were written with the
intention to both 'convince the USSR that war does not pay' (NATO 1950)
and to reassure the allies that continued and even intensified that
security cooperation was necessary. Changing strategic concepts, most
prominently from 'massive retaliation' to 'flexible response', restored
the reliability of mutual defence because of altered security
circumstances (e.g., Haftendorn 1996; Tuschhoff 1999; Kaplan 2004: 100).
Although the concept of 'flexible response' eventually satisfied all
allies and remained valid until the end of the Cold War, different
interpretations of deterrence and its operational implications persisted
(Daalder 1991: 41; Risse-Kappen 1995: 184--7). Once again a particular
structure of conflict among NATO allies was observable in the sense that
[although a 'crisis' occurred, references to the common heritage, shared
norms and values of the 'free world' restored sufficient coherence among
them]{.underline}. In this sense, the decision over **[West Germany\'s
membership]{.underline}** in 1955, **[the Suez Crisis]{.underline}** in
1956, **[the withdrawal of France]{.underline}** from the integrated
military command structure in 1966, or **[NATO\'s double track
decision]{.underline}** in 1979 [were all]{.underline} incidents of
[**alliance disruption** that]{.underline} nevertheless **[did not lead
to a break-up of the Atlantic alliance]{.underline}**. In these
situations **[strategic concepts]{.underline}** turned out to be crucial
in [**re-establishing coherence** and unity by **reaffirming the
authority of the alliance** and its **ability to
(re-)act**.]{.underline} The [strengthening of **consultation
mechanisms**]{.underline} in the 1950s, the formation of '**[Allied
Mobile Forces']{.underline}** (AMF) in the 1960s, or the deployment of
additional **[Pershing II missiles]{.underline}** in the 1980s embodied
the [**institutional consequences** of]{.underline} these [**strategic
re-orientations**.]{.underline}

With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, many commentators expected that
the Atlantic alliance would sooner or later vanish as well. Thus,
[NATO\'s post-Cold War strategies]{.underline} of 1991 and 1999
[were]{.underline} primarily [aimed at **justifying the institutional
continuity of the Western alliance**]{.underline} against the new
setting of a decreasing Eastern threat (e.g., Ringsmose and Rynning
2009: 5). At the beginning of the 1990s, 'Europe, whole and free' (The
Alliance\'s New Strategic Concept 1991) became the obvious new
rhetorical commonplace to legitimise a different future for NATO
compared with the fate of the Warsaw Pact. It opened up the possibility
of Eastern enlargement and paved the way for the institutionalisation of
a new relationship with Russia (Wallander 2000; Williams and Neumann
2000; Schimmelfennig 2003; Adler 2008; Pouliot 2008) as well as
initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean (Masala 2003).

In the same vein of institutional and geographical expansion, the
'out-of-area' debate in the mid-1990s rearticulated the necessity for a
political and military engagement far beyond alliance territory and
territorial defence.Footnote7 While the bipolar confrontation of the
Cold War had largely constrained the alliance\'s global military
engagement, 's[afeguarding the freedom, common heritage and
civilisation' now ascribed a **global mission** to NATO\'s
members.]{.underline} Instead of supporting a culture of self-restraint
and legal formalism, the [allies]{.underline} even
[intensified]{.underline} a tendency towards [**self-authorisation** in
**the name of defending human rights and the achievements of 'Western
civilisation'**]{.underline}. Disregarding United Nations' formal legal
provisions [in]{.underline} the case of **[Kosovo]{.underline}**,
**[NATO]{.underline}** itself **[became a]{.underline}** **[producer of
a common law]{.underline}** where **[the protection of human rights was
deemed more important than respecting state sovereignty and
non-intervention]{.underline}**. The specific formation of NATO\'s
strategic discourse made such 'humanitarian interventions' intelligible
as the new raison d'être. Public justifications for **[military
interventions in Serbia or Afghanistan]{.underline}**, for example,
[cited the **attack on 'Western' values** as a determining reason for
taking military action]{.underline}. Ultimately, in its statement on
terrorism, [the North Atlantic Council said]{.underline} that '[the
lives of **our citizens**]{.underline}, and **[their human rights and
civil liberties']{.underline}** [were threatened by
terrorism]{.underline} and reaffirmed that the allies 'condemn terrorism
in all its forms and manifestations. We, the 19 [NATO
Allies]{.underline}, [are determined to **combat this
scourge**]{.underline}. Our **[security requires no less']{.underline}**
(NATO 2001).Footnote8

During the Cold War, such a project of self-authorisation was primarily
realised by institutionalising an integrated command structure,
coordinated defence planning and common exercises. Today, **[the
rhetoric of unpredictable risks]{.underline}** and the global war on
terrorism **[assigns]{.underline}** an almost **[universal authority to
NATO]{.underline}**, in particular when '[the challenge is not just to
make our populations secure, but **feel secure'**]{.underline} (de Hoop
Scheffer 2009, emphasis added). 'Europe' and the 'transatlantic area' is
the endangered subject of NATO\'s strategic discourse
[justifying]{.underline} a durable and institutionally dense [military
cooperation]{.underline} of its member states [and a **nuclearisation**
of its defence strategy]{.underline}. Whenever allies pursued (national)
security policies without consultation, conflicts and crisis within the
alliance ensued. [It was **only through NATO** that 'the West' could
materialise its power position through a specific form of
self-authorisation]{.underline}. [NATO]{.underline}, respectively
Western states, [presented]{.underline} '**[democracy', 'human rights',
the 'rule of law', and 'market economy' as normatively unquestioned
principles]{.underline}** they had already realised. Others had only one
choice: to **[comply or to resist]{.underline}**. The normative
attractiveness of 'the West', thus, also directs our attention to the
temptations of securitising practices where [a formalisation of IR
through law is marginalised by unilateral acts of
self-authorisation.]{.underline}

#### The resolution's conceptualization of data as an international political tool stimulates endless growth with limited regulation

[**Data** form]{.underline} an increasingly **[essential element of
contemporary politics]{.underline}**, [as both]{.underline} **[public
and private actors extend claims of their legitimate control in diverse
areas]{.underline}** including health, security, and trade. This paper
investigates [**data governance** as a site of fundamental **normative
and political ordering**]{.underline} processes [that unfold in light
of]{.underline} ever-increasing inter- and **[transnational
linkages]{.underline}**. Drawing on the concept of jurisdictional
conflicts, the paper traces the evolution of data governance in three
cases of transatlantic conflicts as diverging definitional claims over
data. The paper argues that these [conflicts reveal]{.underline} varying
[conceptualizations of data linked]{.underline} to four [distinct
visions of the social world]{.underline}. First, a conceptualization of
[data]{.underline} as an individual rights issue [links human rights
with the promotion of sovereignty to]{.underline} a vision **[of data
governance as local liberalism]{.underline}**. Second, **[proponents of
a security partnership promote global security cooperation based on the
conceptualization of]{.underline}** **[data as a neutral
instrument]{.underline}**. Third, a conceptualization of [data as
an]{.underline} **[economic resource]{.underline}** is [linked to
a]{.underline} vision of the **[digital economy]{.underline}** [that
endorses]{.underline} **[progress and innovation with limited
regulation]{.underline}**. Fourth, a conceptualization of data as a
collective resource links the values of universal rights and global
rules to a vision of global protection.

[The]{.underline} ever-increasing relevance of the [internet has
contributed to the recognition of data as a key concern in social,
political, and economic lives.]{.underline} [How data are collected,
processed, and shared has significant implications for contemporary
politics in areas, such as security, health, democracy, and human
rights]{.underline} (van Puyvelde, Coulthart, and Hossain 2017; Davies
and Wenham 2020). [After the]{.underline} 2013 **[Snowden revelations of
mass surveillance by intelligence agencies around the
world]{.underline}** but [also]{.underline} following potential **[voter
manipulation in the Cambridge Analytica scandal]{.underline}** in 2018,
[data governance has experienced a "salience shock"]{.underline}
(Kalyanpur and Newman 2019). Data governance describes ordering
processes by actors including but not limited to states, international
organizations, local authorities, and private companies that relate to
the processing, transfer, sharing, and general use practices of digital
data. [Regulatory measures on the international, regional, and domestic
level have proliferated]{.underline}. Of the 132 countries that have at
least minimal data privacy laws in place, 55 countries have adopted such
legislation only in the last ten years (UNCTAD 2020). As even [tech
companies have increasingly called for regulation]{.underline} (Hern
2019), former European Commissioner Martine Reicherts has claimed that
["\[d\]ata protection is the new business model]{.underline}" (Reicherts
2014). While there seems to be convergence around common standards
(Bradford 2020), conflicts resulting from different approaches to the
governance of digital data have shaken particularly transatlantic
relations in the last decade (Farrell and Newman 2019). Actors face
significant incentives to avoid such conflicts. In 2013, the European
Centre for Political Economy estimated that a serious disruption in
transatlantic data flows could have a negative impact on the EU Gross
Domestic Product of between 0.8 and 1.3 percent (ECIPE 2013, 3). Yet,
overlapping claims of control have adversely affected the transatlantic
data transfer regime multiple times. For instance, in 2015 and again in
2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the
main transatlantic data sharing agreement for commercial transfers
exposing more than 5,000 businesses to legal uncertainty.

#### Information inequality is the invisible monster poisoning debate. Debate itself is but one of the victims of the episteme focused on the supremacy and preservation of "Data" and "Information"

**Triumph Debate No Date**

"Triumph Debate, \"We Always Say There's A Wealth Disparity in Speech
and Debate -- Now Here's the Proof,\"
https://triumphdebate.com/we-always-say-theres-a-wealth-disparity-in-speech-and-debate-now-heres-the-proof/"

[[Wealthy debaters have a laundry **list of advantages**]{.mark} in
Speech and Debate]{.underline}. [Generally, the wealthier you are, the
better school you go to -- **even if it's not a private school, you
likely live in a district that receives better funding and has more
resources available**.]{.underline} The more money your school has, the
more it can pay coaches, attracting both better quality coaches
(generally, not always) and being able to hire multiple coaches for one
category. Your school can afford to go to tournaments that are far away,
including national circuit tournaments, meaning you can face the best
competition and can have access to longer tournaments with break rounds.
[**Even the [smaller issues can add]{.mark}** [**up -- being able to
afford briefs/websites**]{.mark}, getting an extra 2 hours of sleep
because your team can afford a hotel for travel tournaments, being able
to afford nicer suits and better laptops, having the ability to prep
rather than spend weekends fundraising for their team to even
compete,]{.underline} etc. And, all of these advantages compound,
creating "dynasty teams"; wealthy schools with wealthy debaters who all
enjoy these privileges and therefore elevate one another. [Say, for
example, Roosevelt HS (generic presidential named school), devotes
thousands to their debate team, they have multiple PF coaches, their
students never have to fundraise and can all spend time prepping, **they
have [access to every brief]{.mark}**, and can have a 14 person strong
team because they can afford to travel to avoid event caps**. They all
[get the best education]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and with 10 students
researching and several coaches to bounce ideas off of, they likely come
in with some of the strongest arguments. They've all practiced them two,
three, four, five times because their team is so large they can do as
many mock rounds as they want[**. [They show up]{.mark} to the
tournament, not only [as some of the strongest debaters]{.mark}**, but
also not being able to debate each other.]{.underline} **[Compare that
with [a poor inner-city public school]{.mark};]{.underline}** the LD
team has no coach and was just founded in the last few years. There are
3 debaters, one varsity, two novices, so they get very few mock rounds,
and the ones they get are much less productive. They can't afford to go
to tournaments out of district, so they get less out-round
experience**[. They [spend their Sunday fundraising so their team can
compete]{.mark}, so they lose out on a whole day of prepping. The team
[can't afford JSTOR or briefs]{.mark}. [How does the latter compete with
the former?]{.mark}]{.underline}** I wanted to paint this image because
often unless you come from a low-income school or are low-income
yourself**[, it can be hard to see the privilege you
have]{.underline}**. You've never not had briefs, or mock rounds, or a
coach, or a captain to read over your case**[. It is easy to take these
things for granted. But the [more we talk about these inequities, the
closer we can get to filling the]{.mark} [gap]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
order to analyze the effects of wealth on debate, we compared the
performance of students who attend private schools with students who
attend public schools at the state tournament in Ohio over the course of
the last 5 years. [While this is not a perfect methodology, we simply
don't have access to students' financial records, so this is the best we
could do]{.underline}. We do believe that, for the most part, when
talking about trends and averages, the type of school students attend
can give insight on their socioeconomic status.

[In the months following the 2003 invasion, **the debate** between the
United States and allies opposed to the United States' actions (namely
France and Germany) **continued in the Atlantic Council**.]{.underline}
The [United States appealed to the alliance for **support in training
new Iraqi security forces**]{.underline}, [and NATO complied in
establishing the NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I),]{.underline}
**[circumventing the objections of France]{.underline}**. But, as Philip
Gordon and Jeremy Shapiro argue, the [short-term damage to the US-NATO
relationship was immediately evident]{.underline}. "By the time the war
began in March 2003, the Iraq crisis was no longer just a result of
transatlantic differences, but a significant cause of them**[. The
crisis reinforced many of the worst transatlantic stereotypes --
depicting the United States as unilateralist and militaristic in
European eyes, and Europeans as unreliable and ungrateful allies in
American eyes]{.underline}**" (Gordon and Shapiro 2004[**). The Iraq
case provides valuable information about the effects of NATO's
nonparticipation on legitimacy**. While the US mission's likelihood of
success for finding weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) was uncertain at
best, disputes between the allies and NATO's absence in Operation Iraqi
Freedom further damaged both the legitimacy of the operation and the
perception of US adherence to international norms.]{.underline} J. GAREY
37 [**When the Bush administration acted without the alliance, it was
seen as aggressive and unilateral** despite having assembled a coalition
for the Iraq effort and continued to pursue NATO's support throughout
the operation.]{.underline} [Policymakers also recognized the utility of
the alliance and benefitted from the allies' participation through the
NTM-I. Thus, **while the Iraq War did not result in a US-NATO
partnership or a major NATO undertaking**, the hypotheses on the
importance of the alliance to the United States are confirmed. **Both
legitimacy and utility led the United States to pursue the
alliance**]{.underline}

[Speculation **of both US and NATO intervention in Libya began** with
the protests in Benghazi in February 2011.]{.underline} Shortly after
protestors stormed the city, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)
passed Resolution 1970 condemning the government's actions and applying
sanctions[. In the following weeks, the Security Council also passed
UNSC Resolution 1973 authorizing international intervention (NATO 2012).
On March 19, 2011, one day after the UNSC Resolution 1973, **the United
States launched Operation Odyssey Dawn (OOD**)]{.underline} [to further
enforce the no-fly zone. In the days following the initiation of OOD,
NATO placed ships and aircraft in the Central Mediterranean to prevent
the shipment of arms to Colonel Qaddafi's army.]{.underline} They also
instituted a search and seizure order of all incoming ships[. One week
after the passage of UNSCR 1973, **NATO agreed to take control of the
multinational effort at the behest of several organizations, including
the Arab League** and other non-NATO partners.]{.underline} Beginning
March 31, 2011, NATO air and sea assets deployed as NATO launched
Operation Unified Protector (OUP) (NATO 2011). [The mandate of OUP was
threefold: to enforce an arms embargo, to maintain a no-fly zone over
Libya, and to ensure the protection of Libyan civilians.]{.underline}
Through the two overlapping operations, [the United States participated
in the air campaign over Libya for eight months, first as the leader of
the coalition effort (under OOD), and then as a vital component of the
NATO led OUP.]{.underline} **[Not only was the United States successful
in enforcing these sanctions, but NATO also counted the operation as a
"win." The Libyan operation confirms all four of the hypotheses on the
importance of US-NATO relations]{.underline}**. Although many states and
international organizations---including the Arab League and other
regional partners---agreed on the necessity of intervention, and the UN
Security Council essentially authorized the allies' actions, [**the
United States pursued NATO partnership to enhance its legitimacy as a
multinational effort and adhere to international norms**. Furthermore,
the Obama administration insisted on NATO leadership because of the
heightened **utility of the alliance vis-à-vis other multilateral
arrangements.**]{.underline} [**Policymakers recognized the alliance's
capacities** to coordinate the multinational coalition were unmatched by
any other organization, **and they wanted to ensure the successful
handoff of responsibility for the mission.**]{.underline} [The United
States also exerted its influence within the **alliance to highlight
NATO's shortcomings in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR)** capabilities, and **pushed the alliance to acquire the necessary
resources for future ISR missions.**]{.underline}

The [North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as an instrument of U.S.
foreign policy for seven decades, has never been the good-guy guardian
of world peace and progress]{.underline}. Instead, it [has been the
instrument by which U.S. and transnational corporations can dominate the
planet through military, economic, and political means.]{.underline}

When the situation called for it---[whether in Iraq, Serbia, Croatia,
Libya, Syria, or Afghanistan]{.underline}---[NATO could be counted on to
step forward in full support of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. [Today
it plays that role by planning, under the leadership of the U.S., war
games on the borders of Russia that involve hundreds of thousands of
troops and weapons and by backing up U.S. military operations in the
Middle East.]{.underline}

[NATO policy]{.underline}, like most of U.S. foreign policy over the
last 70 years, [has resulted not in peace and democracy but in war,
massive human suffering, displacement of millions of refugees, and, not
least, incredible numbers of deaths.]{.underline}

In addition to being a military protector of capitalism and guarantor of
its export to formerly socialist Eastern European countries, NATO is
also an international outlaw organization.

Like the U.S., [it has conducted many illegal wars.]{.underline} In
violation of its own constitution, [it goes to war without UN
authorization and almost always in cases where there has been no
military attack on one of its members]{.underline}. Essentially [every
single military exploit undertaken by NATO has been just as illegal
under international law]{.underline} as have been the wars conducted by
the United States since NATO was founded.

Instead of bringing these truths to Americans, the media was busy this
week talking about the fight between Trump and French President Macron
over France paying its "fair share" into the alliance piggy bank. They
never bothered to touch on where those NATO dues go once they're paid
up.

When the corporate media does talk about the alliance, they usually put
forward false narratives. [They say, for example, that NATO was formed
in response to Soviet aggression.]{.underline}

When the alliance was founded in 1949, the Soviet Union had just lost 25
million of its people fighting Hitler and the Nazis. The countries that
founded NATO, with the exception of Germany of course, had been allied
with the Soviet Union in that fight. What changed by 1949 was that the
capitalists in control of NATO's founding members were alarmed that in
one European country after another, the left was growing and often
taking political power.

Around the world, [former colonies were breaking away from their
masters]{.underline}. [NATO was created to foster the unity of the
capitalist Western countries to enable them to maintain economic and
political control of as much of the world as possible]{.underline}. [The
need, as far as NATO was concerned, was to make sure the 20th century
would be the century that saw capitalism triumph over
socialism]{.underline}. The truth is that [when NATO began in 1949,
there was no threat of aggression coming from the Soviet
Union.]{.underline}

[If the reason for starting NATO was to counter Soviet aggression, then
why did NATO not disband after the Soviet Union and the socialist
countries were defeated?]{.underline} [The reason, of course, is that
maintaining capitalism and imperialist control of the world was always
the real goal.]{.underline} From the time of the end of the USSR and the
socialist countries in Europe until now, NATO has continued in this
role, becoming capitalism's global military arm.

After the defeat of the socialist countries, Russia was promised by the
U.S. that NATO would not be expanded to include Soviet-allied states.
That pledge was of course ignored. Instead, the alliance expanded from a
dozen to 29 countries, including many on the borders of Russia. And they
haven't stopped, pushing now to grab Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine---all
former republics that made up part of the Soviet Union itself. On top of
that, they are also expanding into Latin America, with their eyes on
Colombia and Brazil.

Trump bragged this week that he had a good meeting with NATO General
Secretary Jens Stoltenberg. Stoltenberg was happy about Trump's push for
higher NATO spending by member countries, who have now pledged to hike
the NATO coffers by some \$400 billion.

[It should frighten us that where the people rise up for economic
justice]{.underline}, like in Venezuela and Bolivia, for example, the
progressive forces [have to be ready for the U.S. and NATO to
pounce]{.underline}. [It is no accident that NATO is putting the moves
on countries]{.underline} that surround Venezuela and Bolivia, countries
[that have rejected U.S. imperialism]{.underline}. [Free elections,
democracy, and human rights are not the criteria for NATO action. The
alliance acts whenever and wherever the interests of imperialism or
capitalism are threatened.]{.underline}

Yet today, we unfortunately see liberal lawmakers who join in support
for NATO even though the defense of that alliance and support for the
U.S. military budget threatens world peace and the funding for
progressive programs here at home. Even the best in the U.S. Congress,
among them Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, voted for the NATO
Support Act earlier this year.

#### The government is key player

**Stanger 21** -- \[Allison Stanger is an American political scientist
and the Russell J. Leng \'60 Professor of International Politics and
Economics at Middlebury College; 11/24/21; [Perspectives on Digital
Humanism]{.underline}; The Real Cost of Surveillance Capitalism: Digital
Humanism in the United States and Europe; Cham: Springer International
Publishing AG, 2022//JL\]

In the New York Times piece, [Zuboff argues that the world is currently
experiencing both "epistemic chaos" and an "epistemic
coup]{.underline}." [The Big Tech companies have executed a silent
epistemic coup]{.underline}, Zuboff warns, [to which we must pay close
attention if we are to sustain democracy]{.underline}. "[In an
information civilization, societies are defined by questions of
knowledge---how it is distributed, the authority that governs its
distribution and the power that protects that authority]{.underline},"
Zuboff writes. "Who knows? Who decides who knows? Who decides who
decides who knows? [Surveillance capitalists now hold the answers to
each question, though we never elected them to govern. This is the
essence of the epistemic coup]{.underline}" (Zuboff 2021).

Zuboff's epistemic coup proceeds in four stages. The first is the
"appropriation of epistemic rights." The second involves a rise in
epistemic inequality, "The difference between what I can know and what
can be known about me." The third and present stage is one of "epistemic
chaos" that is the result of prior coordinated manipulation; this is the
stage where there is disagreement about the truth that cannot be
bridged. The fourth is epistemic dominance, effectively the
institutionalization of computational government by "private
surveillance capital." The epistemic chaos reflected in the January 6
siege of the capital, according to Zuboff, was a warning shot (Zuboff
2021).

Who or what is driving this sequential epistemic nightmare? Presumably
the appropriators are private surveillance capitalists, and the
implication is that Zuboff is mounting a Marxist argument, as she seems
to be pointing a finger squarely at capitalism itself. She also sees
[the CIA and NSA---i.e., government---as part of surveillance
capitalism]{.underline}. Is this the deep state as the executive
committee of the bourgeoisie? While Marx references feature prominently
in Zuboff's book, they are not mentioned in the New York Times essay,
suggesting that capitalism itself isn't the problem. But [if the
capitalist profit motive is not the problem, what is? What does any of
this have to do with epistemology? Big data in and of itself is not
knowledge]{.underline}. The interpretation of data produces knowledge
rather than mere noise. Who are these knowledge creators? Is Zuboff one
of them?

2 What the Metaphor of Surveillance Capitalism Obfuscates

Zuboff's concepts of surveillance capitalism and a related epistemic
coup pose obstacles to understanding, for at least four reasons. First,
coups, which involve the military, have clear objectives in mind. They
involve an intention to seize power. [The military has not sanctioned
Facebook and Google's rising power]{.underline}. Yes, Facebook knows
more about us than we know about ourselves and each other, and they cut
off the communications of Donald Trump just as the military will close
down airports and all communications in the aftermath of a coup. But
[not only is the military not involved in any of this, there is nothing
to stop Donald Trump or any one of us, to communicate by alternative
means]{.underline}. Trump can still send a mass email, and we can still
delete and block, or simply migrate to another platform. [Facebook and
Twitter appear to have total information dominance only when we allow
them to do so. We are choosing to allow companies to commodify our
personal data and use us in this way.]{.underline}

Second, there is a difference between voluntary and involuntary
surveillance, between whether the citizen volunteers the information or
has it hijacked by a company or government agency. From a foreigner's
perspective, the NSA conducts involuntary surveillance when it exploits
the Court's interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits
unreasonable searches and seizures, as not extending to foreigners.
According to existing American constitutional interpretation, American
citizens have the right to privacy; non-American citizens do not.
Perhaps extending Fourth Amendment protections to Europeans is a
promising change to consider, but the question that rightfully then
arises is why Europeans should receive a privilege that non-Europeans do
not. The status quo jurisprudence has the virtue of being
non-discriminatory, as it applies to all non-citizens. In addition,
consumers may volunteer their personal data to Facebook in exchange for
using the platform, but that initial consent could in the future be
ruled involuntary when Facebook sells the data to third parties or
stands as a gatekeeper to the use of other apps requiring a Facebook
login.

[Third, rather than government and business being co-conspirators in
surveillance capitalism, as Zuboff suggests, it is possible to find
numerous instances where Big Tech and governments have been at
loggerheads]{.underline}, both within the United States and especially
when one extends one's gaze beyond American borders. Twitter and
Facebook banning the former American president from their platforms is
the most recent example of the former. [The myriad ways that the
capitalist economies of continental Europe and the European Union have
challenged the excesses of surveillance capitalism through national and
EU legislation are evidence against a business-government
conspiracy]{.underline}. If there has been an epistemic coup, as Zuboff
argues, [democratic governments are clearly not entirely on
board.]{.underline}

Finally, [surveillance capitalism suggests that there is something
intrinsic to capitalism that is animating data collection]{.underline},
when this is not the case. While [its economy certainly has some
capitalist features, the Chinese Communist Party's interventions in
economic life are incompatible with capitalism]{.underline}. Beijing's
restructuring of Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma's corporate empire is a case
in point (Zhong 2021). The China Brain Project, which involves the
Chinese military, harvests data from Baidu that fuels China's
controversial Social Credit System, designed to reward "pro-social" and
punish "anti-social" behavior. China is also apparently interested in
building expertise in American behavior modification, and Americans have
willingly volunteered their personal data for Chinese use in exchange
for using the popular app TikTok, which has been banned in India for
national security reasons. It may not be the case, however, that
[securing American data to train algorithms to better manipulate or sell
to Americans is necessary]{.underline}. A 2007 multinational study found
that the OCEAN Big Five personality inventory, which was exploited so
brilliantly by Cambridge Analytica to interfere in the 2016 US
presidential election, is "robust across major areas of the world"
(Schmitt et al. 2007).

In mischaracterizing the nature of the problem, therefore, [Zuboff
misses the real story]{.underline}. Coups are intentional, and if
anything, [technology companies don't want the political power that has
inadvertently accrued to them through their monopoly of
information]{.underline}. [Mark Zuckerberg and other tech titans have
repeatedly stated that they want appropriate government regulation but
have been forced to do the best they can with self-regulation until
government again assumes its proper role as overseer and promoter of the
greater good]{.underline}. The inherent problems with self-regulation
are obvious. But [it is not difficult to see that government has been
slow to come to terms with the dramatic transformation of democracy's
public sphere through technological innovation]{.underline}.

To summarize, [the Big Tech companies have not orchestrated a coup; they
have myopically optimized for shareholder value at the expense of civic
life]{.underline}. They have created products for other children that
they do not want their own children to use (The Social Dilemma 2020).
Further, [these companies haven't cornered the market on knowledge, as
the word epistemic suggests, but on data, and data can mislead just as
easily as it can inform]{.underline}.

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 7: Four Cheers for Vulgarity!!!!)//gideon

[If you want to show that your version of Marxism is a cut
above]{.underline} somebody else 's, the quickest way to do so is to
[call the other vulgar]{.underline}. [One's own is sophisticated,
subtle, erudite, philosophically rich---all the things the vulgar is
not]{.underline}. Or so it has been for a century. Even outside the
small world of selfdescribed Marxists, some versions of Marxism have
been acceptable in polite company---but rarely the vulgar ones. What is
wrong about the vulgar other is a bit of a moving target, as we shall
see. The category works by contrast, as the bad term in a combinatory.
The sins of the vulgarians are what you claim your refinement of Marxism
is a cut above. When Marx said something was vulgar, he often meant it
was bourgeois. This sense of the vulgar is that which has been stripped
of its qualities by exchange. But vulgar is a promiscuous word, and
sometimes even among Marxists it refers not to the exchangeable thing,
but the laboring peoples and the "dirt" that sticks to them one way or
another. Does it not seem strange that there are Marxists who want to
distance themselves from the vulgar? Does that make them genteel
Marxists? Perhaps [the very notion that there's something bad about what
is vulgar needs challenging]{.underline}. While far from exhausting the
multitudinous senses of the word, here are some of the things the
[vulgar can be: ill-bred, obscene, crude, base, earthy, ordinary,
popular, current, vernacular, coarse, common, indelicate, unlettered,
idiomatic, heretical.]{.underline} It's curious how this range of
[meanings]{.underline} also [resonates with Blackness or queerness and
with that femininity (trans and cis) that finds itself policed rather
than idealized]{.underline}. There are certainly strands of
[Marxist]{.underline} or Marxist-influenced [thought]{.underline} that,
while (more or less) respectable, [engage with]{.underline} one or other
of these senses of [the vulgar]{.underline}. At the level of the concept
Aimé Cesaire and [negritude]{.underline}, George Bataille and [base
matter]{.underline}, Raymond Williams and [the ordinary]{.underline},
Silvia Federici on [the body-politic]{.underline}---to name just four. 1
At the level of the radical subject, consider Guy Debord and [the urban
workshirker]{.underline}, Paul Préciado and [the queer sex
worker]{.underline}. 2 [One could compose a]{.underline} **[whole
countertradition of these affirmative vulgar Marxisms]{.underline}**. In
this chapter's thought experiment, let's suppose that **[getting
a]{.underline}** conceptual **[grasp on the twenty-first century might
only be possible from the everyday experiences of]{.underline}** the
various **[vulgarians]{.underline}** **[who were insulted during the
twentieth century]{.underline}.** But **[first]{.underline}**, I want to
look a bit more closely now at [**how the insult** "vulgar Marxist!"
**is deployed**]{.underline}, and in otherwise not wholly compatible
ways, before moving on to four other forms of vulgarity that I think are
worth particular attention in the current situation. [Finding the vulgar
distasteful is]{.underline} perhaps [the defining gesture
of]{.underline} so-called [Western Marxism]{.underline}.3 For Georg
Lukács, the vulgarians think the foundations of bourgeois society are
pretty unshakeable. They are in it for the long haul, [building
**unions**]{.underline}, mass [**cultural institutions**, and
**electoral bases**]{.underline}.4 This [gradualism]{.underline} in
practice [corresponds to a **theoretical failing**]{.underline}. The
vulgarian does not take the totality as the central category and sees it
as unscientific. [Vulgar Marxists **reject the doctrine of commodity
fetishism as the root of a false consciousness**]{.underline} that
occludes the thought of the totality. [They]{.underline} merely
[practice **marxisant flavors**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} each of
the [specialized forms of knowledge. A proper dialectical theory grasps
History as a]{.underline} totality both as [concept and]{.underline} as
[sphere of action for the proletariat, with the party as
the]{.underline} total [unifier]{.underline} of theory and practice---or
the philosopher. Karl [Korsch thinks]{.underline} the [vulgarians do not
understand the central importance of the correct dialectical method.
They **lack a philosophical perspective**]{.underline}. [For
Korsch]{.underline}, as for Lukács, [the "orthodox" Marxism]{.underline}
of the Second International is the main target of attack. They both
dissent from its social theory, [where base "mechanically" determines
superstructure]{.underline}, and also from its historical theory, [which
insists on the succession of economic stages]{.underline} and their
corresponding political forms. [It is **too "materialist"**]{.underline}
a Marxism, **[not dialectical enough]{.underline}**. Although he had
some quirky vulgarian tendencies of his own, Walter Benjamin deploys a
slightly different version of the vulgarian insult in "On the Concept of
History," worth quoting a little: "The conformism which has dwelt within
social democracy from the very beginning rests not merely on its
political tactics, but also on its economic conceptions. It is a
fundamental cause of the later collapse. [There is nothing which has
corrupted]{.underline} the German working-class [so much as the opinion
that they were swimming with the tide]{.underline}. [Technical
developments counted]{.underline} to them [as the]{.underline} course of
the [stream]{.underline}, [which they thought they were
swimming]{.underline} in. From this, [it was only a step to the illusion
that the factory]{.underline}-labor set forth by the path of
technological progress [represented a political
achievement]{.underline}. The old Protestant work ethic celebrated its
resurrection among German workers in secularized form. The Gotha Program
already bore traces of this confusion. It defined labor as 'the source
of all wealth and all culture.'... This [vulgar-Marxist concept
of]{.underline} what [labor]{.underline} is ... [wishes to]{.underline}
**[perceive only the progression of the exploitation of nature, not the
regression of society]{.underline}**... [Labor]{.underline}, as it
[is]{.underline} henceforth conceived, is [tantamount to the
**exploitation of nature**]{.underline}, [which is **contrasted to** the
**exploitation of the proletariat** with **naïve
selfsatisfaction**]{.underline}."5 Benjamin is resistant to the working
class point of view of proletarian culture. From Joseph Dietzgen comes
what one might call the myth of labor as a key resource for
self-organization.6 From the labor point of view, how could labor come
into its own if it did not imagine itself as the source of value? In
Korsch and Lukács, what is [vulgar lacks a proper understanding of
philosophy]{.underline}. Here in Benjamin, interestingly, is a
distancing from a positive sense of the vulgar, as the self-image of the
working class. And not entirely without justice, but [if we are indeed
to be dialectians, perhaps now is the time to negate the negation and
return a rude prole stare to this genteel gaze]{.underline}.
[Adorno]{.underline} deploys the vulgar insult in a different way. In
Minima Moralia he [claims that the critique of ideology as false
consciousness has itself become an ideology]{.underline}. 7 [The vulgar
Marxist reduction of the cultural artifact to its basic economic
determinants]{.underline} comes too close to [paralleling the culture
industry's]{.underline} own [evaluation of its products by their sales
numbers]{.underline}. [That]{.underline} [which]{.underline} in [culture
might escape exchange value]{.underline} also [escapes the vulgar
Marxist's attention]{.underline}. For Adorno, as for Lukács and Korsch,
[what is vulgar lacks]{.underline} a proper understanding of [Hegelian
dialectics]{.underline}, but for Adorno the dialectic needs an extra
twist: [absent the revolution]{.underline}, [eternal Capital remains a
false totality]{.underline}. Maurice Merleau-Ponty concurs with Lukács's
Hegelian-Marxist variant of the insult: The [vulgarians
**neglect**]{.underline} the central concept of
**[totality]{.underline}**. 8 By the time we get [to
Althusser]{.underline}, it is precisely [the dialectic]{.underline} that
[is vulgar]{.underline}! For Althusser, those vulgarians think of [the
economic base as an essence and the superstructures as mere
appearances]{.underline}. Moreover, [they miss Marx's]{.underline}
crucial intervention in his [critique of the economics of David
Ricardo]{.underline}. [Marx]{.underline} did not simply take over the
object of economic science and bring a "dialectical" method to it. He
[constructs a]{.underline} whole new and properly "[scientific"
theoretical object]{.underline}. While Althusser sees dialectics as the
taint of the vulgar, this is still in the name of a genteel Marxism that
calls for more, not less, engagement in philosophy. If for Lukács the
genteel Marxist has to bring dialectics to Marxism, for Althusser the
genteel Marxist has to undo the vulgarizing effects of that dialectics
in the name of a better sense of the correct method, but which is still
a philosophical method.9 E. P. Thompson is famous for a book- length
tirade against Althusser. 10 Yet even [in Thompson there is a tactical
deployment of the vulgarian insult]{.underline}. In his appreciation of
Christopher Caudwell, what Thompson finds vulgar is [a lack of respect
for disciplinary boundaries and hierarchies]{.underline}. 11 This is not
that different from Althusser's anxiety about Marxists working in
newfangled forms of knowledge such as the study of communication, who he
insists need to have the objects of their field defined and policed by
Marxist philosophy. In both Thompson and Althusser, [there's a sovereign
form of knowledge]{.underline}: [For Thompson,]{.underline}
[history]{.underline} is the queen of the sciences; [for Althusser,
philosophy]{.underline} is king. This sense of [**the vulgar other** as
having **tracked their muddy footprints across the
disciplines**]{.underline} and not followed the protocols of its
sovereign form is different to its sense in Lukács or Merleau-Ponty
where to be vulgar is to lack a sense of the whole, although both of the
latter will claim in turn to have the more elevated means of affecting
the synthesis. [They are all variants of the **genteel gesture** of
reserving to itself a sovereign role for]{.underline} a more **[refined
Marxism]{.underline}**, with access to a special method or perspective.
[There are]{.underline} then **[four]{.underline}** general [**actions
of othering** involved **in calling a Marxism vulgar**.]{.underline} The
[first]{.underline} is **[political]{.underline}**. The [vulgarians
think in]{.underline} terms of [a]{.underline} [gradual]{.underline} or
evolutionary [process of historical change]{.underline}. [They
lack]{.underline} a taste for [the political leap]{.underline}. The
[second]{.underline} is **[theoretical]{.underline}**. [The vulgarians
pay]{.underline} too much [attention to]{.underline} specialized
knowledge such as the [sciences]{.underline}. [They lack the sovereign
method]{.underline}. The [third]{.underline} is
**[cultural]{.underline}**. The [vulgarians are too close to the culture
of the subordinate classes]{.underline}. [They lack]{.underline} a
**[sophistication]{.underline}** about the struggle within bourgeois
culture. The [fourth]{.underline} is more strictly
**[academic]{.underline}**. The [vulgarian ranges]{.underline} too
promiscuously [across disciplinary knowledge and lacks training in a
traditional knowledge-form]{.underline} that is sovereign. All of
[these]{.underline} uses of the vulgarian insult [are designed to
produce a]{.underline} certain [**autonomy and priority** for the
**genteel Marxist** in relation to the working class]{.underline}.
**[Marxism can't be vulgar, because]{.underline}** then **[the
subordinate classes might figure out how to apply it for
themselves]{.underline}** to their own situation. [Marxism]{.underline}
also [has to be]{.underline} something **[superior to the
sciences]{.underline}**, [otherwise]{.underline} a[ctual scientists,
engineers, designers, media producers, or technical people]{.underline}
more generally [would have to be **acknowledged as co-producers of
knowledge**]{.underline}. [Genteel Marxism can't prioritize]{.underline}
the nexus between [labor, technology, and nature, as that
would]{.underline} pretty much [exclude]{.underline} [text-based,
interpretive forms of knowing such as philosophy]{.underline} or history
from claiming a sovereign role. On the other hand, [Marxism
can't]{.underline} claim to [critique]{.underline} [scholarly
knowledge]{.underline} from without. [That would concede]{.underline}
too much [to those trained]{.underline} (as I was) [in]{.underline} the
[party schools]{.underline}, or [with organic experience]{.underline}
with emerging forces of production. If you'll pardon a moment of
twenty-first century vulgarity: track Anglophone usage of
"vulgar+marxism" in Google's ngram, and one finds that its use ramps up
steadily through the seventies and then declines in the eighties.12 The
seventies was the time when Lukács, Korsch, Benjamin, Althusser, and
many other Western Marxists were translated into English and became
textbooks for academic study. After the decline of the last wave of
first-world struggles against Fordist forms of industrial production,
[Marxism took refuge in the superstructures]{.underline}, particularly
in the expanding world of [higher education and state-subsidized high
culture industries]{.underline}. There is a new range of extensions and
developments of the insult in and after this peak period. Antonio [Negri
thinks the vulgarians limit themselves to an objectivist and economistic
Marxism and fail to understand the potential for revolutionary
subjectivity]{.underline}. He even has the wit to hint at the vulgarity
of [Marx's Capital itself]{.underline}, which in his view
[falls]{.underline} away [from the integration of objective and
subjective]{.underline} aspects of the Grundrisse.13 Kojin Karatani
criticizes as vulgar those Marxisms that take Marx's economics to be an
extension of Ricardo's, whereas Ernesto Laclau declares that the
vulgarians make a philosophical error in thinking the revolutionary
moment as one that produces an absolute reconciliation of society with
itself, dissolving false appearances. Cornel West sees the vulgarian as
the essentialist and reductionist Marxist who thinks of action entirely
as force and does not understand the discursive nature of the
political.14 Fredric Jameson defends himself against "avant-garde art
critics" who "quickly identified me as a vulgar Marxist hatchet man." In
some of his most popular works, Terry Eagleton frequently distances his
own method from vulgar Marxism, which he puts in scare quotes. Writers
otherwise as different as Samir Amin and Julia Kristeva share a disdain
for vulgarians, who they think adhere to a mechanistic and deterministic
basic metaphor for conceiving the social and historical.15 In an
original move, Jean [Baudrillard takes up]{.underline} Walter
[Benjamin's disdain for proletarian culture's celebration of labor as
vulgar but pairs it with genteel Marxism's attempt to critique what
labor becomes under capitalism]{.underline}. To him, [both]{.underline}
positions already [concede too much to capitalism as an economic
order]{.underline}, which creates this fetish of commodity production in
the first place.16 The vulgarian insult lived on past the high point of
genteel Marxism in the seventies. Perhaps part of what happened is that
as [Marxism became a creature of the academy]{.underline}, it became a
habit to cordon off respectable approaches to Marxist knowledge that
could fit within disciplines. [In]{.underline} [the absence of
first-world working class movements that could]{.underline} even appear
to [effect social change, hope retreated to the academy or]{.underline}
other [cultural superstructures.]{.underline} But there was another
driver as well: Social movements such as [**feminism and gay liberation
refused to settle for** secondary status as]{.underline} mere
[**epiphenomenon to the class struggle**.]{.underline} However, [the
locus for]{.underline} articulating the [centrality of these movements
was]{.underline} sometimes positioned as [outside of productive
relations]{.underline}. The terrain of **[language]{.underline}**, or
the social or domestic and reproductive relations [became the **new site
of**]{.underline} both [conceptual and practical
**struggle**]{.underline}. Making the case for such a locus sometimes
proceeded through a distancing from vulgar Marxism, to which a
relentlessly economic and class-centric approach would be imputed. Times
change, however. Coming out of the theory wars of the eighties, Gayle
Rubin seems more concerned about "vulgar Lacanians."17 By the
mid-nineties, Laura Mulvey is surveying the media and culture industries
and almost longing for a rather vulgar Marxism to return: "This Marx
would no doubt have reflected with interest on the Rupert Murdoch
phenomena. For most of my intellectual life, such simple correlations
would have fallen into the category of vulgar Marxism. Nowadays [the
gap]{.underline} of determination [between economic structures and
culture seems to be narrowing]{.underline}."18 Particularly [in the era
of **climate change**]{.underline}**,** **[revisiting vulgar Marxism
might be timely]{.underline}**. Lukács disqualified [the sciences
as]{.underline} fetishes of the particular, [unable to grasp the
totality]{.underline}, over which only the nonscience of philosophy had
dominion. John Bellamy Foster has provided a whole missing lineage of
those Marxists who were excluded from the genteel canon for one kind of
vulgarity or other, including Engels, Bogdanov, Bukharin, and many
lesser known lights who took the heavy, sweaty, gritty engagement of
labor and technology with nature, and the sciences that make all that
possible, as objects of attention.19 [Genteel Marxism is a **wannabe
sovereign discourse**]{.underline}, usually a traditional one like
philosophy, [rather than a]{.underline} more **[collaborative and
comradely production of knowledge]{.underline}**. The [sciences and
social sciences are taken to]{.underline} be specialized, instrumental,
to [reify their object]{.underline}. One finds variants of this genteel
strategy in Negri, Karatani, and Žižek. (Žižek's jokes are vulgar; his
philosophy is not.20) But [this is]{.underline} surely [an **outdated
view** of the sciences]{.underline}, [based on]{.underline} a critique
of [its nineteenth century form]{.underline}. As I argued in Molecular
Red, [**climate science has to be addressed as** being]{.underline}, for
better or worse[, **a science of the totality**]{.underline}. 21

Inertia)//gideon

The conscious human subject, [the **for-itself**, is **not an
identity**. It is n]{.underline}othing but a difference, [**a lack**.
The for-itself depends on its desire for what it is not. The
lack]{.underline} that the for-itself feels [can never be
overcome,]{.underline} as [there is no prior unity to uncover, **nor**
is there a **final form** to posit as a goal **at the end of History**
in the manner of the negationists. Nor are the in-itself and the
for-itself in]{.underline} any relation of [reciprocity. The
**for-itself lacks the in-itself, but not vice versa**]{.underline}.31
**[It is not Capital but unhappy consciousness that is a permanent
condition]{.underline}**. Sartre's thought (at this time) is
relentlessly individualist. [Relations between atomistic subjects are
conflictual.]{.underline} [Only the]{.underline} objectifying gaze of an
external, [third-party observer can]{.underline} [make]{.underline}
squabbling [individuals]{.underline} [cohere into a group by
producing]{.underline} a sense of community, [the
us-object]{.underline}. But [this has its limits]{.underline}. [There's
no God who can occupy]{.underline} that place for [the]{.underline}
whole [species-being]{.underline}. [Nor is there]{.underline} ever a
time of [reconciliation]{.underline}. [The for-itself is
**future-oriented**, and the future is **always open**, a realm of
**freedom**.32]{.underline} Sartre agrees with Lukács contra Engels (and
his vulgar Marxist followers such as Needham) that nature is
undialectical, but for Sartre history cannot be thought separately from
nature. In Sartre, nondialectical nature permeates the human, in the
form of the body, troubling the foritself. Nausea (also the title of
Sartre's first novel) reveals the body to consciousness.33 As Martin Jay
remarks in Marxism and Totality: "In short, the radical heterogeneity
between history and nature that was posited by Hegelian Marxists like
Lukács and Kojève in order to save dialectical totalization for human
practice was interiorized within the realm of human history itself by
Sartre."34 [We are confronted by the]{.underline} facticity of an
**[alien world]{.underline}** that is not for us. And **[yet we must
act]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} we [are responsible
fo]{.underline}r all [our acts]{.underline}: **[we are condemned to
freedom]{.underline}**. And [yet **we dwell in** **bad faith**, refusing
to accept that we are our choices]{.underline}. [What we must do
is]{.underline} **[choose a project and embark on it]{.underline}**.
[The goal of such projects is]{.underline} however an
[impossible]{.underline} one: [the fusion of the for-itself with the
in-itself]{.underline}. [There is]{.underline} no God to fuse with,
[just]{.underline} [the inert, repulsive facticity of an alien
nature]{.underline}. And so as Sartre says in Being and Nothingness,
"man is a useless passion."35 Such was the worldview Sartre formed in
the 1930s, a depressing and dark time, where it would have been foolish
to expect any reconciliation of reason and History.

### AT: Just Another Capitalism / Cap v Cap

#### Their obsession with modified modifiers around the eternal essence of capital is wrong

\"Capital is dead\", Introduction)//gideon

In other accounts, [the strangeness of this state of affairs is elided
by making it]{.underline} simply [a variation on]{.underline} received
[ideas about Capital]{.underline}.20 **[Just add a
modifier]{.underline}** to it: **[surveillance]{.underline}**
capitalism, **[platform]{.underline}** capitalism,
**[neoliberal]{.underline}** capitalism, **[postfordist]{.underline}**
capitalism, [and so on]{.underline}.21 T[he essence stays the
same]{.underline}, only the appearances change. But [to sustain that
argument]{.underline}, surely [one has to]{.underline} at least
[entertain the thought]{.underline} experiment [that this is no longer
capitalism]{.underline} at all. Curiously, [the attempt to make this
thought]{.underline} experiment [meets with **strong
resistance**]{.underline}. Even **[critical theory seems]{.underline}**
very emotionally **[attached to the notion that capitalism still goes
on]{.underline}**, and on. Against this trend, Paul Mason has risked the
concept of postcapitalism, which has the merit of raising the stakes,
even if it does not venture a language for an emerging mode of
production. As Mason says, "[The]{.underline} main [contradiction today
is between]{.underline} the possibility **of [free]{.underline},
[abundant goods and information]{.underline}** [and a **system of
monopolies, banks and governments trying to keep things private, scarce
and commercia**]{.underline}**l**."22 Through a fresh reading of Marxist
political economy, Mason offers a way of thinking how
[capitalism]{.underline} may have [mutated]{.underline} that confounds
received ideas about its form and trajectory. [It]{.underline}'s a
stimulating read and [implies]{.underline} [two further
projects]{.underline}: [coming up with a]{.underline} **[renewed
language]{.underline}** for describing the present situation and
identifying what in the received language about capitalism impedes
forward movement in thought and action. That this is not capitalism any
more but something worse is a possibility I have tried out on all sorts
of audiences, both activist and academic, for some years now. To some,
this matches their experience and seems obvious, but it also meets with
pretty strong resistance. There's a curious need to find reasons in
advance not to think about it. Here might be the place to play
postcapitalist bingo, where I list the most common reactions to even the
possibility of thinking that this is no longer capitalism. [I am told
that I am just talking about finance capitalism]{.underline} and that
this is nothing new. ([Sorry]{.underline}, but [information has worked
its way through the entire value production]{.underline} and
reproduction cycle.) [I am told I am just talking about
circulation]{.underline}. ([See previous answer]{.underline}.) [I'm told
that information is just ideas]{.underline}, [which is
idealism]{.underline}. [Materialism is about matter]{.underline}. ([Even
the]{.underline} science of the [mid-twentieth century had]{.underline}
a [more sophisticated "materialism" than that]{.underline}.) [I'm
told]{.underline} that a lot of [features of the present still look like
the capitalism of the age of steam]{.underline}. (Yes, you can make it
all look the same if you want, but [let's try to focus also on what's
not the same and account for both]{.underline}.) [I'm told that since
the telegraph existed in Marx's day, information is not]{.underline} all
that [new]{.underline}. [(There are always]{.underline} historical
[precedents]{.underline}, long histories.) [I'm told that]{.underline}
to talk about [information is the language of Silicon
Valley]{.underline}. ([Why let them monopolize]{.underline} the thinking
about [information]{.underline} as well as the actual information?) [I'm
told]{.underline} (usually by some professor who has tenure) that [Marx
already explained everything]{.underline} in [some obscure footnote in
Volume 2 of Capital]{.underline} and that I should read the
distinguished professor's very long exegesis of it. ([Marx was not a
professor]{.underline}, did not have tenure, [and was trying to
explain]{.underline} both [continuity and change in his own
historical]{.underline} time.) [Or I am told]{.underline}, as if I did
not know it, [that the exploitation of labor still exists]{.underline}.
(On that we can agree, [but so does the extraction of rent from tenant
farmers]{.underline}. Even [slavery is not extinct]{.underline}. [Modes
of production co-exist and interact]{.underline}. [I'm only asking if an
additional one is emerging]{.underline}, not whether it describes the
totality.) Another objection is that [I am only talking about the
overdeveloped]{.underline} world, about Europe, Japan, and the United
States. ([Information is]{.underline} now [the means to control global
supply chains that reach]{.underline} deep into [the so-called
underdeveloped world]{.underline}.23) [Or]{.underline} that [I am only
talking about the "tech" sector]{.underline}, which is not the same as
the "real" economy. ([This seems]{.underline} like an increasingly
[feeble]{.underline} objection, [given how large]{.underline} the
leading [tech companies]{.underline} now [are]{.underline}, measured by
market capitalization.)

#### The third class relation subsumes prior exploitation of nature in a global network of surplus information extraction, a truly free labor. Labor is dead; workers produce unique instances and hackers produce new forms, but it's all owned by someone else. The means of production or land are no longer necessary -- information is the sole vector of control. Addressing the vector is sufficient, and anything that refuses the stack is doomed

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 4: The Class Location Blues)//gideon

A reminder of the thought experiment that threads through these
chapters: What if this was no longer capitalism, but something worse?
Could we [approach this now by describing relations of exploitation and
domination in the **present**, starting with the emerging features, and
work back]{.underline} and out and up from that? This chapter plays
mostly [with]{.underline} the [sociological imagination]{.underline}.1
This is the ability [to conceptualize the problem
synchronically]{.underline}, as if we could slice through the social
formation of the present and look at its [anatomy]{.underline}, [rather
than diachronically]{.underline}, [in terms of]{.underline} patterns of
development [through]{.underline} time (a topic discussed in Chapter 5,
[a historical fantasia]{.underline}). Since the sociology we are playing
with is vulgar Marxist, our imagination might be drawn initially to some
features of the forces of production. It is still the case that
**[extracting]{.underline}** useful **[organic and inorganic matter from
the earth is the basis of social existence.]{.underline}** And it is
still the case that [applying vast amounts of energy in]{.underline} the
form of [**fossil fuels and labor** to that base matter is still how
the]{.underline} endless array of [commodities around us come into
existence.]{.underline} But [both of those processes seem]{.underline}
these days [to be **subordinated to a third**]{.underline} form of
**[relation]{.underline}**. At the smallest and largest scales, [so
much]{.underline} of primary [production]{.underline} and secondary
manufacturing [seems to be controlled by]{.underline} **[rapid flows,
extensive archives and complex algorithms]{.underline}** [whose concrete
existence is]{.underline} in a tertiary form---that of
**[information]{.underline}**. [The forces of production
that]{.underline} [instrumentalize information extend]{.underline} all
the way [into the production process]{.underline}, [whether]{.underline}
in the form of [**industrial robotics** or]{.underline} the detailed and
[constant **surveillance of living labor**]{.underline}. [They
extend]{.underline} all the way [out to **global networks of
measurement, command**, and control that work in **real
time**]{.underline}. These [networks of information
**subsume**]{.underline} not only [**inorganic** and **organic matter**
and **energy** in their web]{.underline} but [also **the human as
"user**,"]{.underline} who becomes [a **producer of
information**]{.underline} **[even when not working]{.underline}**. [The
value of information]{.underline} can be [extracted]{.underline} even
[from **free labor**.]{.underline} The [relations of
production]{.underline} seem to evolve to [enclose]{.underline} [these
forces in]{.underline} rather [novel extensions of the private property
form]{.underline}. Wittgenstein's contribution to communism was his
robust proof of the proposition that there is no private language, but
in our time, privatized languages are everywhere.2 And not just
languages: [**Images, codes, algorithms**, even **genes** can **become
private property**]{.underline}, and in turn [private property shapes
what we imagine the limits and possibilities of this information to
be]{.underline}. [Information is a **relation between novelty and
repetition**,]{.underline} noise and order. 3 [Novelty is extracted from
a class whose efforts are hardly]{.underline} described by the category
of [labor]{.underline}, for the simple reason that while labor repeats
an action whose form is given in advance, the whole point of [these
actions]{.underline} is to [produce **unique instances**]{.underline} of
such forms in the first place. [Alongside the worker is the]{.underline}
figure of the [hacker]{.underline}, [producer]{.underline} not of
repeated content but [of **novel form**]{.underline}, and form
[which]{.underline} more often than not [ends up being **someone else's
property.**]{.underline} One has to ask whether the ruling class
presiding over this mode of production is still adequately described as
capitalist.4 [It s]{.underline}eems **[no longer necessary
to]{.underline}** directly **[own the means of
production]{.underline}**. A remarkable amount of [the valuation of the
leading companies of our time consists not of tangible assets,
but]{.underline} rather [of information]{.underline}. [A company is its
**brands**,]{.underline} its **[patents]{.underline}**, its
**[trademarks]{.underline}**, its **[reputation]{.underline}**, its
**[logistics]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} perhaps above all its
distinctive **[practices of evaluating information]{.underline}**
itself. Some like to talk as if one could just add an adjective or two
to capitalism and describe all this, but we have already rejected that
option as uninteresting poetry. Maybe it's not the same old familiar
endless essence of capitalism cloaked in new appearances. For instance,
call it finance capitalism if you like, but perhaps [the rise of
**finance is**]{.underline} really **[just a symptom]{.underline}**.
Yann Moulier Boutang invites us to see finance as something other than
speculative or fictive excess.5 It has to do with the whole problem of
exchange value in an age where [the forces of production are extensively
and intensively controlled by information]{.underline}: **[nobody knows
what anything is worth]{.underline}**. [Financialization is a perverse
socializing of the problem of the uncertainty of information about
value]{.underline}. So [let's think of it as a]{.underline}
**[postcapitalist mode of production]{.underline}**, [with a
ruling]{.underline} class of a different kind, the [vectoralist
class]{.underline}. [Their **power does not lie in**]{.underline}
directly owning **[the means of production]{.underline}**, as the
capitalist class does. **[Nor]{.underline}** does it lie [**in** owning
agricultural **land**]{.underline}, as the capitalists' old enemy, the
landlord class, does. And just as there was conflict between capitalist
and landlord, so [now there is conflict between capitalist and
vectoralist.]{.underline} **[Capital is dead; long live the vectoralist
class.]{.underline}** It was [with new forces of production]{.underline}
that [Capital defeated labor]{.underline} in the late twentieth century.
Like the sorcerer's apprentice, [Capital summoned]{.underline} up
[forces it could not]{.underline} restrain or [control]{.underline}.
Capital in turn finds itself struggling against a rising class that
provided the very means of that victory. [If one can use an information
infrastructure to route around labor's power to block the production
process, one can]{.underline} use the same means to [make capitalist
producers compete with each other on a global scale]{.underline}.6

#### The new class antagonism subordinates previous class relations

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 2: Capitalism---or Worse?)//gideon

[Industrial capitalism]{.underline} was not terribly interested in
workers who think and feel. It wanted hands. It [wanted
muscle]{.underline}. It was a flesh-eating machine.
[Whatever]{.underline} disgusting and terrifying [power lurks
in]{.underline} these more [recent stories does not so much eat bodies
as brains]{.underline}. This combinatory works two ways: [either your
mind is erased and your body is another mind's vehicle; or your mind is
subordinated to the will of another power]{.underline}. 9 Either way,
**[your mind is not your own]{.underline}**. It feels like some vile
takeover. But what if [this isn't just a takeover, but **a whole new
class relation**]{.underline}? Let's start thinking through this curious
class relation by being very "orthodox." [Let's start with]{.underline}
the forces of production, the relations of production that correspond to
them, [the class antagonism generated out of those relations of
production, and the political and culture superstructures that
correspond to that base]{.underline}.10 [And]{.underline} let us also
try to [describe]{.underline}, just as Marx did, **[what may be emerging
rather than what is established.]{.underline}** [If one **starts with
what is established**, it is **easy to interpret any new
aspect**]{.underline} of the situation **[as]{.underline}** simply
[**variations** on the same essence]{.underline}. Starting with what may
be emerging provides a suitable derangement of the senses, a giddy hint
that all that was solid is melting into air. 11 The thought experiment
that might result is quite simple. Here's a sketch, to be elaborated
upon as we go: [There]{.underline} really [is something]{.underline}
qualitatively **[distinct]{.underline}** [about the forces of production
that **eat brains**, that **produce** and **instrumentalize and control
information**]{.underline}. This is because [information]{.underline}
really [does turn out to have **strange ontological
properties**]{.underline}. Making information a force of production
produces something of a conundrum within the commodity form.
[Information wants to be free but is]{.underline} everywhere [in
chains]{.underline}.12 [Information is]{.underline} no longer scarce, it
is [infinitely replicable]{.underline}, [cheap]{.underline} to store,
cheap to transmit, [and yet the]{.underline} whole [premise of the
commodity is its scarcity.]{.underline} [Information as a force of
production calls into being]{.underline} particular [relations of
production and is]{.underline} at the same time [formed by those
relations]{.underline}. In classic Marxist style, one can look here at
the evolution of legal forms.13 In the late twentieth century
"[i]{.underline}ntellectual [p]{.underline}roperty" [emerged
as]{.underline} almost [a]{.underline}n absolute [private property
right]{.underline}.14 One [that]{.underline} [makes the]{.underline}
once separate and local property forms of pat[ent, copyright, and
trademark equivalent and exchangeable]{.underline} forms of private
property. [These]{.underline} forms [need transnational legal
enforcement]{.underline}, precisely [because information is]{.underline}
such [a slippery and abstract thing]{.underline}.15 And so, like the
enclosures or the joint-stock company before it,
[i]{.underline}ntellectual [p]{.underline}roperty [law
becomes]{.underline} the form of [a new kind of relation of
production]{.underline}, [more abstract]{.underline} than its
predecessors, and one that makes not land or physical plant, but rather
[information itself, a form of private property.]{.underline} Like those
preceding forms of private property, [this]{.underline} one [crystalizes
into a class relation.]{.underline} As an absolute form of private
property, it creates **[classes of owners and nonowners of the means of
realizing its value]{.underline}**. [Land]{.underline} as private
property [gave]{.underline} rise to the two great classes of [farmer and
landlord]{.underline}. [Capital]{.underline} as private property
[gave]{.underline} rise to the two great classes of [worker and
capitalist]{.underline}. Is there **[a new class relation]{.underline}**
that [emerges **out of**]{.underline} the **[commodification of
information]{.underline}**? For this thought experiment, let's say it
[does]{.underline}. I call those classes **[the hacker class and the
vectoralist class]{.underline}**. **[The hacker class produces new
information]{.underline}**. But what is "new" information? It is
whatever intellectual property law recognizes as new. It's a strange
kind of production. Where the farmer grows crops through a seasonal
cycle and the worker stamps out repetitive units of commodities, [the
hacker has to use their time]{.underline} in a different way, [to turn
the same old information into new]{.underline}. Getting this done is not
like the seasonal repetitions of farming or the clocking-on of the
worker. [It]{.underline} [happens when it happens]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} time spent [napping or]{.underline} pulling
[all-nighters]{.underline}.16 The workplace nightmare of the worker is
having to make the same thing, over and over, against the pressure of
the clock; [the workplace nightmare of the hacker is to produce
different things]{.underline}, over and over, [against the pressure of
the clock]{.underline}. The characters of Peggy and Don in the TV series
Mad Men work as midcentury prototypes.17 It's the advertising business
during the golden years of Fordism.18 Don is a creative, struggling
within the agency with its owners to become an owner too. Peggy is a
secretary, a white collar worker, and her struggle is to become a
creative. Meanwhile, Joan is already at the top of the secretarial pool,
managing it, but wants to become an owner. As the show progresses, the
women make a little headway in this male business. By show's end, Black
women are just starting to get the secretarial jobs, but the computer
has arrived and will make some of them obsolete anyway. Like much of
bourgeois culture, it is a small business narrative, which compresses
the classes and blurs the lines between them. The prize of becoming
truly ruling class is always just out of reach. For our purposes, the
interesting part is its picture of the activities of one prototype of
the hacker class. The camera is fascinated by Don and Peggy actually
doing their jobs. Don takes long naps on his office sofa. Sometimes he
just wanders off. [The material for]{.underline} his [brilliant ad
campaigns come from]{.underline} all sorts of [incidental
sources]{.underline}. He drinks too much, tries smoking pot. The whole
office takes amphetamine shots and pulls an all-nighter, making
speed-induced creative work full of tremendous energy and really bad
decisions. Meanwhile Peggy manages [to transition from worker to
hacker]{.underline} because she actually knows something about how to
address the desires of women, but she [ends up limited and
stymied]{.underline} in all sorts of ways [by an industry that does not
know the value of her difference]{.underline}. The less popular series
Halt and Catch Fire shows us the early tech industry version of the same
set of activities, this same work that isn't quite regular work.19
[Hackers can't be managed]{.underline} like farmers or workers; they are
not the same as either class. [There's no relation between]{.underline}
the units of [labor time and the]{.underline} units of [value produced.
Something]{.underline} cooked up [on the spur of the moment might have
enormous value]{.underline}. Long hours of [slog might end
up]{.underline} being [for nothing]{.underline}. Being exempt from
routine work is not really all that glamorous in either story, as
[it]{.underline} just [brings uncertainty]{.underline}, [frustration,
pressure, and]{.underline} (for some) [madness]{.underline}.
[Both]{.underline} of these shows [hinge on the desire to]{.underline}
escape from the limits of the hacker class and [become
owners]{.underline}. That's the limit to the desire the culture industry
can admit for this class. And yet [both]{.underline} these
[shows]{.underline} portray [a continual treadmill of hope and
failure]{.underline}. Like the farmer and the worker, [the hacker does
not]{.underline} usually [end up owning the product]{.underline} of her
efforts. Unless you own a drug company or a tech company or media
conglomerate, [you have to sell the rights to what you
produce]{.underline}. It is not always the same as selling labor power.
You might still own the intellectual property, for example. But the
hacker rarely captures much of the value of what they create or invent.
Nobody else gets to be Google's Sergey Brin precisely because there is a
Sergey Brin, who is not the avatar of the hacker class, but of its
opposite--- [the vectoralist class]{.underline}. He is the real unicorn:
the hacker become owner. The one that [perpetuates the myth that drives
a million start-ups]{.underline} on the path to the same desire, not
realizing that it is the very thing that now blocks that desire. It is
highly unlikely that your start-up will be the next Google. At best, you
might sell it to Google or to some other avatar of the vectoralist
class. **[The vectoralist class owns and controls the
vector]{.underline}**, a concept I use to describe in the abstract
**[the infrastructure on which information is routed]{.underline}**,
whether through time or space.20 A vector in geometry is simply a line
of fixed length but of unfixed position. It's a way of thinking about a
technology as having something about it that shapes the world in a
particular way, but which can shape different aspects of the world. [You
can own]{.underline} stocks or flows of [information]{.underline}, [but
far better to own the]{.underline} vector, the legal and technical
[protocols for making]{.underline} otherwise [abundant information
scarce]{.underline}. If one takes a look at [the top]{.underline}
Fortune 500 [companies]{.underline}, it is surprising how many of them
[are]{.underline} really in the [information business]{.underline}. I
don't just mean the technology and telecommunication companies like
[Apple or Google or Verizon or Cisco or]{.underline} the [drug
companies]{.underline} like Pfizer. One could also think of the [big
banks as]{.underline} a subset of the vectoralist class rather than as
"[finance capital]{.underline}." They too [are in the information
asymmetry business]{.underline}. And as we learned in the 2008 crash,
even the [car companies]{.underline} are in the information
business---they [made more money from car loans than cars]{.underline}.
[The military--- industrial sector is]{.underline} also [in the
information business]{.underline}. The companies that appear to sell
actual things, like [Nike]{.underline}, [are really in the brand
business]{.underline}. [Walmart and Amazon compete with]{.underline}
different models of the [information logistics]{.underline} business.21
Even the [oil companies are in]{.underline} part at least [in the
information-about-the-geology-of-possible-oil-deposits
business]{.underline}. Perhaps **[the vectoralist class]{.underline}**
is no longer emerging. Maybe it **[is the new dominant
class]{.underline}**. One could make the case here that information was
always central to capitalism and that this is just capitalism. To some
extent, that may be the case. However, [to]{.underline} even think [that
capitalism is about information is]{.underline} a fairly recent
perspective. It ends up being a way of [retrospectively seeing
the]{.underline} whole [course]{.underline} of capitalism [in terms of
something that only emerged]{.underline} as a concept and an
instrumental reality [as one of its late products]{.underline}. The
other point to clarify here is that [there's a difference between
information as a force of production and]{.underline} information [as a
dominant force of production.]{.underline} **[The vectoralist
class]{.underline} [doesn't need to own the other forces of
production]{.underline}** any more. [Apple and Google don't]{.underline}
actually [make their own products]{.underline}. A sizable chunk of
[those they directly employ are]{.underline} not workers but
[hackers]{.underline}, people [who come up with new
information]{.underline}, whether of a technical or cultural kind[, to
be incorporated into products whose manufacture can be tendered out to a
subordinate class of capitalists.]{.underline} That might only be the
case in the overdeveloped world where I happen to live.22 Many of the
world's peoples are not even workers but still peasants who are being
turned into tenant farmers by the theft of their common land by a
landlord class. [Much of the world is also a giant
sweatshop]{.underline}. The resistance of [labor to capital is
alive]{.underline} and well in China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The
[older class antagonisms have not gone away]{.underline}. [It's
just]{.underline} that there's **[a new layer on top, trying to control
them]{.underline}**. Just as the capitalist class sought to dominate the
landlord class as a subordinate ruling class, so too **[the vectoralist
class]{.underline}** tries to [**subordinate both landlords and
capitalists** by controlling the patents, the brands, the trademarks,
the copyrights,]{.underline} but more importantly [the logistics of the
information vector]{.underline}. The vector has also worked its way
throughout the production process. This was already beginning in the
so-called Fordist era. Some proposed naming it instead after the great
Japanese companies that boomed in the mid to late twentieth century,
such as Toyota and Sony. They were the ones who figured out how to
extract not just labor but also information from the labor force. It
turns out that to extract not only efficiency but also quality from
industrial labor, it is best to incorporate the information held by
those who know the labor process best---its workers.23 That there is a
hacker class at all is in part because [workers have been stripped of
the information they possess about the labor process
itself]{.underline}. In Capital, [Marx]{.underline} mostly deals with an
ideal-type political economy with two classes. But in his political
writings it is clear that he [understands social formations as
hybrids]{.underline} of combined and overlapping modes of production.24
His writing on France isn't just a grand confrontation between
proletariat and bourgeoisie; the scene looms large with farmers,
landlords, and peasants. So here I'm simply taking my cue from the
political writings and thinking a matrix of six classes, three ruling
and three subordinate. **[The dominant classes are landlords,
capitalists, vectoralists. The subordinate classes are farmers, workers,
hackers]{.underline}**. [Now]{.underline} [imagine]{.underline} all
[the]{.underline} possibilities of [class alliance and conflict that
this generates]{.underline}. It turns out that [politics is]{.underline}
much less about the relation between the friend and the enemy, and much
more crucially [about relations among nonfriends and

of]{.underline} [convenience between heterogeneous class
interests]{.underline}. It's about [conflicts]{.underline} that can
[take many forms,]{.underline} only some of them open,
[many]{.underline} of them [discreet]{.underline}.

#### Stop talking about 'subversion' and 'revolution' -- that game's over. You're playing into capitalist realism -- the theological obsession with capital-as-eternal, that it must be negated or subsumed. The world's materiality is critical but so is the lens through which we view it, and that lens has been dirtied by submission and recreation of the same essence through modified modifiers. We must understand the world beyond capital, something worse, with a new approach and rhetoric. Old systems of thought and writing are stuck in the 19^th^ century

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 1: The Sublime Language of My
Century)//gideon

[One thing that the left and right]{.underline} [now seem to
agree]{.underline} on [is that the society in which we live
is]{.underline} called [capitalism]{.underline}.1 And strangely enough,
[both]{.underline} now [seem to agree that it is eternal]{.underline}.
[Even the left seems to think that there is an eternal essence to
Capital]{.underline} [and]{.underline} that [only its appearances
change]{.underline}. [The parade of changing appearances
yields]{.underline} a series of [modifiers]{.underline}: this could be
[necro]{.underline} capitalism, [communicative]{.underline} capitalism,
[cognitive]{.underline} capitalism, [platform]{.underline} capitalism,
[neoliberal]{.underline} capitalism, [or computational]{.underline}
capitalism.2 But short of an increasingly allegorical or messianic leap
into something other, it is as if [this]{.underline}
self-[same]{.underline} [thing]{.underline} just [went on
forever]{.underline}. I have a taste for the writerly tactics of
modernism, so whenever I come across a piece of language about which
there is such wide consensus I want to trouble it somehow. 3
[This]{.underline} capitalism that we have all agreed that we live in,
[has]{.underline} it not [become too]{.underline} familiar, too
[cozy]{.underline}, too roomy an idea? [Why are we so
devoted]{.underline} to its name? The reality the term tried to describe
is, of course, far from comfortable. [Capitalism is a world of
exploitation, domination, and oppression.]{.underline}
[Capitalism]{.underline}, if this is what this still is,
[appears]{.underline} to be [like a steam-hammer smashing]{.underline}
not only the social but also the natural conditions of its [existence to
pieces]{.underline}. But then maybe this is the thing to ask about. [Why
have we become so comfortable]{.underline} with a way of [describing an
uncomfortable reality]{.underline}? Do we want a certainty in language
that can't be had anywhere else? That the world we live in is capitalism
has become a familiar way of describing something that destroys what is
familiar. 4 [Capitalism atomizes and alienates]{.underline}. It renders
everything precarious---except its own hold on the imagination. If the
greatest trick of the devil was to persuade us that the devil does not
exist, then maybe [the **greatest trick of capitalism** is to gull us
into **imagining that there is nothing but eternal
capitalism**]{.underline}. It is hard to describe [things]{.underline}
that [change imperceptibly]{.underline}. 5 Some changes are like the
crack in the china cup that just appears one day. 6 [This
may]{.underline} well [be the]{.underline} level of
[language]{.underline} on which the problem rests. [Language has to
describe change using]{.underline} the [combinations]{.underline} and
permutations [of terms]{.underline} that language offers: **[the
combinatory]{.underline}**. [This combinatory]{.underline} of terms
always [has]{.underline} something of [a binary quality]{.underline}. 7
If this is not capitalism, well then it must be communism, the term that
negates it. [Since this is]{.underline} obviously [not
communism]{.underline}, then [it must]{.underline} still [be
capitalism]{.underline} after all. But what about when the change to be
described doesn't correspond well to the neat digital chop between one
term and another? Perhaps [it is as hard to describe
transitions]{.underline} between modes of production as it is to
describe changes in mood. There was once a language about transitions
between modes of production. There's an elaborate argument about how
feudalism became capitalism, about whether there might be multiple
routes toward capitalism, about whether there could be more than one
kind of socialism to come after. The debates about where capitalism came
from are fascinating but mostly of academic interest.8 The debates about
where it might go got caught up in Cold War discourse; with the demise
of the Soviet Union, they appear to be moot. [With the truncating of the
historical time line to]{.underline} [the chunk in the middle called
capitalism]{.underline}, [the **historical imagination finds itself
reduced**]{.underline} as well. That [language]{.underline} tends to
work this way [leaves us with a very odd situation]{.underline}. Now,
both the left and the right alike end up working within the same
language about this being capitalism. It was surely not Marx's intention
that the language he brought together to get critical leverage on his
times would become commonplace terms also used by our enemies. Among
other qualities as a writer, [Marx]{.underline} really [was one of the
great modern poets]{.underline}.9 He made modifications to the language
that have stuck. Of course he worked with the materials of the languages
he had at hand, but he wrought something lasting: a combinatory of
terms, a matrix of concepts, for describing History. 10 Like any great
poetic corpus, his work contains multitudes. But a few standard
permutations came to stick in the mind, like great pop songs, although
maybe with misremembered lyrics.11 Here I think is [his greatest
hit]{.underline}, his epic track, the one that has become something of
an earworm. Here's how it [goes]{.underline}: [this is
capitalism]{.underline}. It has an essence and it has appearances. [Its
appearances are false]{.underline}, a phantasmagoria of fetishes, in
which [commodities appear]{.underline} as if endowed [with]{.underline}
self-moving [spirit]{.underline}. Its real essence is defined by these
things: [the commodity form]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} its doublet
of [use]{.underline} value [and exchange value]{.underline}; by labor's
double form, [as concrete labor and abstract labor]{.underline}; by [the
extraction of surplus value]{.underline} in the production process, by
[the wage relation]{.underline}, by the rising [organic]{.underline}
composition of [capital]{.underline}, in which more and more of it is
made up of [dead labor]{.underline} rather than living labor, by [the
crisis]{.underline} caused of the tendency of the rate of [profit to
fall]{.underline}. And finally, [by negation]{.underline}.12 One could
debate endlessly whether this is what Marx really meant, but I think
that's a fair condensation of how many have heard him. It's a sort of
ur-version of [Marx]{.underline} that has [become]{.underline} something
of a refrain. Or even a [myth]{.underline}. [There are]{.underline}
actually [two main variants of the myth]{.underline} here [about
negation]{.underline}. [Either capitalism negates itself]{.underline},
brought to ruin [by its own contradictions. Or it is negated by a
subject]{.underline} that it produces as its own negation, [the working
class]{.underline}. In either variant, one thing is key: [until the
moment of negation]{.underline}, [capitalism can change its appearances
but never its essence]{.underline}. **[Its essence can only be negated
by contradiction or struggle]{.underline}**. Assorted variant tunes
spill out of this rhetorical frame, mutating like genres of techno
music. [There are]{.underline} other [ways to perform variations on
Marx's combinatory]{.underline} of terms. For instance, one can
[swap]{.underline} out the abstract verb [negation]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} replace it with [acceleration]{.underline}. This
approach was popular again in the early twentyfirst century, as it was
in the early twentieth century. 13 Here the idea is that there's nothing
that can negate capital, either in its own contradictions or in the
force it produces in and against itself. Rather, the best one can do is
[accelerate it to its end]{.underline}, toward a Promethean leap into
another mode of production.14 But note that this is not as much a change
in tune as its advocates like to imagine. [It leaves]{.underline} intact
[the mythic form of Capital as an essence]{.underline}. Yet [faith in
either the negation or acceleration of Capital has grown
faint]{.underline}. [The essence of Capital is
eternal]{.underline}---this is the striking feature of how it is now
imagined.15 Naturally, [those who]{.underline} love it [embrace
this]{.underline} thought. It needs merely to be perfected by our love.
This [is]{.underline} sometimes called (with a stunning lack of
imagination) [neoliberalism]{.underline}. But what is even stranger is
that [those who do not love it seem to agree]{.underline}.16 The essence
of Capital is eternal. [It goes on forever]{.underline}, and [everything
is an expression of its essence]{.underline}. Capital is the essence
expressed everywhere, and its expression is tending to become ever more
total. The other side of the eternal essence of Capital is its
ever-changing appearances. [Change is]{.underline} accounted for
[through]{.underline} the use of [modifiers]{.underline}. Its
appearances can even be periodized. [There was merchant capitalism, then
liberal capitalism, then monopoly capitalism, then neoliberal
capitalism]{.underline}. (Let's not even mention that other and more
problematic category, [the Asiatic mode of production]{.underline},
because that [was not supposed to have a history]{.underline}. 17)
There's some ambiguity as to what to call [the current
s]{.underline}tage, however. It [could be disaster, cognitive, semio,
neuro, late, biopolitical, neoliberal, or postfordist
capitalism]{.underline}, to name just a few options.18 Note that [the
last two are temporal modifications to a modifier: neoliberal,
postfordist]{.underline}. [Could there be any better tribute to the
**complete enervation of the imaginal faculty by capitalism**, or
whatever it is, that this is the best our poets can do?]{.underline}19
**[Modify the modifier]{.underline}**? Besides adding modified modifiers
to the sacred category of Capital, another variant is worth a mention,
one that works on different terms within the combinatory. This is a
[poetics]{.underline} that [opens a split]{.underline} within its
essential categories. Its [partisans tend to go]{.underline} a bit
[overboard with the binary difference]{.underline} between two terms
that emerges out of the split, although they have not been so bold as to
break too much with the essence of capitalism. Rather, it worked like
this: [there used to be material labor; now there is immaterial labor.
It's a different kind of labor]{.underline}. It's the opposite! [But
what this labor produces]{.underline}, [and is exploited by, is still
only a modified capitalism, a **cognitive capitalism**]{.underline}.20
It['s]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [material]{.underline} any more.
[Capitalism]{.underline} itself [is about ideas]{.underline}. It's
striking how much [one can get **carried away with the play of language
and forget to look at the world.**]{.underline} Somehow, **[I don't
think the tens of millions of industrial workers in China perceive their
work as immaterial]{.underline}**.21 [Nor does this]{.underline} strange
[immaterial labor of the overdeveloped world happen without an
**extensive technical apparatus**]{.underline}, indeed [a whole new
suite of forces of production, **a stack of vectors, an
infrastructure**]{.underline}---call it what you like. The task of this
little book is thus a provocation: to think the possibility that
[**capitalism has** already **been** **rendered historical**
but]{.underline} that [**the period that replaces it is
worse**.]{.underline} [That]{.underline} it could be worse [gets us away
from the happy narratives in which latter-day capitalism is the magic
kingdom]{.underline}, free from contradiction and class struggle, [where
History ends]{.underline}.22 Rather, in this thought experiment, I
propose to write [the present]{.underline} a[s]{.underline} including
**[a new kind of class conflict]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline}
**[new kinds of class,]{.underline}** arising out of recent mutations in
the forces and relations of production. By [putting this pressure
on]{.underline} our received ideas and **[legacy
language]{.underline}**, perhaps [we can]{.underline} begin to
[see]{.underline} the outlines of [the present afresh]{.underline},
**[estranged from our habits of thought]{.underline}**. There was once a
grand attempt to have done with at least part of this great epic-poetic
edifice. It started with questioning the idea of Capital as having an
essence and an appearance. [What if appearances were as real as the
essence]{.underline}? Before addressing that, let's add just a little
more nuance. [There were]{.underline} actually [two versions of the
essence--appearance structure]{.underline}. [One took]{.underline} [the
economic to be the essence]{.underline}, but in the sense of being the
base, [and everything else is built upon on it. This]{.underline} rather
[vulgar version is]{.underline} called **[economism]{.underline}**. [In
the other version]{.underline}, it's not the economic, but [the
commodity form]{.underline} that [is the essence]{.underline}, one that
has come into being in history and then become the essence of history,
which records its forms of appearance as a false totality or as
spectacle.23 Against this, Louis Althusser took the view that [the
economic base only determined everything else in the last instance. The
political and cultural superstructures were not mere appearances. They
have their own material form, but one whose function is the reproduction
of the essential economic form of capitalism]{.underline}.24 Whatever
its merits, [this]{.underline} version [was like catnip to academic
Marxists]{.underline} looking for ways to fit into conventional academic
disciplines, because [it allowed for]{.underline} three distinct objects
of study: [the economic, the political, and the ideological]{.underline}
(or cultural). [These]{.underline} conceptual [objects]{.underline}
conveniently [correspond to]{.underline} those of [existing academic
disciplines]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} things like [politics or
culture are]{.underline} relatively [autonomous superstructures of an
economic base]{.underline}, and if they have their own material form,
maybe [they]{.underline} even [have their own essence]{.underline}! It
did not take long for culture to have its own essential categories,
borrowed from linguistics: [the signifier and the signified were just
like exchange value and use value]{.underline}. [An abstract
essence]{.underline}! [A different one]{.underline}! So [one
could]{.underline} just [specialize in singing the song of
this]{.underline} (relatively) [autonomous world of essences and
appearances]{.underline}, [while]{.underline} still [gesturing to the
master narrative,]{.underline} that this is indeed and will remain
[capitalism]{.underline}.25 [If the economy has an essence]{.underline}
and appearances, and culture has an essence and appearances, then maybe
[politics does too]{.underline}. The wonderful thing about language is
that [if you seek it, you can find it.]{.underline} Yes, politics has an
essence too! It [is The Political]{.underline}, the great fundamental
drama of friend versus enemy, or maybe it's dissensus, or something.26
The main thing is that [we can sing the song of the essence and
appearances of politics, while]{.underline} still [gesturing to the
master narrative]{.underline}, that this is indeed and will remain
capitalism. I have to say that my inner modernist finds this all rather
banal. **[Is this the best we can do to speak the sublime language of
our century]{.underline}**?27 Why does it all seem the same, like pop
music? [Variations on themes]{.underline}, all [leading back to the same
old note]{.underline}, [that capital is eternal]{.underline}? [One day
(that never comes) there will be a messianic leap into something
else]{.underline}.28 It seems to me that [our **poetry of
capitalism**]{.underline}, or whatever this is, [shows]{.underline} all
the [signs of being a **culture industry**]{.underline}.
[Nowhere]{.underline} in these tunes [is]{.underline} there that
striking note of [nonequivalence or]{.underline} that moment of
[defamiliarization]{.underline} when the roof falls in.29 One has to
ask: what is the emotional attachment that we have to the idea that this
is capitalism and that it is eternal?30 It has to be said that the most
[vigorous attempts to tell a different story]{.underline}, to strike a
different tune, [were made in bad faith]{.underline}. There was a time
when it was a popular art form. While the Soviet Union claimed ownership
of the narrative of capitalism and its coming negation, you could make a
good living in the "free world" coming up with a different story. Not
surprisingly, it was former Marxists and socialists who wrote most of
those alternative epic poems that sprouted into whole worldviews. These
former Marxists would sing of the glories of the "managerial
revolution," of the "postindustrial society," of the conditions for
"take-off" and growth, of the "future shock" of technological
disruption. What these [epic narratives]{.underline} all had in common
was that they [**accepted the basic Marxist combinatory of terms** for
understanding History. They conceded its power, its poetry]{.underline}.
31 [But]{.underline} they [changed the ending]{.underline}. Rather than
negation, the story ends with Capital resolving its own contradictions.
It's a happy ending that Theodor Adorno would have called an extorted
reconciliation?32 This mytho-poetics had some currency during the Cold
War. But [with the]{.underline} [collapse of the]{.underline} supposedly
socialist world of the [Soviet Union]{.underline}, which claimed all
subsidiary rights to the great Marxist story, these [counternarratives
lost their force]{.underline}. One influential counterstory from the
twentieth century survives. The author who inspired it, Joseph
[Schumpeter]{.underline}, was not a socialist, although he briefly
worked for a socialist government.33 He probably [got it
from]{.underline} that original Marxist sellout, Werner
[Sombart]{.underline}. [In this play]{.underline} on the combinatory of
Marxist language, Ca[pital affirms itself continually by negating itself
continually]{.underline}. [It negates itself, and in an affirmative way,
as "creative destruction." It can "disrupt" itself]{.underline}! Indeed,
[its essence becomes its selfdisruption]{.underline}. And **[it is our
sacred duty never to get in its way]{.underline}**. [In our own times
this]{.underline} old [story was adapted into]{.underline} the belief
system of the so-called tech industry, as a part of what Richard
Barbrook calls **[the California Ideology]{.underline}**. 34 Into it can
be folded certain other variations, about **[the "fourth industrial
revolution]{.underline}**," for example.35 The conceit of all these
postcapitalist stories was that [this is not the]{.underline} same [old
capitalism---it's better!]{.underline} When people hear the beginnings
of a story about this no longer being capitalism, their resistance
generally rises. Unless you happen to be worth several million dollars,
the chances are you do not perceive this as something better than
capitalism or a capitalism that always improves on itself. Maybe it
would be interesting, aesthetically and politically, to take the other
fork of possible epic-poetic combinations of terms. Instead of the line
that this is not capitalism, it's better, what if we explored the line
that this is not capitalism, but worse? This meets a lot of resistance
too. This I can tell you from experience, having tried to write
variations on this text for fifteen years.36 [Nobody wants to leave the
certainty of the devil they know]{.underline}, or think they know, [for
something that promises to be worse.]{.underline} So the bad news is:
**[this is not capitalism anymore, it's something worse]{.underline}**.
And the good news is: **[Capital is not eternal, and even if this mode
of production is worse, it is not forever. There could be others. That's
the struggle today]{.underline}**. OK, so that's not particularly good
news. But [there is]{.underline} also [this]{.underline}: [an end to
left-melancholia]{.underline}, [that eternal sadness about eternal
capitalism]{.underline}.37 Interestingly, [few people will even attempt
to think Capital-is-dead even as a thought experiment.]{.underline}
[There]{.underline} really [is something fundamental to the myth that
this is capitalism, **as if Capital were the name of a
God**]{.underline}. It may even be the defining feature of ideology
today. Ideology today is not the acceptance of a neoliberal structure of
feeling or habits of thought and action.38 [Ideology today is clinging
to the belief that this is capitalism]{.underline}. To think [that we
live in an illusory world of capitalist realism]{.underline} still
[might concede too much]{.underline} reality [to the belief in eternal
Capital]{.underline}.39 I think **[it's time to be bold]{.underline}**.
Let's [reanimate Marx's infamous remark: "All I know is that I am not a
Marxist]{.underline}."40 What if we took that in the sense that he was
not one of those who simply took a language and a poetic form extracted
from his predecessors as a given? [He]{.underline} was, to the contrary,
the one who had [constructed]{.underline} that [language with
a]{.underline} quite [particular purpose]{.underline} in mind: [to
understand the situation of his times from the labor point of
view]{.underline}. So: what if we kept the commitment to understanding,
not his situation, but ours, from the labor point of view---whatever
that might mean now---and bracketed off the rest? That makes a certain
sense to me. [I really am puzzled by why we should use blocks of
linguistic material from his time to understand our time]{.underline}.
**[Why use Marx's]{.underline}** playful [modifications of
the]{.underline} fashionable philosophy, the [popular
science]{.underline}, the political tracts, [or the **technological
metaphors of the midnineteenth century**]{.underline}? [When
poets]{.underline} or novelists [inhabit old forms]{.underline} like
that, [we]{.underline} immediately [think it's dated or ironically
retro]{.underline}. But [somehow **we want our critical theory to still
be about eternal Capital, as if it were some subgenre of
steampunk**]{.underline}.41 Different genres of text have a different
relationship to tradition and innovation, and at different moments in
their development. They aren't always in synch. [There's]{.underline}
generally [a **culture industry** that **pulps**]{.underline} the more
[**innovative texts into sameness** and an avant-garde trying to escape
that sameness and do something else]{.underline}. If you are trying to
write an interesting (rather than merely successful) novel or poem, you
want to change things at the formal level, rather than ship your wine in
the same old bottles. The thing is, [where readings and rewritings of
Marx are concerned]{.underline}, [they seem to]{.underline} me to
[belong to the culture industry]{.underline}. [It's a
commonplace]{.underline} now [to read **Capital as a work of
philosophy**]{.underline} or even as a novel, but to do so **[with a
distinctly un-Marxist reverence]{.underline}**.42 Like everything else,
the transmission of the Marxian corpus through time is a matter of what
Raymond Williams called selective tradition.43 [Most textology of Marx
deploys]{.underline} conventional protocols of [quotation, exegesis, and
interpretation]{.underline}.44 In these habitual readings, [selections
from the **canonic texts are made to yield an underlying meaning that
subtends them**.]{.underline} The texts count as evidence that
represents an underlying essence. Where Capital is thought as an essence
that produces appearances that are false, [the **Marx-corpus is read as
an appearance that is true to an essence**]{.underline} ---most of the
time. Marx's texts can be discreetly corrected to correspond to their
true essence. (Writing this sort of Marx fan-fiction gives our
conservative textologists enough of a thrill of originality). This
essence is the veracity against which the false appearances of the world
are then held to account. Alternatively, rather than read the
Marx-corpus through the interpretive filter of a Marx essence, [Marx
texts can be read through the interpretive filter of someone else's
text]{.underline}. This yields all of the supplemental Marxisms: Marx
read [through structuralism]{.underline}, [psychoanalysis,
deconstruction, and so on]{.underline}.45 Rather than a Marx-corpus read
in terms of its fidelity to a Marxessence that it resembles, [this
procedure]{.underline} is a bit different. It [yields a Marx who says
something other than what he probably thought he meant to
say]{.underline}. [There's still a "real" Marx, to be interpreted, but
it may be at variance with the surface of the text.]{.underline}
Capitalism can then be read in terms of what this other Marx meant, and
the surface effects of Marx that don't conform to it are themselves
residues of Capital itself. Pursued to its limit, this method tends to
become post-Marxist, when Marx himself appears to be more symptom than
diagnosis.46 One ends up saying, with Foucault: "[Marxism exists in the
nineteenth century like a fish in water: that is, unable to breathe
anywhere else]{.underline}."47 The paradox here is that because the
reading protocols operating in the selective tradition of Marxism are
rather conservative, [Marx ends up snagged on the language of his
times]{.underline}. His combinatory is not really opened up to play
freely in our times.

#### Ideology is a myth -- information infrastructure caused change, not an idea -- reject their historical idealism

[The **myth of neoliberalism** is that **the idea**]{.underline} of
neoliberalism **[came first]{.underline}**, [and then]{.underline}
**[politicians]{.underline}** like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan
[**made it policy** and then law.]{.underline} [This narrative
is]{.underline} sometimes popular among leftists despite its clearly
**[idealist]{.underline}** view of history. 48 I think it's possible to
tell the story another way. After all, [what made it possible to
implement neoliberal policies]{.underline} in the first place? [What
changed]{.underline} since the seventies that made it possible [to
**globalize banking** and build vast **international supply chains** to
combine components of a manufacturing process from all over the
world]{.underline}? The clue is already there in the stray fact that
Microsoft came into existence in the mid-seventies. [It was not
information as an idea]{.underline} ---free markets---[that changed the
mode of production]{.underline}. [It was **a vast, global infrastructure
in which information enabled the control of flows of money, machines,
resources, and labor.**]{.underline} [If you can use a **computer to**
calculate the positions of ten thousand atoms in a protein, you
can]{.underline} use it to **[calculate a global production system that
routes]{.underline}** around [**the power of**]{.underline} militant

time machine that will take you back to the seventies. Or rather, we
have only a one-way time machine, or perhaps not a time machine so much
as a tome machine. [You can **look in the archive** for some neglected
storylines]{.underline}, and the past comes back as something else.
Maybe something even more amazing than the surprises you could spring on
people in the past if you had a time machine are the surprises the past
can spring on us through the tome machine of the archive. [Maybe we
could practice a]{.underline} kind of [historical art]{.underline}, of
telling the stories otherwise, as a way of inquiring into why certain
kinds of story are neglected or suppressed. [The default
stories]{.underline} selected from the combinatory of story elements
[may be **arbitrary narrative habits**]{.underline}. [Here's a
story]{.underline}, then: **[It is an error to call our times neoliberal
when its politics are not "neo" and its politics are not
"liberal,"]{.underline}** anyway. [The politics of the present
might]{.underline} just as well [be described]{.underline} with the
equally retro term **[alt-fascist]{.underline}**.50 [It is]{.underline}
all [about]{.underline} **[securing ruling class power]{.underline}**
[through the manipulation o]{.underline}f [**racial and ethnic
prejudice** and the use of **surveillance** and **overt violence** to

**farcical double of the superstructures of old**]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} rather **[the mode of production underneath

### AT: Tech Always Good / Bad

#### The form of technology is capital -- it is the dead labor of our time. There is no inherent normative being to technology; only its use for and by capital is wrong

**Wark 19** (McKenzie Wark, Activist, Writer, PhD in Communications,
Professor at the New School for Social Research and Eugene Lang College,

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 3: The Forces of Production)//gideon

[The first and last question]{.underline} that usually comes up [about
technology is whether it is]{.underline} a [good or a bad]{.underline}
thing. This can apply both to particular technologies and to technology
in general. [Marx can]{.underline} readily [be]{.underline} [recruited
to either side]{.underline} of this argument, either through quoting
selectively, picking the Marx of a particular period, or extracting a
particular perspective out of his work at the expense of the dialectical
and poetical play at work in his corpus. Marx has a lot of uses on the
technology question. He is an allpurpose tool. Marx might also offer
"tools" for thinking a bit more critically about technology. Do we have
to subject technology to a moral decision only, as good or bad? How does
this technology appear as a thing apart that one could contemplate and
judge? From what kind of genteel point of view does it seem something
separate? What range of things are we thinking of as technical, anyway?
Starting from the last of those questions[, it is important to situate
Marx in his own times.]{.underline} [What we now think of]{.underline}
as [technology was for Marx]{.underline} [more a question of **the
machine**]{.underline}. [His was an era of steam]{.underline}, which
powered factories, railways, shipping, and the printing presses of the
newspapers for which he wrote.1 It was an era of telegraphy, but
[before]{.underline} the wide distribution of [electric power,
or]{.underline} the rise of [modern chemistry, particle physics,
genetics, climate science, or information science]{.underline}. Marx did
his best to keep up with the scientific and technical developments of
his time, but that was more Engels's job. [Marx's]{.underline} knowledge
of how the physical world works, and hence his [materialism, stops short
at a certain historical threshold]{.underline}.2 Nevertheless, Marx
makes important steps toward thinking technology as a set of things that
can be grasped with a concept. Particularly in the Grundrisse[, he
starts to write about **technology beyond the moral decision of whether
it is good or bad**]{.underline}.3 He starts to write of it as [having a
**range of possibilities**]{.underline}, as something that has, as one
might say in a more modern idiom, "[affordances]{.underline}."
Consistent with the rest of his thinking, [Marx comes to understand
technology **not as having an essence**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
as something [emerging out of]{.underline} particular [historical
circumstances.]{.underline} This gave him a way to think beyond the
curious way that [technology appears as something separate]{.underline}.
Technology is [intimately connected]{.underline} on the one hand [to the
human and]{.underline} on the other to the [nonhuman]{.underline}.
Indeed, [technology may be **the inhuman zone**]{.underline} [where
distinctions between]{.underline} the [human and]{.underline} the
[nonhuman]{.underline}, not to mention anxieties about their
permeability, [originate]{.underline}. Among other things, technology
mediates senses of the human to the human. To take up just the first of
these connections for now: Marx could see technology as connected to the
human in a double way. To put it simply: **[the content of technology is
labor; the form of technology is capital]{.underline}**. It is **[living
labor]{.underline}** that [**makes** **technology**]{.underline};
**[technology is congealed dead labor]{.underline}**---pink goo
---[that]{.underline} then **[returns to confront the worker in the form
of capital]{.underline}**. The form of [technology]{.underline} is
capital, in that it [is shaped by]{.underline} the objective of
[**extracting value** from labor (and from nature) **as** **efficiently
as possible.** As]{.underline} particular [capitalist firms
compete]{.underline} with each other, [they reach for labor-saving
devices to increase output and drive down costs]{.underline},
**[replacing living labor with dead labor]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} in the long run [putting a squeeze on
profits]{.underline}, [as surplus value is extracted]{.underline} from
exploiting [human labor alone]{.underline}. The form of technology is
capital in a second sense, too. [Not all decisions that capital
makes]{.underline} about technical change in the workplace
[are]{.underline}, strictly speaking, [economic]{.underline}. [Capital
may also implement technical change that takes power away from the
worker]{.underline} at the point of production.4
[Technology]{.underline} is not a separate thing, then. It [is intimate
to the human]{.underline}, in a bifurcated way: **[capital in form is
capital; in content, it is labor]{.underline}**. **[Labor makes the
machine, but not in the design of its own choosing]{.underline}**. There
is a parallel connection, on the other side, to the nonhuman, to nature.
[Technology is made of, and remakes, nature itself]{.underline}.
[Technology's content is]{.underline} sensuous
[materiality]{.underline}, iron and coal and so forth, [mixed with
labor]{.underline}; [its form is]{.underline} once again [the form of
capital]{.underline}. Rimbaud: "**[If the brass awakens as a horn, it's
not to blame]{.underline}**."5

#### The internet's a liberating tool but was coopted by the California ideology to create the new ruling class in the '90s. The 'hero' of the entrepreneur hides a history of oppression and violence. Whether technology is good or bad cannot be found without first resolving class conflicts

\"Capital is dead\", Chapter 3: The Forces of Production)//gideon

[The Internet came out of the university and took capital by
surprise]{.underline}. While many a scholar was writing genteel Marxist
theory in the humanities, in information science [a whole new mode of
production was germinating]{.underline}. It had already transformed much
of the sciences. By the nineties [there was enough cheap
technology]{.underline} around [to]{.underline} take a punk approach and
[develop new theories and practices]{.underline} with and about it. I'll
mention just two examples, starting with Dmytri Kleiner's détourned
text, the Telekommunist Manifesto.36 Kleiner's starting point is the
transformation of the forces of production and the pressure this put on
the relations of production. [**Cheap computation plus the Internet**
vector was supposed to **make capitalism more efficient** and enable
capital to **route around the power of workers** at the point of
production]{.underline}. It did all that, but [it also opened the
prospect of **self-organized peer-to-peer production**]{.underline}.37
[There]{.underline} really [could have been a
**telecommunism**]{.underline} ("tele" = "at a distance"). [Autonomous
producers could cheaply and easily communicate and
coordinate]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} was a possibility that [had
to be foreclosed to enable]{.underline} a new kind of capture of the
surplus by the rising ruling class that I call [the vectoralist
class]{.underline}. On the technical level, [what developed in place of
a peer-to-peer network]{.underline} [was a **client--server
network**]{.underline}, built around privately owned hubs--- what
Benjamin Bratton calls stacks.38 Meanwhile, [states]{.underline} engaged
each other in trade agreements, which [produced transnational regimes of
intellectual property]{.underline} designed [to **secure surplus
information** within novel forms of private property]{.underline}. The
free creation of [information would be]{.underline} alternately policed
and encouraged: [policed where it infringed on corporate
monopolies]{.underline}; [encouraged where free labor]{.underline} or
[nonlabor could be captured as information that had value]{.underline}.
We now have the information commons as a form of disintegrated
spectacle, owned by the vectoralist class. [What Kleiner advocates as a
counterstrategy is]{.underline} what he calls **[venture
communism]{.underline}**: "Politics is not a battle of ideas it is a
battle of capacities."39 [The hacker class has to **create its own
autonomous forms**]{.underline}. "A specter is haunting the net, the
specter of communism." 40 Like Kleiner, Richard Barbrook (and his
collaborator, the late Andy Cameron) emerged out of the intersection of
media activism and practice and produced illuminating détournements of
Marxist texts as a way to grasp the nineties situation. [Barbrook took
the point of]{.underline} view of what he called [digital artisans
against the rise of the virtual class]{.underline}.41 What was
particularly useful in these polemical texts was the identification of
[the California Ideology as the worldview of this emerging ruling
class]{.underline}, one whose success is to be measured by the sad fact
that [even critics of "bad technology" take it for gospel.]{.underline}
The California Ideology emerged out of seemingly progressive movements
of the counterculture in California in the mid to late twentieth
century. 42 Once again, repression played a role. [Black
militants]{.underline} of this period [were **systematically murdered or
imprisoned**]{.underline}.43 To give just one example, [**Angela Davis**
survived a criminal trial and was fired from her teaching
job]{.underline}. Shorn of its more radical edge, [the counterculture
became]{.underline} merely [cultural]{.underline}, and [its anti-state
posture made]{.underline} its [peace with free market libertarian
enthusiasms]{.underline}. Like the worldviews of capital under
feudalism, [the California Ideology promised a **universal
liberation**]{.underline}, [which turned out]{.underline} on its
ascendency [to be]{.underline} just [that of a **new ruling
class**]{.underline}. Drawing on the historical vision of the lapsed
socialist Alvin Toffler, the California Ideology proposed a world in
which technology itself was the sole transformative force of history. 44
[The hero]{.underline} of this epical-poetical myth [was the
entrepreneur]{.underline}, who single-handedly [battles against labor,
state, and culture to unleash the supposedly "natural" force of
technology.]{.underline} Once unbound, [technology will show itself to
be]{.underline} inherently [the vehicle of free markets]{.underline} and
a return to Jeffersonian democracy. 45 [Hence]{.underline}, technology
is [good in essence]{.underline}. Barbrook follows Marx in seeking out
the internal contradictions in this emerging ruling class ideology. He
notes [the irony of the retro-futurist celebration of]{.underline}
Thomas [Jefferson]{.underline} as the patron saint of yeoman democracy
that [fails to mention that he was a slaveholder]{.underline}. 46
Unfortunately, many of the tech-pundits of today lack Barbrook's wit and
historical acumen, and they take much of the California Ideology for
granted. The result is a sort of conspiracy theory, in which the public
was allegedly duped by a cabal of "Silicon Valley" entrepreneurs. [To
mask their intention to unleash]{.underline} powerful tools of [monopoly
and political control, they lulled everyone into thinking technology was
in essence good when it is in essence bad.]{.underline} As Barbrook
points out, the development of the forces of production is not magically
called into being from the brains of business geniuses. In the case of
Silicon Valley, [it took a massive amount of state funding, passing
through university research labs]{.underline}.47 It may at one point
have been quite possible that [these developments could have led to a
**digital agora**]{.underline} or commons as well as (or as an
alternative to) new forms of class power based on information
asymmetries and the surveillance state. [What gets erased in **both
moral fables** about technology]{.underline}, the one where its essence
is good and the one where its essence is bad, [is the **struggle over
the form**]{.underline} the technologies **[of Internet]{.underline}**
would take. [Both]{.underline} Barbrook and Kleiner [get critical
purchase through a détour-nement of]{.underline} classic [Marx texts,
erasing]{.underline} [terms]{.underline} that spoke to the past,
[replacing them with a language saturated in the emerging class
struggles]{.underline} of the times. Interestingly, [both deployed the
modifier]{.underline}, but they added it not to Capital [but to their
concepts of what might come into being]{.underline} within and against
it [to negate it]{.underline}: Kleiner's [tele]{.underline}kommunism
[and]{.underline} Barbrook's [cyber]{.underline}communism. [I read
this]{.underline} now [as a useful transitional tactic for working in
and against the combinatory of terms inherited from former historical
conflicts]{.underline}, on its way to a theory of the present situation,
[wherein]{.underline} the development of the [forces]{.underline} of
production [might start to escape]{.underline} the porous bounds of [the
relations of production through unanticipated cracks]{.underline}. [In
the nineties it still seemed possible to shape a different future for
the Internet]{.underline}, and there were many struggles around its
emerging form: technical, political, legal, and cultural. [We won some
battles; we lost the war]{.underline}. Like the progressive wing of the
Social Relations of Science, [this was]{.underline} in the end [a
defeated movement]{.underline}. But [that is no reason to pretend it
didn't exist]{.underline}. Rather, [there's work to be done
to]{.underline} narrate and [analyze the struggles of that
time]{.underline} and those that continue as relatively novel
expressions of what kinds of worlds are possible in and against the
forces of production of these times.48 [Marx saw capitalism]{.underline}
as evidence in the negative [that the problem of material scarcity was
potentially solvable]{.underline}. [We now see]{.underline} that
**[information scarcity is]{.underline}** in principle **[solved
already]{.underline}**. In both cases, [we get critical
leverage]{.underline}, in the first case, on the persistence on
exploitation; in the second, [on the **persistence of disinformation,
noise, and information asymmetry**]{.underline}. Once again, **[the
means are at hand to solve these problems]{.underline}**, [but
the]{.underline} [**class nature** of]{.underline} the [existing
**relations of production** are a **fetter** on the forces of
production]{.underline}. Only [it is]{.underline} [not just the
capitalist class that is a fetter]{.underline} on development this
time---[it is the vectoralist class]{.underline} as well. But [to think
of that as a problem means]{.underline} not only to pay attention to the
forces of production, it is [to]{.underline} [look]{.underline} again
[at the class relations]{.underline} they both generate and are
structured within. **[What is good or bad about technology is the
outcome of class conflict over its form and between more than two
classes.]{.underline}**

### IP Law

historian, former professor of economics at California State University,

Property\", 1/1/2003, https://monthlyreview.org/2003/01/01/the-political-economy-of-intellectual-property/, accessed

The dramatic [**expansion of intellectual property rights** represents a
**new stage in commodification**]{.underline} [that threatens to make
virtually **everything bad about capitalism even worse**]{.underline}.
Stronger **[intellectual property rights will reinforce class
differences, undermine science and technology, speed up the
corporatization of the university, inundate society in legal disputes,
and reduce personal freedoms.]{.underline}** We have no precise measure
of the extent of intellectual property, but a rough calculation by
Marjorie Kelly suggests the magnitude of intellectual property rights.
At the end of 1995, [the book value of the]{.underline} Standard and
Poor ([S&P]{.underline}) index of [500]{.underline} companies accounted
for only 26 percent of market value. [**Intangible assets** were **worth
three times the value of tangible assets**]{.underline}.1 Of course, not
all intangible assets are intellectual property rights, but a
substantial proportion certainly is. While the [legal protection of
intellectual property]{.underline} might [seem]{.underline} [inseparable
from]{.underline} contemporary global [capitalism]{.underline}, until
fairly recently capitalists were equivocal about such things. [During
the]{.underline} first six decades of the [nineteenth century,
corporations]{.underline} in the United States [were not inclined to
respect]{.underline} such [intellectual property rights]{.underline}.
For example, they often paid as little as possible, or nothing at all,
to inventors. In addition, [the United States did not]{.underline} even
[recognize international copyrights]{.underline}. The
[free-marketeers]{.underline} of the nineteenth century vigorously
[opposed intellectual property rights as feudalistic
monopolies]{.underline}. Their view of intellectual property rights
mostly dominated political economic opinion in the United States until
the massive depression of 1870s weakened faith in market forces. In the
context of the economic crisis, business was desperate for anything that
would return profits to what they considered to be an acceptable level.
At first, [business owners tried forming cartels and trusts to hobble
competitive forces]{.underline}. In response to vigorous protests,
[Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act]{.underline}. However,
[corporations were able to use **patents**]{.underline}, which were
perfectly legal, [as a convenient **loophole**]{.underline} to evade the
intent of that law. Through patent pools, they could divide up the
market and exclude new competitors. In this way, intellectual property
rights were important in establishing monopoly capitalism. The
strengthening of intellectual property rights accelerated once again as
the bloom wore off the post-Second World War "Golden Age" and the United
States' export surplus disappeared. Behind closed doors, corporate
leaders successfully lobbied the government to strengthen intellectual
property rights that would give advantages to their industries. Just as
in the late nineteenth century, business saw property rights as a means
of increasing profits when economic conditions began to sour. The public
never had a clue about the extent to which the government had given away
important rights. [Today, **intellectual property rights** claims go
**far beyond patent protection** for useful inventions and copyrights
for new music.]{.underline} Some [claims are]{.underline} so
**[outlandish]{.underline}** that they would be humorous if the courts
did not take them so seriously. For example, [lawyers are]{.underline}
now [suggesting]{.underline} that **[athletes should patent the way they
shoot a basket]{.underline}** or catch a pass.2 The American Society of
Composers, Authors, and Publishers ([ASCAP]{.underline}), ever on the
lookout for more royalties, [was about to]{.underline}
**[sue]{.underline}** the **[Girl Scouts for singing "Row, Row, Row Your
Boat]{.underline}**" and other songs **[around campfires]{.underline}**
until adverse publicity caused it to relent.3 On the same day that the
Girl Scout article appeared, a Wall Street Journal article reported that
[the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[B]{.underline}**asketball **[A]{.underline}**ssociation was engaged
in a **[suit against]{.underline}** America Online over the
**[transmission of game scores]{.underline}** and statistics from NBA
games in progress.4 In another case, **[someone]{.underline}**, in all
seriousness, **[patented]{.underline}** the correct way of **[lifting a
box]{.underline}**.5 In one remarkable case, a patient found that his
**[doctor]{.underline}** had **[patented genetic material from the
patient's]{.underline}** own **[body without informing
him]{.underline}**. The patient sued for compensation, but the **[courts
upheld the doctor's rights to the intellectual property encoded in the
patient's genes]{.underline}**.6 Absurd claims to informational property
rights have been expanding by leaps and bounds. [People
have]{.underline} successfully convinced the Patent and Trademark Office
to [grant property rights]{.underline} for everything from
**[colors]{.underline}** [to a]{.underline} specific
**[number]{.underline}**.7 [The Patent and Trademark Office]{.underline}
even [registered the]{.underline} "**[frowny" emoticon]{.underline}**
[as a trademark of Despair.com]{.underline}. Ralph Lauren won a victory
in an appeals court in 2000, when his lawyers forced a magazine, begun
in 1975 as the official publication of the U.S. Polo Association, to
change its name because [Lauren claimed **the word "Polo" as
intellectual property**]{.underline}.8 In a similar case, when educators
at the Australian Institute of Management listed a twenty-year-old
course, "Effective Negotiation Skills," on the organization's Web site,
a United States training group, Karrass, told the institute to take the
course description off the site because [Karrass has a U.S. trademark
over the expression]{.underline}s "**[effective
negotiating]{.underline}**," "advanced effective negotiating," and
"effective sales negotiating."9 One critic of the patent system even
succeeded in winning a patent for Kirchoff's law, a scientific principle
first developed in 1845, proving that the electric current flowing into
a function equals the current flowing out.10 If an individual critic of
the patent system is able to manipulate the Patent and Trademark Office
into registering such ridiculous claims, think of how much
profit-maximizing corporations, with enormous resources available for
research and legal expenses, are able to stake out as private property.
To illustrate this point, Richard Stallman, winner of a MacArthur
"genius" award, challenged Bruce Lehman, then head of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office, at a contentious meeting. Stallman produced a
voluminous, unwieldy printout of a computer program he had written
earlier with several colleagues. He explained that the program was
currently in use on more than a million computers, including those of
the U.S. Air Force and major companies, such as Intel and Motorola.
"Just a few lines of code can be enough to infringe a patent, and this
compiler has ten thousand pages," Stallman said, gesturing to the
document. "How many patents does it infringe? I don't know. Nobody does.
Perhaps you can read the code and tell me?" he challenged Mr. Lehman.11
[Intellectual property rights **change the nature of
competition**]{.underline}. Most industries that do not enjoy the
protection of intellectual property rights find themselves involved in
intense competition, which lowers their profits. In contrast,
[companies]{.underline} with intellectual property rights [face
**limited competition**]{.underline} and can enjoy elevated profits. For
example, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan recently told
Congress: "Indeed, a striking feature of the current cyclical episode
relative to many earlier ones has been the virtual absence of pricing
power across much of American business, as increasing globalization and
deregulation have enhanced competition. In this low-inflation
environment, firms have perceived very little ability to pass cost
increases on to customers."12 Let us decode the Chairman's words.
[For]{.underline} agricultural products, steel, and other
[commodity-like goods]{.underline} with no intellectual property
protection, [competitive forces put powerful pressure on
profits]{.underline}. If the entire economy were like those industries,
a severe crisis would engulf it. In particular, those industries that
depended on intellectual property would tend to be especially
vulnerable. [Reproduction costs for software, pharmaceuticals, or movies
are trivial]{.underline}. In the language of economics, marginal costs
are small and fixed costs are high. [Without]{.underline} the legal
protection of [intellectual property]{.underline} rights, strong
[competition]{.underline} in such industries [would mean]{.underline}
certain [bankruptcy]{.underline}. Consequently,
**[monopoly]{.underline}** in these sectors **[is
essential]{.underline}**, and [**monopoly** is **made possible by
intellectual property rights protection**]{.underline}. A few years
earlier, Greenspan was emphasizing a different part of the economy,
breathlessly rhapsodizing about a weightless economy: The world of 1948
was vastly different from the world of 1996. The American economy, more
then than now, was viewed as the ultimate in technology and productivity
in virtually all fields of economic endeavor. The quintessential model
of industrial might in those days was the array of vast, smoke-encased
integrated steel mills in the Pittsburgh district and on the shores of
Lake Michigan. Output was things, big physical things. Virtually
unimaginable a half-century ago was the extent to which concepts and
ideas would substitute for physical resources and human brawn in the
production of goods and services. In 1948 radios were still being
powered by vacuum tubes. Today, transistors deliver far higher quality
with a mere fraction of the bulk. Fiber-optics has \[sic\] replaced huge
tonnages of copper wire, and advances in architectural and engineering
design have made possible the construction of buildings with much
greater floor space but significantly less physical material than the
buildings erected just after World War II. Accordingly, while the weight
of current economic output is probably only modestly higher than it was
a half-century ago, value added, adjusted for price change, has risen
well over threefold.13 Over and above the obvious exaggeration,
Greenspan's words here appeal to the marvels of high technology. But the
so-called weightless economy has more to do with the legislated powers
of intellectual property that the government granted to powerful
corporations.14 For example, companies such as Nike, Microsoft, and
Pfizer sell stuff that has high value relative to its weight only
because their intellectual property rights insulate them from
competition. In his more recent testimony, Greenspan noted, however, "a
firm is inherently fragile if its value-added emanates more from
conceptual as distinct from physical assets."15 This possibility would
be even more terrifying to holders of intellectual property was it not
for the powerful protection that the state provides. Not a day goes by
when some legislature or some courtroom fails to grant new powers to
holders of intellectual property. Intellectual property rights are in
the process of corrupting society in a number of ways. First of all,
[intellectual property rights will **reinforce class
differences**]{.underline}. Worldwide, the rich have become richer to an
unimaginable extent in recent years. The members of the "Forbes 400," a
compilation of the 400 richest people in the United States, have a
combined net worth of \$1 trillion-greater than the gross domestic
product of China.16 Between 1995 and 1998, the average annual income for
a member of this elite group rose from \$50 million to a staggering
\$110 million. The obscene wealth of a Bill Gates of Microsoft, a Phil
Knight of Nike, and all of the other instant Internet billionaires,
alongside the sizable residue of poverty that blights the contemporary
United States, reminds us of the link between the distribution of income
and intellectual property. Emblematic of the extent of this new
distribution of property, in 1999 outside of those who have inherited
their wealth, three of the four richest people in the world, according
to a Forbes magazine survey, owed their wealth to Microsoft, one of the
major holders of intellectual property rights, befitting the so-called
New Economy in which "DOS Capital" has supplanted Das Kapital.17 Perhaps
the famous trickle down effect could justify the obscene maldistribution
of wealth if intellectual property rights actually improved
productivity. In fact, intellectual property rights are terribly
destructive of productivity on many counts. First of all, intellectual
property rights undermine the very science and technology that they are
supposed to promote. Intellectual property rights are to science what
tollbooths are to highway traffic. Both create bottlenecks and impede
forward progress, but in the case of intellectual property rights,
innumerable disputes arise about who gets to collect the tolls and how
much the tolls should be. To the extent that the present system of
intellectual property rights constricts the flow of new technologies, it
imposes another incalculable cost on society. For example, virtually no
new technology is the product of a single person or even a single
corporation. Ideas and discoveries, what Marx called "universal labor,"
draw upon a multitude of sources. Sorting out who deserves legitimate
credit for any technology is impossible. Just consider the complexity of
a large software system with 100,000 components. It can use hundreds of
previously patented techniques. Because each patent search costs about a
thousand dollars, searching for all the possible patent potholes in the
program could easily run well over \$1 million, and that far exceeds the
cost of writing the program.18 [Intellectual property rights spawn a
system of wasteful litigation]{.underline}. Already, by the early 1990s,
[Intel's annual litigation budget alone was believed to be at least
\$100 million]{.underline}. No doubt it has grown significantly since
then. [Intellectual property]{.underline} rights also [create an
atmosphere of **secrecy**]{.underline}, [which is **inimical to
scientific progress**]{.underline}. Finally, the quest for [intellectual
property rights is speeding up the **corporatization of the**
university]{.underline}. [Universities]{.underline} now routinely
[**sell to corporations** the rights to the patents developed in
university laboratories, often at public expense.]{.underline} While
energy sources are the central to maintaining life itself, let alone the
capitalist mode of production, [intellectual property rights are now
every bit as important in maintaining the international financial
balances of the U.S. economy]{.underline}. Domestic access to oil will
remain important, of course, so long as the comfortable classes continue
to ride in their SUVs and heat and cool their mega-mansions, but the
energy requirements for the domestic production of material goods
becomes increasingly less important as production moves to low-wage
peripheral areas of the world. Intellectual property rights have become
the financial counterweight to deindustrialization, because the revenues
that they generate help to balance the massive imports of material
goods. Unfortunately, this means of payment still remains woefully
insufficient to reimburse the rest of the world for the imports to
United States. The strengthening of [intellectual property rights is
perhaps the **most pressing U.S. foreign policy objective** today,
possibly even **more so than oil**]{.underline}**.** The government's
efforts go well beyond shoring up the legal rights of holders of this
kind of intellectual property. The full weight of its power is brought
to bear against all evildoers who would dare to create knock offs of a
Disney cartoon or a Nike "swoosh." In the words of Thomas Friedman,
perhaps the most enthusiastic proponent of globalization at the New York
Times: [The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden
fist---McDonald's cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas, the
designer of the F-15. And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for
Silicon Valley's technologies is called the United States Army, Air
Force, Navy and Marine Corps....Without America on duty, there will be
no America Online.19]{.underline} Lest the skeptical reader dismiss
Friedman's clever phrasing as nothing more than a rhetorical flourish,
consider the words of William Cohen, the secretary of defense in the
Clinton administration. In February 1999, upon his arrival in
Seattle---a city that a few months later became a symbol of resistance
to the policies that he was sent to advocate---to speak to the employees
of Microsoft, the secretary told reporters, "I will point out that the
prosperity that [companies like Microsoft now enjoy could not occur
without having the strong military that we have]{.underline}."20
Friedman and Cohen have expressed what is probably the central thrust of
the foreign policy of the government of the United States. Guarding the
property rights of typical material commodities is relatively simple.
Because most commodities are assembled in stores or warehouses, the
owners merely have to watch over the commodities in question to ensure
that unauthorized people do not take possession of them. In the case of
intellectual property, the materiality of the good is irrelevant. A song
or a program can be downloaded virtually everywhere by anybody. As a
result, [protecting intellectual property requires **control over people
rather than things**]{.underline}. Consequently, [the protection of
intellectual property is necessarily **more intrusive** than for
material commodities. Purveyors]{.underline} of intellectual property
[implore the government]{.underline}, often with success[, to mandate
modifications]{.underline} [that limit]{.underline} the capacity of
[modern technologies to violate intellectual property
rights]{.underline}---even if they cause inconvenience to the consumers
whom capitalism is supposed to serve. A frightening, albeit ridiculous,
example of this invasiveness came from a Canadian case in which [**a
farmer was accused of "stealing" Monsanto's intellectual property** **by
planting genetically engineered seeds**]{.underline}. [The
farmer]{.underline} protested that [he had not planted Monsanto's
seeds]{.underline}. [The judge ruled that]{.underline} even [though the
court had no evidence to prove that the genetic material had not
**drifted onto his property in pollen from** other farms, this **farmer
had the obligation to police his fields** to **protect Monsanto's
intellectual property**]{.underline}. According to the decision, "[the
source...is]{.underline} really [not significant]{.underline}....[Growth
of the seed]{.underline}, reproducing the patented gene and cell, and
sale of the harvested crop [constitutes taking the essence]{.underline}
of the plaintiffs' invention, using it, [without
permission]{.underline}. In so doing the defendants infringed upon the
patent interests of the plaintiffs."21 Of course, [to expect farmers to
**prevent pollen from drifting onto their** fields strains
credulity---even in a corporate-dominated society]{.underline}. So here
is a property right that undermines science, burdens the economy with
expensive litigation, and infringes on personal freedom. To make matters
more absurd, public research forms the basis of the great advances in
intellectual property. Yet the leaders of the capitalist world can find
no better way to lift the rate of profit than to promote the expansion
of intellectual property rights.

#### Intellectual property is a tool of neocolonialism for the US's project of global control

**Ferrer 19** (Cory Ferrer, (now a) PhD in communication, 2019, thesis

a degree in the Department of Communications, \"THE RHETORIC OF
"BALANCE": NEOCOLONIALISM AND RESISTANCE IN THE GLOBAL BATTLE FOR
GENERIC DRUGS\")//gideon

Several efforts have been made to create [a **homogenous IP system** for
the **whole planet**,]{.underline} beginning with the Paris Convention
for the Protection of Industrial Property in 1883. However, 11 these
efforts have accelerated significantly since the 1990s, [particularly
with the rise of **economic neoliberalism**. The US]{.underline},
specifically, has [led the way in terms of helping to spread
**Western-style IP regimes** around the globe]{.underline}. Across
administrations, both Republican Democrat, the United States government
has made recognition of [**US intellectual property** a **mandatory
requirement** for favorable trade terms]{.underline} (Marcellin 15).
Losing favorable trade terms with the US could provide a significant
blow to countries with smaller economies. The US is currently the
largest consumer market in the world, the largest supplier of foreign
aid, and one of the world's largest exporters of foreign direct
investment ("Top 10"; "25 Largest"; "World"). As this thesis will
demonstrate, [the US also hasn't hesitated in its use of **punitive
economic sanctions** to **pressure other nations** into **changing their
IP laws for the benefit of US exporters**]{.underline}. This means that
countries with [smaller economies are]{.underline} often [caught
between]{.underline} a proverbial rock and a hard place when they must
choose between [determining their own IP laws and maintaining favorable
relations with the world's largest economy]{.underline}. [America's role
in **standardizing global IP laws is no accident**]{.underline}. During
the second half of the 20th century, [the US export economy shifted
heavily]{.underline} from commodities and manufactured goods
[to]{.underline} industries such as [software, entertainment, and
pharmaceuticals]{.underline}, all of which are easily copiable and rely
heavily on IP protection. Law and media scholar Siva Vaidhyanathan
writes: "Not coincidentally, the export of film, software, and the
spread of brands like Starbucks around the world followed a period of
de-industrialization. If the United States could not sell as many
Chevrolets to the rest of the world, at least it could get people to sit
through Spider-man movies" (Vaidhyanathan 14). Political economist
Sherry Marcellin points out that "in 1947...IP accounted for less than
10% of all US exports...by 1994, [well over 50%"]{.underline} (Marcellin
2). US President Donald Trump went so far as to call the US tech
industry's IP [the "crown jewels" of]{.underline} 12
[America]{.underline} ("China"). The amount of money riding on other
countries' protection of American IP cannot be understated. One estimate
maintained that [US firms lost **\$2.5 billion a year** in the
pharmaceutical industry alone in]{.underline} lost sales on account of
[patent infringement]{.underline}. (Marcellin). However, some observers
have pointed out a certain historical hypocrisy, in that while the US
has long had strong IP protection for [America]{.underline}n IP holders,
the nation **[didn't recognize other nations' IP]{.underline}** until
the Paris Convention in 1883 and made liberal use of copyrighted works
and patented technology from Europe during its own industrial revolution
(Vaidhyanathan; Kasson). In addition to pushing IP protections though
bilateral trade agreements[, the US and its firms have successfully
pushed for **IP-favorable policy in**]{.underline} large **[multilateral
trade organizations]{.underline}**, notably the World Trade Organization
(WTO). Since the WTO's trade policy provided the basis for the lawsuit
in the case study of this thesis, it's worth taking a closer look at the
organization. The trade federation grew out of a treaty called Global
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), signed in 1948 by 23 countries1 .
Prior to World War II, most of the world's major Western economies
preferred protectionist trade policies, like tariffs and subsidies, to
keep foreign competition out of their domestic markets, and retaliatory
trade wars were prevalent (Hoekman). As Western economies developed
greater surpluses to export, however, they realized that they could
unlock more economic growth by coaxing their fellow countries to lower
their import barriers. As political scientist Clara Park succinctly puts
it, "[Trade agreements are essentially about promoting domestic firms
abroad and protecting domestic firms at home against foreign
competition]{.underline}" (Park 31). Since lowering your own trade
barriers would make your country more vulnerable to foreign competition,
it would only be advisable if they agreed to lower their trade barriers
for your exporting domestic firms as well. It is important to note that
this arrangement is better for wealthier countries capable of generating
large surpluses of goods to ship around the world. The GATT treaty
essentially created a trade war ceasefire and a set of standards for
lowering trade barriers among its signatories ("Fiftieth"). However, the
treaty lacked a clear enforcement mechanism. If you felt another country
violated your trade rights, you would basically be left to work it out
on your own. The WTO was then created in the "Uruguay Round" of
negotiations (1986-1993), to provide a consistent, stable institution
for negotiating and enforcing trade agreements that would lower export
barriers among member countries (Hoekman & Mavroidis). The trade network
has now grown to 159 countries since its formal launch in 1995 (Hoekman
& Mavroidis). But does it serve all their interests evenly? According to
the WTO website, "The \[organization\] is run by its member governments.
All major decisions are made by the membership as a whole...Decisions
are normally taken by consensus" (WTO). While in theory, consensus
sounds like the fairest possible standard for making decisions, it's
much harder to pull off in practice. [Consensus]{.underline} here
[doesn't mean]{.underline} "jury consensus," where [everyone gets an
anonymous vote]{.underline} and you keep deliberating until all agree.
It's more like "wedding consensus" where [you stop the
ceremony]{.underline} partway through [and ask]{.underline}, "[if anyone
objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your
peace]{.underline}." Much of the actual [negotiating takes place in
**highly exclusive "green room meetings**]{.underline}" (so called
because the original room was in fact painted green), [and]{.underline}
then [**prepackaged decisions** are offered to the rest of the member
countries to ratify]{.underline}. If a nation's interests will be
negatively affected by the decision, the burden is on them to force the
issue (Hoekman & Mavroidis). 14 Capacity also creates barriers to equal
negotiations. Smaller [and less wealthy countries]{.underline} like
Uganda [can often]{.underline} only [afford]{.underline} to send [a
handful of negotiators to advocate]{.underline} for their interests,
[while the US]{.underline} and other wealthy countries [often
send]{.underline} over **[a hundred]{.underline}**. Furthermore, if a
nation's treaty rights have been violated by a member country,
initiating [a dispute requires]{.underline} considerable
**[documentation and negotiating capacity]{.underline}**, creating
barriers for less economically developed countries (Kim). Lastly,
countries with vastly different economic resources are never really in
equal negotiating positions. All the leverage previously mentioned that
America possesses for bilateral negotiations is still in play for large
multilateral agreements. Therefore, it was largely [through the
**lopsided influence of the US** that the **WTO made IP an important
feature of global trade policy**]{.underline}. The TRIPS agreement,
mandatory for all WTO members, maintains that each of the member states
must recognize the IP claims of other member states. In strictly
economic terms, this clearly benefits some countries more than others.
Net exporters of intellectual property, like the US, stand to gain from
their entertainment and tech industries, whereas poorer countries that
mainly export commodities or are net-importers of technology will bear
the high costs of paying for the monopoly prices of patented and
copyrighted goods without gaining much benefit themselves. The economist
E. Penrose, writing in 1951, summed this up succinctly: ...any country
must lose if it grants monopoly privileges in the domestic market which
neither improve nor cheapen the goods available, develop its own
productive capacity nor obtain for its producers at least equivalent
privileges in other markets. No amount of talk of about the 'economic
unity of the world' can hide the fact that some countries with little
export trade in industrial goods and few, if any, inventions for sale
have nothing to gain from granting patents on inventions worked and
patented abroad except the avoidance of unpleasant foreign retaliations
(quoted in Marcellin 5-6) In other words, global patents represent a
"win-lose" rather than a "win-win" situation, with wealthy IP exporters
gaining the benefits and IP importers paying the price. Furthermore, 15
research and development (R&D) in cutting-edge industries requires both
a highly educated workforce and surplus investment capital, which are
typically only found in the industrialized nations of the Global North.
The following map (see Appendix, fig 1.) shows each nation according its
number of international patents, as of 2006. Together, the US, the EU,
Japan, and South Korea practically eclipse the entire rest of the world.
The only significant change since 2006 is that, now (2019), China would
be significantly larger. However, this map still clearly demonstrates
that R&D is highly localized within a handful of the World's wealthiest
nations and follows the "Brandt Line" said to separate the Global South
and Global North. The transplantation of intellectual property systems
is even further complicated by the fact that not all cultures share the
set of values on which Western IP is founded. As legal scholar Akalemwa
Ngenda argues, intellectual property is based on Western conceptions of
property that are "individualistic- commodity- and incentive based,"
presuming that cultural works are the product of one author, that their
worth lies in their exchange value, and that their creators are
self-interest maximizers driven by the profit incentive (Ngenda 66). He
points out that many cultures have their own systems of governing the
proprietary rights of cultural reproduction that are directly at odds
with IP. For example, in Australian Aboriginal cultures, knowledge tends
to be communally owned, and its value is derived from its religious use,
placing it at odds with the concept of an individual creating a
commodity to be sold. Furthermore, the right of reproducing certain
cultural works may come with "custodial obligations---for instance, the
obligation not to allow reproduction of a work without a full
appreciation of its ancestral meaning or power" (Ngenda 68).
Significantly, this approach is also at odds with the idea of a "free
for all" cultural commons, what many of IP's Western critics push for,
and what happens to cultural works whose copyrights expire (Ngenda). 16
Thus, transplanting Western standards of intellectual property can
create both cultural and economic conflicts, and, as demonstrated by the
case of HIV/AIDS medication in South Africa, barriers to accessing vital
technology. The World Health Organization (WHO) has even identified
strict enforcement of patents across borders as a barrier to accessing
essential medicines. All the problems that patent thickets can create
for manufacturing high-tech goods can only be amplified in countries
with less economic means. Lastly, this practice benefits the Global
North at the expense of the Global South, reproducing colonial
relationships that privilege powerful (mostly Western) countries at the
expense of poorer and often formerlycolonized states. These power
relationships will be discussed in the following section. The second
half of the 20th century marked a profound shift in the global political
order, as, one by one, most of the African, Asian, and Middle Eastern
colonies of the old European empires began winning independence,
officially ending a geopolitical structure in which legal authority for
much of the planet resided solely with Western elites. The 1950s through
[1970s saw]{.underline} not only the dissolution of sometimes
centuries-old European empires, but the consequential emergence of newly
independent nation-states like India, Algeria, and Kenya. [The
world]{.underline} suddenly appeared much more [pluralistic and
decentralized]{.underline}. However, many critics have argued [those
appearances are deceiving]{.underline}. While no longer directly
administering the governments of the Global South, [Western
industrialized nations have continued to benefit from the **historical
legacy of colonialism** and]{.underline} from vast **[asymmetries of
economic and military power]{.underline}**, often using this power to
continue influencing life in the former colonies. 17 Kwame Nkrumah,
revolutionary and first president of independent Ghana, writes that
"[neo-colonialism...represents imperialism in its final and perhaps its
**most dangerous stage**]{.underline}" (Nkrumah ix). "Neo-colonialism"
is a critique of political relations that implies either a new form of
colonialism or a continuation of colonial relations. Nkrumah goes on to
define the term: "the essence of neo-colonialism is that the State which
is subject to it is, in theory, independent and has all the outward
trappings of international sovereignty. In reality its economic system
and thus its political policy is directed from the outside" (Nkruma ix).
While this "direction" can take a variety of forms, Nkrumah argues that
it is most often "exercised through economic or monetary means" (Nkrumah
ix). Neocolonialism can include [powerful nations using **foreign aid**
to **prop up administrations**]{.underline} willing to give favorable
trade terms in return for support. It can also take the form of nations
from the Global North using their leverage in trade agreements and
**[international]{.underline}** financial **[institutions]{.underline}**
such as the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and International
Monetary Fund to [create policies and laws which **favor their
economies** at the expense of the Global South]{.underline}. The
[TRIPS]{.underline} agreement, I argue, [is]{.underline} such a
**[neocolonial law]{.underline}** [because it privileges the economic
interests of the Global North at the expense of people who need
medicine]{.underline} (to say nothing of other products) in the world's
poorer countries. This thesis will demonstrate how [global **IP
enforcement** has been a site of **neocolonial
domination**]{.underline}, particularly the ways in which [the US has
directed other countries' policies]{.underline} from the outside using
various forms of economic coercion. While [these relationships of
dominance]{.underline} and coercion may be enacted through mostly
economic means, they [must be **publicly legitimized or concealed** to
continue]{.underline}. To excavate the role that
**[rhetoric]{.underline}** specifically plays in **[reinforcing and
upholding neocolonial power relations]{.underline}**, we turn to
de/post-colonial theory. Western thinking about non-Western cultures is
historically built 18 on a foundation of colonialism, one in which there
is a fundamental division between "the West" and "the Rest" (Hall).
Writing specifically about the West's relationship to Asia and the
Middle East, Said writes: "Orientalism is a style of thought based upon
an ontological and epistemological distinction made between 'the Orient'
and (most of the time) 'the Occident'" (Said 10). He goes on to argue
that "European culture gained in strength and identity by setting itself
off against the Orient as a sort of surrogate and even underground self"
(Said 11). We begin with a relationship of division. If Burke argued
that "identification" is the essential feature of rhetoric, here we have
an example of "dis-identification," of creating a clear set of
categories by which cultures should be understood as different (Ott et
al.).

#### IP exports are a project of both corporations and the government

While all IP-exporting countries may, in principle, benefit from a
globalized IP system, [no nation]{.underline} has [pushed more
aggressively for its adoption]{.underline} of late [than the United
States]{.underline} (US). As this chapter will demonstrate, the US has
used its [**economic power** to **coerce other nations** into changing
their policies and has campaigned vigorously for the inclusion of **IP
protection in international law**]{.underline}. This chapter will
identify the key actors in this campaign and explore their rhetoric.
[How the world came to have such **strong IP laws**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} a story of [both]{.underline} **[corporate
influence]{.underline}** on the US government [and]{.underline} the
**[US government's influence]{.underline}** on foreign countries.
Consequently, this chapter will take a multi-pronged approach to this
history, analyzing rhetorics from both government and lobbyists.
[First]{.underline}, I will discuss [the United States Trade
Representative (USTR),]{.underline} an office of the federal government
instrumental in advocating for stronger Global IP protection, examining
its IP related public facing documents and the laws which shape and
enable its powers. I will then summarize the history of the
pharmaceutical industry's influence campaign on the US government,
largely [responsible for making **global IP standards a US foreign
policy priority**]{.underline}. The chapter will then discuss the USTR's
response to [South Africa's Medicines Act of 1997]{.underline},
demonstrating [the agency's opposition]{.underline} to the legislation
and its [**rhetorical framing** of states who defy US
demands]{.underline}. I will then analyze the USTR's 2018 report,
exploring the [ideological commitments]{.underline} both manifest and
latent there and discussing the ways in which the organization's
rhetoric has both changed and stayed the same. Finally, the chapter will
turn its attention to the lobbying perspective, briefly summarizing the
history of [the United States Chamber of]{.underline} 23
[Commerce]{.underline} ([USCOC]{.underline}) and analyzing its 2017
pamphlet "The Roots of Innovation," which makes a strong case [for
strengthening IP protection in foreign markets]{.underline}. I will
conclude the chapter by discussing the common themes and parallels
between these documents. Ultimately, I argue that [the ideology
supporting this push to align]{.underline} the South African IP regime
(and, indeed, those of [the Global South]{.underline} more broadly)
[with those of the United States draws on a **neo-colonial conception of
world relations**, one in which **Western standards are understood as
universal, modern, and moral.**]{.underline}

#### USCOC lobbying overcomes any resistance -- shadow corporations fund massive resistance. It's ridiculous that debate has

The second document we will examine represents the perspective of a
corporate lobbying group advocating for stronger global IP protection:
[the US Chamber of Commerce (USCOC)]{.underline}. Like patents
themselves, chambers of commerce have a long history extending back into
Europe, the first being founded in France in 1599 ("Chamber of
Commerce"). [A chamber of commerce is]{.underline} essentially [a
**consortium of local businesses**]{.underline} [who]{.underline} join
forces to **[lobby governments]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[advance]{.underline}** their **[mutual interests]{.underline}**. Most
chambers of commerce operate at the local level, but in 1911, US
President William Howard Taft called for all the local chambers in the
United States to connect on a national level, appealing for a \"central
organization in touch with associations and chambers of commerce
throughout the country and able to keep purely American interests in a
closer touch" ("U.S. Chamber's History"). Over the past century, the US
Chamber of Commerce ([USCOC]{.underline}) [has become the]{.underline}
**[largest lobbying organization in America]{.underline}**,
[spending]{.underline} over US **[\$132 million]{.underline}** on
lobbying [in 2010]{.underline}, **[more than the second, third, and
fourth largest lobbying organizations combined]{.underline}** ("The U.S.
Chamber"). [USCOC's website proudly describes the organization as
a]{.underline} "**[lobbying and political powerhouse with expanded
influence across the globe]{.underline}**" ("Thomas"). In the words of
Alyssa Katz, author of The Influence Machine, "The U.S. Chamber 37 of
Commerce is not just a lobbying group, and not just a massive political
spending apparatus, and not just a policy shop, and not just a prolific
combatant in the courts. [It is]{.underline}, rather, all of those
things wrapped into one---[a well-funded **influence machine** seeking
to build an economy where **government becomes a tool of big
business**]{.underline}" (Katz xiii). USCOC has taken several
controversial stands throughout US history: opposing the New Deal,
opposing US involvement in World War II, opposing portions of the Civil
Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Clean Air Act,
as well as supporting McCarthyism (McKibbon; "The U.S. Chamber"). The
organization has drawn criticism for allowing [member
**corporations**]{.underline} to **[lobby for unpopular positions
without paying a reputational cost]{.underline}**. Since its books are
not public, nobody knows who funds the Chamber; however, as of 2010,
**[55% of its funding came from just 16 businesses]{.underline}** ("U.S.
Chamber"). Because corporations can lobby through them anonymously, the
organization has often drawn companies whose business interests are not
in line with what the public wants. Katz goes on to write that the
[USCOC]{.underline}, ...has built its recent success in large part by
[advancing the **interests of industries whose prosperity is
threatened... by**]{.underline} emerging trends in human history---by
the [evolution of our **values**, **technology**, scientific
**knowledge**, and notions of **environmental
stewardship**]{.underline}. Its constituents...are mature industries
that provide vital goods and services but at mounting costs to
society...What unites all these industries...is that [achieving
**business success** depends on inflicting **collateral damage on public
well-being**]{.underline}... By doing their political and lobbying
spending through the Chamber, [beloved brand names are never
sullied]{.underline} with the causes they finance (Katz xiii-xiv). While
not trying to insinuate that everything the USCOC advocates is
detrimental (consider their current opposition to President Trump's
trade war, or their support for a new infrastructure spending bill), I
would concur with Katz that overall, this organization is an extremely
wellfunded, organized lobbying force advocating primarily for companies
that would rather not be seen supporting their unpopular causes. 38 Katz
goes on to argue that the USCOC "frames the objectives of these specific
companies and industries as those of 'business' generally...the causes
of 'free enterprise'" (Katz xiv). The rhetorical move of [cloaking
specific interests behind broad platitudes]{.underline} about progress
and free enterprise will be an important part of USCOC rhetoric [calling
for **IP "harmonization**]{.underline}**."** While the USCOC may claim
to speak for all US businesses, a growing movement of US firms have
disavowed the USCOC as an organization that does not speak for them,
especially because the organization's current stance against addressing
climate change. Apple, Microsoft, and Nike have left positions in the
USCOC, while local chambers of commerce in Seattle, San Francisco, and
New York have cut ties with the national organization ("U.S. Chamber").
While cutting into its public image as an organization that speaks for
all US businesses, these [defections have not slowed down the USCOC's
lobbying efforts.]{.underline}

From 1981, Edmund Pratt, then **[CEO of the Pfizer]{.underline}**

Committee on Trade Negotiations (ACTN) [had been **consulting directly
with the US President about**]{.underline} placing **[foreign
intellectual property protection]{.underline}** [on the US trade
agenda]{.underline} (Ryan 1998). At this time, the [US
commenced]{.underline} a series of [**bilateral negotiations on patents,

Mexico, Singapore, Hungary and Taiwan]{.underline}. [US intellectual
property negotiators]{.underline} apparently [discovered]{.underline},
however, that financially [more effective outcomes emerged once their

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) seems to have been
by-passed in the task of promoting GIPP, perhaps because the US and

This new policy of enhanced international protection of U.S. IPR further
sought to link trade to IPR. This link would achieve two further U.S.
aims. First, it would steer away from WIPO, which was increasingly
becoming a center of gravity for the revision of the Paris Convention
for developing countries.77 Second, and most importantly, such a move
would give the U.S. an additional mechanism, the international trading
system, through which to crank up support and observance of its IP
rights; particularly through the legally binding and compulsory dispute
settlement system established by the Uruguay Round.\" Of course, these
[policy shifts did **not** occur **in a political vacuum**]{.underline}.
A group of **[high technology multinational corporations]{.underline}**
[known as the]{.underline} **[Intellectual Property
Committee]{.underline}** (IPC)79 [played a critical role in
**influencing** these **policy shifts**]{.underline}.so [Links between
the IPC and the U.S. federal government resulted in a powerful
**private/public sector collaboration**.]{.underline} For example,
Edmund Pratt Jr., then chairman and **[CEO of Pfizer]{.underline}**,
[had been a]{.underline} [member of President]{.underline} **[Carter\'s
Advisory Committee]{.underline}** [on Trade and Policy
Negotiations]{.underline} (ACTPN) since 1979, which was created under
the 1974 Trade Act.i [The]{.underline} role of this [private sector
advisory group]{.underline} is and was to [**advise** the U.S. Trade
Representative\'s Office]{.underline} (USTR) [on **trade
policy**]{.underline}, as well as to review and report to Congress on
the work of the USTR.8 2 Pratt and IBM chairman John Opel jointly
chaired the IP task force of the ACTPN.83 [This]{.underline} successful
[private/public collaboration is not surprising]{.underline} in part
[because it]{.underline} was and [still is **entrenched within the
federal government\'s trade policy and negotiating apparatus as mandated
by law**]{.underline}.84 Businesses also play a central role in shaping
U.S. foreign trade policy, particularly because [favoring]{.underline}
the [political process]{.underline} as the primary forum for resolving
the interlocking trade concerns through Congressional control over trade
policy [provides]{.underline} these [businesses with]{.underline}
\"**[continuous and unlimited opportunities for business
lobbying]{.underline}**.\"\"8 These [**private sector**
groups]{.underline} also [had]{.underline} (and continue to have) a
**[huge stake]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} the direction of **[U.S.
trade policy,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} therefore
[employ]{.underline} **[large numbers of lobbyists to seek legislation
on their behalf]{.underline}**. For example, **[the pharmaceutical
industry]{.underline}**, which is one of the most profitable industries
in the United States, **[employs at least two lobbyists for every member
of Congress]{.underline}**. [As a **result of the efforts** of
the]{.underline} IPC and other related [groups]{.underline}, [the United
States supported **inclusion of IP rights** within the international
trade agenda]{.underline} during the Uruguay Round of talks of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade particularly in the early
1990s.87 As a result of the way in which this group lobbied for support,
both within the United States and among U.S. allies, as well as through
the pressure of unilateral trade sanctions under super § 301, the TRIPS
Agreement was formulated very consistently with U.S. interests.\" For
example, the right of a WTO member country to engage in compulsory
licensing, with the exception of emergency situations or in cases of
public, non-commercial use, is subject to a multitude of exceptions,
making it virtually impossible to \"break\" patents.\"9 Additionally,
although the TRIPS Agreement refers to technology transfers, it does not
place equally rigorous requirements on technology transfer as a
precondition for receiving patent protection unlike in prior versions of
the Paris Convention. 90 For process patents, the TRIPS Agreement puts
the burden of proof in an infringement suit on the defendant.\" In the
developing country and the LDC context, ill-financed defendants will
potentially come face to face with \"wellfinanced\" developed country
accusers who could much more easily bear the burden of proving
infringement.92 Thus, the TRIPS Agreement contains a number of
thoroughly watered down protections of the public interest. It affords a
heightened level of protection of patents.93

[Informational capitalism found its growth in the **codification and
digitalization** of knowledge, culture and symbolic and nonmaterial
goods and products]{.underline}. [**Cybernetic technologies** operated
by **software made digital networks viable.**]{.underline} These
networks covered the planet and became indispensable to the daily life
of a large part of society, [making communication a structural element
of social, economic, cultural and political processes]{.underline}.
**[But digital communication is a form of communication mediated by
software]{.underline}**. Cybernetic, informational society, which can be
seen as a society of control, has in software its principal media.
Researcher Lev Manovich (2008) was very astute in affirming that, just
as electricity, the machine, and combustion made industrial society
possible, it is software that makes global informational society
possible. [Software, seen as media that guarantees the growing
digitalization of social activities and practices, is not apparent to
this same societ]{.underline}y. Its role is not clear, much less
evident. [Seen as akin to any other technology, and **presented by the
market as merely a product,**]{.underline} software contains source code
that defines it and determines what it is capable of doing. Meanwhile,
[software has the power **to completely determine our
communication**]{.underline}. Its design, its functions, operations and
**[interfaces are defined by the programmers that create and maintain
it]{.underline}**. This code, in general, is closed-source and
incomprehensible to those that use it. **[This is something obscure,
lacking any transparency.]{.underline}** For the software market, it is
this opacity of the code for its users that makes up part of the
intellectual property rights of its creators. The mainstream software
market was structured around a model of remuneration of property based
on the denial of access to the knowledge of its logically nested
routines. [But the lack of source code transparency in the context of
intense digital codification isn't limited to the software market. It
extends to the bodies and essential codes of the species.]{.underline}
It is in the fusion of various disciplines with Biology and Computer
Science that biotechnology, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering
arise. As Adriano Premebida and Jalcione Almeida point out: [With the
influence of cybernetics, a live organism is treated like an information
system, with an extensive history of adaptation, able to be both
interpretable and executed by molecular biology. Politics about life
tends to center around the indifferentiation of the borders between
species and understand the materiality of living beings as 'a matrix of
virtual,' or possible, 'genetic combinations' (Ferreira, 2002: 238). The
junction between techniques and policies in the manufacture of living
beings is what will be at the center of the contemporary
commercial/industrial dynamic in areas of knowledge informed by genetic
engineering.]{.underline} '**[Life can no longer be simply thought of as
the result of reproduction. Life is now able to be
produced]{.underline}**' (Ibidem, 223). Biological life is part of
modern power strategies and currently these strategies also focus on
genetic information. (PREMEBIDA; ALMEIDA, 2010[) The remuneration model
of genetic encoding in **cognitive capitalism** involves closed source
code or restrictions on its use through patent enforcement.]{.underline}
Thus we witness the proximity of Microsoft and **[[Monsanto, or Pfizer
and Oracle]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in their business models. **[Blocking
free access to scientific knowledge is a profound concern for large
corporations.]{.underline}** And that is exactly where Aaron Swartz was
vigorously involved. On January 6, 2011, at 24 years old, Aaron was
arrested for electronic fraud, computer fraud and unlawfully obtaining
information from and recklessly damaging a protected computer.
Specifically, Swartz was accused of downloading 4.8 million documents
from the JSTOR academic article archives, violating its terms of use,
and circumventing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT)
attempts to stop him. According to the report, Swartz bought a laptop in
2010 and registered on the MIT network under a ghost username. On this
computer, Swartz wrote a script in the Python language that allowed him
to rapidly download articles from JSTOR. JSTOR detected the script and
blocked the IP address. According to the report, Swartz repeatedly
changed the IP and MAC address to evade JSTOR's and MIT's efforts to
block access. [When JSTOR normalized MIT's network access some weeks
later, Swartz had changed his technique to download the files. He was
accused of going to a room containing networking equipment and hiding
his laptop behind some equipment so that it would not be
found]{.underline}. He thus circumvented existing blocking and filtering
mechanisms via the direct connection to the servers, successfully
executing his downloads**[. The police report describes how Swartz, as
he went to recover his laptop from its hiding place, had his bicycle
helmet clearly filmed, despite using a mask to cover his
face.]{.underline}** The [United States government alleged that Swartz
probably downloaded the articles to freely distribute them on P2P
(peer-to-peer) networks.]{.underline} However, **[JSTOR itself
recognized that the downloaded content was not used, transferred nor
distributed.]{.underline}** But, for government representatives[, mass
**downloading many articles from academic journals constitutes a hacker
crime and should be punished by imprisonment**.]{.underline} The
interesting part is that Swartz, as an MIT student, had free access to
any of the articles that he downloaded. The criminal attitude was the
use of a script to download many articles. **[The United States federal
prosecutors sought an exemplary conviction. They wanted a sentence of 35
years and said they were acting to discourage copyright
violation.]{.underline}** Pressure mounted on the young Swartz, who had
a large role in the campaign against the **[Stop Online Piracy Act
(SOPA]{.underline}**) and [**PROTECT IP Act bills** in the U.S. Congress
in January of 2012]{.underline}. [These proposed bills sought to block
U.S. citizens' access to digital contents and applications that
supposedly were in violation of intellectual property.]{.underline}
Furthermore, companies in the United States would have five days to
block access to such sites. [The stiffening of intellectual property
legislation and the shadowy activities of the copyright industry are an
**attempt to gain control of the sources of creation and
knowledge**.]{.underline} The case against Swartz is a legal aberration,
since the only consistent accusation was over his intention to release
academic texts on P2P networks for free downloading. Computer forensics
consultant Alex Stamos, who is frequently asked to testify in cases to
determine if intrusions in digital systems and informational crimes
occurred, wrote on his blog[: Aaron did not "hack" the JSTOR website for
all reasonable definitions of "hack". Aaron wrote a handful of basic
python scripts that first discovered the URLs of journal articles and
then used cURL to request them. Aaron did not use parameter tampering,
break a CAPTCHA, or do anything more complicated than **call a basic
command line tool that downloads a file in the same manner as
right-clicking and choosing "Save As" from your favorite
browser**]{.underline}. (STAMOS, 2012) Following the tragic death of
Aaron Swartz, United States federal prosecutors dropped all of the
charges against him. Many people around the world noted the truculence
and arbitrariness being practiced in order to block the sharing of
cultural goods and knowledge. The battles do not appear to be cooling
down. The possibilities for collaboration, interaction and digital file
exchange will continue to grow if the Internet continues to be open, not
proprietary, and not submitted to the telecommunications infrastructure
controllers[**. Still, the copyright industry articulates its next steps
to turn cultural goods and symbolic expression proprietary, as if they
were limited resources. Governments**, such as the United States,
coordinate treaties and laws to **subjugate the rights of all citizens
to the defense of intellectual property**]{.underline}. Yes, Aaron was a
major victim of this war. But millions of young people do not live and
have never lived under proprietary licenses[. They want to share the
possibilities that information technology creates for all. There no
longer seems to be any doubt that one of the principal conflicts of the
twenty-first century centers around the sharing of knowledge and
cultural goods.]{.underline}

#### Corporates are lobbying for IP laws that gives them more control -- congress would not cross them

Meanwhile, [technology giants are spending millions of dollars lobbying
for IP reform]{.underline}. "[They are lobbying Congress heavily to
weaken the strength of patent laws because they don't like the fact that
they are exposed to litigation]{.underline}," Jacobs said.

In a recent blogpost, Google General Counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado laid
out the company's vision "to support Americas innovation." In a written
response to the National Law Journal, [Google emphasized the need for
patent reform]{.underline}.

"Patent trolls and opportunistic companies have begun to weaponize
patents against their rivals, hindering both competition and innovation,
and ultimately harming the quality of new products. [America's prized
'culture of innovation' is being undermined by a 'culture of
litigation.]{.underline}'"

Wiggin and Dana partner and NYU Law School adjunct professor Michael
Kasdan has represented clients on both sides of the "V" in IP
litigation. "If you're making a product and you have to clear thousands
of patent rights ... these little guys pop up you didn't know about."
Big Tech is continually facing repeated challenges to their products,
Kasdan said, noting, however, that the important question then becomes
whether they are in fact infringing.

Of course, [plaintiffs firms and some of those previously involved in
the U.S. patent system see Big Tech mostly as an actor rather than a
victim]{.underline}.

"[All the articulations of the Big Tech giants are just propaganda using
buzz phrases and accusations that are not accurate]{.underline}," Michel
said. He calls [the Internet giant's arguments a "PR spin---and they've
been doing it for dozens of years, they do it to Congress, they do it to
the media]{.underline}."

"To be specific after reading that blog," Iancu said, referring to
Google GC's blog post, "[they want to be permitted multiple challenges
against the same patent, and they should explain why that is good for
the system of the United States]{.underline}."

Iancu and Michel both [underscored that having a robust IP system is not
only a judicial matter, but also one of national security. "It's
important for innovations surrounding artificial intelligence, quantum
computing and other cloud information technology]{.underline}," Iancu
said. "[Venture capital from U.S. sources used to go almost entirely to
U.S. innovators, and now a great chunk is going to innovators overseas,
particularly in China,]{.underline}" Michel said.

However, "most of the litigants bringing patent suits are not
irresponsible trolls," he said but rather companies "who spent a lot of
time inventing and patenting and are simply trying to enforce their
patents," according to Michel.

Speaking about patent reform, Kasdan [proposes "specialized courts
deciding these issues." He believes that it could make case resolution
more efficient and predictable rather than "going through a case and
have widely different experiences, judges," then going through
appeal]{.underline}. "We're really a litigious country, a lot of money
is spent on litigation---I wonder if we can do better there."

#### Private companies control IP regulations -- pretending they don't stops us from creating actual change given the reality of corporate lobbying

**Obendiek 22** -- \[Anke Sophia Obendiek is a Postdoc at the Centre for
European Integration Research, University of Vienna, "What Are We
Actually Talking About? Conceptualizing Data as a Governable Object in
Overlapping Jurisdictions", International Studies Quarterly, Volume 66,

accessed 7/21/22, Lowell-JL\]

The overview over the cases also highlights [that the outcome of the
conflict not only depends on the invoked governance visions but also
indicates several relevant factors, including the institutional
context]{.underline} (Fahey and Terpan 2021). Nonetheless, [the extent
to which agreements represents a compromise between competing visions,
for example through the inclusion of additional oversight or review
mechanisms, seems to influence the stability of the
agreement.]{.underline} Through increased transparency requirements and
references to the rights-based conceptualization of data, [bulk
surveillance practices strongly based on the conceptualization of data
as a tool have expanded]{.underline}, as highlighted by the PNR case
(Bellanova and De Goede 2020). This also [illustrates how legal measures
not only constrain but also specifically enable data use
practices]{.underline} (Cohen 2019).

The cases also indicate that [agreements tilting heavily toward one
vision are vulnerable to disruption by actors that draw on principles
consistent with an alternative conceptualization of data]{.underline}.
[Jurisdictional overlap seems to have an empowering effect on non-state
actors and actors with (formally) more marginal positions]{.underline}.
[High-stakes agreements were disrupted successfully due to
individuals]{.underline}, such as Schrems in the first example, [or
companies, such as Microsoft in the third example]{.underline}. In
contrast to the suggestion by Faude and Große-Kreul (2020), who find
overlap to empower marginalized actors in their own organization, this
effect is particularly relevant vis-à-vis actors in other jurisdictions.
As demonstrated in the Safe Harbor case, [non-state actors were able to
disrupt transatlantic data sharing practices more significantly than
domestic activities, as the largely unobstructed intelligence activities
by EU member states show]{.underline} (Farrell and Newman 2019).

These challengers frequently draw on the local liberal vision of data
governance. Thereby, they often antagonize particularly private
companies from the United States. In interviews, [private company
representatives describe "discrimination"]{.underline} (Tech company
employee, 2019, personal interview) [and "harmful
protectionism"]{.underline} (Private sector representative, 2019,
personal interview) [against US-based companies]{.underline}. In the
public sector, [the predominantly domestic or local character of
governance bodies, such as data protection authorities, and laws, such
as the 1995 Data Protection Directive, has left an ideational legacy
whereby public authorities tend to reproduce their specific local focus
globally, even in disregard of competing local norms or alternative
conceptualizations of data]{.underline}. While it empowers individual
rights, [this approach collides with field-inherent restrictions to
sovereignty based on the transnational nature of data
transfers.]{.underline} It tends [to produce unstable agreements and
exacerbate conflicts]{.underline} (see critically Kuner 2015), as
demonstrated in the right to be forgotten case. The case also
[demonstrates that even rights-based conceptualizations of data are not
necessarily compatible if there is disagreement concerning the
hierarchization of fundamental rights, such as privacy and freedom of
speech, the locus of governance, or the public or private character of
governance.]{.underline}

Throughout the cases, [private companies acted as both challengers and
stabilizers of the status quo]{.underline}. While in the first two
cases, private companies were less visibly engaged in meaning making
processes, the right to be forgotten case and the [Microsoft case showed
how corporate advocacy relied on a combination of material resources and
active participation in object construction processes]{.underline}. [Big
tech companies attempted to create narratives about their legitimate
behavior and even explicitly called for regulation.]{.underline} At the
same time, [they criticized competitors' exploitative data
practices]{.underline} (Hern 2019) [and increased their lobbying
activities]{.underline} (Kergueno 2017). [By challenging jurisdictional
claims from public authorities and actively shaping the
rules]{.underline}, they to some extent displayed characteristics of
what Eichensehr has termed "Digital Switzerlands" (2019), in the sense
that [they attempted to shape governance and scrutinize the exercise of
public power]{.underline}. In the examples earlier, [companies were more
successful in jurisdictional conflicts when they actively attempted to
make claims that established their responsibility to shape policy making
and protect individual rights]{.underline}. They were less successful
when attempting to avoid responsibility, as Facebook in the first
example. Nonetheless, while companies seem to embrace the concept of
responsibility, they have so far been more hesitant to embrace
accountability for their actions, which makes a characterization as
Digital Switzerlands seem premature.

Conclusion

The aim of this article was to [understand the prevalence of disruptive
conflicts in transatlantic data governance]{.underline}. Drawing on a
sociological approach, I have argued that these conflicts are indicative
of and amplified by deep normative divisions: [While united by a common
perception that data governance is important, actors co-create distinct
conceptualizations of data that are embedded in different value and
justificatory systems]{.underline}. Building on this assumption, I have
identified four justificatory bases co-created through jurisdictional
claims. [While proponents of social interaction driven by the belief in
security or economic progress tend to promote loose governance
structures at the global level, those focusing on data as an individual
rights concern demand increasing legislative control on the domestic or
community level.]{.underline} In contrast, [proponents of a vision of
global coherence and cooperation propose medium interoperable or global
protection measures.]{.underline}

The theorization of these different conceptualizations of data
governance is tentative and requires additional empirical research. How
do, for example, conceptualizations in China or India differ from those
presented in this paper? How do claims of control play out in
alternative policy areas, such as health? In the current COVID-19
crisis, [the importance of conceptualizing governable objects to realize
governance goals for specific communities is particularly
evident]{.underline}. [Whether data are conceptualized as a neutral tool
in the fight against an existential threat or as an important part of
human dignity impacts assessment of proportionality and necessity in the
pandemic\'s data governance practices]{.underline}. But [what can data
actually achieve in terms of solving problems or addressing security
threats?]{.underline} While there is no shared understanding of the
societal problems that are to be addressed by engaging in data
governance, even challenging actors, such as the EP or Microsoft, rarely
question the idea that data can provide an answer to these problems. Due
to this faith into "dataism" (van Dijck 2014) or "solutionism" (Nachtwey
and Seidl 2020), [actors are frequently complicit in the creation or
institutionalization of structures and policies that undermine their
wider normative agenda, which amplifies conflicting
developments.]{.underline}

This makes the conceptual contribution of the paper so important,
[focusing on the multidimensional quality of jurisdictional claims as
institutional, power-driven, legal, and normative claims.]{.underline}
Who are the winners and losers from specific conceptualizations of data?
The paper\'s focus on jurisdictional claims naturally limits the
analysis to the carefully curated representations of the involved
actors. While the inclusion of diverse data sources, including
interviews and leaked documents, addresses some of these limitations,
other aspects, such as the overt exercise of power or control through
data infrastructures (Bellanova and de Goede 2020), need further
research. While de Goede has explored the role of banks and airlines as
"reluctant security actors" (de Goede 2018, 3), [the empirical cases
also demonstrate the importance of further conceptualizing private
agency and perceptions of private responsibility in public data
management processes.]{.underline}

In addition, the paper\'s scope is limited to a community of experts.
Further research drawing on [newspaper articles and opinion polls could
incorporate the visions of a broader public, pointing to potential
differences and the salience dynamics of those visions.]{.underline}
This is relevant, because [jurisdictional overlap may obfuscate the
decision-making processes between conflicting norms for affected
stakeholders]{.underline} (Johns and Compton 2019, 16). [The emerging
literature that considers not only the foundational societal
consequences of contemporary data use]{.underline} (Zuboff 2018) [but
also the underlying legal]{.underline} (Mitsilegas 2014; Cohen 2019)
[and power struggles]{.underline} (Farrell and Newman 2019), [and
data-based value judgments]{.underline} (Aradau 2020) is therefore just
a first step toward a more comprehensive analysis of competing normative
goals in transnational data governance.

Where does this leave us in terms of the future development of
transnational data governance? [Jurisdictional conflicts are unlikely to
disappear when regulatory measures, such as the GDPR, strengthen the
extraterritorial reach of governance provisions]{.underline}. [As the
geopolitical relevance of data and internet governance increases, the
stakes seem to be higher than ever]{.underline}. While jurisdictional
conflicts have a productive dimension, they require substantial
improvements in terms of access. As the success of Schrems demonstrates,
[the EU legal order gives significant access opportunities to
resourceful individuals but large parts of the conflicts analyzed play
out behind closed doors.]{.underline} Kosta (2020) also raises the
limits of human agency when faced with machine-based data processing and
the targeting of groups rather than individuals. [Better data governance
requires a broader debate on the construction of data analysis as an
opaque and highly complex practice that is moved out of public
debate]{.underline}.

Days after one of the largest data breaches in U.S. government history,
in which the private information of more than twenty-two million current
and former federal government employees was compromised,1 hackers
claiming an affiliation with Anonymous crashed several Canadian
government websites.2 Also in mid-2015, myriad firms including Blue
Cross Blue Shield were targeted,3 as was German Chancellor Angela
Merkel;4 even sports teams seem to be entering the fray with the FBI
probing the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team about allegedly hacking
into competitors' databases.5 These events highlight both the tumultuous
nature and diverse array of cyberthreats facing the public and private
sectors around the world. Some have gone so far to argue that we are
facing a market failure when it comes to effective, proactive
cybersecurity management in which costs are not being effectively
internalized to punish either bad actors or laggards.6 A similar
argument could be made looking at an array of [national
governments]{.underline} that [run the gambit in]{.underline} terms of
their [efforts to enhance national cybersecurity]{.underline}. Are we
then [facing a global **cybersecurity** market]{.underline} failure? And
if so, [what can]{.underline} realistically [be done]{.underline} about
it [to better protect **intellectual property**]{.underline} and civil
rights and liberties in the digital age? These are questions admittedly
far too large and complex to comprehensively tackle in this Article, or
indeed in a stand-alone volume. However, [it is possible to lay a
foundation for analysis that helps to break some new ground in the
literature while assessing cybersecurity best practices from the public
and private sectors]{.underline} that can cross-pollinate to help
promote a global culture of cybersecurity. In particular, this Article
analyzes **[State involvement in cybersecurity, including]{.underline}**
those policies aimed at **[mitigating cyberthreats targeting
intellectual property]{.underline}** that fall below the armed attack
threshold---namely cybercrime and espionage---by analyzing thirty-four
national cybersecurity strategies across the dimensions of economic
espionage, intellectual property theft, and civil rights and liberties.7
Although the focus is on national cybersecurity strategies, related
domestic follow-up initiatives are also considered, including
"voluntary" bottom-up initiatives being pursued by leading cyber powers
like the United States and Germany, such as the U.S. National Institute
for Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cybersecurity Framework.8 The
vital role of the private sector to help identify and instill
cybersecurity best practices is also considered as part of a polycentric
approach to fostering cyber peace.9

down to minimizing the Attack Surface. This is made difficult by the

importance of electricity and other forms of power in the past century.
Cybersecurity incidents3 can result from unintentional events or
deliberate attacks by insiders or third parties, including

powers have emerged in the meantime and affect these relations
significantly. On a global level, in view of the massive increase in
military spending, the People's Republic of China is the first to be
mentioned, but on a regional level, Russia, India, Brazil, Turkey, Iran,
Saudi Arabia, and, certainly in a different fashion but nevertheless
relevant, the European Union, another important constituent part of the
so-called West, have all expressed different perspectives on and visions
of world order recently (Acharya 2017). Collectively, global power
shifts in favor of non-Western states can certainly be considered a
consensus within International Relations (IR). The same holds for the
assumption that this is accompanied by a -- relative -- loss of
importance of the West, specifically in light of President Trump's
disregard for multilateralism and the values of the liberal order as
such. Second, power on the international scene understood as the
capacity to have an impact on people's lives whether they want it or
not, is also shifted to and increasingly exerted by so-called non-state
actors and within intergovernmental organizations (Avant, Finnemore, and
Sell 2010). [This includes advocacy groups claiming moral high grounds
in global governance as well as multinational corporations, particularly
to but not exclusively from the technology sector (Alphabet/Google,
Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft to name but a
few).]{.underline} - 3 - Against this backdrop of a double power shift
away from the West and away from states, **[we do not believe that the
declining relative relevance of transatlantic relations as the internal
relationship of the West diminishes its relevance as an object of IR
research]{.underline}**. Rather, [assuming **discursive
importance**]{.underline} as a reference object and as political
practice, [we assume actors in and of **transatlantic** **relations**
respond to these challenges and]{.underline} thereby either reproduce or
[develop new aspects of said relations]{.underline}. For one thing, [we
do **not** assume **a zero-sum approach to power**]{.underline}. Under
the condition of an understanding of power as the enforcement of rules,
for instance, [the relative loss of power of a political entity can go
hand-in-hand with the entity striving to enforce a greater number of
rules in absolute terms than before]{.underline}. What these
rules-as-visions are about, then, remains important -- regardless of the
fact that others also (increasingly) have power and enforce (an even
more growing number of) rules. Moreover, it can be observed that in case
of [positional differences between the governments of the U.S. on the
one hand and (some) European states on the other hand, major **crises**
and the end of transatlantic relations are always **proclaimed** very
quickly (and alarmistically) -- **by politicians, journalists, but also
by IR scholars**]{.underline}. Crisis and catharsis, at least, seem to
be recurrent narratives of transatlantic relations, often originating
unreflectively within a hybrid discourse of practitioners and think
tanks, often derived from the notion that a new U.S. president
approaches transatlantic relations in a different light.1 The inherent
presentism of think tank thinking and political practice aside,
[**transatlantic relations** are thus still a much-noticed **object of
public debate and consideration** as they remain an issue quite
**affectively occupied and connected to normative assumptions, in the
West as well as beyond**. To **examine transatlantic relations** thus
also seems promising from this point of view.]{.underline}

#### NATO is good

**Coker 09**

(Christopher Coker is Professor of International Relations at the London
School of Economics and Political Science, 3-27-2009, \"Post-modern
NATO,\" Rusi,
<https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/post-modern-nato/>,
DOA July 21, 2022)

[**NATO has expanded beyond its initial notion of an Atlantic
community**. No longer is it delineated by the Iron Curtain, and the
Alliance has resisted calls to define itself against Islamic
fundamentalism.]{.underline} [NATO still needs a new self-understanding,
key to which will be a clearer sense of its relationship with
Russia.]{.underline} The Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges once
remarked that we are all confronted by the 'modesty of history'. In
plying their trade historians and political scientists try to identify
historic turning points and to date them precisely, but history is more
modest. Its essential dates remain secret for a long time. I cite Borges
because one of the decisive dates he chose, and one which moved him
profoundly (or so he tells us), was the liberation of Paris in August
1944. [For what he saw at the time was the conception of something new
-- **a western community** or coalition that **having triumphed over
fascism would stand firm against communism as well**]{.underline}. Had
Borges been alive today what dates would he have chosen for the
transformation of that community in its institutional form, the Atlantic
Alliance? Since the end of the Cold War NATO has changed profoundly[. If
we seek to date that change perhaps we should look to the Partnership
for Peace initiative of 1994; or the NATO-Russia Founding Act signed
three years later which placed the relationship between the West and its
old protagonist on a contractual footing; or the invitation at Madrid in
1999 to three East European countries to begin **the process of
enlargement**]{.underline}. One could choose all or any of these as
keystones in NATO's path to becoming a post-modern alliance. [Post
western alliance To claim that NATO has become a post-western alliance
may strike one as at best ironic, at worst plainly
perverse]{.underline}. At the Washington Conference in 1949 one of the
participants Paul Henri Spaak called it 'an act of faith in the destiny
of western civilization'. It is worth remembering[, in fact, that the
alliance was meant to be more than a military alliance**. Its founding
fathers hoped to forge an Atlantic Community as Christian
Herter**]{.underline}, **[John Foster Dulles' successor at the State
Department called it.]{.underline}** At the end of the 1950s, in fact,
the United States fought to give the alliance a federal framework -- a
permanent council elected by the NATO Council of Ministers; a political
general staff or steering committee, or Atlantic Commission. In the end,
an Atlantic Community was not forged. Instead, the United States and
Europe began drifting apart. [As Walter Hallstein, the President of the
European Commission remarked in 1961, the Europeans were no longer
interested in the Alliance as a 'collective political personality'; they
were interested only in a loose association based on two separate
pillars -- Europe and the United States]{.underline}. Yet until the very
end of the Cold War, **[the Alliance's 'Western' credentials were
constantly reaffirmed:]{.underline}** in the Atlantic Declaration of
1974 and most recently the Transatlantic Declaration of 1990[. Even
after the collapse of communism and long before 9/11 there was **still a
hope** that **NATO** would remain a western club, by **defining itself
against another universal enemy: Islam**. In the attack by Islamic
fundamentalists on western culture many observers seemed to be confirmed
in their conviction that the worlds of secularism and Islam were as
fundamentally incompatible as those of capitalism and communism. **In
Islamic fundamentalism many commentators saw another existential threat
to western civilization**]{.underline}. In the event, the attempt in
February 1995 by the NATO Secretary-General, Willie Claes, to reaffirm
the alliance on that basis met with little or no support. History has
now moved on. Willie Claes' 'Huntingdonian' predilection for seeing it
in cultural terms was not wrong in itself, but **[the clash of
civilizations thesis is based on a very modern definition of
civilization]{.underline}**. [**The idea of civilization which the West
fought so hard to impose on its enemies can no longer be sustained.** It
now refers to a distinctive mode of existence in the global age, not an
ideal order of human society.]{.underline} [It is no longer possible to
insist that the peoples of the world are living through a stage in a
unitary scale of progress **whose apex is western
civilization**]{.underline}. Indeed, long before the Cold War had run
its course this had been conceded by no less a figure than Raymond Aron.
Aron shared none of his own countrymen's fears of American hegemony or
their aversion to Anglo-Saxon universalism. [He would be among the first
to applaud his country's return to NATO's integrated military
command.]{.underline} [But he recognized that if civilization itself was
to be defended in the future against fundamentalist forces that
challenged everything that made life 'civil' the West would have to be
less exclusive in its definition.]{.underline} 'The present phase of
civilization is coming to an end', he wrote in the 1960's, 'and for good
or ill humanity is embarking on a new phase,' that of forging a single
world civilization for the first time, one truly universal in its
appeal. [What Aron recognized was that every culture - to take one
critical example, human rights - must realize values in its own way. He
recognized that the whole debate on human rights had been bedeviled for
far too long by western ideas]{.underline}. [There is no global
consensus on what constitutes those rights **but NATO is trying to
demarcate what President Bush called 'the non-negotiable demands of
human freedom'.**]{.underline} In 1996 in a speech in Aachen Vaclav
Havel defined what the term 'civilization' meant in the post-modern era.
Like Aron he talked of a new West, a wider one, though still
distinguished by 'a metaphysically anchored sense of responsibility'.
[The West's task, he argued, should be to rededicate itself to a
different project -- to admit that there are values which transcend the
West itself; to find what it has in common with other cultures; 'to join
forces with them in search for the common moral minimum necessary to
guide us'.]{.underline} Let me highlight two key phrases from that
speech. **[NATO must have a normative purpose in the twenty-first
century, or what Havel calls 'a metaphysically anchored sense of
responsibility']{.underline}**. [**But in a post-modern age it cannot
have a maximalist one: the desire to impose a western definition of
civilized norms**. The 'moral minimum' is what it must aim for. This is
not a minimalist objective, however, for it requires the alliance to
intervene for the first time on behalf of those who are not even
members]{.underline}. It did this in Kosovo in 1999, the alliance's
first war. It is attempting to do this in Afghanistan today, in its
second military venture. [Post Atlantic Alliance To call NATO a
post-Atlantic Alliance may appear equally perverse given its decision to
forge a Euro-Atlantic Partnership and a Euro-Atlantic Council but both
of these were conjured into existence for a reason]{.underline}. i.e.
'Atlanticism' as it was traditionally understood is no longer
sustainable. For most of its history, of course, NATO was an Atlanticism
institution whose founding document was not the Washington Treaty of
1949 but the Atlantic Charter of 1941 to which the United States put its
name four months before it entered the Second World War. The Charter was
not only a statement of principle signed by Britain and the United
States. The British signed it on behalf of all but one of the European
governments in exile in London. The exception, France, only signed in
December 1944 -- three months after its liberation (so Borges, perhaps,
was right after all, to date the conception of the Atlantic Alliance --
as opposed to its birth -- to the liberation of Paris[). In the words of
André Malraux, the Old and New Worlds had been divided by the Atlantic,
an ocean which had provided a passage for those fleeing political and
economic oppression in Europe**. In the 1940s the immigration largely
stopped. The Atlantic became a bridge, not a barrier. In that sense, the
Old World was conjoined with the New.**]{.underline} **[The Atlantic
Alliance was lauded precisely for that reason. It offered, wrote the
contemporary historian Hans Kohn, a vehicle through which 'the nations
on the two shores of the Atlantic' had begun to realise their
communality for the first time.]{.underline}** Although they had not
shared a common past they would, at least, share a common destiny.
[Atlanticism grew naturally out of the politics and sympathies forged in
two World Wars]{.underline}. It was consistent with the very 'modern'
belief that countries were not states so much as contracts with history.
What was the United States, asked the poet William Carlos Williams, but
'the inspired invention of European thought'. In the political sphere
Atlanticism was a also a corner stone of Britain's supposed 'special
relationship' with the United States. But it was also vitally important
in helping the United States understand itself. [For the American
elite's idea of national consensus at the time was also in step with the
popular response to assimilation.]{.underline} [Indeed, the East and
Central Europeans who began arriving after 1910 only to find themselves
discriminated against as 'non-whites' were the first to benefit from
Atlanticism]{.underline}. **[For at its core was the belief in the force
of equality. That ideology, in turn, became a mainstay of the
government's own effort of mobilisation]{.underline}**. It facilitated
its attempt to unite the nation behind the rhetoric of the Cold War. It
marked the historic moment when the 'ghetto-whites': the Slovaks, Poles
and Ruthenians felt fully accepted as Americans. It was all the more
ironic, therefore, that the Atlanticism which helped end social
divisiveness within the US and unite the United States should have
divided western and eastern Europe. [In closing the gap between the old
and new worlds, Atlanticism widened the gap between the two in the
western imagination. The decision forty years later to enlarge NATO was
important for that reason]{.underline}. It spelt the end of what the
historian Norman Davies calls 'the Allied version of history' -- the
belief in a unique, secular brand of western civilisation in which the
Atlantic Alliance was presented as the pinnacle of human progress with
the Atlantic Charter as its key. [The Allied version of history was
pernicious precisely because it drew an imaginary line behind which the
West deemed itself to be more progressive, advanced and civilised. The
Hungarian writer Istvan Bibo was probably right to suspect in 1946 -
even before the Iron Curtain was drawn across the continent - that many
westerners were not unhappy to see Eastern Europe policed by a great
power, in part because they suspected its people of 'an innate
barbarism'.]{.underline} It is now clear, of course, that many fault
lines have shaped the history of Europe. Some run north/south and divide
the members of 'old Europe'. The lukewarm support for the Kosovo war in
the south, and 85 per cent support ratings in the Nordic world
highlighted the differences[. It is symbolically fitting that NATO
should have become the instrument by which Eastern and Western Europe
(and the United States, with its large and politically important East
European minorities) **have rediscovered each other**]{.underline}. It
is morally important that the Czech Republic has embraced what Havel
once described as "the poetic charm" of NATO membership. The phrase
reminds me of a passage in the novel Life is Elsewhere by his fellow
countryman, Milan Kundera. Referring to the coup of 1948 which his
generation welcomed as a new dawn, Kundera reflects that 'the wall
behind which people were imprisoned was made of verse'**[. The new
poetics of history is no longer communism but European integration, and
instead of imprisoning people behind a conceptual wall, it offers them a
wider horizon]{.underline}**. Is the process of NATO expansion complete?
Should the Alliance admit Georgia and Ukraine? Historically and
culturally neither have been 'European' -- they have always been on the
margins (if that) of the western imagination. [The same cannot be said
of Russia. Alliance without borders Throughout the Cold War NATO and the
Warsaw Pact found themselves locked into a position of strategic
inertia]{.underline}. History in the twentieth century, wrote the
philosopher Walter Benjamin, was a permanent state of emergency. And
like all such states it demanded a suspension of action, (though not, of
course, belief). [The very concept of movement, Benjamin added, had
become associated with the notion of catastrophe -- 'the fact that
things move on is the catastrophe' he warned.]{.underline} History since
then has become the permanent revision of what has been achieved, and
this is no less true in the security field than every other. [In today's
Europe 'the structure of peace' is no longer based on two opposing
military blocs deterring each other from breaking the peace. **Today's
Europe is characterized by change: the transformation of the security
environment is the principal theme of politics and security
studies.**]{.underline} The old system was built on the principle of
power restraining power. Great emphasis was based on drawing lines in
the sand. Today the emphasis is on inter-penetration and transparency.
The British diplomat Robert Cooper describes its chief characteristics
[: the break down the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs
the growth of mutual interference in traditional domestic affairs and
mutual surveillance]{.underline}. Intrusive verification which is at the
heart of the news arms control regime is a key element of a global order
in which state sovereignty is no longer considered to be absolute. the
rejection of force for resolving disputes, and the codification of rules
of behavior the growing irrelevance of borders the extent to which
security is based on transparency, mutual openness, interdependence and
mutual vulnerability [One of NATO's twenty-first century missions is to
help construct a community in which common identities are constituted by
normative practices other than national sovereignty; and in which people
find themselves involved in the life of the region as well as their own
country**. NATO shares that task with other institutions, especially the
OSCE which is also trying to forge a common security perspective or
'single cognitive space'.**]{.underline} Peace in Europe is now
maintained by the institutional synergy of several security
organizations of which NATO is one. The OSCE is another. If anything,
the Russians take the OSCE more seriously than most western countries,
or, at least, claim to. Some time ago Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of
the Duma International Affairs Committee, suggested that the second
phase of NATO enlargement should include all the participating members
of the OSCE (including Russia), and that thereafter, the organization
should dissolve itself and become the OSCE's military arm. This is
unlikely to happen but the West needs to find some more permanent basis
for its relationship with Russia. For synergy is a process not a
product. Each institution increases the effectiveness of the other; it
is the relationship between them which enhances each. Since 1991 we have
seen the emergence of the Russia-NATO Council. There was also talk of a
joint NATO-Russia brigade. The alliance has put much of its history
behind it; it has embraced globalization with some real success; it has
fought one war and finds itself involved in another. But for good or
ill, the relationship with Russia is still crucial to the new alliance
NATO is in the process of becoming. Until it is resolved we will not
know what the alliance will finally become.

### TVA

#### Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially increase security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the area of cybersecurity by imposing regulations on data extraction

#### Regulation is key to solve the consequences of surveillance capitalism -- only working with both tech and regulations can solve

Turning now to what could be done, one goal should be to [[limit the
damage done]{.mark} by the surveillance capitalism business model,
[while still retaining key benefits of the services]{.mark} it
provides]{.underline}. But if possible, we would like to [[move beyond
damage control and support positive visions]{.mark} of how IT can better
support people and communities]{.underline}. Crafting and deploying such
solutions is an exceedingly difficult problem. Even though this business
model has only recently come into being, the corporations practicing it
have become dominant, and the technologies and services are threaded
throughout our lives, communities, and economies. [[Regulation will be a
key element]{.mark} of a response]{.underline}. However, [regulation
should not simply be a reaction to technology]{.underline} and an
attempt to curb its worst excesses: [[technology should not be taken as
a fixed, external force that will inevitably follow a particular
path]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Nor is surveillance capitalism at its root
a technological problem]{.mark} amenable to a purely technological
fix.]{.underline} Instead, [[regulation and technology should be
co-designed and co-evolved]{.underline}]{.mark}. Citizens and civil
society organizations will play key roles as well, by [pushing for more
effective regulation and supporting technologies, by helping to foster
alternative models for providing needed services, and by adopting new
social practice.]{.underline}

Regulation and law

Regulation and law form key elements of possible solutions. [We suggest
four principal goals for regulation: [protecting privacy]{.mark},
[erecting barriers to behavior manipulation]{.mark}, [protect]{.mark}ing
[free speech and civic participation, and]{.mark} (probably most
controversially) [undermining the economic basis of the surveillance
capitalism business model]{.mark} so that alternatives can take root and
flourish]{.underline}. Having such alternatives should lessen the
dependence on these IT companies, while still having a way that people
and society can have access to useful IT services -- and beyond this,
support positive visions of the role of IT in communities and society.

#### Informed consent and the minimum data approach protect our personal information while browsing -- this limits the damage of surveillance capitalism

**Landwehr, Borning & Wulf 21** -- \[Marvin Landwehr is a Ph.D. student
for Pluralist Economics and Socio-Informatics at the University of
Siegen, Alan Borning is a Professor Emeritus in the Paul G Allen School
of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington,

accessed 7/19/22; Lowell-JL\]

Another area of legislative activity is [do-not-track
legislation]{.underline}. The general goal of these bills is to [allow
users to decide whether or not they are willing to be tracked by
third-party websites while browsing websites and potentially while using
other internet-based services]{.underline}.

True informed consent

One reaction to privacy concerns is to implement much stronger
requirements for informed consent, of which the GDPR is one important
example. [Improving information and consent is]{.underline} certainly a
good thing, but in our view is [inadequate]{.underline}. Being deluged
with pages and pages of consent agreements about what information is
being gathered about you isn\'t that useful, and if the alternatives are
to check the 'agree' box, or to be left out of a great deal of social
and political interaction, this is not a particularly meaningful choice.
However, [stronger implementations of consent are possible.]{.underline}

As a thought experiment, suppose that [surveillance capitalist
corporations were required to operate under the same conditions that
govern research involving human subjects]{.underline}. For example, in
response to past abuses, [the US government adopted the Belmont
Report]{.underline} (1978), which laid out [principles for human
subjects research]{.underline}. It [requires true informed consent,
which must be voluntary and ongoing]{.underline}. That implies that the
[consent form must be straightforward and comprehensible]{.underline} --
so [no 30 page legal monstrosity]{.underline} as with typical corporate
privacy statements -- and the [subject must be able to withdraw from the
experiment at any time]{.underline}. Further, [only data needed to
conduct the study should be gathered, and must be deleted once the study
is over and analysis is complete]{.underline}. [The data must also be
held confidential and protected]{.underline} -- it would be forbidden,
for example, to hand it over to another research group without consent.

[If similar requirements were placed on surveillance capitalist firms,
they would require true informed consent, the ability to withdraw ones
data at any time, and would not allow the data to be shared without
permission with a third party]{.underline}. People should be able to
challenge inaccurate information and have it removed. Note that [today
people do not even have access to a transparent overview of how their
private data is trapped, transferred, sold and aggregated]{.underline}.
Therefore, as a prerequisite, [these data pathways need to be visible
for the user and the public regulators]{.underline}.

Further, in analogy with the human research requirements, only the data
needed to provide the service in question could be gathered, but not the
cloud of additional data that is gathered and retained as at present. In
other words, [what we advocate includes]{.underline} (but is not limited
to[) the concept of 'minimum data]{.underline}.' These [corporations
should not be allowed to collect data that is not necessary to provide
their service]{.underline}. However, minimum data alone could still
leave loopholes for service providers, e.g., they could claim all
personal data collected is necessary for AI-powered algorithms to
provide a service optimized to personal needs. Therefore, [true informed
consent in analogy with human research requirements exceeds the minimum
data approach]{.underline}. Finally, the [requirements should be much
stronger for children and vulnerable populations]{.underline} (e.g.,
prisoners). For example, in many cases the [companies should simply not
be allowed to accumulate information on children.]{.underline}

#### The plan is key to interoperability -- it's the only way to reduce the user's dependence on monopoly organizations

**Landwehr, Borning & Wulf 21** -- \[Marvin Landwehr is a Ph.D. student
for Pluralist Economics and Socio-Informatics at the University of
Siegen, Alan Borning is a Professor Emeritus in the Paul G Allen School

accessed 7/19/22; Lowell-JL\]

Adversarial interoperability

The current IT landscape is dominated by a very small number of
companies in monopoly positions. [Breaking up monopolies would be a
useful step in ensuring that users are not too dependent on a single
service provider]{.underline}. However, in our view, simply splitting
Facebook, for example, into six mini-Facebooks, each with the same
surveillance capitalism business model, would not be a particularly
effective approach. [Better would be to break up companies along
functional lines and to regulate the exchange of information among these
now-third-party entities]{.underline}. For instance, Facebook could be
required to divest from the essentially unrelated parts of its business,
including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. However, just
doing that, each sub-company could hold a monopoly in its niche, so a
comprehensive approach must go further. And given the network effect and
the resulting centralization mentioned above, which are prevalent for
Internet platforms, reverting to a monopoly situation is the most likely
outcome without additional regulation and oversight.

[Interoperability is one key to reducing the user\'s dependence on the
corporation or organization providing the service, as well as increasing
the ability of small competitors to improve upon single features or to
serve specialized markets]{.underline}. In his recent book How to
Destroy Surveillance Capitalism, Doctorow (2020) uses the term
'adversarial interoperability' (or 'competitive compatibility'
(Doctorow, 2021)), capturing that [interoperability cannot be expected
to be implemented voluntarily by for-profit companies if doing so might
reduce their profits]{.underline}. But having such [interoperability
would make it easier for for-profit competitors to enter the market, as
well as nonprofit or public entities]{.underline}, and therefore should
be legally enforced. Doctorow (2020) argues:

'If our concern is how corporations are foreclosing on our ability to
make up our own minds and determine our own futures, the impact of
dominance far exceeds the impact of manipulation and should be central
to our analysis and any remedies we seek.'

His position that [enforcing antitrust legislation in this domain is an
important one]{.underline}, although we would add that [protecting
against surveillance and manipulation is equally important]{.underline}.

[Antitrust law may provide a suitable means for motivating requirements
for adversarial interoperability]{.underline}. We are not experts in the
law, but we can say that it will probably not be enough to apply
existing antitrust law consistently to the case of IT services; [new
regulations will also have to be added]{.underline}. For example,
antitrust law as currently interpreted aims at enforcing fair prices for
customers. This does not cover the case of free applications, in other
words, the users who should be protected are not even the customers in
this case.

#### The organizations are supported by advertising -- profit will still be available

**Landwehr, Borning & Wulf 21** -- \[Marvin Landwehr is a Ph.D. student
for Pluralist Economics and Socio-Informatics at the University of
Siegen, Alan Borning is a Professor Emeritus in the Paul G Allen School

accessed 7/19/22; Lowell-JL\]

For-profit corporations

One option is for-profit corporations. We earlier suggested that [the
shift from context specific to targeted advertising marks the location
of a suitable line to draw and challenge surveillance capitalism by
prohibiting advertising based on personal profiling]{.underline}.
However, for-profit corporations [could continue to offer these
services, supported by advertising, including context-specific
advertising, just without personal profiling]{.underline}. Another
funding option is fee-for-service. These [options are thus still very
much capitalism, just not surveillance capitalism]{.underline}.

[There are existing corporations that use these models.]{.underline} Two
systems to be noted in particular are Brave2 and DuckDuckGo3. Brave is
an open-source browser that (the company says) blocks ads and trackers,
in both mobile and desktop versions. The DuckDuckGo search engine,
according to the company, does not collect or share personal
information. Its business model is still based on advertising (and also
affiliate marketing).

Another option is to [nudge the market by having institutions such as
libraries, universities, and others buy ad-free, no tracking versions of
services for their patrons/students, either from new companies, or from
existing large IT corporations if they are willing to unbundle their
services to support this.]{.underline} (Note that it would be essential
to monitor the corporations carefully to ensure they are not tracking
these users (Farivar, 2016; Peterson, 2015).)

Since these measures directly attack the power position of IT companies,
[countermeasures are to be expected,]{.underline} [including extensive
lobbying and media campaigns]{.underline}, as well as the continuing
instrumentalization of intellectual property laws. For example, even if
an IT service was involved in the creation of content, it should not be
granted any intellectual property rights to it. Otherwise, Facebook, for
example, could use intellectual property law to prevent users from
scraping their own content and uploading it onto competing systems. The
same is true for cloud computing providers. Therefore, [IP restrictions
are quite consequential and must be considered in responding to the
expected countermeasures]{.underline}. However, intellectual property is
just one way in which law is used to create abstract forms of capital.
In her recent book The Code of Capital, Pistor (2020) shows how the law
selectively codes claims and ideas into capital. All of these forms need
to be considered as expected legal countermeasures big companies will
apply against regulation. Furthermore, [investigations and
whistleblowers will be necessary for identifying
misconduct.]{.underline} As a consequence, there should be compensation
paid, and since one of the aggrieved parties is society as a whole, it
is easily justifiable to channel this compensation into the development
of alternatives, as one source for funding for them.
