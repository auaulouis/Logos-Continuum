Strategic Ambiguity: How Much is too Much?

[Overall]{.underline}, [the [Brussels]{.mark} Communiqué]{.underline}
[[send]{.mark}s a **[strong signal]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} [are
**[prepared to defend]{.mark}** their interests]{.underline} in space,
[including [through]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[use of
[force]{.mark}]{.underline}** [if necessary]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [the **[clarity]{.mark}** of this
message]{.underline} [[is **diluted**]{.underline}
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[surrounding]{.mark} the **exact [conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[prompt]{.mark} the [Allies]{.mark} to
**invoke**]{.underline} [**A**rticle **5**]{.underline} in response to
an armed attack. [This **[ambiguity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [may
be]{.underline} seen as [an **asset**]{.underline}:
[leaving]{.underline} hostile [powers **guessing** the exact
conditions]{.underline} [that could **trigger a forceful military
response**]{.underline} [by the Alliance]{.underline} [may
prompt]{.underline} those [powers]{.underline} [to
**proceed**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} greater
**[caution]{.underline}**.25

Strategic ambiguity thus has its benefits. [However]{.underline},
**[hostile]{.underline}** [actors]{.underline} may [also [read it as a
**lack of resolve**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the present case, at least
two factors may encourage such a reading. The first relates to the
[[uncertain **parameters**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of]{.underline} the
[right of self-defense]{.underline} [itself]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**ambiguities** that surround]{.mark}
its application]{.underline} [in space]{.underline}.26 For example,
[could]{.underline} **[[non-kinetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[interference]{.underline}]{.mark} against space-based assets or
services, such as signal jamming, [rise to the level of an
armed]{.underline} [attack]{.underline}? If so, under what circumstances
does such interference satisfy the gravity threshold required to
constitute an armed attack?27 Is it lawful to declare a space exclusion
zone or to deploy "bodyguard" satellites to defend critical space-based
assets in anticipation of an attack in the exercise of the right of
self-defense? Having recognized the applicability of Article 5 to space
attacks, [[NATO nations]{.underline} [need]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
develop a **[shared approach]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to these
and]{.underline} [related questions]{.underline} [in order [to
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[unity and
resolve]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

The second factor relates to the geographical limits that Article 6 of
the NAT imposes on the operation of Article 5 of the NAT. The first
sub-paragraph of Article 6 deals with attacks on Allied territory. It is
clear from the language of this sub-paragraph that armed attacks
launched into the territory or islands of NATO members from or through
space fall squarely within the ambit of Article 5. Armed attacks
launched against their assets in space are caught by the second
sub-paragraph of Article 6, which deals with attacks against the
"forces, vessels or aircraft of any of the Parties." While neither the
notion of a vessel,28 nor that of an aircraft, 29 extends to objects
primarily designed for operation in outer space, the concept of 'forces'
is broad enough to cover spacecraft and their personnel. There is a
catch, however. [The second **sub-paragraph**]{.underline} [of Article
6]{.underline} of the NAT [refers to attacks]{.underline} [taking place
**"in or over"**]{.underline} [Allied territories]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} [means that]{.underline}, at best,
[attacks]{.underline} [against **Allied forces**]{.underline} in space
[are covered by Article 5]{.underline} [only]{.underline} [whilst in
orbit "**over**"]{.underline} such [territories]{.underline} and above
their airspace. Accordingly, the destruction of an Allied satellite may
engage Article 5 if the satellite was orbiting over the territory of a
NATO nation, but not if it was orbiting over the South China Sea, for
instance.30

[NATO [nations]{.mark}]{.underline} thus **[[face a
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} geographical
[[**limitations** imposed by]{.mark} **[A]{.mark}**rticle]{.underline}
**[[6]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the NAT [on the operation]{.underline}
[of their]{.underline} mutual **[assistance commitment]{.underline}**
[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of their space
assets]{.underline} [[to **hostile maneuvers**]{.underline}
[by]{.underline}]{.mark} [potential]{.underline}
[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in the Southern
Hemisphere where the Alliance has the fewest Space Surveillance Network
(SSN) assets. [To address this **vulnerability**]{.underline}, the
[Allies]{.underline} [may]{.underline} consider Article 5 to be
applicable to attacks against their space assets wherever they may
operate, that is without any geographical restrictions. However,
**[[extend]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing the [scope of **[A]{.mark}**rticle
**[5]{.mark}** to cover all]{.underline} [around Earth]{.underline} [may
**[expose]{.mark}**]{.underline} [NATO to
**[accusations]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that it **seeks to**]{.mark}
**[militarize]{.mark}**]{.underline} this domain. Also, [such a move
would **[lack credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline} [unless it is
**underwritten by capabilities**]{.underline} [necessary]{.underline}
[to defend]{.underline} Western [space assets]{.underline} and the
services they provide.

**[[Ignoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** the matter [is **[not an
option]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
are [known for **[exploit]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} [legal]{.underline}
[**["grey zone"]{.underline}** [situations]{.underline}]{.mark} [by
conducting]{.underline} **[hostile]{.underline}**
[operations]{.underline} [below]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
traditional [**threshold** of physical violence]{.underline}
[amounting]{.underline} [to an armed attack]{.underline}.31 They are
**[[likely to test]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[NATO]{.mark}'s]{.underline}
legal **[readiness]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} political
[[resolve]{.mark} in the space]{.underline} [domain]{.underline}, for
example, [[by using **blind spots**]{.mark} to undertake]{.underline}
[**nefarious** activities]{.underline} [such]{.underline} as co-orbital
**[jamming]{.underline}** or RPOs. [Strategic
[ambiguity]{.mark}]{.underline} on the geographical scope of application
of Article 5 is [[likely to **invite, rather than
deter**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such [**hostile**
[probing]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Specifically, the recent [ban]{.underline} on ASAT testing [signals]{.underline} US weakness in space [deterrence,]{.underline} [incentivizing]{.underline} adversaries to [proliferate]{.underline} space capabilities.

[While the U.S]{.underline}. [would like to]{.underline} **[prevent
conflict]{.underline}** [from escalating]{.underline} to space, [many of
our **adversaries do not**]{.underline} share this goal. Instead, [they
see]{.underline} [developing]{.underline} and fielding [capabilities to
**hold** our systems]{.underline} on orbit at risk [as an
**opportunity** to gain]{.underline} decisive
**[advantages]{.underline}**. [Our]{.underline} space [**enterprise** is
the **super glue** that **empowers**]{.underline} a [broad]{.underline}
range of [military functions]{.underline}. [It is **exceedingly
difficult** to project]{.underline} modern [American]{.underline} combat
[power]{.underline} [without]{.underline} [a range of **crucial,
space-based** systems]{.underline}. This includes our communication,
weather, intelligence, navigation and missile-warning satellites. It may
[even be impossible for us to project]{.underline} effective combat
[power]{.underline} [if we lose]{.underline} our [space-based
capabilities]{.underline}, and our adversaries retain theirs. Our
adversaries know this, and it is exactly why they have pressed so hard
to hold our satellites at risk by demonstrating and fielding known
terrestrial and, likely, space-based anti-satellite weapons.

[Given this]{.underline} reality, [it is **important** to]{.underline}
present our leaders with a broad range of options that will **[deter
adversaries]{.underline}** [from **attacking**]{.underline} U.S.
**[space-based assets]{.underline}**. We must convince our adversaries
they cannot destroy our critical satellites, while retaining theirs.
Several of our opponents are equally dependent on their constellations.
A nightmare scenario for the U.S. would see us send our terrestrial
forces into combat without the support of our space capabilities, while
our enemy retains all of theirs. A far better outcome would see us deter
hostile actions in space altogether through holding their assets
similarly at risk, thereby empowering deterrence. Should an opponent
miscalculate, and deterrence fails, it is crucial our leaders have
options, including direct-ascent, anti-satellite missiles, to level the
playing field.

This is why [the administration's]{.underline} admirable
[**announcement** to **unilaterally ban**]{.underline} [the testing
of]{.underline} direct-ascent,
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
missile**[s]{.underline}** [must not **constrain**]{.underline} [the
**development**]{.underline} and fielding [of]{.underline} U.S.
offensive [space capabilities]{.underline}. [This approach **mirrors**
the policies]{.underline} and posture [of our **nuclear**]{.underline}
deterrent [forces]{.underline}: Our voluntary compliance with the
nuclear test ban treaty does not impede our fielding of a credible triad
to deter adversarial strategic attacks on the U.S. or our allies. We
understand these realities here on Earth, and we must ensure we apply
the same calculus to space. It is why the nuclear triad was so important
to check the Soviet Union in the Cold War, and why it remains essential
today. We did not invest in nuclear weapons because we wanted to launch
them. Quite the contrary: It was so we would never have to employ them
or be subject to them.

"[Using" our **strategic deterrent**]{.underline} force [means
**developing the enterprise**]{.underline}, [fielding]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} various [components and **ensuring**]{.underline} [our
adversaries understand]{.underline} [the **credibility**]{.underline}
[of our commitment]{.underline}. The same will hold true for keeping the
peace in space. However, [for a set of capabilities]{.underline} [to be
**persuasive**]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} [must **ensure** our
commitment]{.underline} to use [is **credible**]{.underline}. [This
means we must]{.underline} **[speak]{.underline}** [with
**care**]{.underline} [and ensure our actions]{.underline} [**reflect**
our **resolve**]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON --- [A **new report**]{.underline} [from the]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[I]{.underline}**ntelligence
**[A]{.underline}**gency [links **China and Russia's**]{.underline}
[increased]{.underline} operational **[space capabilities]{.underline}**
[in **recent**]{.underline} [years to their **growing intent** to
extend]{.underline} future **[conflict into space]{.underline}**.

The unclassified "Challenges to Security in Space" report follows a 2019
DIA report that surveyed space and counterspace programs being pursued
by adversary nations, including Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. The
2022 report highlights growth in Russian and Chinese on-orbit systems as
well as efforts to better organize their military space capabilities

"[**Evidence** of both nations' **intent to undercut**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**allied** leadership]{.underline} in the space domain [can be seen in
the **growth** of]{.underline} combined on-orbit
**[assets]{.underline}** of China and Russia, [which grew]{.underline}
approximately **[70% in just two years]{.underline}**," [DIA
Intelligence]{.underline} [Officer]{.underline} for Space and
Counterspace [John Huth]{.underline} [said]{.underline} during a Tuesday
press briefing.

[That **expansion**]{.underline} of capability [follows a **200%
combined increase**]{.underline} between 2015 and 2018 and
[reflects]{.underline} a [recognition]{.underline} by the two countries
[of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tate**[s']{.underline}** **[reliance]{.underline}**
on space assets and its role as a leader in the domain.

"[As the number of]{.underline} [spacefaring]{.underline} [nations
**grow** and]{.underline} counterspace **[capabilities]{.underline}**
[become]{.underline} more [integrated into **military
operations**]{.underline}, [the U.S.]{.underline} space
[posture]{.underline} [will be]{.underline} **[increasingly
challenged]{.underline}** [and on-orbit assets]{.underline} [will **face
new risks**]{.underline}," Huth said. "[A secure,]{.underline} stable
and accessible space [domain is **crucial** as]{.underline}
**[challenges]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and our
**allies'**]{.underline} [space]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}
[continue to **increase**]{.underline}."

//EM \[ISR = intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance\]

[The U.S. military faces]{.underline} [a **variety of
threats**]{.underline} [to its]{.underline} satellite
[systems]{.underline}, [but the Space]{.underline} [Force's]{.underline}
**["soft underbelly"]{.underline}** [is **cyber**]{.underline}, a top
official said Monday.

[Cyberattacks]{.underline} could [**threaten** on-orbit
capabilities]{.underline} [and the **ground systems**]{.underline} [that
support]{.underline} [them]{.underline}, which are
**[critical]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance (**[ISR]{.underline}**),
[communications]{.underline}, [and **positioning**]{.underline},
navigation and timing. [Making U.S. systems **secure**]{.underline} [is
a **top priority**]{.underline}, noted Lt Gen. Stephen Whiting, head of
Space Operations Command (SpOC).

"[These global networks]{.underline} that we have in Space Force and
SpOC are truly not only global --- meaning they wrap around the globe
--- but then they extend out to 22,000 miles above the Earth's surface
into geosynchronous orbit. And that [creates a lot of]{.underline}
**[novel]{.underline}** [cyberattack **surface**]{.underline} ... where
bad actors might try to attack us in the cyber domain. So, we have to
secure that because that's our soft underbelly," Whiting said during a
Mitchell Institute event.

"That's our first priority is to prepare those combat-ready, ISR-led,
cybersecure space and combat support forces," he added.

[Advanced **adversaries**]{.underline} [like **Russia and
China**]{.underline} [have tested]{.underline} anti-satellite
([ASAT]{.underline}) [**missiles** that could destroy]{.underline} [U.S.
spacecraft]{.underline} [in orbit]{.underline}, "[but]{.underline}
[they]{.underline} would [**prefer** to **take us on** in
**cyber**]{.underline} [because it's just a **lower bar**"]{.underline}
[to clear **operationally**]{.underline}, Whiting said.

[Cyberattacks]{.underline} [would]{.underline} also [be a **preferred
method** for]{.underline} [less]{.underline} [**advanced**
adversaries]{.underline} [such]{.underline} [as]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [because
their]{.underline} other counter-space [**capabilities** are
**lagging**]{.underline}, he said.

The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) released a report last month on
challenges to security in space. The study included cyber among a list
of other threats to U.S. space systems such as ASAT missiles, directed
energy weapons, electronic warfare and orbital systems.

"[With **sophisticated knowledge** of satellite]{.underline}
**[C2]{.underline}** \[command and control\] [and data]{.underline}
**[distribution networks]{.underline}**, [actors can use]{.underline}
**[offensive]{.underline}** cyberspace [capabilities to enable
a]{.underline} [**range** of]{.underline} reversible to [**nonreversible
effects** against]{.underline} [space systems]{.underline}, associated
ground infrastructure, users, and the links connecting them," the report
said.

China's **[P]{.underline}**eople's **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[A]{.underline}**rmy **[emphasizes]{.underline}**
[offensive]{.underline} cyberspace [capabilities]{.underline} [as a
**major component**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} integrated
[warfare]{.underline}, the DIA noted.

[The PLA could]{.underline} launch cyberattacks against other nations'
space-based assets and other command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR)
networks and commercial systems to [establish **"information
dominance"**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} [early stages of a
**conflict**]{.underline}, the report said.

China also uses cyberespionage to steal other countries' space and
counterspace technologies for its own benefit, according to DIA.

Meanwhile, Russian counterspace doctrine involves using cyber
capabilities to target an adversary's satellites and supporting
infrastructure.

"Russia considers the information sphere, especially space-enabled
information collection and transmission, to be strategically decisive
and has taken steps to modernize its military's information attack and
defense organizations and capabilities," the DIA report said.

It added: "Since at least 2010, the [Russian military]{.underline} has
[placed a **priority** on the]{.underline} [**development** of
forces]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline},
[including **cyberspace operations**]{.underline}, for what it terms
'information confrontation' --- a holistic concept for ensuring
information superiority. [The **weaponization** of
information]{.underline} [is a **critical aspect**]{.underline} of this
strategy [and is]{.underline} [employed in times of]{.underline}
**[peace]{.underline}**, [crisis]{.underline}, [and
**war**]{.underline}."

On July 1, 2021---the one-hundredth birthday of the Chinese Communist
Party---President [Xi Jinping]{.underline} [**declared** that
China]{.underline} [will "advance **peaceful national
reunification**]{.underline}" [with Taiwan]{.underline}.
[It]{.underline} [would be easy to **dismiss**]{.underline} [such
statements]{.underline} [as mere]{.underline} political
**[rhetoric]{.underline}**: [certainly]{.underline}, [Taiwan would
never]{.underline} willingly **[accede]{.underline}** [to
Chinese]{.underline} [demands]{.underline} to rejoin the fold. [But
China's]{.underline} rapidly advancing anti-satellite ([**ASAT**)
capabilities]{.underline} [could open up **another
avenue**]{.underline}: [deterring]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[intervention]{.underline}** [on
Taiwan's]{.underline} [behalf]{.underline} [in order to **coerce
reunification**]{.underline} without firing a shot.

If current trends hold, then [China's]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**trategic **[S]{.underline}**upport
**[F]{.underline}**orce [will be **capable**]{.underline} by the late
2020s [of **holding** key U.S. space]{.underline} [assets **at
risk**]{.underline}. [Chinese military **doctrine**]{.underline},
**[statements]{.underline}** by senior officials, [and **past
behavior**]{.underline} [all suggest that]{.underline}
[China]{.underline} [may well believe]{.underline} [**threatening** such
assets]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [be an **effective
means**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [deterring]{.underline} U.S.
[intervention]{.underline}. [If so]{.underline}, [then]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
would [face a type of "**Sophie's Choice**]{.underline}": [decline to
**intervene**]{.underline}, [potentially leading allies to **follow
suit** and Taiwan]{.underline} [to **succumb**]{.underline} [without a
fight]{.underline}, thereby enabling Xi to achieve his goal of
"peacefully" snuffing out Taiwanese independence; [or **start a
war**]{.underline} [that would]{.underline} at best be long and bloody
and might well even **[cross the nuclear threshold]{.underline}**.

This emerging crisis has been three decades in the making. In 1991,
China watched from afar as the United States used space-enabled
capabilities to obliterate the Iraqi military from a distance in the
first Gulf War. The People's Liberation Army quickly set to work
developing capabilities targeted at a perceived Achilles' heel of this
new American way of war: reliance on vulnerable space systems.

This project came to fruition with a direct ascent ASAT weapons test in
2007, but the test was limited in two key respects. First, it only
reached low Earth orbit. Second, it generated thousands of pieces of
long-lasting space junk, provoking immense international ire. This
backlash appears to have taken China by surprise, driving it to seek
new, more usable ASAT types with minimal debris production. Now, [one
such ASAT is **nearing** operational]{.underline} [status]{.underline}:
[spacecraft capable]{.underline} [of **rendezvous**]{.underline} and
proximity [operations]{.underline} (RPOs).

[Such spacecraft]{.underline} [are **inevitable**]{.underline} [and
cannot **realistically**]{.underline} [be limited]{.underline}. The
United States, European Union, China, and others are developing them to
provide a range of satellite services essential to the new space
economy, such as in situ repairs and refueling of satellites and active
removal of space debris. But [RPO capabilities are
**dual-use**]{.underline}: [if a satellite can]{.underline}
[**grapple**]{.underline} space [objects]{.underline} [for
servicing]{.underline}, [then it might well]{.underline} [be **capable
of grappling** an adversary's]{.underline} [satellite]{.underline} [to
move it out of its]{.underline} servicing [orbit]{.underline}. Perhaps
[it could **degrade**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [**~~disable~~** it
by bending]{.underline} [or **disconnecting**]{.underline} [its solar
panels]{.underline} and antennas all while producing minimal debris.

This is a serious threat, primarily because no international rules
presently exist to limit close approaches in space. Left unaddressed,
this lacuna in international law and space policy could enable a
prospective attacker to pre-position, during peacetime, as many
spacecraft as they wish as close as they wish to as many high-value
targets as they wish. The result would be an ever-present possibility of
sudden, bolt-from-the-blue attacks on vital space assets---and worse, on
many of them at once.

China has conducted at least half a dozen tests of RPO capabilities in
space since 2008, two of which went on for years. Influential space
experts have noted that these tests have plausible peaceful purposes and
are in many cases similar to those conducted by the United States. This,
however, does not make it any less important to establish effective
legal, policy, and technical counters to their offensive use. Even if it
were certain that these capabilities are intended purely for peaceful
applications---and it is not at all clear that that is the case---China
(or any other country) could at any time decide to repurpose these
capabilities for ASAT use.

There is still time to get out ahead of this threat, but likely not for
much longer. China's RPO capabilities have, thus far, lagged about five
years behind those of the United States. There are reasons to believe
this gap may close, but even assuming that it holds, we should expect to
see China demonstrate an operational dual-use rendezvous spacecraft by
around 2025. (The first instance of a U.S. commercial satellite docking
with another satellite to change its orbit occurred in February 2020.)

At the same time, China is expanding its capacity for rapid spacecraft
manufacturing. The Global Times reported in January that China's first
intelligent mass production line is set to produce 240 small satellites
per year. In April, Andrew Jones at SpaceNews reported that China is
developing plans to quickly produce and loft a thirteen
thousand-satellite national internet megaconstellation. It is not
unreasonable to assume that China could manufacture two hundred small
rendezvous ASAT spacecraft by 2029, possibly more.

[If this happens]{.underline}, [and Beijing was to
**decide**]{.underline} in 2029 [to launch]{.underline}
[these]{.underline} two hundred small [RPO spacecraft]{.underline} and
position them in close proximity to strategically vital assets, [then
China]{.underline} [would be able to]{.underline} **[simultaneously
threaten]{.underline}** [disablement of]{.underline} the **[entire
constellations]{.underline}** [of U.S. satellites]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} **[m]{.underline}**issile **[e]{.underline}**arly
**[w]{.underline}**arning ([about a dozen satellites]{.underline} with

[and **timing**]{.underline} (about three dozen); [along with **several
dozen**]{.underline} [key communications]{.underline},
**[imagery]{.underline}**, [and meteorology satellites]{.underline}.
[Losing these assets]{.underline} would [**severely degrade** U.S.
**deterrence**]{.underline} [and warfighting capabilities]{.underline},
yet [once close pre-positioning]{.underline} [has
**occurred**]{.underline} such [losses become **almost impossible to
prevent**]{.underline}. For this reason, [such pre-positioning
could]{.underline} conceivably [**deter** the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [from **coming to
Taiwan's aid** due to the prospect]{.underline} [that
**intervention**]{.underline} [would spur China to
**disable**]{.underline} [these]{.underline} critical space
[systems]{.underline}. Without their support, the war would be much
bloodier and costlier---a daunting proposition for any president.

[Should the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [fail to intervene]{.underline}, [the
consequences]{.underline} [would be **disastrous** for]{.underline} both
Washington and [its allies]{.underline} in East Asia, [and potentially
the]{.underline} [**credibility** of]{.underline} [U.S. **defense

be what could happen if China believes that such a threat will succeed
but proves to be wrong. [History is **rife**]{.underline} [with examples

**miscalculations**]{.underline} such as this, [and there are **many

**[escalate]{.underline}** out of control [to a full-scale]{.underline}
conventional conflict or even to **[nuclear use]{.underline}**.

This Catch-22 of so-called "peaceful reunification" on the one hand and
catastrophic miscalculation on the other is entirely preventable. [To do
so,]{.underline} however, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [must **act now**]{.underline}. [To
**deter**]{.underline} [such]{.underline} [pre-positioning]{.underline}
[and provide a]{.underline} **[clear framework]{.underline}** [for how

All told, [given the **obvious advantages**]{.underline} [of using
**space**]{.underline}-enabled [communications]{.underline} [over the
**cumbersome**]{.underline} [terrestrial alternatives]{.underline},
[there are **good reasons** to]{.underline} [suspect]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} nuclear [powers may react]{.underline}
**[strongly]{.underline}** [to their loss]{.underline} or tampering.
Additionally, their neat lining up along the GEO belt in very close
proximity to each other transforms large and cumbersome communication
satellites into the easiest targets of space-to-space engagements. Those
are not comforting observations against the background of the pivotal
roles played by those satellites.

Positioning and Timing Signals

Over the course of the last three decades, positioning, navigation, and
timing (PNT) signals broadcast by satellites positioned in MEO altitudes
(at roughly 20,000 kilometers, or halfway between LEO and GEO) have
become an intrinsic and indispensable feature of military operations.
The United States, Russia, China, and others orbited PNT constellations,
which are critical for the proper functioning of NC3. Satellite-assisted
position finding and navigation is the more readily visible application,
without which navigation and targeting would become enormously
complicated, slow, and inefficient. [**Terrestrial** backups are
not]{.underline} as [**practical, reliable**, and
efficient]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} they [rely mostly on
**antiquated**]{.underline} equipment and [techniques dating back to
**1940s**]{.underline} (Sivacek 2018). But even more critical are the
timing signals emitted from PNT satellites in whose absence a whole
range of services such as secure communications, datalinks, sensor
fusion, and network operations could come to a complete standstill
(Hawkes and Blake 2017). It is doubtful that any military or nation is
at all prepared for such an eventuality (Dawson 2018, 5--6).

On the bright side, the MEO altitudes across which PNT satellites are
commonly spread are among the least crowded of orbital domains.
Therefore, a hostile spacecraft trying to position itself would
immediately become conspicuous and alert operators to possible
intrusion. Furthermore, PNT constellations have considerable spare
capacity, meaning several satellites must be pursued and attacked
individually before the performance of the system starts degrading
significantly. Even then, the loss of signals would be periodic at any
place on Earth and not total. In short, the vulnerability of PNT
constellations to space-to-space warfare and proximity operations is in
fact rather low (Federation of American Scientists 2004, 34). The recent
deployment of a new generation of maneuvering PNT satellites (Hitchens
2020a) and a new backup layer of LEO satellites (Munoz 2020) should
further improve the situation. Adversaries intent on interfering with
PNT would more plausibly resort to electronic spoofing, which could
simultaneously be conducted against several PNT satellites by using
Earth-based emitters.

Proximity Operations Pitted against NC3: Five scenarios

NC3 capabilities and the proximity operations targeting them are
technologically complex, multifaceted, and constantly evolving subjects.
Analyzing the impact of proximity operations on NC3 and the
ramifications for strategic stability is by no means easy or
straightforward. To facilitate the task, we shall make use of five
simplified scenarios. This clearly is not an exhaustive list of
contingencies, and several equally plausible scenarios could be added.

Scenario 1: What's Wrong with Our Satellite?

[Amid]{.underline} **[increased tensions]{.underline}**, [perhaps even
an **imminent**]{.underline} military [confrontation]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} [two **nuclear**]{.underline}-armed
**[adversaries]{.underline}**, [a high-value]{.underline} (for example,
early-warning or strategic communication) [satellite stops
**functioning**]{.underline} or communicating [instantly]{.underline}
and inexplicably. [SSA sensors]{.underline} **[do not pick
up]{.underline}** any **[anomalies]{.underline}**. This may be the
outcome of a technical malfunction or a natural phenomenon, such as the
impact of a collision with a meteoroid or piece of space debris small
enough to have evaded detection. Alternatively, the satellite perhaps
becomes the victim of a deliberate, undetected attack. Earth-to-space
kinetic, electronic, or directed energy attacks would leave behind some
trails. [A **cyberattack**]{.underline}, [which is **harder to
detect**]{.underline} [and attribute]{.underline}, [is a **strong
possibility**]{.underline}. So is a stealthy attack by hostile
spacecraft. In fact, the adversary is known to have experimented with
ominous small spacecraft that could easily conceal or disguise
themselves until conducting a final maneuver to neutralize their
targets. The victim would also be aware that, especially at distant GEO
and HEO altitudes, SSA is not sufficiently comprehensive to detect and
give warning of all suspicious or threatening movements as they happen.
As suspicions abound, decision makers are faced with hard choices. Could
this perhaps be [the **harbinger**]{.underline} [of a wider
**nuclear**]{.underline} or nonnuclear **[first strike]{.underline}**,
[along with]{.underline} which [the attacker is **seeking to
eliminate**]{.underline} the possibility of [**retaliation by
degrading** the defender's]{.underline} [**capacity** to
command]{.underline}, control, [and communicate]{.underline} with its
forces? Should the defender react immediately before the remaining
space-enabled NC3 elements are also compromised and its control over
nuclear and nonnuclear forces degrades even further? [In the absence of
a **clear-cut picture**]{.underline} of what actually has happened,
[there is a **risk** that impending]{.underline} [decisions
will]{.underline} [be **made**]{.underline} on the basis of insufficient
and potentially erroneous information, and [the climate will be
**ripe**]{.underline} [for **unfounded**]{.underline} presumptions and
[predispositions]{.underline}. [The resulting
**ultimatums**]{.underline}, responses, [or counteractions]{.underline}
could [set off a **dangerous** cycle of escalation]{.underline} [and
**tit-for-tat**]{.underline} [actions]{.underline},
[whereby]{.underline} reactions and **[overreactions]{.underline}**
between adversaries [lead to potentially]{.underline} **[catastrophic
consequences]{.underline}**. At a minimum, heightened tension in orbit
would have the outcome of spilling down to Earth so as to further
aggravate an already tense situation.

Scenario 2: Unwelcome Guest

The circumstances of the second scenario are very similar to the first,
with the exception that when the satellite goes off, there is an
RPO-capable vehicle, inspector satellite, or other unidentified object
in its vicinity. But there is no evidence of hostile activity or
interference. This is an [increasingly **plausible scenario** because in
recent years,]{.underline} [suspicious]{.underline}, uncooperative
[spacecraft **getting very close**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
strategic [satellites]{.underline} of others [and **staying
there**]{.underline} for a while [has]{.underline} [become
**routine**]{.underline} and customary. [Whereas]{.underline} [the
**dose of uncertainty**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} [the real
**cause of loss**]{.underline} [of contact]{.underline} with satellite
**[persists]{.underline}**, [the victim's presumption]{.underline} [that
a]{.underline} **[proximity attack]{.underline}** [is to
blame]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} much **[more
intense]{.underline}**. Thus, the considerations and processes are
similar to those in the first scenario, but [the **potential for
escalation**]{.underline} [is elevated **exponentially**]{.underline}.

Scenario 3: To Preempt or Not to Preempt?

The circumstances of the third scenario are similar to those of the
second in that tensions are already high between nuclear-armed
adversaries, but this time there is no loss of contact with a satellite.
Instead, a suspicious spacecraft belonging to the adversary has
positioned itself nearby or on the same orbital plane as a critical NC3
satellite. Even worse, there are indications that it may be undertaking
additional maneuvering. The side whose satellite is being shadowed
judges that a hostile action is imminent and that evasive, defensive, or
preventive measures -- or some combination of those -- are warranted.
Evasive maneuvering would take the targeted satellite out of its primary
mission and achieve the same results the attacker was seeking.
Alternatively, if appropriately equipped, the targeted satellite could
resort to defensive measures such as emitting laser beams or HPMs to
interfere with the sensors and electronics of the nearby attacker. The
side believing its satellite is in imminent danger may decide to move in
one of its small "defensive" spacecraft to fend off the "offensive"
craft. However, the decision to actually engage the attacker will not be
easy. Even when employed in a presumably preemptive and self-defense
mode, the use of space-to-space weapons or a guardian spacecraft to
inflict damage on the adversary would be tantamount to having the first
shot of a military confrontation fired in space. Escalatory risks of
launching the first strike in the space domain are evident (Bilsborough
2020).

Scenario 4: Entanglement

This scenario involves the opening or evolving phases of a nonnuclear
confrontation between two nuclear-armed adversaries, with one or both of
them attempting to disorient the other side's conventional war effort by
targeting its satellites. The motivation is simple and straightforward:
all forms of modern warfare depend heavily on the services of
satellites, and leaving one's opponent devoid of those services reduces
its operational efficacy. For satellites in LEO, a larger array of
kinetic and non-kinetic anti-satellite options exist. For satellites in
MEO and especially GEO altitudes, space-to-space and proximity
operations stand out as the more viable option. However, there is one
obvious danger: even when targeted as an extension of conventional
skirmishes, most if not all military satellites are serving NC3 and
nuclear forces as well. Consequently, their owners would likely become
very sensitive to their loss. [It is **important** to
underline]{.underline} in this respect that [there is **no such thing**
anymore]{.underline} [as]{.underline} strategic [satellites
dedicated]{.underline} **[exclusively to NC3]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} nuclear [forces]{.underline} (Acton 2018, 58). For
example, **[e]{.underline}**arly-**[w]{.underline}**arning
**[s]{.underline}**atellites, originally developed to detect
nuclear-tipped strategic missiles, are [nowadays an **indispensable**
part of active missile]{.underline} [defenses]{.underline} aimed at
intercepting shorter-range, nonnuclear missiles, which are frequently
used in regional conflicts as well. Likewise, strategic communication
and PNT satellites serve both tactical and strategic and both nuclear
and nonnuclear forces. [Therefore if high-value satellites]{.underline}
also [serv]{.underline}ing [NC3]{.underline} [are **targeted** during
a]{.underline} **[conventional confrontation]{.underline}**,
[how]{.underline} quickly [will their owners feel]{.underline} overly
**[alarmed]{.underline}** [and **cross the nuclear
threshold**]{.underline} in response? For example, the United States has
already threatened to use nuclear weapons if its NC3 came under attack
with nonnuclear weapons (Acton 2019). Likewise, when faced with
conventional attacks threatening the security of the state, Russia's
nuclear doctrine -- described by some in the West as "escalate to
de-escalate" -- allows a limited nuclear strike to convince the
adversaries to back down (Oliker 2018). [Even China's
strict]{.underline} "no first use" [doctrine]{.underline} [may be
**conducive**]{.underline} [to **setting off preparations**]{.underline}
[for a]{.underline} nuclear [response]{.underline} in the face of
high-tech conventional weapons used against China's major strategic
targets (Kulacki 2020). All told, the omens are not very comforting.

Scenario 5: Accident

In this scenario, [a spacecraft capable of **proximity
operations**]{.underline} [conducts]{.underline} relatively [**benign**
activity]{.underline}, [such as **close inspection**]{.underline} or
eavesdropping, near its object of interest [and]{.underline} [ends up
**inadvertently harming** it]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} [could be
an **accidental collision**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} perhaps
**[unintended activation]{.underline}** [of its repertoire]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} kinetic and [non]{.underline}-[kinetic
tools]{.underline}. That is not implausible, given the continuous
presence of such vehicles nowadays in the immediate vicinity of others'
sensitive satellites. [The]{.underline} [trend toward
embedding]{.underline} [more]{.underline} **[autonomy]{.underline}** and
automation [in spacecraft **increases the probability**]{.underline} [of
such accidents]{.underline} and the consequent rounds of uncontrolled
events. In fact, even [the **debris** resulting]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} in-orbit [experiments]{.underline} at more distant
orbits (such as the firing of high-speed projectiles) could
[find]{.underline} [its way to a **collision**]{.underline} [with a
**high-value satellite**]{.underline} of an adversary. This may be a
particularly discomforting possibility in the tightly populated GEO belt
where the majority of NC3 satellites are located. If such inadvertent
events were to take place during times of high tension between two
adversaries, would the victim believe that the harm was unintended?
Would forbearance and conciliation rule the day? Or would [the
responses]{.underline} [be shaped by **suspicion**]{.underline},
[worst-case]{.underline} **[assumptions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[consequent]{.underline} reprisals, and thus
**[escalation]{.underline}**? There is little doubt that this scenario
represents a set of dangerous uncertainties.

These five scenarios provide a picture that differs from the previous
section's in some important ways. The earlier discussion of the
characteristics and likely vulnerabilities of NC3 assets revealed
significant backup capacity and thus considerable redundancy in the face
of intrusions from space. The subsequent overview of a non-exhaustive
list of scenarios points out that by threatening space-based elements of
NC3, proximity operations could nonetheless create dangerous,
potentially destabilizing, and escalatory pressures. It is true that the
danger is not one of catastrophic collapse or complete paralysis of NC3
when its space-based elements come under attack. Rather, in
circumstances [comparable to]{.underline} those of [a
**cyberattack**]{.underline}, [the real risks appear]{.underline} [to
**emanate**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} **[ambiguities and
uncertainties]{.underline}** of timely and reliable detection and
attribution of proximity attacks (Stoutland 2017). In the absence of
complete, reliable, and timely information, decision makers would come
under pressure to rapidly determine what they believe are the
appropriate courses of action. Yet their decisions run a high risk of
being erroneous and potentially catastrophic. This does not bode well
for either crisis stability or escalation and crisis management.

[The recent]{.underline} [Russian]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite [test]{.underline}
[didn't tell]{.underline} [the world]{.underline} **[anything
new]{.underline}**, [but it did **reaffirm**]{.underline} [the
peril]{.underline} [posed by warfare in space]{.underline}.
[Debris]{.underline} from explosions could [make some earth
orbits]{.underline} **[remarkably risky]{.underline}** [to use
for]{.underline} both civilian and [military purposes]{.underline}. But
[the test]{.underline} also [highlighted a **less visible
danger**]{.underline}; [attacks]{.underline} [on]{.underline}
[nuclear]{.underline} **[c]{.underline}**ommand **[and]{.underline}**
**[c]{.underline}**ontrol [satellites]{.underline} [could
rapidly]{.underline} [produce an **extremely**]{.underline}
[dangerous]{.underline} [**escalatory situation** in a war]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} **[nuclear powers]{.underline}**. James Acton and
Thomas Macdonald drew attention to this problem in a recent article at
Inside Defense. As Acton and MacDonald point out, [nuclear]{.underline}
command and control [satellites]{.underline} [are the **connective
tissue** of]{.underline} nuclear **[deterrence]{.underline}**, [assuring
countries that]{.underline} [they're **not being attacked**]{.underline}
[and that they'll]{.underline} [be able to **respond
quickly**]{.underline} if they are.

For a long time, these strategic early-warning satellites were akin to a
center of gravity in ICBM warfare. Nuclear deterrence requires awareness
that an attack is underway. [Attacks]{.underline} [on the **monitoring
system**]{.underline} [could easily]{.underline} [be read as an
**attempt**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [blind]{.underline} [an
**opponent**]{.underline} [in preparation]{.underline} [for]{.underline}
general [war]{.underline}, [and could]{.underline}
[themselves]{.underline} **[incur]{.underline}** nuclear
**[retaliation]{.underline}**. Thus, [the nuclear
**c**]{.underline}ommand **[and]{.underline}** **[c]{.underline}**ontrol
[satellites]{.underline} [are **critical** to the]{.underline}
[maintenance]{.underline} [of]{.underline} nuclear
[deterrence]{.underline}. They make it possible to distribute an order
from the chief of government to the nuclear delivery systems themselves.
Consequently, their destruction might lead to hesitation or delay in
performing a nuclear launch order.

It was only later that the relevance of satellites for conventional
warfare became clear. Satellites could reconnoiter enemy positions and,
more importantly, provide communications for friendly forces. Indeed,
the expansion of the role of satellites in conventional warfare has
complicated the prospect of space warfare. [States have a **clear
reason**]{.underline} [for targeting]{.underline} enemy [satellites
which support]{.underline} conventional **[warfare]{.underline}**, as
those [satellites]{.underline} [enable]{.underline} the [most **lethal
part** of the **kill chain**]{.underline}, [the
communications]{.underline} and recon networks [that **link
targets**]{.underline} [with **shooters**]{.underline}. Thus, [we now
have a situation]{.underline} [in which]{.underline} [space]{.underline}
military [assets]{.underline} [have **both nuclear and conventional
roles**]{.underline}. [In a conflict **confusion**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[misperception]{.underline}** [could rapidly become
**lethal**]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} [one combatant **views an
attack**]{.underline} [against]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}**
[**c**ommand **and** **c**ontrol as]{.underline} [a
**prelude**]{.underline} [to a general]{.underline} nuclear
[attack]{.underline}, [it might choose to **pre-empt**]{.underline}.

#### Independently, miscalc from [ISR failure]{.underline} escalates to [full-scale]{.underline} nuclear war\-\--[nothing]{.underline} checks

[The **[fog]{.mark}** of nuclear conflict [will
prove]{.mark}]{.underline} all the **[[thick]{.underline}]{.mark}**er
[[because]{.mark} leaders and [planners **lack**]{.mark} **adequate
[knowledge]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}]{.underline} their
[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}' mind-set, resolve, wartime aims, and
[game plans]{.underline}. For instance, de-classified Soviet documents
show clearly that the US strategy of "escalation dominance" was
completely out of sync with Soviet nuclear strategy and that escalation
to full-scale nuclear war was virtually inevitable if the United States
struck first.13 After many decades of scholarly research, it is still
not known what leaders in Moscow and Beijing were thinking during Cold
War crises involving US attempts to threaten nuclear violence to coerce
them.14 Today it would be foolhardy in the extreme to presume we would
know Putin's, Xi's, and Kim's minds and behavior in wartime. A prudent
leader would not only refrain from initiating the actual use of nuclear
weapons because of the danger of escalation; that leader would also
refrain from brandishing them at all during a confrontation. [The
**[fear of]{.mark} an adversary [striking]{.mark} first** [is]{.mark}
the leading **[textbook]{.mark} cause** of **[crisis
instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To stabilize a military crisis
situation, what is actually needed is predictability and reassurance
that first use is not on the table. For many strategists, however,
taking options off the table looks like weakness. Retired Gen. James
Mattis (the recent defense secretary) has a favorite military maxim:
"Never tell the enemy what you are not going to do." Strategists weaned
on Thomas Schelling's classic game theory arguments believe threatening,
manipulating risk, and blackmailing are the currency of savvy crisis
diplomacy. And it is certainly true that [past US presidents have
regularly played nuclear
**brinks**]{.underline}~~man~~**[ship]{.underline}** with the Soviets
and Chinese [and displayed **incautious risk-taking** in their crisis
maneuvering]{.underline}. This was in fact the playbook of the Nixon
advisors who ordered the world-wide nuclear alert that my crewmate and I
helped implement in 1973. This alert sent a provocative message to the
Soviets: The United States was prepared to play nuclear roulette to gets
its way.15 [[**Nuclear roulette** begins]{.mark} at the outset of a
crisis [as]{.mark} the [belligerents **intensify**]{.mark} **their
[\[ISR\]]{.mark}**]{.underline} intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance **[operations]{.underline}**. The aim is to maintain
"situation awareness," but [the activities lend themselves to the
**[worst-case]{.mark} interpretation** that the adversary is updating
its targeting in **preparing to strike**. Similarly, nuclear forces and
command [structures]{.mark} are **programmed to [go to higher
readiness]{.mark}** to prepare for war if the adversary will not back
down]{.underline}. [[Although]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**motives** may
be **[defensive]{.mark}**, these **[activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
may appear to be precursors of a first strike and [[provoke]{.mark} an
[**action-reaction spiral** that **spins out of
control**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Certainly, [if [even]{.mark} a
**[single]{.mark}**]{.underline} nuclear [weapon were
**[use]{.mark}**d]{.underline}, the strategic nuclear forces on both
sides would move rapidly to a maximum war footing and project credible
mutual threats of large-scale preemptive attack. In sum, a nuclear
posture gearing up for a possible enemy first strike [risks
becoming]{.underline} a **[self-fulfilling]{.underline}** prophecy. From
the perspective of presidential decision making, the
[first-use]{.underline} contingency [could easily accelerate
**escalation**]{.underline} to the point of causing mental duress.
[This]{.underline} contingency [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[notable
for]{.mark} its [**absence of guardrails** and]{.mark} the
**[ease]{.mark}** with which [a **misguided**]{.mark} or rattled
[president could **order**]{.mark} it]{.underline}. The launch protocol
described earlier for [**launch on warning** applies]{.underline}
equally to first use. Although the timeline could be extended greatly,
the president could choose at any time to end the discussion and order a
strike. During the Cold War, I seldom practiced executing a first
strike, and today there are no foreseeable scenarios that would justify
transgressing the nuclear taboo of first use. Nevertheless, a first
nuclear strike remains the default contingency of the US posture, owing
to the huge uncertainties surrounding the alternatives -- second-strike
retaliation and launch on warning. A crisis that brings the belligerents
to the brink of nuclear war would compel consideration of first use.
Nuclear warfighters who reject the adage that a nuclear war cannot be
won and must never be fought may well brief and tout the purported
warfighting advantages of going first. Even though first use runs
counter to and undermines the entire framework of the global nuclear
order, in which nuclear weapons exist only to deter, leaders may waver
if it seems the least fraught choice at the moment of truth. An
impulsive president may be drawn to it. Wiser advisors may counsel
restraint, but nothing would stand in the way of the president ordering
a first strike. [The]{.underline} likely if not [[**inevitable**
consequence]{.mark} of attacking a nuclear adversary with nuclear
weapons [is nuclear **retal**]{.mark}iation [and]{.mark} **uncontrolled
[escalation]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} crosses the threshold of acceptable
damage to this nation. First use [runs an **existential risk**]{.mark}
to the]{.underline} United States and [the world. It carries a huge risk
of triggering a **nuclear exchange** of **cataclysmic
proportions**]{.underline} with massive casualties to all the
belligerent parties and beyond.

NATO in Cyber and Outer Space

[[**Cyber** and **space** is]{.mark} a **[promising]{.mark} arena** [for
**NATO** to address **China** ]{.mark}**challenges** [by]{.mark}
[building]{.mark} **member state [resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Like the air and sea domains, as areas that belong to no one state and
which provide access to much of the globe, they form part of the global
commons. Command of the commons has been the key enabler of the US
global position of power for many decades.26 However, [[China]{.mark}
[wields]{.mark}]{.underline} a sufficient range of [**sea**, **air**,
**cyber**, **and space [capabilities]{.mark}** [such that the **global
commons** is]{.mark} now a **[contested]{.mark}** zone]{.underline}. In
contrast to the sea and air domains, [**cyber** and **space** are
**sparsely regulated**. This **[lack of]{.mark} international
[norms]{.mark}** [enhances the risk of **conflict**]{.mark} based on
**misperception**, [making **NATO cooperation pertinent**. Adversarial
activities]{.mark} toward the **US** and **Europe** in the cyber and
space domain threaten transatlantic security. These [come not just from
**China**, but also]{.mark}]{.underline} from other adversaries such as
[[**Russia** and **Iran**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mechanisms for
addressing these challenges in the military sector are essentially
generic and not, at least in their basic design, established with a
particular country in mind. Thus, [[**cyber** and **space**
provide]{.mark} an [avenue]{.mark} for NATO [to **contribute
significantly** to **deterrence**]{.mark} of China [without having to
combat]{.mark} **major [internal resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NATO
would also benefit from long-standing US-EU cooperation on cyber and
space issues.27

Cyber and space provide an avenue for NATO to contribute without major
internal resistance

[NATO has vowed to clarify **A**rticle **Five's** collective **defense
commitment** to encompass threats to **satellites** in **space** and
**coordinated cyberattacks**. NATO can design this]{.underline} effort
[to include **adversarial behavior** from **China**]{.underline}. The
alliance already has an array of instruments to deal with cyber and
space challenges from adversaries. These can be extended to encompass
China without pronouncing it a threat.28 [This]{.underline} approach
[allows the US and Europe **time to adjust** their cooperation to take
into account]{.underline} the fact [that China poses **military
threats** to them]{.underline} both [without]{.underline} explicitly
[using the **language of threat**]{.underline} at a time when NATO
members do not agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can
trigger Article Five responses.

Since the late 1990s, the vulnerability of shared space assets to
cyberattacks has been a concern for both the US and Europe. For example,
in 1998 a US-German satellite, used for peering into deep space, was
rendered useless after it turned suddenly toward the sun, damaging its
High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA later determined that the
accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at the Goddard Space Flight
Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged as a major threat to both
the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For example, for about eighteen
minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom advertised erroneous network
traffic routes that instructed US and other foreign internet traffic to
travel through Chinese servers. Other servers around the world quickly
adopted these paths, routing all traffic, including government and
military traffic, to about 15 percent of the internet's destinations
through servers located in China.29

In the future, the need [to [enhance]{.mark} **situational [awareness in
space]{.mark}** is likely to [lead to]{.mark} **further
[integration]{.mark}** [of space assets between the US and]{.mark} its
[allies. **Civilian entry points**]{.mark}]{.underline} are likely to
[[provide]{.mark} a **growing opportunity** for [**infiltration**. The
**weak state** of]{.mark} cybersecurity in **civilian
[agencies]{.mark}** [should]{.mark} also [be considered.
Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} military [[doctrine
prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark} weaponry that targets vulnerabilities
in the deployment of US and allied power, such as the [[use of
**cyberattacks** to **disrupt**]{.mark} **surveillance
[assets]{.mark}**[, **intel**]{.mark}]{.underline}ligence networks,
[[and
**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ommand-[[**and**-**c**]{.underline}]{.mark}ontrol
systems.30 These threats are significant, since [next generation
systems]{.underline}, including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and
special forces, [**will not function** without access to **space
communication**]{.underline} and space-derived data.

Although European and US allies have indigenous space programs outside
the [[NATO framework]{.underline}]{.mark}, cyber security and outer
space [[would be]{.mark} a **[useful]{.mark} field** [for]{.mark}
**joint explorations** of [how to]{.mark} **divert** and **[manage
attacks]{.mark}** and identify an agency which can
coordinate]{.underline} transatlantic [**responses** to
attacks]{.underline}. Allies are embedded in a range of information
networks which may be disrupted, giving rise to alliance management
concerns emerging from attacks. [The [**lack of red lines** regarding
behavior]{.mark} in cyber and outer space]{.underline} between the US
and its allies on one hand, and adversaries such as China on the other,
[[adds to the risk of]{.mark} **misperception** and [**escalation**,
and]{.mark} hence also [highlights the need for]{.mark} **allied
[coordination]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark} **starting [a war by
mistake]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [An improved **[NATO dialogue]{.mark}**
on safeguards]{.underline} and alliance consultation [[could]{.mark}
also [assist]{.mark} communication [with]{.mark}]{.underline} China on
arms control and [[**conflict prevention** in]{.mark} cyber]{.underline}
and [outer [space]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is not currently taking
place.

Looking to the future, [[NATO's success]{.underline}]{.mark} in
establishing transatlantic mechanisms for cyber and outer space
safeguards and consultation [[will be **crucial** to]{.mark} allow NATO
a **key role** in [taking on the **China challenge** in ways
that]{.mark} help [restore faith in **NATO's credibility** as a provider
of]{.mark} **collective [defense in all domains]{.mark}**[. It
will]{.mark} also [assist NATO in **straddling the chasm**]{.mark}
between]{.underline} member states prioritizing threats
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} either China,
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}**iddle
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**ast, or **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**orth
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**frica, [[since]{.mark} cyber and space
**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} potentially [[stem from **all of
them**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the effectiveness of cyber and space
defense mechanisms do not necessarily depend on geographical origin.

[**Cyber** and **space** would allow NATO a **key role in the China
challenge** without prioritizing China]{.underline}.

Miscalculation resulting in deterrence failure

[Miscalculation]{.underline} in crisis can [resulting]{.underline} [a
**failure to deter**]{.underline} the outbreak of [war]{.underline} via
the same pathways as above. First, in a crisis, [either side
could]{.underline} continue to **[miscalculate]{.underline}** the scope
of the other's [interests]{.underline}. Although the immediate interests
at stake in a crisis would become clear, [Blue might
**underestimate**]{.underline} [Red's willingness to **exploit the
crisis**]{.underline} [to secure a]{.underline} related
[interest]{.underline}; Red might seize on the crisis to engage in
horizontal escalation. For instance, [Russia]{.underline} **[annexed
Crimea]{.underline}** [weeks into the]{.underline} Euromaidan
[crisis]{.underline}. Second, [a crisis could **escalate to
war**]{.underline} [through Blue or Red's]{.underline} **[failure to
assess]{.underline}** the other's **[resolve]{.underline}**. [Although
Blue and Red]{.underline} [will have **strong incentives**]{.underline}
[to **signal their resolve** in a crisis]{.underline} [over]{.underline}
vital [interests]{.underline}, [in a **more complex**
crisis]{.underline}, [**miscalculations** of resolve may]{.underline}
accompany miscalculation of interests. In the Crimean crisis, [NATO did
not see a need]{.underline} [to **signal resolve**]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} [it **miscalculated** Russia's]{.underline}
[interests]{.underline}. [If a crisis arises]{.underline} from a mishap,
[Blue]{.underline} may [be **hesitant**]{.underline} [to engage in
**overt shows of resolve**]{.underline} [to avoid]{.underline}
[provoking]{.underline} rather than deterring Red. [A crisis
atmosphere]{.underline} [may]{.underline} also [make **signaling
harder**]{.underline} [due to a complex]{.underline} and contested
[information environment]{.underline}, [further]{.underline} [limiting
each side's "strategic]{.underline} [vocabulary]{.underline}." Third, a
crisis may exacerbate the risk of miscalculating the military balance.
All sides will have incentives to be less transparent and predictable.
To preserve warfighting advantages, Blue may be hesitant to reveal
decisive capabilities, especially those that depend on secrecy. Blue may
also hesitate to court escalatory risk through signaling capabilities
while Red may conceal forces used for hybrid warfare.

Miscalculation resulting in inadvertent escalation

In a crisis, **[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}** [can
**result**]{.underline} [from miscalculation]{.underline} of the intent
behind mishaps, [responses to mishaps]{.underline}, [or
shifts]{.underline} [in the **military balance**]{.underline}.
[Although]{.underline} [status]{.underline} [quo-oriented
powers]{.underline} may [seek to **avoid war**]{.underline} [and
thus]{.underline} may [be **generous**]{.underline} [with their
interpretations]{.underline} [of complex]{.underline} and uncertain
[events]{.underline}, a [sufficiently **tense atmosphere**]{.underline}
[could **exacerbate paranoia**]{.underline},
[risk-aversion]{.underline}, [and **mistrust**]{.underline}, [fueling
escalation]{.underline}. The impact of military behaviors during a
crisis on escalation risk are not clear. Blue might respond to a mishap
in a way that increases the resilience of their forces, which could
allow Blue to avoid further escalation while it assesses the cause of
the mishap. Red or Blue might also be aware of the potential for
inadvertent escalation and actively seek to manage this risk. Greater
senior decision maker attention to military matters during a crisis
could contribute to risk management. At the nuclear level, escalation
would almost certainly involve deliberate decision making by both sides,
reducing the risk. Conversely, [crises **increase incentives** for
opacity]{.underline}, [**limiting** the ability]{.underline} [to
distinguish]{.underline} [between]{.underline} true [**mishaps** and
guises]{.underline} [for aggression]{.underline}. [Changes in **force
readiness**]{.underline} [could]{.underline} also [be
**escalatory**]{.underline} in some contexts, while conventional forces
could interactin ways that escalate the conflict even if national
leaders do not decide to escalate. Measures to enhance resilience and
signal resolve may also cast a nuclear shadow on a crisis and provoke
unanticipated escalation. If Blue or Red do not anticipate inadvertence,
they might overestimate their ability to control escalation.

Miscalculation in war

[**Miscalculation** resulting]{.underline} [in a **failure to
deter**]{.underline} vertical or horizontal [escalation]{.underline}.
Although each side's core interests might be well understood when the
fighting begins, the war itself may lead Red or Blue's interests to
evolve in ways that increase the risk of miscalculation. [Red might
**view the war** as an **opportunity**]{.underline} [to
pursue]{.underline} other [interests]{.underline}, [but Blue might
**miscalculate**]{.underline} [Red's]{.underline} [ambitions and **fail
to deter**]{.underline} horizontal [escalation]{.underline}. [Red
might]{.underline} also **[miscalculate]{.underline}** [Blue's
interests]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} conduct of the
[war]{.underline}, such as Blue's reputational interest in punishing
violations of the nuclear taboo. [**Miscalculating** Blue's]{.underline}
[interests]{.underline}, [Red could then see]{.underline} [an
**opportunity to gain advantage**]{.underline} [through]{.underline}
[limited]{.underline} [nuclear escalation]{.underline}. In a war, both
sides will also have strong incentives to signal resolve. [Yet the **fog
of war**]{.underline}, as well as a [**breakdown** of]{.underline}
diplomatic [relations]{.underline} [and a **shift to a
wartime**]{.underline} domestic information [environment]{.underline},
could [make it **difficult** to send]{.underline} [and **receive such
signals**]{.underline}. The conduct of the war itself could also
complicate strategic messaging. Forces that might be used to send
signals could be committed to other operations or destroyed in the
fighting, constraining each side's strategic "vocabulary."

Each side's actions in war may reveal information about the military
balance, which could reduce the potential for miscalculation of
capabilities. Yet [inherent **uncertainties**]{.underline} [about the
outcomes of certain]{.underline} military **[contests]{.underline}** may
[contribute to **miscalculation**]{.underline}. Some [forms of
miscalculation]{.underline} [may be]{.underline}
**[advantageous]{.underline}**. For instance, the US has an interest in
encouraging Red to be extremely pessimistic about the outcome of any
nuclear exchange. By the same token, however, [Red]{.underline} [may be
**prone to overestimate**]{.underline} [its ability to
fight]{.underline} [a **nuclear war**]{.underline}. The uncertainty of
how a nuclear war would unfold could make it difficult to dispel Red's
overconfidence without engaging in actions that themselves risk further
escalation.

#### US-Russia war causes extinction

**Fisher '15** \[Max; June 29; Foreign affairs columnist at Vox; Vox,
"How World War III became possible,"
http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war\[

That is why, analysts will tell you, [today\'s **tensions** bear far
more similarity to]{.underline} the period before [**World War I**: an
unstable power balance, belligerence over peripheral conflicts,
entangling military commitments, disputes over]{.underline} the future
of [the European order, and dangerous uncertainty]{.underline} about
what actions will and will not force the other party into conflict.
[Today\'s **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, once more the strongest
nation in Europe and yet weaker than its collective enemies, [calls to
mind the turn-of-the-century German Empire]{.underline}, which Henry
Kissinger described as \"too big for Europe, but too small for the
world.\" Now, as then, [a rising power, propelled by nationalism, [is
**seeking to revise the European order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now, as
then, it believes that through superior cunning, and perhaps even by
proving its might, it can force a larger role for itself. Now, as then,
the drift toward war is gradual and easy to miss --- which is exactly
what makes it so dangerous. But [there is one way in which today\'s
dangers are less like those before World War I]{.underline}, and more
similar to those of the Cold War: **[the apocalyptic logic of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**. [[Mutual suspicion]{.mark}, [fear]{.mark} of an
existential threat[, armies parked across]{.mark} [borders]{.mark} from
one another, [and hair-trigger]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} all
**[make any small skirmish]{.mark} a potential
[armageddon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In some ways, that logic has grown
even more dangerous. [Russia]{.underline}, hoping to compensate for its
conventional military forces\' relative weakness, [has dramatically
relaxed its rules for using nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Whereas Soviet
leaders saw their nuclear weapons as pure deterrents, something that
existed precisely so they would never be used, Putin\'s view appears to
be radically different. [**[Russia\'s]{.mark}** official [nuclear
doctrine calls on]{.mark} the country to **launch a [battlefield nuclear
strike]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} case of a **[conventional war]{.mark}**
that could pose an existential threat]{.underline}. These are more than
just words: Moscow has repeatedly signaled its willingness and
preparations to use nuclear weapons even in a more limited war. [This is
a **terrifyingly low bar** for nuclear weapons use]{.underline},
particularly given that any war would likely occur along Russia\'s
borders and thus not far from Moscow. And it suggests Putin has adopted
an idea that Cold War leaders considered unthinkable: that a \"limited\"
nuclear war, of small warheads dropped on the battlefield, could be not
only survivable but winnable. \"It's not just a difference in rhetoric.
It's a whole different world,\" Bruce G. Blair, a nuclear weapons
scholar at Princeton, told the Wall Street Journal. He called Putin\'s
decisions more dangerous than those of any Soviet leader since 1962.
\"There's a low nuclear threshold now that didn't exist during the Cold
War.\" Nuclear theory is complex and disputable; maybe Putin is right.
But many theorists would say he is wrong, that the logic of nuclear
warfare means [a \"limited\" nuclear strike is in fact likely to trigger
a larger nuclear war]{.underline} --- **[a doomsday
scenario]{.underline}** [in which major American, Russian, and European
cities would be targets]{.underline} for attacks many times more
powerful than the bombs that leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. [**Even
if** a nuclear war did somehow remain **limited**]{.underline} and
contained, recent [studies suggest that environmental and atmospheric
[damage **would cause a \"decade of winter**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" and
mass crop die-outs that could kill up to 1 billion people in a global
famine.

[In the **military domain**]{.underline}, [some]{.underline} [of the
[major]{.mark}]{.underline} system [[**vulnerabilities** include]{.mark}
the **[use of commercial]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} [for military purposes]{.underline};
[**['back-doors']{.mark}** in encryption]{.underline}; [[and]{.mark} the
**[supply-chain]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[security]{.mark} of
satellites]{.underline}.27 This list can also be extended to include
physical, personnel and procedural vulnerabilities. [[Risks]{.mark} also
arise]{.underline} [from the **dual-use**]{.underline} aspect [of
most]{.underline} of the [space]{.underline}-related
[technology]{.underline} -- [where the technology]{.underline} [can be
used for]{.underline} both **[civilian]{.underline}** [and
**military**]{.underline} [purposes]{.underline}. For instance --
whether fixed or mobile units -- [communications satellites]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [broadcasting satellite]{.underline} service[s have
both]{.underline} [civilian]{.underline} [and military
utility]{.underline}. Similarly, the [utilization of]{.underline}
[satellite]{.underline} imagery [capability]{.underline} [in the
civilian]{.underline} [sphere]{.underline} [for]{.underline} **[earth
observations]{.underline}**, [environmental]{.underline}
**[monitoring]{.underline}**, [and the provision]{.underline} [of
**oceanographic**]{.underline} and cartographic [data]{.underline}, also
extends to the military domain.28 [[There is an increasing need
to]{.underline} [apply]{.underline}]{.mark} [higher-grade **[military
hardening]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and cyber **protection**]{.underline}
specifications [[to civilian]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} [that have the
**potential**]{.underline} [to be [used in]{.mark} support]{.underline}
[of **[military]{.mark} application[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

These capabilities aside, terminals located in ground stations
constitute a critical vulnerability, as a terminal is an access point to
a satellite and is usually not protected by authentication in order not
to hinder operational actions. Terminals house software systems that can
be compromised and require patching and upgrading. Moreover, software
embedded in weapons systems (such as precision-guided munitions) could
also be compromised.

At times, [[NATO]{.mark} allies **procure equipment**]{.underline} and
software [to be **integrated** into their]{.underline} national [defence
architecture]{.underline}, which becomes part of the overall NATO
capability. [The commercial]{.underline} supply [[chain]{.mark} is
[**embedded** in]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly [[**every aspect**
of]{.mark} military]{.underline} [[equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This
may not necessarily]{.underline} [be a **particular
vulnerability**]{.underline}, as long as commercial equipment is
designed to military standards and is secure. [However]{.underline}, [if
military standards]{.underline} [are **not met**,]{.underline}
[items]{.underline} [procured]{.underline} from commercial industry with
design flaws [may **expose**]{.underline} [NATO's]{.underline} [systems
to **additional vulnerabilities**]{.underline}.

While the absence of data is easy to detect, the manipulation of data or
erosion of confidentiality at such an interface is potentially more
difficult to discern.

[[**Civil** satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}, [operated by **private**
companies]{.underline}, [may be [used]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
fulfil]{.mark}]{.underline} specific [[missions]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
**locations** [where]{.mark} NATO]{.underline} [[allies]{.underline} [do
not have]{.underline}]{.mark} [their]{.underline} **[own space
[equipment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Ground stations]{.underline}
[constitute]{.underline} [**further** **elements**]{.underline} [that
are relevant]{.underline} for the data flow. [From a
cybersecurity]{.underline} point of view, [**[each interface]{.mark}**
could]{.underline} [[present a vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} could [become a **weakness**]{.underline}, as an
interface typically requires manual processes to establish its
operation, and/or the administration of the components involved.
Adversaries infiltrating ground- or space-based systems could exploit
weak software implementation, or the incompatibility of network or data
transfer protocols in the chain. While the absence of data is easy to
detect, the manipulation of data or erosion of confidentiality at such
an interface is potentially more difficult to discern. [Vulnerabilities
can stem from]{.underline}:

- [A **higher number** of data]{.underline} exchange
  [interfaces]{.underline} used between the military and civil sectors;

- The fact that each actor has its own isolated view of its data
  network, protected by its own security standard;

- The [use of **old** and]{.underline} **[proprietary]{.underline}** IT
  [hardware and software]{.underline}; and

- The [failure or **inability**]{.underline} [to conduct]{.underline}
  regular [software updates]{.underline} to remove known
  vulnerabilities.

- In such an environment, it seems difficult to ensure security of the
  information delivered.

- Space-specific risks for the NATO alliance and for key NATO countries

[Space systems]{.underline}, which include both satellites and ground
stations, as well as related space products and services, [provide
**mission-critical**]{.underline} [information both for]{.underline}
[NATO's member states]{.underline} and for the alliance [as a
whole]{.underline}. [NATO relies on **space-based**]{.underline}
[assets]{.underline} [**for almost all** of]{.underline} [its
operations]{.underline} [and missions]{.underline}.29 Some of the
critical missions that rely on space assets include: defence of NATO's
territory and the neighbouring regions; peacekeeping missions;
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief; counterterrorism; and
conflict prevention activities.

NATO does not own satellites. It owns and operates a few terrestrial
elements, such as satellite communications (SATCOM) anchor stations and
terminals. It requests access to products and services but does not have
direct access to satellites, leaving it up to its allies to determine
whether they provide access to their satellite capabilities. NATO has
established memoranda of understanding with allies for possible use of
space products and services.

Originally, in the US, space systems used by the military were separated
from commercial and civilian assets in terms of their development and
operation.30 One of the reasons for this separation was to protect the
military structure against physical and cyberthreats. Military space
system safety and security requirements were also higher and more
stringent than in the commercial sphere (for example, requirements to
invest in survivability enhancement mechanisms in order to resist
jamming, or special design approaches for military space architecture).
In recent years commercial methods, for instance the capture and
analysis of satellite imagery, have been shown to be as effective as
military means. As a result, [NATO uses a **mix** of
military]{.underline}, [civilian]{.underline},
**[commercial]{.underline}**, [and national/]{.underline}multinational
[assets]{.underline} to conduct its operations. [The **joint use** of
these assets]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [comes with an
**acceptance of inherent risk,**]{.underline} not only to the countries
that provide such capability but also [to the **alliance as a
whole.**]{.underline} In response, the European Defence Agency, through
its Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM) development
programme, decided to build an intermediary class of satellites between
commercial SATCOM and military SATCOM, with security requirements able
to address the needs of critical missions, including crisis
management.31

[There is **increased dependence** on]{.underline} [space-based systems
in]{.underline} **[modern]{.underline}** military
[engagement]{.underline}. During the US engagement in Iraq in 2003, 68
per cent of munitions were guided utilizing space-based means (including
laser-, infrared- and satellite-guided munitions); this percentage had
risen sharply from 10 per cent in 1990--91, during the first Gulf war.32
In its operations in Afghanistan in 2001, 60 per cent of the weapons
used by the US were precision-guided munitions: these included bombs,
missiles, and other weapons, many of which had the capability to correct
their own positioning to hit the target, using space-derived
information.33

[Cyber [vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[undermine
confidence]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in]{.underline} strategic
[systems]{.underline}; [they [increase
**uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in information]{.underline} and
analysis, [which **[impacts]{.mark} the [credibility]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[deterrence]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} strategic [stability]{.underline}. [**[Loss of
trust]{.mark}** in technology]{.underline} also [[has
implications]{.underline} [for **attribution**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} strategic [**calculus** in crisis]{.underline}
[decision-making and]{.underline} may [[increase]{.mark} the risk of
**[misperception]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This **dependency**]{.underline} on space-based technology [has major
**implications**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the way
[NATO]{.underline} conducts warfare today, and how it will do so in the
future. For instance, in order to conduct precision strikes or earth
observation through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs -- such as
military drones), [systems]{.underline} [rely on so-called
']{.underline}beyond-line-of-sight' (**[BLOS]{.underline}**)
[communication via satellites]{.underline} -- [especially in times of
**crisis and conflict**]{.underline}, since ground-based line-of-sight
communications are vulnerable to physical attacks. [Yet]{.underline},
[cyberattacks]{.underline} [on space technology]{.underline} or on the
UAVs [may lead them]{.underline} [to **misinterpret**
commands]{.underline}, or to lose contact with the command centre and
fail in operation. \*\*\*TABLE 1 OMITTED\*\*\* Identification is another
important capability that is used in the NATO maritime domain for
coastal tracking, and for identifying and locating ships and vessels.
Using automatic identification systems (AIS), data is electronically
transmitted between ships and the coastal stations. By providing similar
functions, AIS supplements and provides resilience to maritime radar and
is fundamental for avoiding collisions.36

[[NATO's]{.mark} space-dependent]{.underline}
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} [have **individual**]{.underline}

[**[coupled]{.mark}** to each other]{.underline}, [[with

Although there would be a number of contenders for technologies of

indicates that PNT signals (which utilize GPS) are a much-needed
priority capability in almost all NATO operations.

[The [allies **consistently**]{.mark}]{.underline} [have [kept]{.mark}
space]{.underline} **[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** [firmly [on
**sovereign ground**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [and
traditionally]{.underline} often [[have been **reluctant** to
share]{.mark} [information]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The fact that it has
**taken this long**]{.underline} to roll out of the public version of
the policy --- a first framework document was signed in June 2019 ---
[is a **testament**]{.underline} [to the]{.underline} culture of
**[[secrecy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that has [been
even]{.mark}]{.underline} [[more]{.mark} **pervasive [in
Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline} [than in the **US**]{.underline} (and that
is saying something).

[One [reason for]{.mark} **allied [reluctance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to
engage]{.underline} [[on **military**]{.underline}]{.mark} space
[[issues]{.underline}]{.mark} in public [[is that]{.underline}]{.mark},
[with the **exception** of]{.underline} **[France]{.underline}** and
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom,
[[many]{.underline}]{.mark} [European [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}
traditionally [[have been]{.underline}]{.mark} either [**deeply
[uncomfortable]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}]{.underline}, or downright
opposed to, [the **concept of [warfighting]{.mark}** [in
space]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [especially **offensive
action**]{.underline}. Indeed, in an August 2019 speech, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg found it necessary to declare that [NATO's
declaration]{.underline} of space [as an allied operational]{.underline}
[domain]{.underline} [was "**not about**]{.underline} the
**[militarization]{.underline}** of space."

[The public policy]{.underline} [released today]{.underline} [makes **no
such caveat**]{.underline}, [but does **signal**]{.underline} [that
[there remains]{.mark} **some [cracks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on
military uses]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [space]{.underline}.

For example, the policy explains that the North Atlantic Council ---
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s decision-making body that at its
highest level involves heads of state --- [[will **need to**]{.mark}
**approve**]{.underline} [any options]{.underline} "[across]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[conflict spectrum]{.underline}** [to
**[deter]{.mark}**]{.underline} and defend [[against
threats]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} or attacks on
[[Allies']{.mark} **space [systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}." It adds that
in the meantime, [[allies]{.underline} "[should **develop**
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[common understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[of concepts]{.underline} [[such]{.underline} [as the **role of
space**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} crisis or

[Unlike during the **Cold War**]{.underline}, [when space]{.underline}

[space has become]{.underline} increasingly
**[democratized]{.underline}**. As of 2019, over 60 countries have a

enormous **[opportunities for defense]{.underline}** space
[partnerships]{.underline}. This new era also presents serious risks.
[Space is becoming]{.underline} increasingly
**[contested]{.underline}**. In April 2020, Russia tested a direct

called out Russian satellites for trailing a U.S. national security
satellite.6 Also in April 2020, Chris Ford, a senior official in the
State Department, said that China was exploring capabilities to attack
U.S. satellites, including in high orbits such as those of U.S. nuclear
command, control, and communications satellites.7 [The **seriousness**
of the threat]{.underline} [underlines the importance of]{.underline}

[[should **not**]{.mark} try to]{.underline} **[[manage]{.mark} these
threats purely [on its own.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

To enable more international defense space partnerships, U.S. leadership
will need to treat such partnerships as a strategic priority, not as an
afterthought or add on. This chapter looks at advantages, challenges,
and mitigations for broadening and deepening security space partnerships
that could prompt key decision points during the next presidential term.

Advantages of Partnerships

Defense space partnerships offer considerable advantages. These include
allowing the United States to expand and improve its network and
capabilities with fewer resources, deter adversaries from attacking its
systems, and coalesce allied and partner thinking on space security
concepts.8 A look at some common space maturity metrics suggests that
many of the most mature space nations in the world are partners of the
United States. Specifically:

The United States and its close partners make up 11 out of the top 15
countries with the biggest national space budgets.9

Of the roughly 2,700 active satellites in orbit, over 500 are operated
by international partners and over 1,300 are operated by the United
States.10

- Among the world's 22 active space launch centers, six are operated by
  partners and five by the United States.11

[Many allies are]{.underline} also [taking steps to
**emphasize**]{.underline} [the seriousness]{.underline} [of space
security]{.underline}. In the past year, France and Japan have
established their own military units dedicated to space.12 The United
Kingdom officially recognized space as an operational domain in 2018.13
And NATO, which historically has said little on space, came out with a
space policy in 2019.14 [Given the space **maturity**]{.underline} [of
many of its allies]{.underline} and partners, [and the **shared
recognition**]{.underline} [of the importance]{.underline} [of the
domain]{.underline}, [the time is **advantageous**]{.underline} [for
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to
place **more priority**]{.underline} [on establishing]{.underline} and
deepening **[space partnerships]{.underline}** [for
defense]{.underline}. Expand and Improve Networks and Capabilities.

[[Partners]{.mark} have capabilities]{.underline} [that can
**[improve]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[U.S.]{.underline}
[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [and networks [in]{.mark}
**geographically [dispersed]{.mark}**]{.underline} and strategic
[[locations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is particularly **true**
in]{.underline} **[s]{.underline}**pace **[s]{.underline}**ituational
**[a]{.underline}**wareness, [an area in which]{.underline} [a
**[diverse set]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[geographically]{.underline}-[distributed sensors]{.underline} [can
[more **accurately**]{.mark}]{.underline} and completely
[**[capture]{.mark}** the]{.underline} [operational
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline}.15 [Partners]{.underline} can [help us
[**collectively attain** more]{.mark} **persistent**]{.underline}
[surveillance]{.underline} [and **[continuous]{.mark}**]{.underline}
global [[coverage]{.mark} of satellites and debris, which is only
**possible**]{.underline} [if we have more]{.underline} and better
[sensors]{.underline} in a variety of locations. Radars and optical
telescopes spread around the world can also more comprehensively
identify space threats. For example, Japan is developing a deep-space
radar that will observe objects in geosynchronous orbit. Given the
counterspace threats from potential adversaries, the radar could also be
invaluable to the United States because of its capability and location.

Additionally, space capabilities and operations are expensive. A clear
advantage of military space partnerships is that they generate
opportunities for sharing the financial burden of operating in space. As
an example, the United States putting its security payloads on the
Norwegian satellite will reportedly generate up to \$900 million in
savings.17 Hosting U.S. payloads on foreign systems, like this example,
represents an area in which the United States could leverage allied and
partner capabilities more so than it does currently. Hosted payloads
offer affordable means to expand protected communications satellites;
position, navigation, and timing satellites; and space situational
awareness capabilities, among other systems. Rather than host payloads,
partners can also simply contribute to the cost of a satellite system.
For example, through multilateral agreements, Canada, Denmark,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand provided funding for the
U.S. Wideband Global SATCOM-9 satellite that launched in March 2017.18
Or the United States can use partners' satellites. For example, the
United States partners with Japan and Europe to obtain weather
information from space-based sensors, providing accurate weather
information to warfighters around the world and avoiding the need to
field additional U.S. systems.19 And it is not just satellites and
payloads. Partners have terrestrial infrastructure and user equipment,
including for position, navigation, and timing and satellite
communications, that can be used collectively to achieve needed
capabilities more efficiently. Leveraging allied systems can offer
technological insights, system improvements, and capability expansions
at lower costs.

[[Partnerships]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[create

**[integrat]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} allied and partner capabilities,
[such as incorporating]{.underline} [**[combined]{.underline}**
[systems]{.underline}]{.mark} [in **satellite networks**]{.underline}
[and ground]{.underline} **[infrastructure]{.underline}**. [Such
integration]{.underline} [can **[strengthen]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the
[cohesiveness]{.mark}]{.underline} [of a]{.underline} defense
[partnership]{.underline}, [which could]{.underline} also
[[help]{.underline} **[deter]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[an
attack]{.underline}**. [A potential [adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}
[may]{.underline} [[consider an attack]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}]{.mark} [a **purely** [U.S. system
**differently**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[than an attack]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}]{.mark} [a **system**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
[incorporates]{.underline} [[several]{.underline}
**[allied]{.underline}**]{.mark} and partner
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Deployment of NATO's]{.underline}
**[multinational battlegroups]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [the
eastern part]{.underline} of the Alliance (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
and Poland) is an example of this concept in the ground domain. [If
Russia's military were to invade]{.underline} Estonia [and
attack]{.underline} [the multinational forces]{.underline} there, [the
invasion could be seen]{.underline} [as **not just an
attack**]{.underline} [on Estonia but]{.underline} [on **all of the
countries**]{.underline} represented in those forces [and]{.underline}
perhaps all of **[NATO]{.underline}**.20 A May 2017 NATO fact sheet on
its multinational forces reaffirms this: "\[The multinational\] presence
makes clear that an attack on one Ally will be considered an attack on
the whole Alliance."21 [Similarly]{.underline}, [in the space domain,
an]{.underline} [**attack** on a U.S. constellation]{.underline} [of
satellites]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [U.S. payloads]{.underline}
[might **prompt a response** from]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates; [an [attack
on]{.mark} a]{.underline} [satellite]{.underline} [[constellation
with]{.underline}]{.mark} [a]{.underline} **[mix of
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[partner]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[capabilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** might [[prompt]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from **several
countries**]{.underline}]{.mark} [acting collectively]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} may [[help **deter**]{.mark} a
potential]{.underline} **[[adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[from]{.underline} [attacking in the first]{.underline}
[place]{.underline}.

[With **integrated**]{.underline} allied and partner
[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, [U.S. satellite networks]{.underline}
and ground infrastructure, as well as other equipment and capabilities,
[can **[become more resilient]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
**[more]{.mark}** systems [you have]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the
[**larger** an]{.mark}]{.underline} [[attack]{.underline}]{.mark} [would
need to be]{.underline} to take out a given percentage of capability:
all else equal, two satellites would be more resilient than one, three
satellites more resilient than two, and so on. [The
**resilience**]{.underline} [offered]{.underline} by integrating allied
and partner capabilities into a network, therefore, may also [contribute
to **deterring**]{.underline} [a]{.underline} potential
**[adversary]{.underline}** [from attacking]{.underline} the network.

[In the absence of a]{.underline} formal [treaty]{.underline},

nonetheless [[continue to work towards]{.underline}]{.mark} implementing
[[TCBMs]{.underline}]{.mark} [that seek to **increase

intentions**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [provide a basis
for]{.underline} [**[strengthening]{.mark} mutual [trust]{.mark}**
building]{.underline} [and confidence]{.underline} amongst states.477
Improving space situational awareness (SSA) through an international
outreach effort is the ideal platform through which to accomplish these
goals. [**[SSA]{.mark} is [vital]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **long-term
[sustainability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of the space

mitigate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [natural]{.underline} **[[environmental
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** and identifies behavior that would be
detrimental to responsible use and long-term sustainability.478

Therefore, SSA will be a foundational verification mechanism for
potential treaties as well as an opportunity for cooperative trust
building. 479 [SSA is **generally made** up]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} two components: space surveillance and tracking
([**[SST]{.mark}**)]{.underline} [and]{.underline} space traffic
management (**[[STM]{.underline}]{.mark}**). First, SST [involves using
ground-based and space-based]{.underline} optical [sensors and
radars]{.underline} in order [to track]{.underline}, characterize, and
analyze **[space objects]{.underline}**. Second, STM utilizes SST
[data]{.underline} [in order to [ensure]{.mark} safe [passage]{.mark}
through the space]{.underline} **[environment]{.underline}**.480 [Both
SST and STM [require]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[cooperative
efforts]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to be **successful**]{.underline}.

[SST necessitates a]{.underline} diverse, **[geographically
dispersed]{.underline}** sensor [network to provide]{.underline} timely,
**[accurate]{.underline}** [data]{.underline} on objects in a wide array
of orbits.481 [[A **single nation**]{.underline} [is

the [**geographical [coverage]{.mark}** [needed]{.mark} for
a]{.underline} **[comprehensive]{.underline}** SST

ensure spaceflight safety.482 [There is currently
[no]{.mark}]{.underline} [**standardized [regime]{.mark}** for
conducting]{.underline} the [broad SSA mission]{.underline} in order to
analyze and communicate threats to the space domain.483 [This
**[creates]{.mark} an [opportunity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for]{.mark}
the [U.S. to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[utilize]{.mark} its **position of
[tech]{.mark}nical [superiority]{.mark}** in order to score a **soft
power coup**]{.underline} [by taking the lead]{.underline} in a global
SSA initiative.

[The **[major obstacle]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to building
an]{.underline} **[international]{.underline}** SSA
[coalition]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} the **[military]{.mark} utility**
SST [data]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} [can be [used
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[reveal]{.underline}
**[classified]{.underline}**]{.mark} military [[capabilities]{.mark} and
**conduct ASAT targeting**]{.underline}.484 [The]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[possesses]{.underline} [the **most comprehensive network**]{.underline}
[of SST sensors]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [**maintains a database**
of]{.underline} [20,000+ space objects]{.underline}.485 However, [the
[U.S.]{.mark} military [**did not share** this data]{.mark}]{.underline}
until an Iridium satellite collided with a Russian military satellite,
prompting the amendment of 10 U.S.C. § 2274 to authorize the provision
of SSA services if they were consistent with national security
interests.486 After this event, the U.S. Strategic Command's SSA sharing
program grew exponentially, providing close approach notices to
satellite owner operators and freely sharing SST data on its website.487
This was a good first step, but an increase in the quantity of SST
sensors in the **[[past decade]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [**done
little** to]{.mark} **[bolster]{.mark} space traffic**]{.underline}
[[management]{.mark} efforts]{.underline} [[due]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[disjointed]{.mark}
nature**]{.underline} [of the [data]{.mark}]{.underline}.488 As the
space community attempts to consolidate SST data as part of a broader
SSA régime, multiple nascent SST data sharing organizations show that a
U.S. centric model is not guaranteed.489 The U.S. could put itself in a
dangerous situation if it attempts to control SST data for the purposes
of military use; this could potentially result in having complete
control over only a fraction of the SST market, while American
commercial SST companies lose their competitive edge.

It might not look it, but [our planet is a **fragile place**. A
**delicate balance** of pressure, temperature and gases **keeps us
alive**, as our atmosphere **lets in enough heat** for us to **thrive**
-- but **not too much** that we get **too toasty**]{.underline}. For
many years our planet has looked after itself with ease. [Now, with
humans on the scene, things are **changing more than ever**, from
**climate change** to **mass deforestation**. If our planet is **going
to survive** long into the future it's **going to need our
help**]{.underline}.

Fortunately, we've got plenty of missions that are working for the
benefit of our world already. Using **[observation
satellites]{.underline}** in orbit, scientists [have been **monitoring
Earth**]{.underline} for decades, watching how the planet pulsates and
changes over time. [From orbit we can **watch how species migrate**,
**identify** and **predict environmental changes** and even **fix
problems**]{.underline}.

A great example of this was the global effort to repair a hole in the
ozone above the Antarctic back in 1987. Two years prior, scientists had
discovered that chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) --
produced by fridges and aerosols, among other things -- were causing the
hole to grow. As a result countries around the world agreed to phase out
the use of CFC as part of the Montreal Protocol. In early 2018, NASA
announced that its Aura satellite had watched the hole successfully
close, with it expected to fully repair as early as 2060. It was proof
that we could work together to change the planet for the better.

Aura is part of a broader NASA project called the Earth Observing System
(EOS). This programme, which began in 1997, has seen NASA launch
missions and instruments into orbit. This has included the
groundbreaking Landsat series of satellites, which have provided surface
images of the whole globe. Then there's the Terra mission that launched
in 2009 and studies clouds, sea ice and more from orbit. Most of these
satellites are in polar orbits, which means they orbit the planet from
top to bottom so that it rotates underneath and gives them a global
view.

Planning for the EOS began back in the 1980s, with NASA keen to
regularly fly instruments for at least 15 years. "Human activity has
altered the condition of the Earth by reconfiguring the landscape, by
changing the composition of the global atmosphere, and by stressing the
biosphere in countless ways," they noted in a handbook in 1993. "There
are strong indications that natural change is being accelerated by human
intervention."

More than two dozen missions have been launched as part of the EOS to
date. Among the programme's many accomplishments, scientists watched as
an ice shelf collapsed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 2002 using the
Terra satellite. The same satellite, along with the Aqua satellite
launched in 2002, has provided a global view of how the vegetation cycle
changes over the course of a year and the effect the climate has on it.
Those same two satellites have also allowed us to see how summer sea ice
in the Arctic is decreasing, which means that more of the Sun's light is
being absorbed rather than being reflected, raising global temperatures.

The EOS has helped in other ways too, such as enabling scientists to
keep a close eye on the levels of toxic gases like carbon monoxide being
emitted from massive fires in the atmosphere. This allows people on the
ground to be alerted to these dangers, and they can in turn be advised
to limit their outdoor activity to protect their health. The EOS is even
helping to track and monitor rare animals, such as chameleons in
Madagascar. Here, scientists have been able to use satellite imagery,
combined with known habitats of the animals, to map out where they are
likely to be living. It would take survey teams on the ground thousands
of years to replicate this information without satellites.

It's not just NASA that has been keeping a close eye on the planet. The
European Space Agency (ESA) runs the Copernicus project, billed as the
world's largest single Earth observation campaign. Previously known as
the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme, it
began with the launch of the Sentinel-1A satellite in April 2014. This
radar imaging satellite provides images both day and night and during
all weather conditions, and these are being used to map sea ice, track
oil spills and more.

This has been followed by half a dozen more missions, with the latest --
Sentinel-3B -- launching on 25 April 2018. This mission is focusing on
monitoring the behaviour and health of the oceans, but it has a wide

Sentinel-3A, and together the two of them can provide global data for
Earth across an entire day. The [satellites can **measure the
temperature over oceans**]{.underline}, as well as the colour and height
of the sea. They can also [**monitor wildfires from space**, **check the
health of vegetation** and **map the way that land is being used**

[satellites]{.underline} on the way. In the coming years we'll see the
Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 missions launch, studying the composition of
our planet's atmosphere, while Sentinel-6 will measure global sea

1\. Growing Number of Objects in Space

[**[Space]{.mark}** is [becoming]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
**[more [crowded]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [in the last **60
years**]{.underline} [nearly 8,500]{.underline} [objects]{.underline}
have been **[launched to space]{.underline}**, about 1,500 in
geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and about 7,000 in low Earth orbit
(LEO) (McDowell 2018). [A [large **fraction**
remains]{.mark}]{.underline} (Figure 2-1) [especially [in
**LEO**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Figure 2-2). Going forward, LEO is
expected to become more crowded. As an illustration, [over
6,200]{.underline} small [satellites]{.underline} (satellites weighing
less than 500 kg) are **[expected to be launched]{.underline}** between
2017 and 2026 (Euroconsult 2017a). Although the main space players will
continue to dominate (85 percent of the government space market will
remain concentrated in the 10 countries with an established space
industry---U.S., Russia, China, Japan, India, and the top five European
countries), the other 50 countries engaged in space will launch almost
200 satellites by 2026, twice the number they launched over the past 10
years (Euroconsult 2017a, b).

[The **[concern]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} not]{.underline}
just [the **[increasing]{.mark} number** of satellites]{.underline} and
active payloads, [but the **amount of [debris]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(rocket bodies, other inert bodies, dead payloads) [[in]{.mark} **earth
[orbit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which comprises more than 95 percent of
the currently tracked objects in space. The U.S. Department of Defense
(DoD) is currently tracking 23,000 objects larger than 10 cm in diameter
in Earth orbit (of these, almost 16,000 are in LEO, of which nearly
13,000 were classified as space debris ). An estimated 500,000 objects
larger than 1 cm in diameter are not currently tracked, and over 100
million objects smaller than 1 mm in diameter are likely not trackable
(NASA Orbital Debris Program Office). It is not

trivial to identify space debris and other junk, especially objects
under 10 cm, using active beacons or other markers (e.g., radiofrequency
tracking); they need to be physically spotted and tracked. Starting in
2019, the U.S. Air Force\'s Space Fence System will bring the catalog of
debris tracked by Space Command from 23,000 to an estimated 200,000
objects. Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2 visually show the overwhelming
fraction of debris in space by orbit.

In addition to implications for the safety and sustainability of the
future space environment, these capabilities have other policy
implications. For example, the principal reason Swarm Technologies\'
sandwich-sized \"Space Bees\" did not get a spectrum license from the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was due to concerns that they
might not be tracked consistently by DoD.7,8

2\. Growing Number of Operators in Space

It is not just the number of satellites that is increasing: the number
of satellite operators has been increasing steadily over the last 60
years (Figure 2-3). [More **countries** have **become active** in
space]{.underline}. Figure 2-4 plots data on number of satellites
launched by country, and shows the crowding in the 2010s. This changing
landscape is driven by two primary trends: increasing State interest in
independent national space programs and the globalization of the
aerospace industry (Schroegl 2018).

**[[Smaller]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [lighter]{.underline}, [and **more
capable** [satellites]{.mark}]{.underline} [[make]{.underline}]{.mark}
Earth observation and **[remote [sensing]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[within]{.mark} the [reach]{.mark}]{.underline} not just
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} countries, but also [**[corporations]{.mark}**
and individuals]{.underline}. For example, Bank Rakyat in Indonesia has
launched a satellite, built by Space System Loral and launched by
Arianespace, to manage its 50 million accounts. Another example is the
satellite launched by NanoRacks by an individual who wanted to fly a
cubesat and was able to afford it. [This [trend]{.mark} is **likely [to
continue]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [making the **space
environment**]{.underline} increasingly **[more crowded]{.underline}**.
\*\*\*FIGURE 2-1,2,3,4 OMITTED\*\*\*There is also growing participation
in space by the private sector. It is important to note, however, that
private space, especially in the near- and mid-term, is primarily a U.S.
phenomenon. For most other countries, space is still a
strategically-oriented government-run activity. Of the 44 companies that
plan to launch constellations between 2017 and 2025, 20 are in the
United States (Lal et al. 2017). Of the almost 10,000 satellites that
are expected to launch as part of constellations, over 80 percent are
from companies in the United States (Euroconsult 2016). More generally,
of the 1,700 space companies listed by NewSpace Ventures, about half are
headquartered in the United States; the remaining half were distributed
around the rest of the world (see Figure 2-5).

The increased number of owners and operators requires more coordination
and governance in space, given that a standardization system to
coordinate on-orbit behaviors across operators (other than spectrum,
which is coordinated by the ITU) does not currently exist. Each private
entity (e.g., universities, research institutes, non-profits, commercial
companies) is governed by its licensing nation, potentially resulting in
a varied set of behaviors in space. This issue could be exacerbated as
the number of nations launching government assets as well as licensing
private entities continues to increase. 

3\. Changing Space Activities and Architectures

The current U.S. military SSA system relies heavily on sensors
originally created for missile warning and works relatively well for
tracking satellites in simple orbits around Earth. However, emerging
architectures will change the way objects will need to be tracked
Emerging applications, including missions related to rendezvous and
proximity operations, such as satellite servicing and refueling,
inspection, space RF mapping, and space-based spacecraft assembly and
manufacturing, will require SSA services that would be qualitatively
different than the current system.

For example, formation flying---the ability for satellites to act as
single units while they maintain similar orbits and operate within close
proximity to one another---poses challenges to current DoD SSA systems,
as these systems are not optimized to differentiate objects that are
closer together; the space of uncertainty around each object is
compromised by each object\'s closeness to other satellites in the
constellation. Additionally, tracking and predicting the orbits of
constellations containing hundreds of small satellites may challenge
existing systems due to the number and size of objects involved. Going
forward, the number of satellites in such systems is expected to
increase. Figure 2-6 shows 60 companies that have plans to launch
constellations. While only a fraction of these plans are likely to pan
out, it is an important driver of changes required in the SSA system.
Beyond constellations, further changes in the space sector include
growing activity in several other areas beyond remote sensing and
communication. \*\*\*BEGIN FOOTNOTE 10\*\*\*One example of a new
activity is the **[removal of space debris]{.underline}** -- the goal
being to decrease the number of objects in space and thus reduce
collision risk. [[Beyond]{.mark} the **[technical]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and **regulatory challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., restrictions
on the ability to move an object even if it is no longer in use),
[[any]{.mark}
**[d]{.mark}**]{.underline}e**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**ris
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**emoval **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**ction
[[will **require more**]{.underline}]{.mark} and more accurate
**[[SSA]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\*\*\*END FOOTNOTE 10\*\*\* Countries are
operating satellites across orbits with varied capabilities, further
complicating orbital prediction as the nature of any object in space
becomes further unpredictable. Satellite operations automation, the
continuous thrust allowed by electric propulsion, and other non-
Keplerian activities for which the DoD system is not optimized make
tracking difficult as the satellites\' orbits can change any time,
compromising the effectiveness of orbit prediction.

The popularity of electric propulsion on satellites has grown since the
1990s and implementation has increased sharply in the last decade; many
of the proposed large LEO constellations require electric propulsion
(Lev et al. 2017) and many GEO satellites now use electric propulsion as
well. Unlike chemical thrusters, which impart thrust at one time,
electric propulsion systems can impart thrust over the course of many
months. This increases the number of observations needed to understand
the satellite\'s new orbit. It also creates challenges for astrodynamics
algorithms that model maneuvers as instantaneous, as well as catalog
maintenance routines that only update orbits every several hours (such
as that of the 18 SPCS). This capability can also be used to change a
satellite\'s orbit mid-life, further complicating tracking. Although
many small satellites do not have an on-board propulsion system, some
small satellites in low Earth orbit can change their orbit by orienting
themselves in such a way to increase atmospheric drag, again affecting
projections of the satellites trajectories. Impulsive maneuvers through
chemical propulsion bring their own set of challenges, given that a
spacecraft moving with electric propulsion can be reflected in the
surveillance data (e.g., through a negative drag coefficient) as long as
the thrust is constant. Additionally, impulsive maneuvers can be
challenging to account for with existing U.S. military satellite
surveillance capabilities; thus, the image from a surveillance system is
not reliable, given that more impulsive maneuvers may occur. An accurate
prediction of such an object requires operator-level data that details
whether a maneuver is taking place. This operator data is often not
openly shared with providers; the necessity of this information suggests
that cooperation for SSA is inevitable. An example of this is the
actions of Space Data Association (SDA) in GEO, and a similar effort is
likely in LEO, especially in response to the large satellite
constellations that have been proposed (Schrogel, 2018).

Materials and specifics of satellites---e.g., size (smaller satellites
and components), composition, and antenna technology both hardware and
software (e.g., software defined radio)--- can make the satellites more
difficult to detect, especially given the limitations imposed by the
rotation speeds of telescopes, which minimize the opportunities to sight
and track objects. More efficient and smaller space electronics mean
that power requirements of systems are shrinking, which in turn reduces
the need for large solar panels. This not only reduces the satellite
cross section, but may also reduce the reflectivity of satellites.

New technologies and smaller satellite components have enabled satellite
operators to increase the capabilities of satellites in ever-smaller
form factors. New materials used in satellite composition affect
tracking attributes such as reflectivity. Cubesats and chipsats have
smaller cross-sections and are thus more difficult to observe. These
cross-sections are reduced even further by the improved technologies
that allow for smaller antennas and solar panels. The cubesat standard
is a satellite architecture based on 10 cm-wide units. This standard has
led to an increase in commercial availability of small standardized
parts, which in turn has led to a decrease in the price of components
for such satellites, which can now be mass produced rather than built
individually and/or by hand. Additionally, major providers of launch
services have designed satellite deployment units for the cubesat
standard, further increasing the number of entities that will use this
standard when designing satellites. Chipsats are standalone satellites
built onto computer chips approximately the size of a credit card.
Because of their size, many of these satellites do not have propulsion
units, making predictions of their orbits easier once they are detected.
However, due to their small form factors, initial and follow-up
detection is difficult without higher resolution telescopes. One reason
FCC turned down the Swarm Technologies\' license application was that
there was concern that their satellites were too small to be reliably
tracked by DoD.

[[Future]{.mark} **space [activities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that
[allow]{.mark}]{.underline} and often require **[close
[proximity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} space
[objects]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., rendezvous and docking, on-orbit
servicing or assembly) [[will require]{.underline}]{.mark} **[even
[more]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[precise]{.underline}]{.mark}** orbital
**[estimations and [predictions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to **avoid
collisions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Companies engaged in such activities
would need to supplement DoD information with on-board or space-based
sensors to more precisely assess their location with regard to other
objects in close proximity.

B. Growing Concerns about Increasing Collisions

Although relatively few catastrophic collisions have occurred thus far
in space, the [**[likelihood of]{.mark} a [collision]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} predicted [to **increase**]{.mark} in the]{.underline} near
[future]{.underline}, [given the **expected**]{.underline} [growing
number]{.underline} of objects in both LEO and GEO [and **limited
ability to track**]{.underline} objects\' orbits, which will make it
difficult for operators to adequately avoid threats. This problem may be
exacerbated if any of the proposed constellations of small satellites in
LEO (shown in Figure 2-6 above) are launched, as they will
**[dramatically increase]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [number of
objects]{.underline} [that [require]{.mark} tracking]{.underline}, thus
[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the tracking and
[**[computation]{.mark}al requirements** [for
**SSA**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in]{.underline} general and **[conjunction
[warnings]{.mark}]{.underline}** in particular. Some industry
representatives interviewed for the project noted that the emergence of
constellations is driving the need for higher precision knowledge and
services to mitigate the risk of collision: if numerous small satellites
are deployed at once, tracking can be difficult, as resolution may not
be great enough to distinguish multiple satellites.

NASA projects nearly one collision per year in the next 200 years if
there is no debris mitigation. Independently, insurance companies have
predicted a total exposure of \$1.3 billion in LEO and \$18 billion in
GEO (Lal et al. 2015).

To estimate the number of collisions resulting from the increasing
number of small satellites, several simulations of expected collisions
per year for a number of large satellite constellations in LEO over 200
years have been conducted (Muelhaupt 2017). One such exercise evaluated
the effect of adding two large constellations---those of SpaceX and
OneWeb---to the current constellations in LEO (Iridium, Orbcomm, and
Globalstar). The simulations found that within its first 20 years in
orbit, the first constellation is expected to cause one collision
annually; this number would grow to approximately 8 per year at its peak
collision rate, which occurs about 190 years after launch (see Figure
2-7). [Although the **majority** of the collisions]{.underline} in the
simulation [were]{.underline} **[due to satellites]{.underline}** [that
**failed to be deorbited**]{.underline} following end-of-life protocol,
[satellites that]{.underline} **[did attempt]{.underline}** [to be
deorbited]{.underline} [**still accounted** for]{.underline}
approximately **[40 percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} the total
[collisions]{.underline}.

Given that the systems developed to track space objects were developed
at a time there were fewer objects in space, the [[accuracy]{.mark} of
**prediction [is low]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Oftentimes, a
[[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark} conjunction [[warning]{.mark}
[message]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has **an error**]{.mark}
**ellipse**]{.underline} [of 100 km or more]{.underline}; [the [rate of
**false positives**]{.mark} is **[high]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as
well]{.underline}. Because of these two factors, as traffic in space
grows, both the number of conjunction warning messages as well as the
rates of both false positives---and false negatives--- are likely to
increase. For example, one study estimated that upon launch of its
proposed constellation, SpaceX would receive 7.2 million conjunction
warnings per year, and Iridium would receive about 384,000 per year.
Some operators, aware of the increasing risk of collision, will be more
likely to pay heed to notifications. This could result in increased
maneuvers as operators attempt to avoid collision, even if the warning
is not sound. These maneuvers---even if they are reported to the
providers of SSA (e.g., the DoD, or commercial vendors), which may often
not be the case---will still contribute to uncertainty regarding
objects\' paths, thus compromising the resulting predictions. Other
operators, especially those with low-value assets, are likely to
continue to ignore warnings as they currently do, which is equally
problematic as they will collide with debris or put the onus to maneuver
fully on the operator of the asset it threatens.

[To avoid a **significant increase**]{.underline} in notifications,
[operators will]{.underline} increasingly [look for **higher quality
SSA**]{.underline} information. [This could put]{.underline} [**further
pressure** on emerging systems]{.underline} [to **improve** their
predictions]{.underline}.

C. Changing National Level Motivations

Space is increasingly recognized as a sector of strategic importance
with applications for security, capacity building, and social benefit.
The increasing number of countries seeking to use space for science,
safety, national security, and commercial purposes means increased
threats (both accidental and nefarious) of collision and harm to assets
(e.g., through radiofrequency interference).

1\. Growing Recognition of the Need for Timely and Actionable SSA
Services and Products

As space capabilities become integral to more applications (e.g., earth
observation, communications, global positioning), a growing number of
countries are recognizing the security and economic value of space and
increasing their spending in space. The number of countries involved in
space continues to increase: a decade ago, fewer than 50 countries were
investing in space; today, there are 70. In the coming decade, that
number is expected to increase to more than 80 countries, and the annual
government space expenditure globally is expected to double, from about
\$40 billion in 2006 to \$80 billion in 2026 (Euroconsult 2017b, c).
This increased value (both mission-specific and financial) has led many
nations to treat safety of such assets as higher priority, leading to
growing efforts to develop norms and guidelines for behavior in space.
Additionally, many countries (e.g., Brazil, China, France, Japan, and
South Africa) want to be (and be viewed as) responsible stewards of
space, and thus support these efforts.

In our dataset of 18 countries, most of those actively pursuing SSA
focus on protecting their assets from satellite collisions---due to both
the increasing number of assets and the increasing amount of space
debris on orbit. Some countries (e.g., Japan, Canada) generally pursue
protection of their space assets and interests---either for the sake of
those assets specifically, or for the role they play in national
security broadly. Some countries are more interested in the application
of SSA (e.g., the data products) while others (e.g., Japan) value the
collection and analysis side as well. SSA can also help with safe
operation and control of assets. Though most are concerned with on-orbit
collision warnings, some, such as India, use SSA only to avoid collision
on launch.

Interviewees from some nations, such as Germany, noted that SSA can be
useful in protecting what has been achieved in space thus far and
avoiding major incidents. ESA\'s SSA program is interested in developing
a hazard warning system by federating existing European assets and
developing new sensor technology, with the goal of securing Europe\'s
access to space, protecting the involved economies, and strengthening
European industry.

Some countries prioritize detection of risks to their territory, and
thus seek to detect either threats on reentry such as rogue space assets
(e.g., France) or natural threats such as space weather and asteroids
(e.g., South Africa). Some are specifically interested in protecting
their satellites used for Earth observation; for example,
representatives of Brazil note the importance of using space to protect
its borders given significant issues with drug trafficking. This
[**increasing reliance** on space]{.underline} [assets]{.underline} for
security [**necessitates** greater]{.underline} [interest]{.underline}
in and efforts [toward SSA]{.underline}. [For some]{.underline} (e.g.,
UK), [SSA is seen as **underpinning** all other]{.underline} space
[roles in that it **details the hazards**]{.underline}, risks, and
threats [to the domain]{.underline}.

Our discussions with stakeholders demonstrated some countries\' concerns
that if they do not participate in global discussions (e.g., long term
sustainability \[LTS\] guidelines), their national interests will not be
appropriately reflected in the rules, and they will miss out on critical
opportunities. This involvement suggests that more countries are
becoming concerned with safe and sustainable operations in
space---keeping space open to activities in the future and preventing
problems (e.g., proliferating debris) from adversely impacting or
precluding space activities. It is important to note that smaller and
less powerful countries benefit greatly from these international
discussions, as they are given a voice in the proceedings. More powerful
and established nations may not always agree, as these deliberations
have to include more players and typically take longer to conclude
negotiations. This is specifically true for European countries;
stakeholders noted that Europe can only have a voice in future
regulations regarding the creation of global space traffic regulation if
the EU and ESA work together. They noted that for European industry to
become involved in challenging projects and thus be competitive on a
global scale, the involved nations need to organize at the European
level.

2\. [**Lack of Confidence** in **DoD**]{.underline}-Provided
[Data]{.underline}

Many [**[stakeholders indicated]{.mark}** that they [need
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [[have]{.mark} **trust and
[confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the data [being
**shared**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} collision
[warnings]{.underline} [and other]{.underline} SSA
[products]{.underline}; [many **acknowledged** the]{.underline}
[usefulness of verifying]{.underline} the information [that is **part of
any database**]{.underline}. [There are [many]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**concerns** with]{.mark} the **current systems**]{.underline} for
provision of SSA. Some [operators **question the
[accuracy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} especially
the [**[completeness]{.mark}** of the]{.underline} [information provided
to them]{.underline} [[by the]{.underline}
**[DoD]{.underline}**]{.mark}. For example, some South Korean government
officials estimate that their country receives data on only about 40
percent of the objects tracked by the DoD, due to sensitivity of U.S.
assets.

[This [distrust]{.mark} is]{.underline} further [[**complicated**
by]{.mark} the **[lack of transparency]{.mark}**]{.underline} related to
computing outcomes such as probabilities of collision. [Owners and
**[operators]{.mark}**]{.underline} [believe]{.underline}
[they]{.underline} [[require more]{.mark} **\[high [quality\]
information]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} make **well-informed**]{.underline}
decisions about **[[maneuver]{.mark}ing]{.underline}**. But because they
do not know the process by which U.S.-provided information on an
object\'s location is processed into a collision assessment or warning,
they often do not feel confident maneuvering based on that warning.
Skepticism regarding the reliability of the shared information is
exacerbated by the nonstandard and nontransparent methods of calculation
(often referred to by stakeholders in our discussions as \"black box
processing\"). Beyond the distrust, [some users perceive]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} U.S. [**[DoD systems]{.mark}** as
**[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [given that they are **[not
well-suited]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[emerging]{.mark}]{.underline} space [[environment]{.underline}]{.mark};
additionally, given the separation of the provision of SSA from the
DoD\'s core mission, it is also perceived as overworked and
understaffed, leading to further dissatisfaction. There is also some
concern that going forward, the United States will either not share data
or will charge for it. This last concern has heightened the sense of
urgency in some countries to set up parallel SSA systems.

3\. National Security Considerations

[Many of the 18 countries]{.underline} [are **interested** in
**developing**]{.underline} or strengthening their
[strategic]{.underline} **[e]{.underline}**arly
**[w]{.underline}**arning capacitie**[s]{.underline}**, [specifically
regarding **space-based intelligence**]{.underline}, surveillance, and
[reconnaissance]{.underline} (e.g., South Korean awareness of potential
North Korean targeting, France\'s goal of detecting objects presenting a
risk to its territory). Often the national security goal is two-
pronged: entities are interested in protecting their own assets while
building knowledge of the location and intention of adversary assets.

[Beyond threats]{.underline}, [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} of these
**[[countries\' concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}** have been [[driven by
**recent**]{.mark} **space [events]{.mark}**]{.underline}---
[[natural]{.underline}]{.mark} and
**[[accidental]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the February 2013 [meteor

Syndrome on the number of satellites, the satellite sizes, and the
orbits of LCs. Simulations show: 1) that LCs of small satellites (\<25
kg) are significantly safer than constellations of medium (25 to 300 kg)
or large (\>300 kg) satellites, and 2) that if LCs of medium or large
satellite are deployed, they are safer at lower orbits, such as 450-km
rather than at 600-km or 1,200-km orbits. The orbital capacity (number
and type of satellites that can be sustainably deployed) and tipping
point (at which it is no longer possible to avoid a Kessler Syndrome by
ceasing launches) concepts are demonstrated.

1\. INTRODUCTION

[**Humanity** faces an **existential crisis**]{.underline}; space debris
are at risk of becoming the equivalent of a \"drifting island of
plastic\" \[1\]. Large constellation (LC) systems plan to operate tens
of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of satellites in low Earth
orbit (LEO) \[2\], posing the threat of an inglorious end to the Space
Age. [A \"**take risks and fail** often]{.underline}\"
[approach]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [new technology]{.underline} [is
being **extended**]{.underline} [to space]{.underline}
[without]{.underline} [considering that mistakes in space **cannot be
cleaned up**]{.underline} [as easily]{.underline} [as they
can]{.underline} [on Earth]{.underline}.

Satellites that cannot maneuver, cannot avoid collisions. Loss of
maneuverability can result from failures of satellite sub-systems in the
maneuver chain or from collisions with small (untracked) objects that
disable these subsystems. [Passive deorbit]{.underline}
[times]{.underline} [can be **minimized**]{.underline} [with
lower]{.underline} LEO [altitudes]{.underline} and larger area-to-mass
ratios [but can **still require years** depending]{.underline} [on
the]{.underline} solar [cycle]{.underline} and larger area-to-mass
ratios realized by increasing area can [lead to **increased collision
risk**.]{.underline}

Even satellites that can maneuver, can be involved in collisions.
Conjunction warnings may not be generated, not all lethal debris are
trackable. [Every time a satellite is **not maneuvered**]{.underline} in
response to a low probability conjunction warning, [there is a
**non-zero collision risk** that depends on the **s**]{.underline}pace
**[s]{.underline}**ituational **[a]{.underline}**wareness (SSA)
accuracy. Additionally, every time a satellite is maneuvered, there is
another non-zero probability that the maneuver will result in a
collision. In both cases, with a sufficient number of conjunctions
occurring, even six sigma events can become likely.

Collisions between LEO satellites are typically catastrophic resulting
in large numbers of new debris objects spread across LEO altitudes. For
example, there are currently 1439 tracked debris objects in orbit from
the 2009 collision between Iridium-33 and COSMOS-2251 \[3\]. Even though
the collision occurred at 800-km, the debris\' apogees now range from
400 km to over 1,600 km.

Constellations are appropriately analyzed over their orbital lifecycles.
LCs are incrementally deployed, and satellites are replenished as they
fail, reach end-of-life, or are replaced with more capable models. This
replenishment can be reasonably modeled to continue until the
constellation is no longer economically viable. The result is a
continuing process of orbit raising and phasing, and a combination of
active and passive deorbiting.

Sub-system failures and small object collisions can be mitigated with
sub-system redundancy, and small objects collision can be further
mitigated with shielding. Operational techniques, such as initiating
deorbit immediately after the (N - 1)-th failure with N-th redundancy,
can be used to improve the effective satellite reliability.

[The debris environment]{.underline} **[naturally evolves]{.underline}**
over time [as objects **decay**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [new
objects are **created**]{.underline} by collisions [between existing
debris objects]{.underline}. Satellite [collisions]{.underline} [can
cause **step increases**]{.underline} [in the debris
**population**]{.underline}. In addition, there are over 900 derelict
rocket bodies remaining in orbit which pose further debris generating
risk.

Previous work \[4\] using a simplistic model showed that reducing the
number of non-maneuverable satellites significantly increases the time
to Kessler Syndrome, a self-sustaining collision cascade \[5\]. Another
approach \[2\] used simplified rate equations to model population
evolution. One of the simplifications was ignoring collisions of debris
with other debris, precluding the possibility of a Kessler Syndrome.

This paper expands on the previous work with more sophisticated Markov
models and Monte Carlo simulations to explore the dependence of time to
Kessler Syndrome on key parameters of LCs (the number of satellites, the
satellite sizes, and the orbits). The approach is not only useful in the
design of environmentally friendly broadband LEO systems, but also in
assessing the environmental impact of existing and planned LC systems.
Further, it can help in understanding the implications of multiple LCs
occupying interleaving or overlapping orbits.

While it is generally agreed that LEO is a finite resource and that
collisions may lead to loss of access to space \[6\]\[7\]\[8\]\[9\],
this work can be used to help address the key questions:

1\) How many satellites are too many? What is the \"orbital capacity\",
the number and type of satellites that can be sustainably deployed in
each orbit without risking a Kessler Syndrome?

2\) How close are we to a \"tipping point\", i.e., how urgent is this
issue? A tipping point in that point in time at which it is no longer
possible to avoid a Kessler Syndrome by ceasing launches.

This is an active area of research with numerous contributions,
including \[10\]\[11\]\[12\].

The models are described in Section 2, Section 3 discusses the
simulation results, and the conclusions are summarized in Section 4.

2\. MODELS

A model is developed to explore the dependence of time to Kessler
Syndrome on the constellation sizes and orbits, and on the size of the
satellites deployed. The key simplifying assumptions employed to create
this model are:

1\. Only the LCs being studied are replenished over time, other
constellations and individual satellites are not replaced as they
deorbit, fail, or fragment.

2\. No new rocket bodies are left in orbit.

3\. Collisions with debris between 1 cm and 10 cm never result in
fragmentation, only the possibility of damage resulting in loss of
maneuverability, and the estimated 128 million debris from 1 mm to 1 cm
\[13\] are ignored.

4\. All orbits are circular, including those of satellites, debris, and
rocket bodies, and orbits are fully characterized by their altitude and
inclination.

5\. Objects are grouped into classes with one set of characteristics
modeled for each class.

6\. The probability of non-maneuverable satellites experiencing
catastrophic collisions is approximated as described in Section 2.4.1.

The first three assumptions are believed to be optimistic. Further work
is required to access the impact of the last three.

Objects are divided into 10 classes. At the top level, objects are
categorized as satellite (S), debris (D), or rocket body (RB).
Satellites are sub-categorized as maneuverable (SM) or non-maneuverable
(SN). They are further sub-categorized by mass: large (SML and SNL) for
mass greater than 300 kg, medium (SMM and SNM) for mass

between 25 kg and 300 kg, and small (SMS and SNS) for mass less than 25
kg. Debris are sub-categorized by diameter, large (DL) for 1 to 3 m
diameter, medium (DM) for 0.3 to 1 m diameter, and small (DS) for 0.1 to
0.3 m diameter. Rocket bodies (RB) are not further sub-categorized.

For each class, the number of objects in each orbit is stored in a
matrix with the structure shown in Fig. 1. The possible orbits include
all altitudes between 200 km and 2,000 km in 25 km bins (Sh = 25 km),
and all inclinations between 0° and 180° in 10° bins (Si = 10°). The
number of objects in each bin at time tm is X\^ . These matrices are
initialized using Space-Track SATCAT data \[3\]. A total of 16,621 LEO
orbits were used - 3,773 maneuverable satellites, 920 non-maneuverable
satellites, 10,992 debris, and 957 rocket bodies.

The LC orbit models are discussed in Section 2.1 and the object models
in Section 2.2. Section 2.3 introduces the state evolution model, and
the state transition probabilities are derived in Section 2.4. The
object life process models are discussed in Section 2.5.

2.1 Large Constellation (LC) Orbit Models

Three LC orbits are considered: 1) 450 km altitude at 40° inclination,
2) 600 km altitude at 50° inclination, and 3) 1,200 km altitude at 60°
inclination. These were selected to be representative of the LC orbits
proposed for various NGSO systems \[2\].

2.2 Object Models

The key parameters for each object class are shown in Tab. 1. They are
representative of objects in each class and are not based on any
specific objects. The area-to-mass ratios (A/M) of the non-maneuverable
satellites are modeled as one-half of those for the maneuverable
satellites to account for tumbling.

2.3 State Evolution Model

State evolution is modeled as shown in Fig. 2. Newly launched satellites
start in the Maneuverable State. At each time step, there are four
possibilities for evolution of maneuverable satellites (SML, SMM,
SMS): 1) transition to

the Non-Maneuverable State due to a failure or due to small object
collision damage that disables maneuverability, 2) transition to the
Fragmentation Process as the result of a large object collision, 3)
transition to the Decay Process due to atmospheric drag, or 4) remain in
the Maneuverable State.

Non-maneuverable Satellites (SNL, SNM, SNS), Debris (DL, DM, DS), and
Rocket Bodies (RB) are always in the Non-Maneuverable State. There are
three possibilities for these objects: 1) transition to the
Fragmentation Process as the result of a large object collision, 2)
transition to the Decay Process due to atmospheric drag, or 3) remain in
the Non-Maneuverable State.

2.4 Transition Probability Models

These models are used to calculate the transition probabilities for the
objects in each state at each time step. 2.4.1 Probability of
Non-Maneuverable Object Catastrophic Collision

PN2F is the probability of an object transitioning from the
Non-Maneuverable state to the Fragmentation process. The probability
that an object with radius r, in an orbit with altitude hj, inclination
ik, and shell thickness Sh experiences a collision over one orbit period
at time tm is given by

where is the total number of objects at altitude hj and inclination iq
at time tm, and noting that orbits are modeled as circular and the
object radius, r, is much less than Sh so that

The probability that an object in an orbit with altitude hj and
inclination ik experiences a collision with an object in an orbit with
altitude hj and inclination iq is approximated by

The first factor in the \"otherwise\" value approximates the probability
that both objects are inside a square with sides 2r on the surface of a
sphere. When the difference in inclinations is such that the crossing
angles for planes in a LC are near 0 or n, the geometry degenerates to a
single dimension, and the appropriate probability to consider is that of
both objects being in a segment of the orbit circle with length 2r. The
second factor is the probability that two objects in a square on the
surface of the sphere are in the same cube within an orbit shell of
height Sh, or equivalently for the degenerative case.

2.4.2 Probability of Maneuverable Object Catastrophic Collision

The probability of a maneuverable satellite transitioning to the
fragment process (PM2F) is the probability of a collision avoidance
failure, either due to an untracked object, a low probability
conjunction prediction being ignored, or an avoidance maneuver causing a
collision. It is modeled as

PM2F = AvoidanceFailureRate x PN2F

The avoidance failure rate is set to 0.1%, which assumes that 999 out of
every 1,000 collisions that would be experienced if the satellite did
not maneuver are avoided using maneuverability.

2.4.3 Probability of Maneuverable Object Orbit Decay

PM2D is the probability of a satellite object transitioning from the
Maneuverable state to the Decay process. It is modeled based on the
estimated satellite lifetime as

where St is the simulation step size in seconds and SatelliteLifetime is
in years.

Satellite design life is modeled as 5 years.

2.4.4 Probability of Non-Maneuverable Object Orbit Decay

PN2D is the probability of a non-maneuverable object transitioning from
the Non-Maneuverable state to the Decay process. Assuming that
atmospheric drag is the only nonconservative force and modeling the
orbits as circular the change in altitude over one period is given by
\[14\]

where St is the simulation time step in seconds and Sh is the object
matrix altitude bin size in kilometers. 2.4.5 Probability of Satellite
Becoming Non-Maneuverable

The probability of a maneuverable satellite transitioning to the
non-maneuverable state (PM2N) is the probability of loss of
maneuverability. This can occur either due to a failure mechanism or a
small object collision. It is modeled based on the estimated satellite
lifetime, satellite failure rate over lifetime, and probability of
maneuverability being lost due to a small object collision

where St is the simulation step size in seconds and SatelliteLifetime is
in years.

The small collision factor is set to 5.3 assuming that only 20% of the
collisions with debris between 1 cm and 10 cm result in loss of
maneuverability and noting that ESA estimates \[13\] that there are
900,000 debris objects in that range compared to 34,000 above 10 cm (0.2
x 900,000 / 34,000 = 5.3).

2.5 Object Life Process Models

The launch, decay, and fragmentation processes manage the life cycle of
the objects.

2.5.1 Launch Process

The launch process maintains the LC(s) being evaluated at a fixed size
for the duration of the analysis. The appropriate object flux matrix
(SML, SMM, or SMS) is updated by maintaining a constant number of
satellites in the object matrix cell corresponding to the orbit
(altitude and inclination) of each LC at each timestep.

2.5.2 Decay Process

The decay process moves non-maneuverable objects to the next lower row
of the object matrix. If an object in the h1 row decays, it is assumed
to have completed deorbit, and is removed from the object matrix. For
maneuverable satellites, the decay process moves them to a 300-km
circular disposal orbit as non-maneuverable satellites.

2.5.3 Fragmentation Process

When a collision occurs, the fragmentation process removes the objects
involved from the associated object matrices, determines the numbers and
characteristics of the fragments, and adds the new objects to the
appropriate debris matrices. Fragments with perigee \<200 km or mean
altitude outside the 200 km to 2,000 km LEO range are dropped from the
model.

The Fragmentation Process is modeled based on the MASTER-8 version of
the EVOLVE 4.0 NASA Standard Breakup Model for spacecraft \[15\]. The
number of fragments is determined from a power law distribution
characterized by the object masses and the minimum and maximum object
sizes. It is well known that the NASA model does not conserve mass, and
many workarounds have been proposed. However, for this analysis, the
important quantiles are the number of fragments, their diameter
distribution, and their velocity distribution.

The number of fragments with size in the range from dMIN (m) to dMAX (m)
is given by

Assuming that all collisions are fragmenting (specific kinetic energy of
projectile, greater than 40 J/g) and truncating at a minimum fragment
size to dMIN and maximum fragment size to dMAX, the cdf for fragment
diameter is given by

Area-to-mass ratio is characterized by a bi-normal distribution
parametrized based on 5 = log10 (dF) for x = logw(A/MF)

where the parameters a, p1, oi, and a2 are functions of S.

The fragment delta velocity (m/s) is related to the fragment A/M (m2/kg)
for fragmenting collisions by

The delta velocity is uniformly distributed over a sphere, added to the
state vector for a randomly located object in the original orbit, and
the resulting state vector converted to orbital elements to determine
the delta altitude and inclination of each fragment relative to the
original orbit.

The number of fragments and distributions for the fragment diameters,
area-to-mass ratio, and delta altitude are shown in Fig. 3 for dMIN =
0.1 m and dMAX = 3 m. \*\*\*FIGURE 3 OMITTED\*\*\*

3\. SIMULATIONS

Monte Carlo simulations are used to characterize the debris population
sensitivity to LC orbits and satellite sizes over one hundred years, or
until a Kessler Syndrome occurs. The simulation flow is shown in Fig. 4.
\*\*\*FIGURE 4 OMITTED\*\*\*Initially, 146 cases were run, a baseline
case with the initial object matrices and no new satellite launches, and
an additional 145 cases based on 29 configurations (combinations) of
small (15 kg), medium (250 kg), and/or large (500 kg) satellites in the
three orbits considered. Each configuration results in 5 cases with
10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, or 50,000 satellites maintained in each
orbit. Depending on the case, from 10,000 to 150,000 satellites are
maintained in orbit.

The simulation parameters are summarized in Tab. 2. The start year is
used to determine the solar flux at each time step, which is used to
compute the atmospheric density in Section 2.4.4. The 100-year duration
was selected to focus on near-term (in a cosmic sense) events. The time
step, altitude bin size, and inclination bin size are selected to
provide reasonable simulation times. Reducing the first two by an order
of magnitude did not significantly change the results. Reducing the
inclination step size by an order of magnitude resulted in an observable
increase in the time to Kessler Syndrome but did not change the relative
times between cases. LC satellites typically range from 3 to 10 year
predicted lifetimes; 5 years is selected as a representative value. The
ODMSP \[16\] requires that LC satellites have a 90% probability of
successful post mission disposal with a goal of 99%. The 5% failure rate
(95% success rate) is chosen to be in the middle of this range. The
small constellation factor is discussed in Section 2.4.5 and avoidance
failure rate in Section 2.4.2. Sensitivity analysis was not preformed
with respect to the last 4 parameters.

The baseline case does not result in a Kessler Syndrome after 100 years.
Tab. 3 shows the time to Kessler syndrome (years) for the remaining 145
cases. There are twenty-nine rows for the configurations and 5 columns
for the number of satellites per orbit. The Satellite Size/Orbit columns
indicate which orbits are populated for each configuration and with
which size satellites: S - small (15 kg), M - medium (250 kg), or L -
large (500 kg). For example, the Configuration 1 / 10K case is 10,000
small satellites in 450-km orbits, for that case a Kessler Syndrome did
not occur within 100 years. Another example, the Configuration 22 / 30K
case is 30,000 small satellites in 450-km orbits and 30,000 medium
satellites in 600-km orbits, that case results in Kessler Syndrome in
23.4 years.

It is seen that the number of satellites, the satellite size, and the
orbit altitude all matter. None of the cases consisting of only small
(15-kg) satellites experiences a Kessler Syndrome within 100 years. This
includes the 150,000-satellite case with 50,000 satellites in each
orbit. The cases with at least 30,000 medium (250-kg) satellites in the
600-km or 1,200-km orbits experience a Kessler Syndrome within 25 years.
The cases with at least 10,000 large (500-kg) satellites in the 600-km
or 1,200-km orbits experience a Kessler Syndrome within 12.5 years.

Configurations 28 and 29 are interesting. In Configuration 28, small
satellites (15-kg) are maintained in the 450-km orbit and large
satellites (500-kg) in the 1,2000-km orbit. In Configuration 29, the
sizes are reversed, large in 450km and small in 1,200-km. In both
configurations, medium satellites are maintained in the 600-km orbit.
The time to Kessler Syndrome for of the numbers of satellites per orbit
is from 3 to over 10 times longer for the Configuration 29 cases. All
these cases have the same number of satellites and the same total mass
in orbit. The only difference is the switch of which orbits the small
and large satellites occupy. Clearly, the larger satellites in lower
orbit are safer than the larger satellites in higher orbit.

Four cases are explored in more detail. The baseline case in Section
3.1, the 150,000 small satellite case in Section 3.2, the 30,000 medium
satellite 600-km orbit case in Section 3.3, and the 10,000 large
satellite 1,200-km orbit case in Section 3.4.\*\*\*TABLE 3 OMITTED\*\*\*

3.1 Baseline Case

The time evolution of the baseline case is shown in Fig. 5. The
maneuverable (active) satellites (solid lines) completely decay due to
the 5-year lifetime model and post mission disposal of maneuverable
satellites. The number of rocket bodies (dash-dot-dash line) decreases
due to drag and collisions. The number of non-maneuverable (passive)
satellites (dashed lines) deceases initially due to decay at the lower
altitudes and then stabilizes. The debris (dotted lines) are observed to
grow exponentially with an approximately 6-year time constant until the
active satellites decay, and then at a much slower rate (approximately
100-year time constant). \*\*\*FIGURE 5 OMITTED\*\*\*

Fig. 6 compares the object fluxes at the start of simulation and at the
end, 100 years later. After 100 years, debris growth has increased the
number of objects in the orbits that had the higher object
concentrations.

The evolution of objects by altitude in the baseline case is shown in
Fig. 7. An interesting feature is the clear indication of the solar
cycle in the decay below 400 km. It is also interesting to note the
spread of objects into higher orbits over time. As there are no new
launches, the only mechanism for this in the model are fragmentation
events.

3.2 150,000 Small Satellites Case (Configuration 19 / 50K)

In this case the LCs consist of 50,000 small satellites in the 450-km
orbits, 50,000 small satellites in the 600-km orbits, and 50,000 small
satellites in the 1,200-km orbits, for a total of 150,000 satellites.
After 100 years, there is little difference in object distribution by
orbit compared to the baseline (no new launches) case, as shown in Fig.
8. The additional objects around 1,200 km are from the operational
satellites at that orbit, the debris spread around that orbit, and the
non-maneuverable satellites decaying from that orbit.

height="1.186930227471566in"}

3.3 30,000 Medium Satellite at 600-km Orbit Case (Configuration 5 / 30K)

In this case the LC consists of 30,000 medium satellites in the 600-km
orbits. The result is a Kessler Syndrome in slightly more than 22 years,
consuming the satellites in that orbit and creating millions of debris
objects. The evolution of the object classes in shown in Fig. 9. The SMM
curve jumps to 30,000 at time zero and continues at that level until
just before the Kessler Syndrome when the satellites are consumed by the
debris. Fragmentation of LC satellites that lose maneuverability due to
failures or small object collisions cause the increase in the SNM curve.
Fragments from these non-maneuverable satellites as they experience
collisions result in the increases of the DL, DM, and DS curves. The
approximately 11,000 lethal debris objects at time zero grows to over 33
million at the start of Kessler Syndrome.

The debris evolution by altitude is shown in Fig. 10. The spike in
debris around 600-km leading to the Kessler Syndrome is apparent.

[An **interesting question**]{.underline} raised by these results -
[when is the **tipping point**]{.underline}? Additional simulations were
run to address this question for the 30,000 medium satellites in the
600-km orbit case. The previous results showed a Kessler Syndrome
occurring in 22 years. Stopping launches after year 15 was found to
reliably avoid a Kessler Syndrome within the 100-year simulation time.

Fig. 11 compares the object evolution for the continuous launch and the
launch stop after 15 years cases. Note that the time scales are
different. The continuous launch case plot ends at the time of Kessler
Syndrome while the stop after 15 years case plot continues for 100
years.

As shown in Fig. 12 and Fig. 13, stopping launches after 20 years delays
the Kessler Syndrome by 4 years but does not prevent it - the tipping
point has been reached.

**"systemic risk"**]{.underline} [approach is a more]{.underline}
appropriate [concept]{.underline} [for space debris]{.underline} risk
[assessment]{.underline}. [Systemic risk [is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[sometimes]{.underline} [called **network risk**]{.underline}, [since it

**cause-effect** [interaction]{.mark}s]{.underline} among individual
elements or agents with different and often conflicting interests. In
addition, each element or agent is characterized by its own risk
portfolio. The examples of systemic risks are the financial crisis of
2008, pandemics, cybersecurity, global climate change. [Systemic
risks]{.underline} can [[trigger]{.underline}
**[unexpected]{.underline}**]{.mark} [largescale changes]{.underline} to

the importance of challenging standard approaches for risk assessment
\[83\]. Because in a systems-approach there may be many competing
solutions with no clear best, the challenge for their governance is to
assure transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness of the risk
management process, and effectiveness, stationarity, equity, and
sustainability of the outcome \[84\]. One of the solutions is the
principle of collective responsibility proposed by Helbing, D. \[85\].

Compared to critical risks, [**systemic** [risks]{.mark}]{.underline} do
not attract the same attention and [[tend to be
**underestimated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The OECD defines critical risks
as a rapid-onset event that pose the strategically significant risks as
a result of their probability and likelihood. Another spaceborne hazard,
space weather, was defined as a future global shock by the OECD \[86\].
Therefore, the concept of critical infrastructure resilience with
respect to space threats is mainly focused on ground-based critical
infrastructures, especially on power grids, which is the current
backbone of modern critical infrastructures \[87, 88\]. Governments
established the programs for assessing space weather risk, and this risk
is included in the national risk portfolio of several countries (USA,
Canada, Finland, Sweden, Norway, United Kingdom, Germany, the
Netherlands, Hungary). They specified the tasks that will lead to
improvements in policies, practices and procedures for decreasing
vulnerability.

[Another set]{.underline} of passive threats, sometimes not included in

Since December 2019, the [sun]{.underline} has [been **moving**
into]{.underline} [a **busier part**]{.underline} [of its
cycle]{.underline}, [when]{.underline} increasingly [**intense pulses**
of energy]{.underline} [can shoot]{.underline} [out in all
directions]{.underline}. [Some of these]{.underline} large
**[bursts]{.underline}** of charged particles [head right **toward
Earth**]{.underline}. [Without a **good way** to]{.underline}
**[anticipate]{.underline}** these solar [storms]{.underline}, [we're
**vulnerable**]{.underline}. [A big one could take out]{.underline} a
swath of our **[comm]{.underline}**unication system**[s]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} power **[grids]{.underline}** before we even knew what
hit us.

[A]{.underline} recent **[near miss]{.underline}** [occurred in the
**summer of 2012**]{.underline}. [A giant]{.underline} solar
[storm]{.underline} [hurled a **radiation-packed blob**]{.underline} in
Earth's direction [at more than 9 million]{.underline}
**[k]{.underline}**ilo**[m]{.underline}**eter**[s]{.underline}** [per
hour]{.underline}. The potentially debilitating burst quickly traversed
the nearly 150 million kilometers toward our planet, and would have hit
Earth had it come just a week earlier. [Scientists]{.underline}
[**learned** about it]{.underline} **[after the fact]{.underline}**,
[only because it **struck**]{.underline} [a]{.underline} NASA
[satellite]{.underline} **[designed to watch]{.underline}** [for
this]{.underline} kind of space [weather.]{.underline}

[That 2012 storm]{.underline} [was the **most intense**]{.underline}
[researchers]{.underline} [have **measured since 1859**]{.underline}.
When a powerful storm hit the Northern Hemisphere in September of that
year, people were not so lucky. Many [telegraph]{.underline}
[systems]{.underline} throughout Europe and North America
[failed,]{.underline} and the electrified lines shocked some telegraph
operators. It [came to be known]{.underline} [as the Carrington
Event]{.underline}, named after British astronomer Richard Carrington,
who witnessed intensely bright patches of light in the sky and recorded
what he saw.

The world has moved way beyond telegraph systems. A Carrington-level
impact today would knock out satellites, disrupting GPS, mobile phone
networks and internet connections. Banking systems, aviation, trains and
traffic signals would take a hit as well. Damaged power grids would take
months or more to repair.

To avoid such destruction, in October then-President Donald Trump signed
a bill that will support research to produce better space weather
forecasts and assess possible impacts, and enable better coordination
among agencies like NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

"We understand a little bit about how these solar storms form, but we
can't predict \[them\] well," says atmospheric and space scientist Aaron
Ridley of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Just as scientists
know how to map the likely path of tornadoes and hurricanes, Ridley
hopes to see the same capabilities for predicting space weather.

[The **ideal scenario**]{.underline} [is to get **warnings well before**
a storm]{.underline} [disables]{.underline} [satellites]{.underline} [or
**makes landfall**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[possibly]{.underline} [**even before** the sun]{.underline}
**[sends]{.underline}** charged [particles]{.underline} [in our
direction]{.underline}. [With **advance warning**]{.underline},
[utilities and governments]{.underline} [could **power down the
grids**]{.underline} [and **move satellites**]{.underline} [out
of]{.underline} **[harm's way]{.underline}**.

Ridley is part of a U.S. collaboration creating simulations of solar
storms to help scientists quickly and accurately forecast where the
storms will go, how intense they will be and when they might affect
important satellites and power grids on Earth. Considering the havoc an
extreme solar storm could wreak, many scientists and governments want to
develop better forecasts as soon as possible.

Ebbs and flows

When scientists talk about space weather, they're usually referring to
two things: the solar wind, a constant stream of charged particles
flowing away from the sun, and coronal mass ejections, huge outbursts of
charged particles, or plasma, blown out from the sun's outer layers (SN
Online: 3/7/19). Some other phenomena, like high-energy particles called
cosmic rays, also count as space weather, but they don't cause much
concern.

Coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, the most threatening kind of solar
storms, aren't always harmful --- they generate dazzling auroras near
the poles, after all. But considering the risks of a storm shutting down
key military and commercial satellites or harming the health of
astronauts in orbit, it's understandable that scientists and governments
are concerned.

Astronomers have been peering at our solar companion for centuries. In
the 17th century, Galileo was among the first to spy sunspots, slightly
cooler areas on the sun's surface with strong magnetic fields that are
often a precursor to more intense solar activity. His successors later
noticed that sunspots often produce bursts of radiation called solar
flares. The complex, shifting magnetic field of the sun also sometimes
makes filaments or loops of plasma thousands of kilometers across erupt
from the sun's outer layers. These kinds of solar eruptions can generate
CMEs.

"The sun's magnetic field lines can get complicated and twisted up like
taffy in certain regions," says Mary Hudson, a physicist at Dartmouth
College. Those lines can break like a rubber band and launch a big chunk
of corona into interplanetary space.

It was 19th century German astronomer Samuel Heinrich Schwabe who
realized that such solar activity ebbs and flows during 11-year cycles.
This happens because the sun's magnetic field completely flips every 11
years. The most recent sun cycle ended in December 2019, and we're
emerging from the nadir of sun activity while heading toward the maximum
of cycle 25 (astronomers started numbering solar cycles in the 19th
century). Solar storms, particularly the dangerous CMEs, are now
becoming more frequent and intense, and should peak between 2024 and
2026.

Up and down

The number of sunspots, and other **[solar activity]{.underline}** that
generates solar storms, rises and falls in an 11-year cycle. Solar cycle
25 began in December 2019 and is [**expected to peak** in
2025]{.underline}.

Solar storms develop from the sun's complex magnetic field. The sun
rotates faster at its equator than at its poles, and since it's not a
solid sphere, its magnetic field constantly roils and swirls around. At
the same time, heat from the sun's interior rises to the surface, with
charged particles bringing new magnetic fields with them. The most
intense CMEs usually come from the most vigorous period in a
particularly active solar cycle, but there's a lot of variation. The
1859 CME originated from a fairly modest solar cycle, Hudson points out.

A CME has multiple components. If the CME is on a trajectory toward
Earth, the first thing to arrive --- just eight minutes after it leaves
the sun --- is the electromagnetic radiation, which moves at the speed
of light. CMEs often produce a shock wave that accelerates protons to
extremely fast speeds, and those arrive within 20 minutes of the light.
Such energetic particles can damage the electronics or solar cells of
satellites in high orbits. Those particles could also harm any
astronauts outside of Earth's protective magnetic field, including any
on the moon. A crew on board the International Space Station, inside
Earth's magnetic field, however, would most likely be safe.

But a CME's biggest threat --- its giant cloud of plasma, which can be
millions of kilometers wide --- typically takes between one and three
days to reach our planet, depending on how fast the sun propelled the
shotgun blast of particles toward us. Earth's magnetic field, our first
defense against space weather and space radiation, can protect us from
only so much. Satellites and ground-based observations have shown that a
CME's charged particles interact with and distort the magnetic field.
Those interactions can have two important effects: producing more
intense electric currents in the upper atmosphere and shifting these
stronger currents away from the poles to places with more people and
more infrastructure, Ridley says. With an extremely powerful storm, it's
these potentially massive currents that put satellites and power grids
at risk.

Anyone who depends on long-distance radio signals or telecommunications
might have to do without them until the storm blows over and damaged
satellites are repaired or replaced. A powerful storm can disturb
airplanes in flight, too, as pilots lose contact with air traffic
controllers. While these are temporary effects, typically lasting up to
a day, impacts on the electrical grids could be worse.

A massive CME could suddenly and unexpectedly drive currents of kiloamps
rather than the usual amps through power grid wires on Earth,
overwhelming transformers and making them melt or explode. The entire
province of Quebec, with nearly 7 million people, suffered a power
blackout that lasted more than nine hours on March 13, 1989, thanks to
such a CME during a particularly active solar cycle. The CME affected
New England and New York, too. Had electricity grid operators known what
was coming, they could have reduced power flow on lines and
interconnections in the power grid and set up backup generators where
needed.

Early warning

[But planners]{.underline} [need more of a **heads-up**]{.underline}
[than **they get today**]{.underline}. Perhaps within the next decade,
improved computer modeling and [new space weather]{.underline}
[**monitoring** capabilities]{.underline} [will **enable
scientists**]{.underline} [to **predict**]{.underline} solar
[storms]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [their]{.underline} likely
[impacts]{.underline} [more **accurately**]{.underline} and earlier,
says physicist Thomas Berger, executive director of the Space Weather
Technology, Research and Education Center at the University of Colorado
Boulder.

Space meteorologists classify solar storms, based on disturbances to the
Earth's magnetic field, on a five-level scale, like hurricanes. But
unlike those tropical storms, the likely arrival of a solar storm isn't
known with any precision using available satellites. For storms brewing
on Earth, the National Weather Service has access to constantly updated
data. But space weather data are too sparse to be very useful, with few
storms to monitor and provide data.

[Two U.S. **satellites**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
**[monitor]{.underline}** space [weather are **NASA's ACE
spacecraft**]{.underline}, which dates from the 1990s and should
continue to collect data for a few more years, and NOAA's DSCOVR, which
was designed at a similar time but not launched until 2015. Both orbit
about 1.5 million kilometers above Earth --- which seems far but is
barely upstream of our planet from a solar storm's perspective. [The two
satellites]{.underline} [can **detect**]{.underline} and measure a solar
storm [only]{.underline} [when its **impact is imminent**:]{.underline}
[15 to 45 minutes]{.underline} [away]{.underline}. [That's more
akin]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **["nowcasting"]{.underline}** [than
forecasting]{.underline}, [offering **little**]{.underline} more than a
**[warning]{.underline}** to brace for impact.

**[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**jection**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** (sudden
release of plasma accompanied by a magnetic field) (Kahler 1992). These
phenomena are produced when local regions of the sun\'s magnetic field
suddenly change configuration (Knipp and Biesecker 2015) and are
typically interconnected, occurring within a relatively short period of
time. [The [resulting]{.mark} **electromagnetic [radiation]{.mark}** can
[create **disruptions** of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[Earth\'s]{.underline} [magnetic [field]{.mark}]{.underline} (termed
geomagnetic storms), commonly known as "space weather events" (Schwenn
2006).

The most important implication of these events is in terms of
disruptions to electricity-powered technology. [Due to
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} global [[economy's]{.mark} **increasing
[reliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} such
[technologies]{.underline}, [it has [grown]{.mark}]{.underline}
increasingly [**[more vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the impacts]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[[space
weather]{.underline}]{.mark}**.Footnote1 An extended power outage that
lasts for weeks or months, affecting a large population (potentially
tens of millions), can easily become a major catastrophe, and even a
systemic threat to society.

Societal Impacts of Severe Space Weather and Solar Flares

[Space weather events]{.underline} have been [associated]{.underline}
[with a [**multitude** of negative]{.mark}]{.underline}, mainly
[technological]{.underline}, [direct]{.underline} economic
[[**consequences** such as]{.mark} blocked radio]{.underline}
[communications]{.underline}, **[[sat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ellite
**[[damage]{.underline}]{.mark}** and malfunctions, **[[disruption
to]{.mark} rail networks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[wireless
[networks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and global navigation systems such as
GPS (Cannon et al. 2013; Eroshenko et al. 2010). However, [the
most]{.underline} [consequential]{.underline} possible [effect is
**[extensive]{.mark} damage**]{.underline} [to electricity]{.underline}
**[transformers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} therefore potentially
[**[long-term disruption]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
electricity]{.underline} [[transmission
**infrastructure**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Khurshid et al. 2020; Kappenman
2012). Such a disruption would cause severe problems with the supply of
many basic services, including the access to pumped potable water, and
the loss of all perishable foods and medications that depend on
refrigeration (National Research Council 2009; Kappenman 2012).

The observed history of space weather in modern economies is very
limited. The biggest geomagnetic storm of the last few decades happened
in 1989 and caused transformer damage in multiple countries and an
approximately 9 h-long power outages for over 6 million inhabitants of
Quebec (Lakhina et al. 2004; Barnes and Van Dyke 1990).

The most severe directly observed events were the storms of 1859 (the
Carrington Event) and 1921, which were roughly three times as powerful
as the 1989 event and are typically considered to be a 1 in a 100-year
events (Kappenman 2010). However, since economies at the time were not
so dependent on electricity (especially, of course, in 1859), the impact
of both these events was much less severe than the impacts of the 1989
event and consisted mostly of disruption to the telegraph service
(Boteler 2006).

[While these]{.underline} historical [events are associated
only]{.underline} [with]{.underline} **[relatively]{.underline}** mild
societal [impacts]{.underline}, [a **[similar
event]{.mark}**]{.underline} today [would [have **severe**]{.mark}
**global [consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many of the studies
attempting to analyse the future potential impacts of such an event
focus on the economic effects associated with major power outages. A
study by Kappenman (2010) estimates that a Carrington storm hitting the
United States could put more than 200 large power transformers at risk
of permanent damage and cause severe damages to the power grid, leading
to long-lasting (months or potentially years) blackouts for
approximately 130 million people in the US and a full recovery time of
4--10 years. The total cost of a long-term power outage affecting a
significant area is estimated at USD 1--2 trillion during the first year
(National Research Council 2009).

In a report for Lloyd's, Maynard et al. (2013) points out that the
duration of the power outage depends largely on the availability of
spare transformers. These authors estimate that, in the worst-case
scenario of no spare transformers, a Carrington-like event would lead to
a power outage in the US affecting 20--40 million people and lasting 5
months. They estimate an associated economic loss of USD 0.5--2.6
trillion.Footnote2

Moran et al. (2014) analyse the economic impacts of space weather from a
global perspective and conclude that "a severe space-weather event could
be the worst natural disaster in modern history" (p. 8). Assuming a
power outage lasting 1 year for an event of a magnitude between the 1989
storm and the Carrington event (with annual probability of occurrence
likely to be higher than 1%), the authors conclude a major disruption of
global supply chains affecting all industries and estimate a global
economic loss of up to USD 3.4 trillion (5.6% of global GDP) in the
first year.

Oughton et al. (2016) find that an extended power outage in the US
caused by a similar space weather event would lead to global economic
losses with respect to global supply chain disruptions valued at USD
0.5--2.7 trillion. Using a globally integrated economic model to account
for the post-event dynamic responses of global trade, they estimate a
decrease of global GDP by up to USD 1.1 trillion over a five-year
period. The economic loss to the US manufacturing industry is estimated
to be USD 350 billion with approximately half of the losses being
indirect (roughly equally split between the losses associated with
upstream and downstream disruptions to the supply chain). The losses to
the US insurance industry are estimated to be up to USD 334 billion,
with 90% of the losses caused by service interruption within property
insurance policies.

In another paper, Oughton et al. (2017) suggest that a severe
geomagnetic storm, causing a power outage for 66% of the population in
the US, would create a daily economic loss of USD 41.5 billion.
Approximately half of the total economic loss is estimated to be
inflicted indirectly outside of the blackout zone due to supply chain
disruptions; Moran et al. (2014) reach similar conclusion for the global
economy.

Oughton et al. (2019) estimate an economic impact of a significant
geomagnetically-induced power grid failure in the UK and distinguish
between scenarios in terms of the ability to forecast the event. They
find that a 1 in a 100-year event with the current level of forecasting
would cause a GDP loss of GBP 2.9 billion in the UK, but an enhanced
forecasting ability based on further investment in this technology would
bring the loss down significantly, to GBP 0.9 billion.

In all these modelling exercises, [power [outages]{.mark}]{.underline}
for a significant portion of the population are [assumed to **[lead to
cascading effects]{.mark}** over many sectors]{.underline}. National
Research Council (2009) emphasised banking and finance, government
services and emergency response. Eventually, however, all economic
sectors would be adversely affected (Moran et al. 2014; Riley et al.
2018). Apart from the sectoral vulnerability to power outages due to the
reliance on electricity, Moran et al. (2014) note that the global
economic production system today is made even more vulnerable due to the
common use of practices such as just-in-time production, reduced
inventories, and increased reliance on long-distance supply chains with
many links.

More difficult to model, but maybe not less important to evaluate, is
the public response to such an event. Hapgood et al. (2021) suggest that
a power grid disruption caused by a severe space weather event would
lead to panic buying and stockpiling of essential goods such as petrol,
bottled water, non-perishable foods, and toilet paper. There could be
various flow-on effects from this panic. Ultimately, the longer-term
economic consequences of that are unclear.

It is uncontroversial that an extended power outage for a significant
portion of the population would lead to disastrous economic impacts.
However, the potential of space weather events of the magnitudes
discussed above to cause such extended power outages are questioned by
studies such as NERC (2010, 2012) and Cannon et al. (2013). They argue
that extensive power grid hardware damage is unlikely, and the more
probable consequence is a temporary system collapse due to voltage
instability. In their view, this will result in only short-term
stoppages in electricity supply and thus modest economic consequences.

Superflares

Research focusing on the risk of even more severe space weather events
is scarce, partially because there have so far been no direct
observations of "superflares" in our solar system. Some evidence
suggests that a superflare 100 times stronger than the Carrington event
may have happened in AD 775 (Melott and Thomas 2012; Usoskin et al.
2013; Mekhaldi et al. 2015) and may have led to regional changes in the
Earth's surface temperature (Sukhodolov et al. 2017). The nature of this
AD 775 event, however, is inconclusive (Cliver et al. 2014; Stephenson
2015; Neuhäuser and Neuhäuser 2015). Another extremely powerful event
possibly happened in AD 993 (Miyake et al. 2013; Mekhaldi et al. 2015).
Furthermore, astronomical observations of other sun-like stars in our
galaxy suggest that such events are indeed possible (Maehara et al.
2012; Nogami et al. 2014).

Lingam and Loeb (2017a) propose that the most powerful
**[superflares]{.underline}** might have [been [the **cause**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} some of the **[[previous]{.mark} mass
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[events]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that a very rare [superflare]{.underline} with
energy 100,000 times [larger than]{.underline} the
[Carrington]{.underline} event might [be able to **destroy the ozone
layer**]{.underline} [and lead to widespread]{.underline}
[**[destruction of ecosystems]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}]{.mark}
potentially **[[existential consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a
follow-up paper, Lingam and Loeb (2017b) suggest that the societal
vulnerability to superflares in terms of economic damage is increasing
rapidly, due to the growth of technological infrastructure. They propose
a mitigation strategy of setting up a protective shield between the
Earth and the Sun to avoid these dire consequences.

we can do about it,"
<https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/07/here-s-how-world-could-end-and-what-we-can-do-about-it>\]

As end-of-humanity scenarios go, that bleak vision from Fritz Leiber's
1951 short story "A Pail of Air" is a fairly remote possibility.
[Scholars]{.underline} who ponder such things [think]{.underline} a
self-induced catastrophe such as [**nuclear war** or]{.underline} a
**[bioengineered pandemic]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} most [likely
to do us in.]{.underline} [However]{.underline}, a number of other
extreme **[[natural hazards]{.underline}]{.mark}**---including threats
**[[from space]{.underline}]{.mark}** and geologic upheavals here on
Earth---[could still derail life]{.underline} as we know it,
**[unraveling]{.underline}** advanced **[civilization]{.underline}**,
**[[wiping out billions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of people,]{.underline}
or potentially even **[[exterminating our
species]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Yet there's]{.underline} been [surprisingly]{.underline} [little
research on the subject]{.underline}, says Anders Sandberg, a
catastrophe researcher at the University of Oxford's Future of Humanity
Institute in the United Kingdom. Last he checked, "there are more papers
about dung beetle reproduction than human extinction," he says. "We
might have our priorities slightly wrong."

Frequent, moderately severe disasters such as earthquakes attract far
more funding than low-probability apocalyptic ones.
[[Prejudice]{.underline} [may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be at
work]{.underline}]{.mark}; for instance,
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} who pioneered studies of asteroid and
comet impacts [[complained about]{.underline}]{.mark} confronting [a
pervasive "**[giggle factor]{.mark}**."]{.underline} [Consciously or
unconsciously]{.underline}, Sandberg says, many [researchers consider
catastrophic risks]{.underline} the [province of **fiction or
fantasy**]{.underline}---not serious science.

A handful of researchers, however, persist in thinking the unthinkable.
[With]{.underline} [enough]{.underline} [knowledge and proper
planning]{.underline}, they say, [it's possible to]{.underline} [prepare
for---or]{.underline} in some cases [prevent]{.underline}---[rare but
devastating natural disasters]{.underline}. [[Giggle all you want,
but]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[survival of]{.mark} human [civilization
could be at stake]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Threat one: **[Solar storms]{.underline}**

One threat to civilization could come not from too little sun, as in
Leiber's story, but from too much. Bill Murtagh has seen how it might
start. On the morning of 23 July 2012, he sat before a colorful array of
screens at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space
Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, watching twin clouds of
energetic particles---known as a coronal mass ejection (CME)---erupt
from the sun and barrel into space. A mere 19 hours later, the solar
buckshot blazed past the spot where Earth had been just days before. If
it had hit us, scientists say, we might still be reeling.

Now the assistant director of space weather at the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy in Washington, D.C., Murtagh spends much
of his time pondering solar eruptions. [CMEs]{.underline} [don't harm
human beings directly]{.underline}, and their effects can be
spectacular. [By]{.underline} [funneling charged]{.underline}
[particles]{.underline} [into Earth's magnetic field]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} can [trigger **geomagnetic [storms]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} ignite dazzling auroral displays. But those storms can
also [induce dangerous electrical currents]{.underline} in long-distance
power lines. The currents last only a few minutes, but
[they]{.underline} can [**take out electrical grids** by destroying
high-voltage transformers]{.underline}---particularly at high latitudes,
where Earth's magnetic field lines converge as they arc toward the
surface.

The worst CME event in recent history struck in 1989, frying a
transformer in New Jersey and leaving 6 million people in Quebec
province in Canada without power. [The largest one on
record]{.underline}---the [Carrington Event of 1859]{.underline}, named
after the U.K. astronomer who witnessed the accompanying solar
flare---was up to 10 times more intense. It sent searing currents racing
through telegraph cables, sparking fires and shocking operators, while
the northern lights danced as far south as Cuba.

"It was awesome," says Patricia Reiff, a space physicist at Rice
University in Houston, Texas. But [if another storm that size struck
today's infrastructure]{.underline}, she says, "[there would
be]{.underline} [**[tremendous consequences]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

Some researchers fear that [another Carrington-like event could destroy
tens to hundreds of transformers, plunging vast portions of [**entire
continents** into the dark]{.mark} for weeks or
months]{.underline}---[perhaps even years]{.underline}, Murtagh says.
That's [because]{.underline} the custom-built, house-sized replacement
[transformers]{.underline} [can't be bought off the shelf]{.underline}.
Transformer manufacturers maintain that such fears are overblown and
that most equipment would survive. But Thomas Overbye, an electrical
engineer at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, says nobody
knows for sure. ["We don't]{.underline} [have a lot of data]{.underline}
associated with large storms because they are very rare," he says.

[What's clear]{.underline} is that [widespread blackouts could be
**catastrophic**]{.underline}, especially in countries that depend on
highly developed electrical grids. "[We've done a marvelous job creating
a **great vulnerability** to this threat]{.underline}," Murtagh says.
[Information technologies, fuel pipelines, water pumps, ATMs,
[everything]{.mark} with a plug would be **[rendered useless]{.mark}**.
"That's going to affect our ability to govern]{.underline} the country,"
Murtagh says.

[We live in "a time of]{.underline} **[profound
transformations]{.underline}** [to our global context]{.underline},"
stressed Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World
Economic Forum, during the presentation of the Global Risks Report
2015,4 in Davos, Switzerland. [[For]{.underline}]{.mark} him, mankind
faces the accelerated effects of climate change and the increasing
uncertainty about the global geopolitical context. Going further, the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security Board, in a
recent analysis, pointed out that " in 2015, [unchecked **climate
change**, global]{.underline} [**nuc**lear weapons **mod**ernization,
and out-sized]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** weapons
**[arsenals]{.underline}** [pose]{.underline} extraordinary and
**[undeniable [threats to]{.mark} the continued [existence]{.mark} of
humanity]{.underline}**."5 That led its Doomsday Clock to be advanced by
two minutes. Today it marks three minutes to midnight, the moment of the
Earth\'s collapse.

There are many other reports and studies alerting to this catastrophe.
Such an immeasurable disaster on Earth may affect all space activities,
and their legal achievements. [While]{.underline}
**[focusing]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} **[outer
space]{.underline}** and space activities, [international space law can
be considered not only a probable]{.underline} **[victim]{.underline}**
[of this disaster, but also]{.underline} [an]{.underline} [**important
instrument capable of preventing it**. [The]{.mark}]{.underline}
fundamental 1967 **[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty,6 as
its Preamble points out, [is inspired " by the great prospects opening
up for humanity as a result of man's entry into outer space" and
recognizes " the common interest of all mankind in the progress of
exploration and use of]{.underline} outer [space for]{.underline}
**[peaceful purposes]{.underline}**."

This obviously means that [the]{.underline} **[fate of
humanity]{.underline}** [is in the **core of its
attention**]{.underline}. This paper attempts to demonstrate the ability
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the need for international space law to face
the critical situation of the Earth in extreme danger, including the
legal examination and the use of juridical provisions presented in the
recommendations of the main scientific documents already drawn up on
this transcendental subject. In conclusion, some [viable [initiatives
in]{.mark} the **[space law]{.mark}**]{.underline} field
[are]{.underline} proposed as [**[contribut]{.mark}**ions to efforts to
provide **Earth with [new guarantees of survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

I. The Preventive Function of Law

The paper's proposals raise the opportunity and the need to expand the
scope and the objectives of international space law, including in it
specific space issues of the Earth and of its life expressions.
Furthermore, it is timely to underline that " in today's world, the
preventive function of law is more vital than ever," as observed Manfred
Lachs (1914-1993) about 28 years ago. For him, it would be necessary for
men around the world to feel this reality, " in order to incite them to
abandon something of the parish spirit and give them the feeling of the
existence of a common interest, and of responsibility in application of
law in the everyday life of nations, as well as to make them understand
that, as usually is said, it is worth more act wisely together than
commit follies separately," At the same time, as a notable jurist and
thinker, Lachs foresaw the dangers that the Earth is currently
experiencing: "Today, it is required to work at a time when science and
technology have placed in man's hands weapons capable of creating a
danger to life and even cause total destruction; when modern techniques
create other dangers threatening the earth, water and air; when economic
and political relations between the states require that a new order
abolishes abyss between rich and hungry \[\...\]" .7 If the world
already was in great danger in the 1980s, what could be the magnitude of
danger today?

II, Poly-Catastrophe

"Dark times \[\...\] are not only not new, they are not a rarity in
history," as Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) observed.8 But today we are
certainly living in often darker times. According to the Global
Solidarity, Global Responsibility: An Appeal for World Governance -
launched in Geneva, Switzerland, on 6 March 2012, and endorsed by the
Collegium International members

> \"[we are facing [a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[conjunction of]{.mark}
> global [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that are]{.underline}
> [**[unprecedented]{.mark} in history**: depletion of]{.underline}
> [**[natural resources]{.mark}**, irreversible]{.underline}
> [**destruction of [biod]{.mark}**iversity, disruption of the
> global]{.underline} [**financial system**, dehumanization of the

> single]{.mark}]{.underline} **['poly-crisis']{.underline}** [that
> **threatens the world**]{.underline} [with a]{.underline}
> **[['poly-catastrophe']{.underline}]{.mark}** \[\...\]"

The Appeal stresses that " the great crises of the 21st century are
planetary," and that [" this is **no butterfly effect**, but the
realization,]{.underline} [**grave and strong**, that our **common
home** is in danger of]{.underline} **[collapsing]{.underline}** [and
that our salvation can only be **collective**]{.underline}."9

III\. Our World Today

The new Global Sustainable Development Goals - Transforming our World:
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development10 - have been adopted by
Heads of State and Government and High Representatives, during the
meeting at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York from 25-27
September 2015 - with the UN celebrating its 70th anniversary. Paragraph
14 of this historic document presents the vision of the UN General
Assembly (UNGA) on the world global situation today, as follows: "We are
meeting at a time of immense challenges to sustainable development.
Billions of our citizens continue to live in poverty and are denied a
life of dignity. There are rising inequalities within and among
countries. There are enormous disparities of opportunity, wealth and
power. Gender inequality remains a key challenge. Unemployment,
particularly youth unemployment, is a major concern. [Global health
threats, more frequent and intense **[natural disasters]{.mark}**,
spiraling]{.underline} [**[conflict]{.mark}**, violent]{.underline}
[**extremism**, **[terror]{.mark}**ism and **related humanitarian
crises**]{.underline} [and forced displacement of people threaten to
**[reverse]{.mark} much of the**]{.underline} development
[**[progress]{.mark}** **made in recent decades**. **Natural resource**
depletion and adverse impacts of]{.underline} [**environmental
degradation**, including desertification, drought, land degradation,
freshwater scarcity and loss of biodiversity, add to and exacerbate the
list of]{.underline} **[challenges]{.underline}** which [**humanity
faces**. Climate change is one of the]{.underline} **[greatest
challenges of our time]{.underline}** and its adverse impacts undermine
the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development.
Increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification and
other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and
low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries
and small island developing States. [The]{.underline} **[[survival
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** many societies, and of the biological support
systems of [[**the planet**, are **at risk**]{.underline}."]{.mark}

" Climate change will amplify existing risks and create new risks for
natural and human systems. Risks are unevenly distributed and are
generally greater for disadvantaged people and communities in countries
at all levels of development," as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) says in Climate Change 2014 - Synthesis Report - Summary
for Policymakers.11

IV\. Care for Our Common Home

Pope Francis in his 2015 Encyclical Letter Laudato Si \~ On Care for Our
Common Home - issued in 25 May - makes an " urgent appeal for a new
dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet." According
to Pope, "we require a new and universal solidarity," as " our present
situation is in many ways unprecedented in the history of humanity."

[" The Earth]{.underline}, our home," - he stresses - " [is beginning to
look more and more like an immense **pile of filth**]{.underline},"
because " [each year hundreds of millions of]{.underline} **[tons of
waste]{.underline}** [are generated, much of it non-biodegradable,
highly toxic and radioactive, from homes and businesses, from
construction and demolition sites, from clinical, electronic and
industrial sources]{.underline}."

Pope Francis also warns:

> "A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently
> witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system \[\...} most of
> global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of
> greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others)
> released mainly as a result of human activity \[\...\] The problem is
> aggravated by a model of development based on the intensive use of
> fossil fuels, which is at the heart of the worldwide energy system.
> Another determining factor has been an increase in changed uses of the
> soil, principally deforestation for agricultural purposes."
>
> "Warming has effects on the carbon cycle. It creates a vicious circle
> which aggravates the situation even more, affecting the availability
> of essential resources like drinking water, energy and agricultural
> production in warmer regions, and leading to the extinction of part of
> the planet's biodiversity. If present trends continue, this century
> may well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented
> destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us,"
> as " climate change is a global problem with grave implications:
> environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of
> goods."

Moreover, Pope Francis remarks:

> "We all know that it is not possible to sustain the present level of
> consumption in developed countries and wealthier sectors of society,
> where the habit of wasting and discarding has reached unprecedented
> levels. The exploitation of the planet has already exceeded acceptable
> limits and we still have not solved the problem of poverty. "
>
> "Caring for ecosystems demands far-sightedness, since no one looking
> for quick and easy profit is truly interested in their preservation.
> But the cost of the damage caused by such selfish lack of concern is
> much greater than the economic benefits to be obtained," points out
> Pope Francis, And he adds that " the alliance between the economy and
> technology ends up sidelining anything unrelated to its immediate
> interests."
>
> "The failure of global summits on the environment makes it plain that
> our politics are subject to technology and finance. There are too many
> special interests, and economic interests easily end up trumping the
> common good and manipulating information so that their own plans will
> not be affected."
>
> " It is foreseeable that, once certain resources have been depleted,
> the scene will be set for new wars, albeit under the guise of noble
> claims. War always does grave harm to the environment and to the
> cultural riches of peoples, risks which are magnified when one
> considers nuclear arms and biological weapons \[\...\] Politics must
> pay greater attention to foreseeing new conflicts and addressing the
> causes which can lead to them. But powerful financial interests prove
> most resistant to this effort, and political planning tends to lack
> breadth of vision." 52

Wouldn't these observations also applicable to outer space?

V. The Tragedy f Common Goods

To explain how we arrived to it at current bad situation of the common
resources of Earth, Eduardo Felipe P. Matias recalls the article Tragedy
of Common Goods, written in 1968 by American ecologist Garrett Hardin
(1915-2003). Hardin recounts the case of a village of shepherds, whose
sheep used a pasture in common. Each shepherd was engaged in putting
more and more sheep in the pasture in order to increase his income. Over
time, the pasture was saturated, and there was no pasture left to feed
all the sheep. Most of them died. In sum, a tragedy. The shepherds
abused the common good to increase their individual gains, ignoring the
limits of nature. Although they gained more in short term, they lost out
in long run. Already in 1999, it was recognized that " a globalized
world requires a theory of global public goods to achieve crucial goals
such as financial stability, human security or the reduction of
environmental pollution." And that "many of today's international crises
have their roots in a serious under supply of global public goods." 13

As to global human security as a public good, the 1994 Human Development
Report has showed threats to world peace in transborder challenges:
unchecked population growth, disparities in economic opportunities,
environmental degradation, excessive international migration, narcotics
production and trafficking and international terrorism," It was equally
said that the society would be "willing to pay for public goods that
serve our common interest, be they shared systems of environmental
controls, the destruction of nuclear weapons, the control of
transmittable diseases such as malaria and HIV/AIDS, the preservation of
ethnic conflicts or the reduction of refugee flows," 14

Addressing the present question of common goods in his 2015 Encyclical
Letter, Pope Francis points out:

> "Whether believers or not, we are agreed today that the Earth is
> essentially a shared inheritance, whose fruits are meant to benefit
> everyone. Hence every ecological approach needs to incorporate a
> social perspective which takes into account the fundamental rights of
> the poor and the underprivileged. The principle of the subordination
> of private property to the universal destination of goods, and thus
> the right of everyone to their use, is a golden rule of social conduct
> He also notes that " the natural environment is a collective good, the
> patrimony of all humanity and the responsibility of everyone. If we
> make something our own, it is only to administer it for the good of
> all. If we do not, we burden our consciences with the weight of having
> denied the existence of others."

Antonio Cassese (1937-2011) commented that " the concept of 'common
good' is not yet felt by the members of the international society. Only
state interests and their occasional convergence regulate international
relations." 15 The refugees tragedy in Europe today proves it.

VI\. Uncertainty

According to Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman of World Economic Forum, "
[in [the coming decade]{.mark} \[\...\] our lives will be even more
intensely shaped by transformative forces that are under way
already]{.underline}. The effects of climate change are accelerating and
the uncertainty about the global geopolitical context and the effects it
will have on international collaboration will remain. At the same time,
societies are increasingly under pressure from economic, political and
social developments including rising income inequality, but also
increasing national sentiment \[\...\] \[N\]ew technologies, such as the
Internet or emerging innovations will not bear fruit if regulatory
mechanisms at the international and national levels cannot be agreed
upon."

The Global Risks Report 2015, in turn, stresses: " 2015
[[differs]{.underline} **[markedly]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from the
past, [with]{.mark} rising]{.underline} [**[tech]{.mark}**nological
[**risks**, notably]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**cyber-attacks**]{.mark},
and]{.underline} [**new economic realities**, which remind us that
geopolitical tensions present themselves in a]{.underline} **[very
different world from]{.underline}** [**before**.
Information]{.underline} [flows instantly around the globe and emerging
technologies have boosted the influence of]{.underline} new players and
**[new types of warfare]{.underline}** \[\...\] **[Past
warnings]{.underline}** [of potential environmental catastrophes have
begun to be borne out, yet insufficient **progress**]{.underline} [has
been made]{.underline} - as reflected in the high concerns about failure
of climate-change adaptation and looming water crises in this year's
report."

The Report sees three risk constellations that bear out its findings:

> " 1) The [interconnections between geopolitics and economics are
> intensifying because States are making greater use of economic
> tools]{.underline}, from regional integration and trade treaties to
> protectionist policies and cross-border investments, [to
> establish]{.underline} relative [**geopolitical power**. This
> threatens to undermine the **logic of global**]{.underline} economic
> **[cooperation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} potentially
> [the]{.underline} **[entire international rulebased
> system]{.underline}**;
>
> 2\) [The world is in the middle of a major transition from
> predominantly rural to]{.underline} **[[urban
> living]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with cities growing most rapidly in
> Asia and Africa. If managed well, this will help to incubate
> innovation and drive economic growth. However, [our ability to address
> a range of global risks - including climate change, pandemics, social
> unrest, cyber threats and **[infrastructure]{.mark}** development -
> will largely be determined by how well cities are governed;
> and]{.underline}
>
> 3\) [The pace of]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nological
> [**change is faster than ever**. Disciplines such as]{.underline}
> **[[synthetic bio]{.underline}]{.mark}**logy [[and]{.underline}
> **[a]{.underline}**]{.mark}rtificial
> **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence are creating new fundamental

> most pressing problems. At the same time, they [present]{.underline}
> **[hard-to-foresee risks]{.underline}**. Oversight mechanisms need to

[How to]{.underline} **[govern]{.underline}** the **[emerging
tech]{.underline}**nologies and uncertainties?

VII\. The Doomsday Clock

It is a symbolic clock face, marking countdown to doomsday. On 19
January 2015, it went on to score 23:57h, three minutes to midnight -
the time of global catastrophe able to extinguish the human species
inhabiting the Earth for many thousands of years. The decision to
advance the clock by two minutes was taken after consultations with more
than 20 scientists, including 17 Nobel laureates, among them famous
physicists, such as the British Stephen Hawking, the Japanese Masatoshi
Koshiba, pioneer in the study of neutrinos, and the American Leon
Lederman. The clock has been maintained since 1947 - when the Cold War
between the USA and the former USSR began - by the members of the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Science and Security Board. In 68
years, this sui generis indicator has been adjusted 22 times. Its worst
moment came in 1953, triggered by American and Soviet tests with
hydrogen weapons when the Clock scored 23:58h.

The Clock was conceived by the celebrated Chicago Atomic Scientists,
that had actively participated in the Manhattan Project in the creation
of the atomic bombs launched over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in
August 1945. Haunted with these bombings - that killed more than 100,000
people just on the first day, and many more in the following months -
they started to publish a mimeographed warning newsletter and then the
Bulletin. The closer they set the Clock to midnight, the closer the
scientists believe the world is to a global disaster.

The Clock hangs on a wall in a Bulletin\'s office in the University of
Chicago. Originally, it represented an analogy to the threat of global
nuclear war. But since 2007 it has also reflected climate change, and
new developments in the life sciences and technology that could inflict
irrevocable harm to humanity.

The analysis of the Bulletin - addressed "to the leaders and citizens of
the world" - says in sum: " In 2015, unchecked climate change, global
nuclear weapons modernizations, and out-sized nuclear weapons arsenals
pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of
humanity." The group said in a statement: " \[Wjorld leaders have failed
to act with the speed or on the scale required to protect citizens from
potential catastrophe. These failures of political leadership endanger
every person on Earth." In 2014, with the Doomsday Clock at five minutes
to midnight, the members of the Science and Security Board concluded
their assessment of the world security situation by writing: "[We
can]{.underline} **[manage]{.underline}** our
**[tech]{.underline}**nology, [or become]{.underline} **[victims of
it]{.underline}**. [The choice is ours, and]{.underline} **[the Clock is
ticking."]{.underline}**

In 2015, with the Clock hand moved forward to three minutes to midnight,
the Bulletin feels compelled to add, with a sense of great urgency:
"[The probability of]{.underline} **[global catastrophe]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} [**very high**, and the actions needed to reduce the
risks of disaster must be taken **very soon**]{.underline}."

In face of the dangers affecting today civilization on a global scale,
the Bulletin urges the citizens of the world to demand that their
leaders, among other measures, \"dramatically reduce proposed spending
on nuclear weapons modernization programs" , as " the USA and Russia
have hatched plans to essentially rebuild their entire nuclear triads in
coming decades, and other countries with nuclear weapons are following
suit."

At the start of 2015, nine States - the USA, Russia, the United Kingdom,
France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (North Korea) - possessed about 15,850 nuclear weapons, of
which 4,300 were deployed with operational forces. Roughly 1800 of these
weapons are kept in a state of high operational alert, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Launched on 15
June 2015, the SIPRI Yearbook 2015, which assesses the current state of
armament, disarmament and international security, notes as one of its
key findings that " all the nuclear weapon-possessing states are working
to develop new nuclear weapon systems and/or upgrade their existing
ones." 16

"There are too many nuclear weapons," said Sharon Squassoni, an expert
in nuclear weapons nonproliferation at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, USA. And she added: "The existence
of these weapons takes a lot of time, effort, and money to keep them
safe, and the bureaucracies are poised to keep these systems going
indefinitely." 17

For Hans M Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at
the Federation of American Scientists, " the projected costs of the
nuclear weapons modernization program are indefensible, and they
undermine the global disarmament regime." 18

That is why another demand from Bulletin, addressed to world leaders, is
to " re-energize the disarmament process." In practice it means that "
the USA and Russia, in particular, need to start negotiations on
shrinking their strategic and tactical nuclear arsenals."

The creation of " institutions specifically assigned to explore and
address potentially catastrophic misuses of new technologies," is also a
requirement proposed by the Bulletin.

The Bulletin's appeals are also, to some extent, applicable to outer
space, and some of its requirements can be objects of proper regulation
by international space law.

VIII\. Transparency and Confidence

[The Earth being in danger, the]{.underline} transparency and
confidence-building measures (**[[TCBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[are]{.mark} as **[vital as]{.mark}** those of **[collective
security]{.mark}**. These actions are means by which Governments [can
**share info**]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} [aiming at
[creating]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[mutual
understanding]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [**trust**,
[reducing]{.mark}]{.underline} misconceptions and
[**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulations and [thereby]{.mark} helping both
to]{.underline} **[[prevent military
confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and to foster]{.underline}
regional and [**global stability**. They played an important role during
the Cold War, contributing to reducing the risk of armed conflict
through mitigating misunderstandings]{.underline} on military actions,
particularly in situations where States lacked clear and timely
information.19 [The need for such measures in outer space activities has
increased significantly over the past 20 years, The world's growing
**[dependence on space]{.mark}-based systems and
tech**]{.underline}nologies [and the]{.underline}
**[info]{.underline}**rmation **[they provide]{.underline}** [[requires
**collaborative effort**]{.mark}s to address threats to the
sustainability and security of]{.underline} [outer space activities.
TCBMs " can]{.underline} reduce, or even **[eliminate]{.underline}**,
misunderstandings, mistrust and **[miscalculations]{.underline}** [with
regard to the activities and intentions of States in outer
space"]{.underline} , This is the conclusion of the Report of the Group
of Governmental Experts on TCBMs in Outer Space Activities - a study
adopted by consensus and issued on 29 July 2013.20

The Report adds that " [these measures can augment the safety,
**sustainability and security of day-to-day space
operations**]{.underline} [and can contribute both to the development of
mutual understanding and to the strengthening of friendly relations
between States and peoples."]{.underline}

It is acknowledged that " the existing treaties on outer space contain
several TCBMs of a mandatory nature. Non-legally binding measures for
outer space activities should complement the existing international
legal framework on space activities and should not undermine existing
legal obligations or ham per the lawful use of outer space, particularly
by emerging space actors." The Group also discussed other measures,
including those of a legally binding nature. The Group further agreed
that " such measures for outer space activities could contribute to, but
not act as a substitute for, measures to monitor the implementation of
arms limitation and disarmament agreements," help States to enhance
clarity of their peaceful intentions and create conditions for
establishing a predictable strategic situation in both the economic and
security arenas.

Similarly, included in the Report were \"coordination and consultative
mechanisms aimed at improving interaction between participants in outer
space activities and clarifying information and ambiguous situations."
Likewise the Report recommended a coordination between the Office for
Disarmament Affairs, the Office for Outer Space Affairs (OOSA) and other
appropriate UN entities. Moreover, the Report drafted " a series of
measures for outer space activities, including exchange of information
relating to national space policy such as major military expenditure in
outer space, notifications of outer space activities aimed at risk
reduction, and visits to space launch sites and facilities."

The Group took note of the "Guidelines for appropriate types of
confidencebuilding measures and for the implementation of such measures
on a global or regional level" , as contained in the " Study on the
application of confidence- building measures in outer space"21

TCBMs for outer space activities are integrated in a broader context.
The UN General Assembly endorsed, in its resolution 43/78 H, the
guidelines on confidence- building measures adopted by the Disarmament
Commission at its 1988 session. This resolution noted that "
confidence-building measures, while neither a substitute nor a
precondition for arms limitation and disarmament measures, can be
conducive to achieving progress in disarmament" .

The Report indicates the following categories of TCBMs for space
activities as relevant: " a) General transparency and
confidence-building measures aimed at enhancing the availability of
information on the space policy of States involved in outer space
activities; b) [**Info**rmation **exchange**]{.underline} [about
development programs for]{.underline} **[new space
systems]{.underline}**, as well as information about operational
space-based systems providing widely used services such as
meteorological observations or global positioning, navigation and
timing; c) The articulation of a State's principles and goals relating
to their exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes; d)
Specific information-exchange measures aimed at expanding the
availability of information on objects in outer space and their general
function, particularly those objects in Earth orbits; e) Measures
related to establishing norms of behavior for promoting spaceflight
safety such as launch notifications and consultations that aim at
avoiding potentially harmful interference, limiting orbital debris and
mini mizing the risk of collisions with other space objects; f)
[International cooperation measures in outer space activities, including
measures aimed at]{.underline} promoting [capacity-building]{.underline}
and disseminating data for sustainable economic and social development,
that are [consistent with existing international commitments and
obligations.]{.underline}

In fact, [[some]{.mark} TCBMs for outer space activities have
**[already]{.mark} been [enacted]{.mark}**]{.underline} at the
multilateral and/or the national level. [They include pre-launch
notifications, space situational awareness data-sharing, notifications
of hazards to spaceflight safety and other significant events, and the
publication of national space policies.]{.underline} [**[But]{.mark}
they [need to be]{.mark}** further **[developed]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

IX\. Common Law of Mankind and Earth

**[More than ever, it is time to think big.]{.underline}** International
space law is usually defined as dealing with outer space, celestial
bodies - Moon and asteroids, Mars and other planets as well as with the
space activities which so far are carried out only by the human species
from the planet Earth, However, the very specific situation of Earth as
celestial body responsible for the creation and development of the
international space law is not taken into the due consideration. Earth
is not recognized as one of the main objectives of this branch of law.

Ironically, in this context, we could say that the international space
law takes care of the solar system and the universe as a whole, minus of
Earth, although it is the cradle of the exploration and use of outer
space in general, and, therefore, of international space law.

Let's take just two examples. "At its broadest, space law comprises all
the law that may govern or apply to outer space and activities in and
relating to outer space," write Francis Lyall and Paul B. Larsen.22 In
the same sense, the Education Curriculum of Space Law, adopted by United
Nations Office For Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), on March, 2014, states
that " space law can be described as the body of law applicable to and
governing space related activities."23

Nevertheless, the **[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**uter
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty, of
1967, [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least, two [**[extremely important
norms for]{.mark}** the security of **[Earth]{.mark}** and its
inhabitants **[in Article]{.mark}**]{.underline}s IV and
**[[IX]{.underline}]{.mark}**, respectively: 1) "not to place in orbit
around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds
of weapons of mass destruction," and 2) to avoid "harmful contamination
and adverse changes in the environment of the Earth resulting from
introduction of extraterrestrial matter." [The sky always has played a
crucial role in the evolution of mankind and all life manifestations on
Earth. However, today the **importance of outer space to our
planet**]{.underline} [and its]{.underline} **[common
life]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} [**increased as never before**.
The data coming from **[sat]{.mark}**ellite[**s** are]{.mark} absolutely
[fundamental for]{.mark} any efforts to assure the
[sustainability]{.mark} of Earth and all its life expressions. In this
global reality it is]{.underline} [**sheer recklessness**
to]{.underline} **[ignore the imperative of protecting our planet and
its population]{.underline}**, based on inclusive international space
legislation. Hence the necessity of a Common Law of Mankind24 and Earth,
specially related with international space law.

More and more, **[outer space]{.underline}** [protection]{.underline}25
[must be seen as]{.underline} an **[indispensable]{.underline}** factor
[to]{.underline} **[Earth protection]{.underline}**, and vice-verse. As
the globalization of Earth - with the interdependence of physical,
social and political events - is more than ever recognized as an
undeniable fact, the universalization of outer space {its cosmic reach),
with the interconnection of everything with everything, cannot be
bypassed, as it has been in the past. As Ervin Laszlo remarks, " the
reality we call universe is a seamless whole, evolving over eons of
cosmic time and producing conditions where life, and then mind and
consciousness can emerge."26 Or, as Edgar Morin says, "we carry inside
of us all the cosmos" and "we are all children of the sun."27

X. It Is up to International Space Law

[[If we are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[really
[determined]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to avoid]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[likely apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark}** visible [**on the
horizon**, one of the main tasks of the international space law that we
must trigger is to]{.underline} [**help save the Earth from space**,
using]{.underline} the **[powerful]{.underline}** scientific and
technological **[resources]{.underline}** [we have installed
there]{.underline}.

[Centuries ago Earth ceased to be the center of the universe, as our
ancestors thought. But in face of unprecedented global dangers that
threaten our planet today, its place cannot be other than the center of
our universal concerns. Probably, a collapse of Earth would deprive the
universe of a specie of intelligent life.]{.underline}

In reality, as Jonathan Schell (1943-2014) pointed out, " the vision
that counts is the view from Earth, from life," as " from our strategic
position on Earth different view opens, bigger even than the one taken
from space. It is the vision of our children and grandchildren, of all
future generations of mankind, stretching ahead of us into the
future."28

The question, as posed by Antonio Cassese, is that " international
society is still grounded in the mere juxtaposition of its subjects -
not in their solidarity, let alone in their integration." 29

In any event, " from the microbes inhabiting the earth beneath our feet
to environments of the universe unknown to us now, the next 100 years of
ecological discoveries will influence our lives. We enter a time when
society is armed with the scientific knowledge and ability to make
responsible decisions," as a recent editorial of Science affirms.30 And
with " a new human consciousness " , as says Edgar Morin.31

So, [" the choice is]{.underline} our: form [a]{.underline} **[global
partnership]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[care for
Earth]{.underline}** and one another [or risk the]{.underline}
**[destruction of]{.underline}** ourselves and the diversity of
**[life]{.underline}**," according to The Earth Charter.32

The current global situation seems to be so serious that the titanic
work of saving mankind and our planet can be seen as a kind of utopia,
maybe the major utopia of all times. A dream still far from having a
general support. Coincidentally we'll commemorate in 2016 the 500 years
since the English humanist and statesman Thomas More (1478-1535)
published his Utopia„ considered " a playfully serious social critique
to a social reality deadly and tragically grave."33

[In this context, [it is **urgent**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to build
a]{.underline} **[positive agenda for]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[international space law]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

THE EMERGING ANTI-SATELLITE THREAT

[The [**threat** to U.S. and allied]{.mark}]{.underline} [space
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nti-**[[sat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ellite
weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[continues to
**grow**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [As former]{.underline}
**[D]{.underline}**irector **[o]{.underline}**f
**[N]{.underline}**ational **[I]{.underline}**ntelligence Dan Coats
[noted]{.underline} in testimony before Congress in January 2019:
"[China and Russia]{.underline} [are **training**]{.underline} [and
equipping their]{.underline} [military space forces]{.underline} [and
**fielding** new]{.underline} anti-satellite [weapons]{.underline} [to
hold U.S. and allied space]{.underline} [systems at
**risk**]{.underline}." Coats' testimony is complemented by numerous
reports and studies by government and non-governmental organizations
like the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Air and Space
Intelligence Center, the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
and the Secure World Foundation.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [has]{.underline} also [[been the
**victim**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[real-world]{.underline} [anti-satellite
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. In March 2019, the Norwegian
government accused [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
"**[harassing]{.mark}**]{.underline}"
[[communications]{.underline}]{.mark} [systems]{.underline}
[[during]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO **[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Recent press **reporting**]{.underline} [notes that]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orwegian
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence **[S]{.underline}**ervice [has documented
a [number]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline} [**incidents**
in]{.underline} ]{.mark}[which "**GPS [signals]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} other]{.underline} [**secured [communications]{.mark}**
between]{.underline} [the]{.underline} Norwegian Armed forces, or
[NAF]{.underline}, [units engaged]{.underline} [in exercises
were]{.underline} [subjected to '**blocking'**]{.underline}
[measures]{.underline} from sites located in Russia." And just last
week, U.S. Space Command released a statement claiming that on April
15th, Russia had conducted a direct-ascent anti-satellite missile test.
Faced with these real threats, how should NATO respond?

[[IMPROVE
**INTEL**]{.underline}]{.mark}LIGENCE-**[[SHARING]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[**[Collective action]{.mark}** by]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [on
outer space]{.underline} security [issues **[will only
happen]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[when allies]{.underline}]{.mark} [reach
a **[consensus]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on the]{.underline}]{.mark}
anti-satellite **[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [As a first step,
an]{.underline} appropriate organization at [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
(e.g., the Assistant Secretary General for Intelligence)
[should]{.underline} [be [**directed** to develop]{.mark} a]{.underline}
[**[comprehensive]{.underline}** [assessment]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
the]{.underline} anti-satellite [threat]{.underline} to the alliance.

To be successful, [this [effort will require]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**full support** of the **[U.S.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommunity. Additionally, [NATO
officials]{.underline} [should ensure]{.underline} relevant
[alliance]{.underline} [**political** and **military**
bodies]{.underline} (e.g., the North Atlantic Council, Military
Committee, Senior Political Committee, and Defense Policy and Planning
Committee) [receive]{.underline} regular [**updates** on
the]{.underline} anti-satellite [threat]{.underline}.

**[[MAINSTREAM]{.mark} OUTER [SPACE]{.mark}]{.underline}** AT NATO

[NATO should]{.underline} [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [outer
space]{.mark}]{.underline} [is **"mainstreamed"** and [fully
**integrated**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[within]{.underline}
[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} political and **[[military
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and is not treated as]{.underline}
merely a "**[novelty item]{.underline}**." For instance, overall
[responsibility]{.underline} [for outer space]{.underline} [should be
**placed** in]{.underline} an organization like the Office of the
Assistant Secretary General for Defense Policy and Planning, or the
Office of the Assistant Secretary General for Defense Investment, which
are responsible for defense policy, planning, and capability investment
at **[NATO]{.underline}**. Furthermore, noting the interrelationship
between outer space and other domains like nuclear and cyber, NATO will
need to establish mechanisms that encourage effective coordination and
cooperation across the entire organization, including the military
commands.

At the operational level, [the alliance]{.underline} [should **ensure**
that]{.underline} [outer space is [**incorporated** in]{.mark} its
major]{.underline} military **[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and
**[wargames]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is
**[critical]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[because]{.mark}
[if]{.mark}]{.underline} [[NATO]{.mark} ever [comes]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[into]{.mark} a **major [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with
Russia]{.underline}, [one of [Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**first
targets** would]{.underline} [be]{.underline}]{.mark} the alliance's
space **[[assets]{.underline}]{.mark}** and space-derived information.
Therefore, [it is **important** for NATO]{.underline} [to conduct
its]{.underline} [exercises]{.underline} [with **this in
mind**]{.underline}. Allied Command Transformation, NATO's warfare
development command, should be tasked to make this a reality.

If NATO ever comes into a major conflict with Russia, one of Russia's
first targets would be the alliance's space assets.

[[ENSURE **COOPERATION**]{.underline}]{.mark} AND COORDINATION WITH THE
UNITED STATES

At the end of the day, [[NATO's]{.mark} ultimate
**[effectiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in outer space]{.underline}
[[will **depend** on]{.mark} its]{.underline} [cooperation]{.underline}
[with the alliance's]{.underline} [**most important** space
power]{.underline}: [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. To
date, [U.S. **[leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[has been]{.mark} the
**[key driver]{.mark}** of NATO]{.underline}
**[decision-making]{.underline}** [on outer space]{.underline}, [and
senior]{.underline} U.S. [officials]{.underline} [have **actively
engaged**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [alliance
leadership]{.underline}. For example, in October 2019, General John
Raymond, commander of U.S. Space Command and chief of space operations,
briefed the NATO Military Committee on outer space security issues.
[These types of **[senior-level engagements]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[between U.S.]{.underline} political and [military leaders
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[continue]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and be
**expanded**]{.underline}.

In addition to senior-level engagements, there are a number of other
actions [**[NATO]{.mark}** and the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
could take to improve cooperation and coordination. Specifically, they
[[should]{.mark} [establish]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[clear]{.mark}
consultative [mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[between
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, [U.S.]{.underline} **[[Space
Comm]{.underline}]{.mark}**and, [[and the]{.mark} U.S. [Space
Force]{.mark}]{.underline}. One relatively easy step that could be taken
quickly would be to [establish a **NATO liaison**]{.underline}
[officer]{.underline} [at U.S. Space Command]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}/or [U.S. Space Force headquarters]{.underline}.
Indeed, a number of allied officers are currently attached as liaisons
at several U.S. combatant commands like U.S. Strategic Command
(STRATCOM).

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[should]{.underline} also [seek to **incorporate**]{.underline} [NATO
representatives]{.underline} [into its outer
space]{.underline}-[related]{.underline} **[wargames]{.underline}**
[where possible]{.underline}, [especially the Schriever]{.underline}
[Wargame]{.underline}, [the premier]{.underline} U.S. **[space
wargame]{.underline}**. According to a U.S. Air Force press release,
several allies including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United
Kingdom, France, Germany, and Japan, have participated in previous
Schriever Wargames. [The]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[should invite]{.mark}
NATO]{.underline} [**political** and]{.underline} [[military
officials]{.underline} [to **participate** in the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[next]{.underline}]{.mark} **[Schriever
[Wargame]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

COOPERATE WITH THE EU

NATO should also explore ways to cooperate with the EU on outer space,
primarily because the EU has developed and deployed the Galileo global
navigation satellite system, which like the U.S. Global Position System
(GPS), provides accurate positioning and timing information. In
particular, Galileo includes a capability known as the Public Regulated
Service (PRS), an encrypted navigation service for governmental
authorized users and sensitive applications that require high
continuity. In a crisis situation, PRS could provide NATO important
redundancy against an adversary's attempt to jam or destroy GPS. While
many members of NATO are also members of the EU and have access to PRS,
non-EU NATO members, and NATO as an organization, currently does not.
Therefore, NATO should begin consultations with the EU about the
possibility of gaining access to PRS for the alliance.

DON'T FORGET DIPLOMACY

Military solutions alone will not allow the United States and its allies
to address the increasing anti-satellite threat. While I have generally
supported many of the Trump administration's space security initiatives
like the re-establishment of U.S. Space Command, a key element missing
from the Trump administration's outer space security strategy has been
the complete lack of a diplomatic component. Without a more
comprehensive strategy that includes a strong diplomatic element, it
will make it difficult for NATO to maintain enough political cohesion to
pursue effective military policies. These tensions were highlighted in a
recent article that noted: "With the exception of France and the United
Kingdom, many Europeans countries are deeply uncomfortable with, or down
right opposed to, the development and use of weapons in space."

This is not a problem unique to outer space. Throughout its history,
there has been constant tension within NATO over the appropriate balance
between defense and diplomacy in its strategy. Since the late 1960s,
with the approval of the Harmel Report, named after former Belgian
foreign minister Pierre Harmel, NATO has sought to more effectively
balance some of the inherent tensions between defense and diplomacy. One
of the key findings from the Harmel Report was that "military security
and a policy of détente are not contradictory but complementary." Arms
control was considered an essential element of this strategy. The
general Harmel Report approach has shaped the key strategic decisions
that the alliance has taken over the past 50 years, most notably the
"Double-Track" decision in 1979 to deploy intermediate-range nuclear
forces in Western Europe, while simultaneously engaging the Soviet Union
in arms control negotiations.

As part of its overall strategy for outer space, [NATO should
develop]{.underline} [**options** and **recommendations**]{.underline}
[on how it can advance]{.underline} [**diplomatic solutions** to address
the]{.underline} [**emerging threat** to]{.underline} outer [space
systems]{.underline}. In particular, [NATO should]{.underline} task the
Arms Control and Disarmament Committee to examine what role the alliance
could play in [**develo**p]{.underline}ing [**norms** of
behavior]{.underline} [to encourage]{.underline} [responsible use of
outer space]{.underline}. And even though the Trump administration has
generally been opposed to arms control, it has expressed openness to the
development of norms for outer space. In an recent speech, Assistant
Secretary of State Christopher Ford stated: "[We]{.underline} clearly
[need to **do more** to develop]{.underline}
[non]{.underline}-legally--**[binding]{.underline}** international
[norms of **responsible behavior**]{.underline} that are complementary
to the existing legal regime."

U.S. LEADERSHIP WILL BE KEY

With the increasing role that outer space is playing in military
operations, and the rise of the anti-satellite threat, NATO was correct
in its decision to declare space as an operational domain in December
2019. The question now is whether the alliance will be able to translate
this broad political guidance into an effective strategy.

An effective NATO strategy for outer space will depend on the ability of
the alliance to build consensus on the threat; mainstream outer space
into NATO's political and military institutions; find ways to cooperate
with the EU; and incorporate diplomacy into that strategy. But at the
end of the day, [[**all of this** will]{.underline} [require
**clear**]{.underline}]{.mark}, sustained, and consistent **[[U.S.
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[cyber]{.mark} [defense]{.mark} capability**]{.underline}, seemingly
[positioning itself to be a **standard bearer** for
cybersecurity]{.underline}. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, [these
[commitments]{.mark} **[lack specifics]{.mark}** and]{.underline} could
[[**hamper** NATO's]{.mark} [ability]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
**[respond]{.mark}** to an attack [because]{.mark} of]{.underline}
bureaucratic and **[[security protocols]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Following the inclusion of cyber attacks under Article 5, NATO and its
allies could not agree on what kind of attack would trigger the
collective defense response. [[Allies]{.mark} still [use]{.mark} their
**[own]{.mark}** incident [**standards** to **define**]{.mark}
**[cyber]{.mark} incidents** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} in some cases
[[do **not**]{.mark} [make]{.mark} [these]{.mark} **standards
[public]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This results in an **uneven response**
and makes it [**difficult** for]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} and its allies [to
provide]{.mark} a **[unified]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[Article 5
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}** to cyber incidents. Stoltenberg has
defended this vague definition by stating that, "a clearly defined
threshold only invites attacks immediately beneath it." This
[clarification does not address the larger issue]{.underline} of which
attacks would trigger an Article 5 response, [as [NATO]{.mark}
**already** [defends]{.mark} [against]{.mark} low-level cyber [attacks
**daily**]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Ambiguous
guidelines]{.underline}]{.mark}** could also [[cause]{.mark} NATO to
**misappropriate** responses to cyber attacks]{.underline}, [leading
to]{.underline} potentially [**[embarrassing]{.mark}**
**[overreactions]{.mark}** [to minor incursions]{.mark} [or]{.mark}
**[devastating]{.mark} [slow]{.mark} [responses]{.mark}**
to]{.underline} crippling [attacks]{.underline}. Without a clear
definition, NATO will struggle to respond to attacks. As stated earlier,
NATO's focus is on deterring attacks---to such an extent that the cost
of an attack would outweigh any benefits. However, this focus has
resulted in NATO lacking the offensive capabilities to respond in the
same capacity as its allies, like the United States.

CHANTILLY, Va. --- [Top]{.underline} U.S. space [officials]{.underline}
this week [said it's likely **Russia's invasion**]{.underline} of
Ukraine [will **extend to space**]{.underline}, [predicting]{.underline}
continued [GPS]{.underline} **[jamming]{.underline}** [and spoofing and
urging]{.underline} [military]{.underline} and commercial space
[operators to be **prepared**]{.underline} [for possible]{.underline}
**[cyber attacks]{.underline}**.

"Ensure that your systems are secure and that you're watching them very
closely because we know that the Russians are effective cyber actors,"
National Reconnaissance Office Director Chris Scolese said Feb. 23
during a National Security Space Association conference in Chantilly,
Va. "[It's **hard to say** how far]{.underline} [their reach is **going
to go**]{.underline} in order [to achieve their
**objectives**]{.underline}, [but it's better to be
**prepared**]{.underline} than surprised."

[Reports]{.underline} from the Secure World Foundation and the Center
for Strategic and International Studies [document Russia's use of
**non-kinetic**]{.underline} disruptive [space capabilities]{.underline}
in Ukraine in recent years, [including **spoofing** and
**jamming**]{.underline} [as well as **cyber-attacks**]{.underline}.

"[Russia places a **high priority**]{.underline} [on
integrating]{.underline} electronic [warfare into **military
operations**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} has [been **investing
heavily** in **modernizing** this]{.underline}
[capability]{.underline}," the Secure World Foundation said in its 2021
Global Counterspace Capabilities report. "[Russia has a **multitude** of
systems]{.underline} [that can]{.underline} [jam]{.underline} GPS
[receivers]{.underline} [within a **local area**]{.underline},
potentially **[interfering]{.underline}** [with the **guidance
systems**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} unmanned [aerial
vehicles]{.underline}, [guided missiles]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[p]{.underline}**recision **[g]{.underline}**uided
**[m]{.underline}**unition**[s]{.underline}**, but has no known
capability to interfere with GPS satellites themselves using radio
frequency interference."

One such electronic warfare platform is the Tirada-2, which entered
service in 2019. According to SWF, the system can reportedly performing
uplink jamming on communication satellites. Another system, Bylina-MM,
is being designed to "suppress the on-board transponders" of some
communication satellites.

In its 2021 Space Threat Assessment, [the]{.underline}
**[C]{.underline}**enter for **[S]{.underline}**trategic and
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[S]{.underline}**tudies [noted
that]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} [arsenal]{.underline} [of
**electronic counterspace**]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline}
[include]{.underline} two **[radar jammers]{.underline}** --- Karushka-2
and Karushka-4 --- [which could]{.underline} **[interfere]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} radar [reconnaissance]{.underline} satellites.

Scolese said this week it's likely Russia will employ jamming and
spoofing capabilities to some extent -- though he noted it's not clear
how far it will go.

"I think it's fair to assume that to the extent that they can and to the
extent that they feel it won't extend the conflict out of their control,
that they will extend it into space," he said. "You can imagine they're
already doing GPS jamming, for example, and doing things against
Ukraine."

Kinetic weapons

As for kinetic counterspace capabilities, Russia's most recent
demonstration of a direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon in
November created an estimated 1,500 pieces of debris. Speaking at the
NSSA conference Feb. 23, Lt. Gen. Michael Guetlein, head of the Space
Force's acquisition command, said actions like the recent ASAT test
reinforce Russia's interest in denying space access to adversaries.

Chief of Space Operations Gen. John Raymond has on multiple occasions
referred to Russia's July 2020 test of what he calls a "nesting doll"
capability. The test --- which CSIS said in its report was more
sophisticated than some previous ASAT demonstrations --- involved a
Cosmos 2542 satellite that contained a smaller Cosmos 2543 space vehicle
inside of it. During the 2020 test, the smaller satellite fired a
projectile near another Russian satellite.

"This is further evidence of Russia's continuing efforts to develop and
test space-based systems, and consistent with the Kremlin's published
military doctrine to employ weapons that hold U.S. and allied space
assets at risk," Raymond said at the time.

CSIS notes in its report that Cosmos 2543 was very active after being
released from its "mother satellite."

"Before firing the projectile in July 2020, the inspector satellite was
constantly changing its orbit to synchronize with other Russian
satellites," the report states. "This is out of the ordinary for most
satellites, which rarely maneuver in this way."

While not an on-orbit capability, Russia has also developed an aircraft
called the Beriev A-60, which detects and tracks satellites with the
intent of aiming laser beams at them, according to the SWF report. The
aircraft has flown multiple times since 2010, and the country is
reportedly installing a laser on it.

SPACECOM Support

[U.S.]{.underline} **[Space Com]{.underline}**mand head Gen. James
Dickinson [said this week that **space units**]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} currently [playing a **supporting** role
to]{.underline} U.S. European Command to ensure it has "the space
effects necessary to respond and characterize the situation in
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**.

SPACECOM's Joint Integrated Space Teams, which are made up of
intelligence planners and space professionals, have been working closely
with EUCOM to coordinate space capabilities and integrate them into the
command's planning activities.

Dickinson said one of his command's supporting functions has been to
provide battlespace awareness of the space domain and provide the
missile warning and GPS-enabled tracking capabilities over EUCOM.

Scolese noted that the [response]{.underline} [of the **space
enterprise**]{.underline} [to the **ongoing**]{.underline} Russian
[aggression in Ukraine]{.underline} [is showing how
**integrated**]{.underline} [U.S. **agencies**]{.underline} [are in
**providing key capabilities**]{.underline} in a time of conflict.

"What we do in space and our technology and our partnerships are really
coming to bear, and it's going to show how we work together as a
community to achieve some very significant objectives and to understand
what's going on in the world," he said.

#### Russia [has]{.underline} the intent now to [attack]{.underline} the [West]{.underline}.

- Russia wants to attack now and has the intent

- destroying sats makes U.S vulnerable to attacks

Brandon **Weichert, 21** (Brandon Weichert is a geopolitical analyst who
runs The Weichert Report and is a former Congressional staff member who
holds a Master of Arts in Statecraft & National Security Affairs from
the Institute of World Politics, 11-16-2021, accessed on 6-23-2022, Asia
Times, "Russia threatening space war with US",
<https://asiatimes.com/2021/11/russia-threatening-space-war-with-us/>,
HBisevac) \*\*edited for ableist language\*\*

Last week, US President Joe [Biden's]{.underline} administration
[briefed NATO members about the imminence of a Russia]{.underline}n
invasion of Ukraine. This came after months of increasing tensions
between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia over Crimea,
the small peninsula that juts out into the Black Sea from Ukraine, which
Russia annexed in 2014.

Shortly after [these caustic US intelligence warnings to
Europe]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline} test-[fired an]{.underline}
anti-satellite (**[ASAT]{.underline}**) [weapon that created such a
**large debris field** in orbit that the]{.underline} astronauts on the
International Space Station (**[ISS]{.underline}**) were [forced to take
refuge in the SpaceX capsule]{.underline}, in anticipation of having to
abandon the station.

(As an aside, there were Russian cosmonauts on the ISS who were also
forced to take refuge in the Soyuz capsule docked on the Russian side of
the ISS.)

Western media reported the [US intelligence community's]{.underline}
[warning]{.underline} to NATO [about]{.underline} an imminent [Russian
**invasion** of **Ukraine** and Russia's testing of an **ASAT** that
threatened the **ISS** as separate events]{.underline}. [They are **not
separate**]{.underline}.

The US [government has been distracted by the **absurdity** of its
**domestic politics**]{.underline}. [Russian leaders have **sensed
weakness** they seek to **exploit**]{.underline}. The [US
appears]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~ \[**[disoriented]{.underline}**\] [by
**bad leadership** and **internal dissent**]{.underline}. [Now may be
the time for Russia to **strike hard** against the **West** and rewrite
the **European regional order** in its **favor**]{.underline}.

While Ukraine is not part of NATO, the United States and its European
allies have consistently articulated their opposition to any further
Russian military actions in Ukraine. Throughout former president Donald
Trump's administration, for example, the United States gave Ukraine's
besieged military much-needed lethal aid to assist in the defense of its
territory from greater Russian aggression.

Various NATO countries have also helped Ukraine enhance its national
defenses while Russia has intensified its commitment to expanding its
threat to Ukraine.

Whether the West would risk direct military confrontation with Russia
over a non-NATO member like Ukraine is another matter entirely. Given
the constant declarations of support for Ukrainian sovereignty, though,
Moscow cannot be certain that the Western alliance would not intervene
if it decided to cleave away more of Ukraine.

Therefore, Moscow has likely initiated plans to neuter any potential
threat of a NATO defense of Ukraine against any Russian invasion by
going after sensitive American and NATO satellites.

The surprise Russian demonstration in orbit was probably an example of
radical deterrence: Moscow is letting Washington, Brussels and London
know just how far it is willing to go to achieve its strategic
objectives in what it views as its "near abroad" (in this case,
Ukraine).

The Kremlin is asking the West if it values the security and economic
prosperity of Ukraine over its own security and prosperity. Moscow is
likely banking on the West saying that, in fact, it does not put its own
interests behind those of Ukraine (it doesn't).

Washington is now in a strategic quandary: Failure to respond with at
least an in-kind demonstration in orbit would lead Moscow's leaders to
conclude that they can have their way with Ukraine. This conclusion
would lead to the inevitable annexation of more of Ukraine by Russia
while reinforcing the claims of both Russia and China that the United
States is a great power in terminal decline.

On the heels of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, given how much
moral and diplomatic capital the West has (~~stupidly~~) invested in
Ukraine, [the failure of **Western powers** to **respond** to this
Russian **provocation** would lead to **greater aggression** directed
against the West]{.underline}, not just in Europe but around the world
-- and [in **space**]{.underline}.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [relies on satellites more
than any other nation]{.underline} on Earth. Not only are satellites key
for modern communications and economic transactions, but they are
critical in modern military operations.

[Satellites form the backbone for]{.underline} the most basic functions
of [America's **global military**]{.underline}. [Removing those **key
satellite interlinks** would render the US military
**impotent**]{.underline}, leaving America and its allies vulnerable to
attack from a predatory power, such as Russia.

In space, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has more to lose than **any other country**]{.underline} -- and the
Kremlin knows this. [That fact explains why Russia began a **rapid**
military **modernization**]{.underline} in 2010 to reorganize its forces
[to better fight]{.underline} -- [and win]{.underline} -- [a space war
against the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

[To deter Russia]{.underline}, the [US must **immediately** test its own
**ASAT capability** while deploying **swarms** of smaller]{.underline},
"bodyguard" [satellites]{.underline} designed [to protect
America's]{.underline} sensitive [satellites]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} Earth [orbit]{.underline} from ASAT attack.

At the same time, Washington must clarify its position on Ukraine:
Either it stands with the embattled country, or it does not. Strategic
ambiguity, in this case, invites greater challenge from Moscow -- which
is most unwelcome currently.

[Failure to draw **red lines** clearly will lead to a **Russian strike**
on **US satellites** that might precipitate a **war**]{.underline}. [Or
worse]{.underline}, [a **US defeat**]{.underline}.

### U\-\--Russia\-\--Intent\-\--AT: Alt Causes

#### Russia is [empirically subtle]{.underline}\-\--erring towards [non-kinetic attacks]{.underline} for discreet attacks.

In light of the above, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[likely to
**favor subtle**]{.mark}**r [methods]{.mark}**]{.underline} of NGW.
[[While **kinetic attacks** are]{.underline}]{.mark} [easily
**[attributable]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to a]{.underline} belligerent
[actor]{.underline}, [[**cyber** and]{.mark}
**[e]{.mark}**]{.underline}lectronic **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**arfare
(EW), by contrast, **[[are not]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Both]{.underline} are [essential tools of the **Russian
military**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} their combined
[application]{.underline} [will form the **foundation** for]{.underline}
[Russian]{.underline} space [warfare]{.underline}.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [has **[demonstrated
proficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in EW]{.underline}
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} [such as]{.underline} downlink
**[jamming]{.underline}**---interfering with a ground stations' ability
to receive transmissions from a satellite---and spoofing, both of which
can be used to interfere with an adversary's command and control (C2),
communications, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR)
capabilities. [Cyber operations]{.underline}, which [have
[become]{.mark}]{.underline} [**increasingly [central]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} Russian]{.underline} hybrid [[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark},
[provide]{.underline} **[another avenue]{.underline}** [for
domineering]{.underline}, **[degrading]{.underline}**, [or even
destroying]{.underline} [adversaries']{.underline} space assets and
associated capabilities.

**[[Cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** are [[likely]{.mark} to
become]{.underline} **[Russia's preferred method]{.underline}** of
warfare [in the **space domain**]{.underline}, [as
[successful]{.mark}]{.underline} [[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} [could
[allow Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **gain full**]{.mark}
**[control]{.mark}** of]{.underline} [adversaries'
**satellites**]{.underline} and C2 systems from a terminal far, far
away, whereas EW may be dependent on proximity to the target asset. The
1998 [[ROSAT incident]{.underline}]{.mark}, [in which Russian
hackers]{.underline} **[[hijacked]{.mark} control]{.underline}** [of a
[U.S.-German]{.mark}]{.underline} [[satellite]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
**issued commands**]{.underline} [that caused the satellite to **rotate
toward** the sun]{.underline}, thereby "**[[fry]{.mark}ing its
[optics]{.mark}]{.underline}** and rendering it useless," [is [proof
that **Russia is willing**]{.mark}]{.underline} and able to use
cyberattacks against space systems. Russian focus on cyberattacks and
large-scale cyber offensives against space assets is especially likely
considering the current vulnerabilities of U.S. and NATO space
architecture.

### U\-\--China

#### China is [increasing]{.underline} space power [now]{.underline}\-\--priming space as the [new territory]{.underline} for [conflict]{.underline}.

Chris **Impey, 21** (Chris Impey is a professor of astronomy at the
University of Arizona, 10-8-2021, accessed on 6-18-2022, The Hill, \"Is
conflict in space inevitable?\",
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/575903-is-conflict-in-space-inevitable,
HBisevac)

For now, [we are witnessing [nations testing]{.mark} their [space
tech]{.mark}nology. There has never been an armed conflict in
[space]{.mark}]{.underline} --- but it is [the **next arena for
combat**.]{.underline} Charles Richard, the [deputy commander of U.S.
Strategic Command]{.underline}, [warned]{.underline} in 2017 [that the
country needs to be prepared to fight and win wars in]{.underline} all
domains, including [space]{.underline}. "[While we're not at war in
space, we're not exactly at peace either]{.underline}," Richard said.
Last month, Defense One issued a report highlighting the lack of
international rules governing behavior in space, the growth of China's
military space program, the problem of space debris, a proposed space
arm of the U.S. National Guard, the potential for conflict in ownership
of sites on the Moon and ways satellites might be used to spot
hypersonic missiles. Existing space law offers little reassurance. The
foundation of international space law is the U.N. Outer Space Treaty of
1967. Ratified by 99 countries and signed by another 27, it says that
space is the "province of mankind," and all nations have the freedom to
"use" and "explore" outer space, provided it is done in a way to
"benefit all mankind." Some of its sweeping and vague terms have never
been clearly defined. The treaty prohibits weapons of mass destruction,
but it says nothing about conventional weapons. Ownership is addressed
by the U.N. Moon Treaty of 1979. It declares the Moon to be part of the
common heritage of mankind and says lunar and other off-Earth resources
are "not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by
means of use or occupation, or by any other means." Unfortunately, the
treaty is moot since none of the major space-faring powers signed it.
Lawlessness and **[[lack of regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}** are
[[showi]{.mark}ng an [effect in]{.mark} the [dramatic increase in
**space junk**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [the detritus of our activity in
space.]{.underline} [Chunks of metal that no longer serve a useful
purpose include non-functional spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicles,
cast-off materials from space missions and fragmentation
debris.]{.underline} There are 23,000 pieces of debris larger than a
softball orbiting the Earth, tracked by the Defense Department's space
surveillance network. Estimates of smaller sizes are half a million the
size of a marble or larger and 100 million a millimeter or larger. The
problem is that they are all moving at extremely high speeds, up to
17,500 mph --- and even a tiny fleck of paint can damage a spacecraft at
that speed. The situation is getting worse. As more satellites and
spacecraft are launched and more obsolete hardware accumulates in orbit,
the odds of collisions increase. Commercial space companies like SpaceX
are planning to launch tens of thousands of satellites in the next
decade to facilitate wireless Internet in parts of the world that
currently have no coverage. Even before these plans, it was predicted
that large collisions could cause cascading collisions, exponentially
increasing the number and density of small pieces, and potentially
rendering low Earth orbit completely unusable. This dire scenario is
called the Kessler syndrome. [The problem has an ominous overtone
because world powers are arming themselves to take out each
other]{.underline}'s satellites, offensively or defensively. It is going
to get increasingly difficult for a country to tell why their satellite
went down or fell silent. Was it a collision with debris, space
"weather," or a hostile action? No international treaty governs space
debris. Mitigation strategies exist, but governments have been dragging
their feet. [Earth orbit is a new "**tragedy of the commons**," where we
ruin something because we profit by exploiting it and cannot exclude
others from doing the same]{.underline}. [Space junk is a headache, but
[space]{.mark} [weapons are a **nightmare**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[China is a **rapidly rising**]{.mark} [space power]{.mark}, [with
ambitious plans]{.mark} for a space station, a Moon base and a Mars
base]{.underline}. Unlike the United States, where NASA is a civilian
agency with plans available for scrutiny, [China's space program is
blended with its **military** and operates under a **veil of
secrecy**]{.underline}. A recent report from the Office of the Director
of National Intelligence said [[China]{.mark} is [working on]{.mark} an
array of [capabilities to **weaponize space**]{.mark}, and it [plans
to]{.mark}]{.underline} "[**match** or **[exceed]{.mark}** [U.S.
capabilities]{.mark} in space to gain the military]{.underline},
[economic]{.underline}, [and prestige benefits that Washington has
accrued from space leadership]{.underline}." **[Conflict is not
inevitable]{.underline}**. The [world depends on the smooth functioning
of thousands of satellites that whirl over our heads. Without them,
there would be no high-speed data flow or GPS positional data, and
billions of dollars of economic activity would grind to a halt. **[Every
major power]{.mark}** [has]{.mark} a [**vested interest** in
avoiding]{.mark} a [ruinous war of attrition in
space]{.mark}.]{.underline}

2 The Applications of Space Platforms

Since the dawn of the space age, [outer space]{.underline} has been
regarded [as the **ultimate high ground**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} [could provide a]{.underline}
**[decisive]{.underline}** military [advantage to the State]{.underline}
[that retains **superiority**]{.underline} [over it]{.underline} \[2\].
[In the context of NATO]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}
**[space-based assets]{.underline}** [play an **essential
role**]{.underline}, [providing]{.underline} a [multitude of
services]{.underline} [for more]{.underline} [than 35
years]{.underline}. [Some of the most advanced]{.underline}
[space-faring States are]{.underline} [part of the
**alliance**]{.underline} \[3\]. It is highly anticipated that in the
next leaders' summit taking place in London NATO will recognize space as
a domain of warfare \[4\].

[Since NATO does]{.underline} [not **own any satellites**]{.underline}
in orbit, [it **relys** on services provided by
**governments**]{.underline}, military, civilian and commercial
entities. [NATO has]{.underline} [**terrestrial** SATCOM]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline} [and units]{.underline} (terrestrial SATCOM
anchor stations, transportable satellite ground terminals and
equipment). The C2 for SATCOM is managed by NATO Communication and
Information Agency (NCIA) and operated by NATO CIS Group (NCISG) \[5\].

[Space-based assets]{.underline} [function as **force
multipliers**]{.underline}, [providing **support**]{.underline} [and
crucial **information**]{.underline} [during]{.underline} the
[strategic]{.underline}, operational and [tactical levels of
war]{.underline}. According to the Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and
Space Operations, [space capabilities]{.underline} [provide a **wide
range** of applications]{.underline} [such as]{.underline}:
[global]{.underline}, strategic and [**intra-theatre**
satellite]{.underline} [communications]{.underline} (SATCOM);
**[positioning]{.underline}**, [navigation, and **timing**]{.underline}
(PNT) services; terrestrial and space environmental monitoring; space
situational awareness ([SSA]{.underline}); [intelligence]{.underline},
surveillance, [and **reconnaissance**]{.underline} (ISR); [NATO
**S**hared **E**arly **W**arning]{.underline} \[6\].

1\. Satellite Communications ([SATCOM]{.underline}): [One of the
most]{.underline} **[widespread functions]{.underline}** [of
satellites]{.underline}, either civilian or military, [is
**telecommunications**]{.underline}. [SATCOM]{.underline} [provides
support to C2]{.underline} [through]{.underline} its [multiple
**applications**]{.underline}, [such as the establishment]{.underline}
[of **communications**]{.underline} in regions [with
minimal]{.underline} or even non existent
**[infrastructure]{.underline}**; [transmission of
**intelligence**]{.underline}; relay of messages and control of UVs.

2\. Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT): [The PNT data provided by
space]{.underline}-based assets [are **essential**]{.underline} [for the
**prosecution** of NATO]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}, since
[they]{.underline} are [used for **precision targeting**]{.underline};
tracking of friendly and enemy forces; [provision of **precise
timing**]{.underline} which is also [**vital** for]{.underline} [the
function of networks]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[accurate]{.underline} navigation of [troops]{.underline}.

3\. Environmental Monitoring: Meteorological and oceanographic data
collected by satellites are crucial to NATO forces since they play an
important role in the planning of missions and the selection of the
optimal weapons system to be deployed based on weather conditions. Also
the knowledge of the conditions on the theater of operations allows
forces to take advantage of them, for example the prediction of flooding
based on maps developed in Afghanistan was used enhancing military
operations and provide humanitarian support \[7\].

4\. Space Situational Awareness (**[SSA]{.underline}**): Space
situational awareness is the knowledge regarding the outer space
environment, natural and operational, and its effects on NATO
operations. SSA [applications]{.underline} [includes
knowledge]{.underline} [regarding]{.underline} [the **operational
capabilities**]{.underline} [and **limitations** of]{.underline} both

satellites and the conducting of their missions.

5\. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(**[ISR]{.underline}**): [Space based]{.underline} [assets]{.underline}
equipped with sophisticated sensors [provide]{.underline} a host of
services, such as intelligence gathering, including Signal Intelligence
(SIGNIT); [target **information**]{.underline} [and **damage
assessment**]{.underline}; [warning of attacks]{.underline} and
situational awareness.

6\. NATO Shared Early Warning (**[SEW]{.underline}**): Dedicated
[sensors]{.underline} onboard satellites can [**detect** the **launch**
of ballistic]{.underline} [missiles]{.underline} [and track]{.underline}
their [trajectory]{.underline}. [Satellites]{.underline} also [provide
NATO]{.underline} [with the capacity]{.underline} [to **detect nuclear

identifying]{.underline} any [**violations** of international **treaties

Partial Test Ban Treaty).

Satellites are divided into two main categories of use, military and
civilian. At the dawn of the space age, satellites were predominantly
used for military purposes but with the passing of time and the
advancement of technology satellites have also become of civil use. The
main difference between the two systems is the end user. Dual Use
technology addresses both military and commercial markets. In the US
sector dual use satellites serve both the federal government and the
civilian market.

A historical case example of Dual Use technologies can be traced in the
context of the Space race that saw the US and the USSR in competition to
rule outer space. This race was carried out with military and civilian
personnel to develop technologies that could carry satellites in outer
space for scientific, as well as military purposes. The re-entry of the
launcher with scientific data was used by the military for the potential
deployment of multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles. This
is exactly what has also been experienced at national level in the EU
and in the US where there is a strong tendency to look for synergies.

In the early 1990s the US Agency DARPA started a Dual Use collaboration
in the Global Mobile Information Systems (GloMo) programme. This
programme aimed to accelerate the development of mobile computing and
looked at Dual Use technologies for digitising military and civilian
communications.

In late 1993, DARPA was managing the Dual Use programme "Technology
Reinvestment Program" \[8\] (TRP), with the goal of forging stronger
collaborations between the military and commercial R&D sectors. This
collaboration granted security investment for this field. The synergies
between the military and the Civilian intertwined with the R&D is still
carried out with the development of technologies that are used by both
the field for security and defence.

The driver for both American and Soviet space programmes was the
acquisition of military capabilities: in terms of capacity of delivering
nuclear weapons as well as placing satellites in orbit for strategic
communications and acquisition of information on the adversary's
territory \[9\]. Another contribution that highlights the role of outer
space as a geopolitical variable meant to enhance state power is Everett
Dolman's Astropolitik which "encompass\[es\] the social and cultural
effects of new technologies, in this case space technologies, on the
subsequent evolution of political institutions" \[10\].

3 ASAT

Bearing in mind the host of services that satellites provide, it is a
natural consequence that, parallelly with the development of satellite
technology, the space powers sought ways to deny their adversaries such
services by neutralising their space platforms. This led to the
development of Anti-Satellite weapons (ASAT). These weapons function by
Denying, Disrupting, Disabling, Destroying or Deceiving their targets
(5Ds) \[11\]. Denying and disrupting have temporary effects, while
disabling may be of permanent nature. The kinetic destruction of
satellites has permanent and irreversible effects. Except for the
targeting \[12\] of space based assets, their supporting ground
facilities can be the targets of an attack as well.

3.1 Hard-Kill and Soft-Kill ASAT Weapons

ASAT weapon systems are divided in two categories, hard-kill and
soft-kill.

• Hard-kill ASAT weapons are based on the use of a projectile or other
methods in order to achieve the kinetic destruction of the target. Due
to the predictability of satellite orbits and their restricted
maneuverability, satellites are particularly susceptible to such attacks
\[13\].

• **[Soft-kill]{.underline}** ASAT [attacks]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [rely on **interfering**]{.underline} [with the satellite's
sensors]{.underline} ([via **jamming**]{.underline},
[spoofing]{.underline} or blinding through the use of powerful lasers),
[or with the satellite's]{.underline} [software]{.underline} ([via
**cyber attack**]{.underline}). These [attacks]{.underline} [can
**render** a satellite]{.underline} **[defunct]{.underline}** [without
destroying it]{.underline}.

3.2 ASAT Testings

USA

The United States, along with Russia, were the precursors of ASAT
weapons and have carried out a number of successful testings. The most
recent ASAT testing was Operation Burnt Frost, entailing the
interception of the reconnaissance satellite USA-193, which failed one
month after its launch and was decaying from orbit. The interception was
carried out on 20 February 2008 from the USS Lake Erie using a RIM-161
Standard Missile 3 \[14\].

Russia

Russia tested five ASAT experiments between November 2015 and December
2018. The testings were carried out with the russian
anti-ballistic/anti-satellite missiles A-235 PL-19 Nudol, without
intercepting any targets.

Russian R&D continue to improve on-orbit capabilities that could serve
dual-use purposes and that can be deployed anywhere. Since 2010, Russia
stated that the "weaponization of information is a key aspect of this
strategy and is employed in times of peace, crisis, and war. Russia
considers the information sphere to be strategically decisive and has
taken steps to modernize its military's information attack and defense
organizations and capabilities". Moreover Russia's President Vladimir
Putin stated that the laser weapon system is a "new type of strategic
weapons" \[15\].

China

On 11 January 2007, China targeted and destroyed the aging weather
satellite Feng Yun 1C in LEO with a single ballistic missile launched
from the Xichang Space Center. This ASAT testing led to the creation of
more than 2000 pieces of trackable space debris \[16, 17\].

China put a great focus on the development of launchers such as the Long
March 11 (LM-11) defined as quick response, which can support military
operations in a conflict or civilian in the event of a disaster. Unlike
other launchers, these can be transported by wheeled vehicles or
railroad in unmarked containers. On 5 June 2019, a LM-11 was launched
from a floating platform from the chinese Yellow Sea. This operation
demonstrated the deployment capabilities of stealthy ballistic missiles
and Anti-Satellite Weapons (ASATs). This operation had previously only
been completed by Russia.

By 2020 China's military is expected to deploy a laser weapon (ASAT)
capable of damaging satellites in low earth orbit. This is a development
of the 2006 chinese test from a ground based laser that dazzle an
orbiting satellite \[18\]. Moreover China "probably intends to pursue
additional ASAT weapons capable of destroying satellites up to GEO"
\[19\].

India

On 27 March 2019, India intercepted and destroyed Microsat-R Earth
observation satellite on Low Earth Orbit with an Prithvi Defence Vehicle
(PDV) Mark-II interceptor \[20\]. This test proved that India has the
necessary capabilities to perform an anti-satellite operation. Moreover
India is performing a large number of launches of nano and small
satellites. India is providing the necessary equipment to other nations
that have no launch capabilities, mitigating the monopoly that the US
and Russia have established in the last years.

3.3 Future Threats

Nations with a space objective, such as North Korea, are increasingly
getting to the point of developing technologies that would allow them to
reach space. The numerous missile test that the nation is carrying out
is the proof of a strong interest and a potential threat to the space
ecosystem. A militaristic nation such as North Korea may develop and
implement their technologies in ASAT weapons due to the high rewards
with little investments.

4 The Legal Approach of ASAT Weapons

The legal implications of using ASAT weapons should be examined under
international space law as well as international humanitarian law.

4.1 Space Law

Article IV OST

As far as it concerns international space law, the military uses of
outer space are regulated by Article IV of the Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer
Space, including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies \[21\] of 1967.
Article IV dictates that "States Parties to the Treaty undertake not to
place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or
any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on
celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other
manner". Only the "placement" of WMDs in outer space is forbidden, while
on the other hand, the use of direct ascent systems loaded with WMDs and
their detonation in outer space is not restricted by the OST (but the
detonation of a nuclear warhead would violate the 1963 Treaty Banning
Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water
(Partial Test Ban Treaty, PTBT) \[22\]. Hence the deployment and use of
ASAT weapons in Earth's orbit as well as in the void of Outer Space is
permitted as long as they do not constitute WMDs.

The same is not true regarding the placement of ASAT weapons on
celestial bodies, like the Moon. Article IV dictates that "the Moon and
other celestial bodies shall be used by all States Parties to the Treaty
exclusively for peaceful purposes". Hence the deployment and use of ASAT
weapons on celestial bodies is prohibited by the OST, since it
constitutes an aggressive use of said bodies.

Article IX OST

Article IX OST imposes on States Parties the responsibility to undertake
international consultations before proceeding with an activity or
experiment that the State has reason to believe could potentially cause
harmful interference with the activities of other States

Parties in the peaceful exploration and use of Outer Space. The kinetic
destruction of a satellite generates a large number of space debris that
could hinder the activities of other States, hence the State that has
planned the attack is obligated to undertake consultations with any
State that could be affected, prior to the attack \[23\]. This is why
the Chinese FY-1C ASAT test was criticized by the international
community, since there was no prior notice.

4.2 International Humanitarian Law

Customary international humanitarian law dictates that attacks must be
fulfil the criteria of discrimination, proportionality and necessity
\[24\].

• Discrimination: Articles 48 and 52(2) of the Additional Protocol I to
the 1949 Geneva Conventions \[25\] dictate that only military objectives
can be the targets of an attack, with military objectives being assets
which "by their nature, location, purpose, or use make an effective
contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction,
capture or neutralisation, in the circumstances ruling at the time,
offers a definite military advantage". Hence civilian satellites can
only be targeted if they provide a military advantage to the adversary.

• Proportionality: The damage caused by the planned attack must not be
excessive in proportion to the military advantage gained from it.

• Necessity: The attack must be necessary in order to overcome the
enemy.

This is why an ASAT attack based on the electromagnetic pulse created by
a nuclear detonation in outer space would violate the regulations of
international humanitarian law, since it is by nature indiscriminate and
the damage caused would not be proportional to the advantage gained
\[26\]. The same issues appear regarding the kinetic destruction of a
space object which results in the creation of a large amount of space
debris. On the other hand by using soft kill methods like jamming or
cyber attack no issues of proportionality or discrimination arise if the
target is a legitimate military objective.

5 Actions that Can Be Taken to Contrast ASAT Weapons

[In order to **protect** its]{.underline} [space-based
assets]{.underline} [from]{.underline} adversary **[ASAT
attacks]{.underline}**, [NATO needs to take]{.underline} certain
**[countermeasures]{.underline}**. [These countermeasures can
be]{.underline} [either]{.underline} [**passive** or
**active**]{.underline}. [Passive]{.underline}
[countermeasures]{.underline} are practices [such as **stationing decoy
satellites**]{.underline}, [increasing]{.underline} the
[**maneuverability** of satellites]{.underline}, so as to be able [to
avoid]{.underline} kinetic [attacks]{.underline}, [and
**hardening**]{.underline} their [components]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} their remote [sensors]{.underline}, in order [to
withstand an attack. Active]{.underline} [countermeasures]{.underline}
[would]{.underline} [entail]{.underline} equipping satellites with
**[defense mechanisms]{.underline}** or non destructive
[countermeasures]{.underline} [such as **jamming**]{.underline} \[27\].

The increase and the wide range of ASAT has ensured that resilience was
used to safeguard activities in Space. There has been an increase in the
number of cybernetic systems with defence and security strategies.

[Cyber security]{.underline} [should **reduce**]{.underline} [the risk
of a **cyber-attack**]{.underline} [and protect the
satellite]{.underline}. This would reduce the risk but would not
eliminate it because there is always the possibility of the satellite
being hacked. [The]{.underline} [only]{.underline} [activity that can be
**done**]{.underline} [is to work on]{.underline} the capacity of
**[cyber resilience]{.underline}** [because this allows the]{.underline}
[**continuity** of the]{.underline} satellite's [operation]{.underline}
[in such a way as]{.underline} **[not to influence]{.underline}** the
[activities of the system]{.underline}.

The US Department of Defence considered the occurrence of an attack on a
single or multiple satellites. On this end, there has been an increase
in the number of satellites in order to have a continuous coverage even
with the failure of some units of the system.

With the increase of nano-satellites and mega-constellations an attack
would be able to stop an entire system because a single satellite is
interconnected with others for sharing information. For this reason not
only the number of satellites should be higher but there should be
several constellations isolated from each other so that the operation of
the constellation or satellite continues even after an attack. This
would be considered as a redundancy that prevents data and activity
loss.

[Good practices]{.underline} [that support]{.underline} the
**[creation]{.underline}** [and **sustainability** of
effective]{.underline} national [capacities]{.underline} [in order to
provide]{.underline} **[system resilience]{.underline}** [are those that
can prevent]{.underline} and what can be **["emergency
plans"]{.underline}** [that should provide]{.underline} "[an
overview]{.underline} [of **national incident**]{.underline} response
[mechanisms]{.underline}; in addition to highlight how cybersecurity
incidents are classified, based on their impact on critical goods and
services".

Information sharing is another key point because during an attack
accurate and appropriate communication can eventually lead to the
identification of the attackers. Many organisations in the World, such
as [NATO]{.underline}, are **[conduct]{.underline}**ing [exercises in
this field]{.underline}. Periodically NATO implements exercises and
simulations of war and cyber attack (CMX) \[28\].

[These]{.underline} international computer security
**[simulations]{.underline}** [help to **strengthen**]{.underline} [the
responsiveness]{.underline} [and **resilience**]{.underline} [of
states]{.underline} and strengthen trust between countries and improve
overall international resilience and preparedness levels. Resilience
should focus on two topics: "Critical Infrastructure" and "Critical
Information Infrastructures". The first is essential for the functioning
and security of a company and an economy while the second is the system
that manages the key functions of the critical infrastructure. These two
must be protected in accordance with the principle of risk management
and resilience.

6 Conclusion

With the military and economic importance of space-based assets
increasing so does the need to develop systems that could target and
neutralize these assets. This led to the development of Anti-Satellite
weapons that can temporarily or permanently damage the adversary's
satellites.

[The **development**]{.underline} [and use of ASAT created]{.underline}
[a **new field**]{.underline} [were]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline} [and
its]{.underline} member [States can **enhance**]{.underline} [their
offensive]{.underline} operational [capabilities in order
to]{.underline} [**safeguard** their security]{.underline}.
[NATO]{.underline} already **[embraced this domain]{.underline}** [with
the implementation of personnel]{.underline} and infrastructure. The
fast development of technologies and threats should be faced with the
formation and information of NATO and non-NATO personnel.

[NATO]{.underline} [should]{.underline} also [take into
consideration]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[threat
adversary]{.underline}** ASAT [weapons]{.underline} [**pose** to its own
space]{.underline}-[based assets]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[take]{.underline} the **[necessary defensive measures]{.underline}**.
Such [measures]{.underline} [would be the **enhancement**]{.underline}
[of its cyber-security]{.underline} [and the deployment]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} **[resilient systems]{.underline}**.

[In 2018]{.underline}, Norwegian military and [allied officials
confirmed that **[Russia]{.mark}** had [disrupted NATO]{.mark}'s Trident
Juncture exercise]{.underline} in Europe's High North region
[[by]{.mark} persistently [jamming GPS signals]{.mark}]{.underline}
during the exercise. [**China** has claimed 'the ability to **use**
[space]{.mark}-based [systems]{.mark} and to **deny** them to
adversaries as [central to **modern warfare**]{.mark}**'**]{.underline}.
As the [**[dependence]{.mark}** of military operations on space-based
assets has **[increased exponentially]{.mark}** over the last few
decades]{.underline} and [[space]{.mark}-based [assets]{.mark} are
potential [**targets** for **cyber attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
newly released Chatham House research paper 'Cybersecurity of NATO's
Space-based Strategic Assets' suggests that NATO should bring space more
to the spotlight. The research paper lists cyber threats to space-based
strategic assets and capabilities, analyses capability requirements and
gives concrete recommendations for ways improve the resilience of the
space-based systems. [Strategic [military systems depend on
space]{.mark}-based [assets for]{.mark} the **provision** of **data**
and for many **capabilities**]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline}
positioning, navigation and timing (**[[PNT]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
**[[intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, surveillance and reconnaissance
(**[[ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**), **[[missile
defence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[communications]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [space situational
awareness]{.underline} (**[[SSA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) as well as
environmental monitoring. [For]{.underline} accurate timing and
navigation in [[PNT]{.mark} systems]{.underline}, [NATO
uses]{.underline} the global positioning system ([GPS]{.underline})
which is also well known and widespread in civil use. [[ISR]{.mark}
information and imagery is collected through surveillance and
reconnaissance sensors]{.underline}. [Both [systems]{.mark} are
**satellite-based**]{.underline}. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems
also rely on satellite-based 'beyond-line-of-sight' communication. These
are only a few of the possible examples. In addition to the abundance of
capabilities, it is noteworthy that [the capabilities are also
**[linked]{.mark}** and therefore [affecting one]{.mark} capability may
[cause **collateral effects**]{.mark} on others]{.underline}. [As
explained in the]{.underline} [Space Threat Assessment]{.underline}
[2018]{.underline} published by the [**C**entre for **S**trategic and
**I**nternational **S**tudies]{.underline} (CSIS), [there are [**several
intrusion points** for]{.mark} space-based assets]{.underline}: antennas
on satellites and ground stations, landlines that connect ground
stations to terrestrial networks, and user terminals that connect to
satellites. [This can result in]{.underline} data or [data traffic
[monitoring]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[inserting false]{.mark} or
[corrupted data]{.mark} in the system]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} even
the **permanent [loss]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a
[satellite]{.mark}]{.underline}. As with every other technology, people
have the potential to be the weakest link in the cyber defence of
space-based assets -- social engineering is an important tool for the
adversary. [The research paper highlights]{.underline} some of [the most
important [vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}: [use of **[commercial
companies]{.mark}**]{.underline};
'**[[back-doors']{.underline}]{.mark}**; [**[dual use]{.mark}** of
satellites]{.underline}; [and **[supply chain]{.mark}** security of
space technology]{.underline}. Chatham House reports have touched on
these topics before. The question of supply chain was raised in the
Livingstone and Lewis 2016 report, which observed that [there was
**[no]{.mark} coherent [global]{.mark} [organisation]{.mark}** with
regard [to cyber security in space]{.mark}]{.underline} and that
existing approaches had only limited reach into the supply chain. In
this year's research paper, it is again stressed that when the supply
chain does not ensure that military security standards are met, items
procured may expose NATO systems to vulnerabilities. NATO by itself does
not own satellites, but is dependent on member states. In case of need,
NATO requests access to products and services from the allies. NATO
allies procure equipment and software, which will be integrated into
their national defence infrastructure. In most cases, military and
commercial assets are not separate. Therefore, NATO does not rely only
on military assets, but also uses commercial, civilian and national or
multinational assets for operations. Even though commercial methods have
proven to be effective, they are accompanied by the inherent risk of
lower security requirements. Data exchange between civil and military
sectors may cause extra vulnerabilities. As [most of the
**[space]{.mark}-based [capabilities]{.mark}** are
**[dual-use]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [meaning that assets are used both
for military and civilian purposes]{.underline}, the [Chatham
House]{.underline} research paper [recommends that operators 'apply
**higher-grade** military hardening and cyber protection specifications
to civilian capabilities that have the potential to be used in
**support** of **military applications'**]{.underline}. The research
paper also highlights the aspect of [NATO's **dependency** on member
states for **communication capacity**]{.underline} as [a possible source
of vulnerabilities]{.underline}. [[NATO owns]{.underline}]{.mark}
satellite communications ([SATCOM]{.underline}) [ground
stations]{.underline}, [but **[no satellites]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [it
is]{.underline} therefore [**highly reliant** on allies to provide
space-sourced data, information and services]{.underline}. In addition,
ensuring the security of space capabilities is mostly in the hands of
the allies. [This puts [NATO in]{.mark}to a [position]{.mark} where its
main option [to protect capabilities of **vital importance**]{.mark} is
to encourage allies [to]{.mark} put effort into **securing** the
**space-based assets** and **[foster cooperation]{.mark}** in
space-based systems cyber security]{.underline}. During the Brussels
Summit in 2018, the Alliance recognised space as a 'highly dynamic and
rapidly evolving area, which is essential to a coherent Alliance
deterrence and defence posture' and on 27 June 2019, it approved new
space policy. As claimed by NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg,
the space policy gives guidance on opportunities and challenges and is
not about militarising space, but about information sharing and
increasing interoperability. The research paper suggests that, in
addition to policy, NATO needs to agree upon space doctrine. While
policy directs, assigns tasks and prescribes desired capabilities,
doctrine provides principles of how operations should be planned,
prepared, commanded, conducted, sustained, terminated and assessed.1
This suggestion becomes even more relevant when taking into
consideration recent announcements by some NATO diplomats about NATO's
aims to recognise space as a domain of warfare during the London summit
at the end of 2019. This indeed would be a big step towards focusing
more on space-based assets and their vulnerabilities. Considering the
current context, in which China and Russia are increasing their presence
in space, this action by NATO is inevitable. Whether or not NATO claims
space as a domain, adversaries will nevertheless develop their
aggressive capabilities, from cyber operations to anti-satellite
missiles. Therefore, it is prudent to update the approach towards space
and space-based assets to face new challenges. Yet, claiming space to be
a domain of warfare highlights legal considerations. The Chatham House
research paper raises a question from the cyber perspective: whether a
cyber attack on a space system has to have kinetic consequences in order
to give grounds for collective self-defence according to the Washington
Treaty. This can be supplemented with a question on whether causing
kinetic consequences that result in debris breaches the responsibility
not to cause widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural
environment, as stipulated in article 35 of Additional Protocol I to the
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.2 Another question raised is
targeting dual-use space technology in international humanitarian law
(IHL). The principle of distinction foresees the duty to distinguish
between the civilian population and combatants and between civil and
military objects. As in the case of cyber objectives,3 dual-use
satellites should be counted as military objectives, but would be
subject to the rule of proportionality and requirement to take
precautions in attack.4 The Chatham House research paper makes
recommendations that more or less all stress the same things:
[[NATO]{.mark} is [**highly dependent** on]{.mark} space
capabilities]{.underline}; [[space]{.mark}-based [systems]{.mark} are
[**vulnerable** to **cyber attacks**]{.mark} and will become more and
more **appetising targets** for adversaries]{.underline}; and [NATO must
foster cooperation and information sharing between member
states]{.underline}. [[Overlooking]{.mark} these [aspects]{.mark} could
**[undermine]{.mark}** the **[credibility]{.mark}** of the information
provided through the space-based systems, which would in turn [affect
**deterrence** and **strategic liability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
broader view, destabilising space-based assets would not only affect
military conduct, but also have severe effects on civil infrastructures.

[China]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[increased]{.mark} their own space
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly]{.underline} their
[counter-space weaponry]{.underline} (see Figure 7). As the US Defense

by]{.mark} the **[reliance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [US]{.mark} and

they protect, [[on]{.mark} [space]{.mark}-enabled [systems]{.mark} for

**[missile defense]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[comm]{.mark}unication[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and **hurricane

[[dependence shows]{.mark} [**every sign** of]{.mark}
**[continuing]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the European Global Navigation
Satellite Systems (GNSS) Agency estimates that, by 2022, there will be
nearly one GNSS device for every human being.31 All of these
[[challenges]{.mark} and sensitivities present **[unprecedented]{.mark}
[threats]{.mark}** [to US]{.mark} and [Eu]{.mark}ropean [space

[questions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} its [capabilities in

States and France have announced changes to domestic governmental
agencies, such as "space forces" and the US Department of Commerce's new
Office of Space Commerce, but these [organizational adaptions fail to
fully address the international implications of changes in space, and to

### Internal\-\--Cohesion

#### Divergent views surrounding how to use force in space inevitably fracture NATO

**Berthiaume 19** \[Lee Berthiaume, "Canada in a tough spot as U.S.,
NATO differ on weaponizing space," Nov 24, 2019,
<https://globalnews.ca/news/6211076/nato-us-canada-weaponizing-space/>\]

The [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} military alliance [[looked to
space]{.mark},]{.underline} the final frontier, earlier this week as
members formally recognized the cosmos as integral to their mutual
security, [agreeing to bolster ways to defend their
satellites]{.underline} and other space-based infrastructure from enemy
attacks.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg insisted the measure was purely
defensive and did not include plans to put weapons into orbit. But
**[[it represented a marked departure from the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
**[w[hich is preparing to fight a future war in space if
necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[**[The divergent views of the alliance]{.underline}**,]{.mark} on the
one hand, [[and its largest]{.underline}]{.mark} and most influential
[[member]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} in
many ways [[emblematic]{.underline}]{.mark} of the challenge Canada
itself is facing [[when it comes to working with the U.S. on
space.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"Because of Canada's alliance with the United States, there might be
some pressure to adopt or toe a very similar line to the United States,"
said David Kuan-Wei Chen, executive director of the Centre for Research
in Air and Space Law at McGill University.

"But so far, I think the political leadership and people at the
Department of National Defence have resisted that."

The federal government's 2017 defence policy laid out a broad vision for
the Canadian Armed Forces' operations in space, which recognized its
importance to the country's peace, security and prosperity --- and the
need to ensure satellites and other assets are protected.

The policy also spoke to the need to work with Canada's intelligence
partners known as the Five Eyes --- the U.S., United Kingdom, Australia
and New Zealand --- "with the aim of strengthening deterrence (and)
improving the resilience of space systems on which Five-Eyes militaries
rely."

Yet [it]{.underline} also [called]{.underline} for Canada
[to]{.underline} work with other countries to [promote "the peaceful use
of space and **[provide leadership in shaping international
norms]{.mark}** for responsible behaviour in space]{.underline}" while
supporting efforts "to ensure that space does not become an arena of
conflict."

"[[There are members in (NATO]{.mark}**)**]{.underline} who **[are
[vehemently opposed to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the entire idea
of]{.underline} **[waging [conflict in space]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[among which Canada is one]{.underline}," said Kuan-Wei Chen, who is
overseeing development of a manual dealing with international law and
the use of military force in space.

#### Space integration's a prereq to effective allied consultation

**Silverstein 20** (Benjamin Silverstein, researcher with experience in
the National Laboratory network conducting research on the use of
counterspace technologies to support deterrence goals, past research at

Return to Space", War on the Rocks, AUGUST 3, 2020,
<https://warontherocks.com/2020/08/natos-return-to-space/>)

NATO also lacks the tools, tactics, and procedures to effectively
operate in space. NATO has neither announced an intent to implement a
space situational awareness program to identify and attribute on-orbit
interference, nor convened debate on a collective threat-assessment
process. These are two core tasks that should be accomplished to support
the alliance's relevance in space security. Shared threat-assessment
tools are key for states interested in building meaningful coalitions to
address space security. [**[Without]{.mark}** [agreed-upon]{.mark}
**threat-assessment [processes]{.mark}**[, **allies** may **arrive** at
**different conclusions**]{.mark} about **threats** to **space

analyze data. [This **directly impacts** the alliance's ability to come
to a **consensus decision** under]{.mark} the processes outlined by
**[Article 4]{.mark}** of the NATO Charter]{.underline}. While some
actors like the United States have robust space situational awareness
capabilities, others don't. [[NATO members **may not have** comparable
**capacities**]{.mark} to **observe** or **monitor space activities**,
[leaving allies **unable** to **assess**]{.mark} independently collected

methods or an **[[established procedure]{.underline}]{.mark}** for space
observation [[and shared]{.mark} threat-assessment

**unable to arrive at a conclusion** and may [cede initiative]{.mark}
back [to an **adversary**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Internal\-\--Entanglement

#### A5 applies.

Laura **Winter 19**. Space journalist for Al-Jazeera. "NATO declares
space an 'operational domain'." Al-Jazeera. 12-4-2019.
https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/12/4/nato-declares-space-an-operational-domain
//EM

The 29 [NATO]{.underline} heads of state on Wednesday jointly [declared
**space** a "domain of operations]{.underline}" during a summit in
London that marked the security alliance's 70th anniversary.

"Today, we took a wide range of important decisions," said NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg immediately following the summit's
conclusion."We have declared space as the fifth operational domain [for
NATO, alongside land, **air**, **sea**, and **cyber**]{.underline}."

[The declaration **expands** the scope of collective-defence
**commitment** for NATO,]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. [That commitment is enshrined in **Article 5** of
the]{.underline} alliance's founding document, known as the [Washington
Treaty]{.underline}.

Analysts say Wednesday's announcement was overdue and serves two
purposes: to meet the challenges posed by Russia and China's military
space activities and to assuage United States President Donald Trump's
view that the alliance is both a military and economic burden without
qualifying benefits.

"President Trump's repeated NATO bashings have definitely left the
allies worried," Michael John Williams, director of the International
Relations Program at New York University, told Al Jazeera. "His
declaration of a US Space Force was taken as a sign of interest and thus
advancing space as a fifth military domain is a way of adding to NATO's
value."

[NATO's "collective defence" principle **obligates** all **member
nations** to consider an **attack** against **one** ally as an attack
**against all** allies. If such an attack were to occur, all NATO
members are **bound** to take the necessary measures, including the
**use of force**, to secure the member under attack]{.underline} and the
alliance.

The only time NATO has activated Article 5 was on September 12, 2001, in
the wake of the 9/11 attacks against the US on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon.

In the wake of the declaration, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on
Wednesday that while his government categorically opposes the
militarisation of space, the recent establishment of the US Space
Command is forcing his country to develop its own space systems.

Satellites as tools for waging war

[The rise of **satellites** as tools for **waging war** and keeping the
peace has made space **crucial** to many national and defence
plans]{.underline} -- now [including the plan of]{.underline} the
**[NATO]{.underline}** alliance.

Security experts have pointed to the threat posed by some
[nations]{.underline} that [are]{.underline} reportedly [developing
**a**nti-**sat**ellite systems, including signal **jammers** to disrupt
communications, **lasers**, and **kinetic kill** systems]{.underline}
that issue missile-like projectiles.

Militaries use satellites to command and control their personnel and
weaponry, and to gather intelligence on their adversaries' activities.
If one nation's satellites were to be paralysed or destroyed, that
country's ability to defend itself against an attack could be fatally
crippled.

Commercially-operated satellites also facilitate business transactions,
help people navigate unfamiliar destinations, and control critical
infrastructure, such as power stations and air traffic control systems.

"[Declaring space a fifth military domain opens it up to NATO Article 5
protection]{.underline}, and given the number of assets controlled by
the US and the danger that those satellites might face from Russia and
China, this move is a way to show more European support for the US and
to internationalise," said Williams.

#### Official NATO policy is [ad-hoc]{.underline} and [unclear,]{.underline} but [space attacks]{.underline} can trigger Article 5.

**Nagashima \'20** \[Jun; 5/8/20; Senior Analyst at the Sumitomo
Corporation; \"NATO's Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic: Security
Implication for Japan,\"
https://www.spf.org/iina/en/articles/nagashima_01.html\]

The "**[vulnerability]{.underline}**" [anticipated by NATO will
gradually change with the environment surrounding the
alliance]{.underline}, as revealed in its new strategic concepts and
summit communiques. Recently, after the NAC Foreign Ministers' Meeting
on April 2, [NATO Secretary-General]{.underline} Jens [**Stoltenberg**
suggested that]{.underline} the spread of infectious
[diseases]{.underline} such as Covid-19 [should be included in the
category of vulnerabilities for NATO]{.underline},\[3\] [along with
cross-border threats such as]{.underline} international terrorism and
[**attacks** on]{.underline} cyber- and [**outer space**
systems]{.underline}. It can be assumed, then, that NATO will conduct
full-scale discussions on developing resilience against large-scale
epidemics.

Collective Defense and Resilience

So far, NATO's military response to Covid-19 has consisted of (1)
mediating and coordinating assistance requests centered on the European
Atlantic Disaster Coordination Center (EADCC); (2) airlift assistance
using the NATO airlift scheme; (3) the Rapid Air Mobility (RAM)
initiative; and (4) utilization of innovative technologies like 3D
printing. These have remained within the framework of direct and
indirect support.\[4\] NATO operations are continuing at present in
Afghanistan, Kosovo, and the Mediterranean Sea, so the highest priority
is being given to minimize the pandemic's impact on those
operations.\[5\]

Among NATO's core missions of "collective defense," "crisis management,"
and "cooperative security," these actions can be included in the
category of "crisis management," but, in the future, it is conceivable
for responses to pandemics such as Covid-19 to be carried out as part of
a "collective defense" mission. This is suggested by the confirmation at
the NATO Warsaw Summit in 2016 that the resilience of the military
alliance would be enhanced against a diversifying range of threats.\[6\]

NATO positioned cyberspace as a fourth operational domain along with
land, sea, and air at this summit, and its defense was confirmed as
falling within the scope of collective security. And [at the London
summit in 2019, "**space**" was **newly confirmed** as a fifth
**operational domain**. There was also clarification of the diversifying
threats covered by **Article 5**]{.underline} missions.

Escalation pathways across different domains

Modern militaries, especially [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates', are **[increasingly reliant]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} outer [space]{.underline}. [While most]{.underline}
military **[space-based assets]{.underline}** are [designed to
support]{.underline} **[conventional]{.underline}** military
[missions]{.underline}, [some]{.underline} also [play a role in
**nuc**lear operations]{.underline} [with]{.underline} respect to
**[missile-launch]{.underline}** [detection]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[e]{.underline}**arly **[w]{.underline}**arning,
[tracking incoming]{.underline} [missiles]{.underline} or aircraft,
**[guiding precision munitions]{.underline}** (including nuclear-armed
cruise or hypersonic missiles), [and providing]{.underline} broader
**[situational awareness]{.underline}** and military communications. An
increasing dependence on such assets has created two interlinked
concerns. Firstly, [satellites might be targeted]{.underline} [**early
in a crisis** by an adversary]{.underline}; [this makes
**targeting**]{.underline} and destroying anti-satellite [capabilities a
**priority**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} could **[trigger
escalation]{.underline}**. Secondly, [attacks on space assets may be
**misinterpreted**]{.underline} [because]{.underline} some [satellites
have **dual functions**.]{.underline}39

Anti-satellite weapons are not new.40 Nuclear-armed blasts were
contemplated in the 1950s and 1960s, and kinetic kill can be traced back
to the 1980s. But the ability to conduct non-nuclear counter-space
operations, through direct ascent and co-orbital weapons or by other
means such as directed-energy weapons, has returned to the forefront of
strategic thinking and planning.41 All major nuclear-armed states are
engaged in the development of anti-satellite weapons -- which are
technically similar to anti-ballistic missiles -- and some already have
demonstrated capabilities.42 In 2007, a Chinese weapon destroyed a
weather satellite at an altitude of 850 kilometres. The US destroyed a
reconnaissance satellite at an altitude of 250 km in 2008.43 In 2019,
India destroyed a satellite at an altitude of 282 km.44 And most
recently, in November 2021, Russia destroyed a satellite at an altitude
Disruptive Technologies and Nuclear Risks: What's New and What Matters
\| 109 of 480 km.45 It is unlikely that a state could orchestrate a
'perfect storm' and destroy all space assets in one go, but their
vulnerability is clear.

[Space capabilities]{.underline} are [part of a **broader
quest**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [information
**superiority**]{.underline} [and dominance]{.underline} in an
increasingly complex world. [On account of **real-time information**
flows]{.underline} [facilitated]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
information [technology]{.underline}, social-media platforms and global
networks, [it is **becoming more difficult**]{.underline} [to
discern]{.underline} [**what is and isn't true** in a
nuclear]{.underline} [environment]{.underline} abundant with raw data.46
[This new environment]{.underline} **[complicates]{.underline}**
[nuclear]{.underline} **[signalling]{.underline}** [and presents new
challenges]{.underline} for crisis communications and crisis management.
Different sources may use unorthodox means, such as Twitter.47
[Ambiguous]{.underline} [communications could be]{.underline}
**[interpreted incorrectly]{.underline}**.48 US Strategic Command's
ill-conceived New Year's Eve tweet about 'dropping a bomb' appeared to
be an example of this.49 In addition, international events and actions
that might preclude or exacerbate a nuclear crisis will be reported in
real time and publicly available. This may make it difficult for leaders
to take the time required to think through actions and increase the
potential for an adversary to shape public opinion in dangerous ways.
Imagine how the Cuban Missile Crisis would have played out if it had
arisen today,50 or what impact the 2018 false missile alert in Hawaii
might have had during a real nuclear crisis.51 [There is]{.underline}
also [**greater potential** for '**weaponised**]{.underline} [social
media']{.underline}, [disinformation]{.underline} and misinformation,
particularly from third-party actions [that might lead]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} what Rebecca Hersman [has described as '**wormhole
escalation'**]{.underline}.52 Deep fakes or other types of fake news
could be used deliberately to deepen a crisis. A bogus news story about
how Israel might respond to Pakistani military assistance to Syria
prompted Pakistan to issue a public warning to Israel in 2016.53 It
should be assumed that sophisticated information operations will be part
of any future nuclear crisis or conflict.54

The possible [pathways to **inadvertent**]{.underline} and deliberate
**[escalation]{.underline}** that [could result in **nuclear
use**]{.underline} are changing. [This is due to]{.underline} both
**[growing competition]{.underline}** over the control of outer space
and, less directly, [changes in the]{.underline} global **[information
ecosystem]{.underline}** [within]{.underline} which **[nuclear
decisions]{.underline}** and operations take place. Given the centrality
of space and cyberspace to almost all aspects of nuclear operations,
these developments will inevitably affect other military domains,
missions and weapons systems.

Panic in the skies! \"[The threats to U.S. space assets are significant
and growing]{.underline},\" according to a new report from [the Council
on Foreign Relations]{.underline}, which [warns]{.underline} that
[there\'s a **real chance**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} breaching
**[conflict]{.underline}**\'s final frontier. **[[This isn\'t]{.mark}
idle [fearmongering]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The report makes a not-crazy
case that efforts by China and other powers to limit America\'s total
military dominance of space could **[accidentally]{.underline}**
[destroy an American satellite]{.underline}, **[inadvertently
convincing]{.underline}** [the US that war was coming and prompting
**retaliation**]{.underline} on Earth. Its author, Micah Zenko, has
[made a
name](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-anti-warrior/)
for himself in report-after-report downplaying the threat to the United
States from China, terrorists, and, really, [most
things](http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2012/02/23/clear-and-present-safety-the-united-states-is-more-secure-than-washington-thinks/).
So that fact that Zenko is this [concerned about
space](http://www.cfr.org/space/dangerous-space-incidents/p32790?sp_mid=45655631&sp_rid=emFjay5iZWF1Y2hhbXBAZ21haWwuY29tS0)
should tell you something. The basic dynamic is simple: the US controls
space and its opponents don\'t. Of all the money spent on space by all
countries combined, America
[spends](http://www.cfr.org/space/dangerous-space-incidents/p32790?sp_mid=45655631&sp_rid=emFjay5iZWF1Y2hhbXBAZ21haWwuY29tS0)
75 percent. It also owns 43 percent of all satellites. It uses that huge
satellite network for, among other things, all sorts of military spying
and coordination purposes. At one point, the Bush Administration [mused
openly](http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_11/Krepon) about putting
actual weapons pointed at Earth in space. Countries who might
hypothetically fight a war with the United States hate that space
dominance, which gives the US a real strategic edge. Some have
[developed](http://www.stimson.org/images/uploads/Anti-satellite_Weapons.pdf)
anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons, usually missiles that shoot into space.
Zenko thinks ASAT weapons are really dangerous, particularly those owned
by China, North Korea, and Iran. [The **threat** comes from both
deliberate use and the risk of a **misunderstanding** that could
**spiral out of control**]{.underline}. The \"greatest threat to
international space security,\" in Zenko\'s view, is a Chinese accident.

investing**](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/16/china-s-presidentxiurgesgreatermilitaryuseofspace.html)]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[ASAT]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[weaponry]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which it has
**tested**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by blowing up old
satellites]{.underline} in low earth orbit, one of the places place
where satellites live. [[These explosions create]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[debris]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[which can]{.mark} travel **tens of
thousands of miles per hour**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[shred]{.mark} up]{.underline}** other
[[satellites]{.underline}]{.mark} and spacecraft. [[If
**debris**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[from a **Chinese test** destroys a US
military satellite]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the US could]{.underline}
[**mistake it** as a **preemptive strike** against]{.underline}]{.mark}
[its space [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} --- some of which are
[[[designed](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/military/nuclear-false-alarms.html)
to detect]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[missile

take out its ability to detect a nuclear launch, [things]{.mark} could
[get]{.mark} **[very bad,]{.mark} very [quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Accidents aren\'t the only concern. Zenko also worries about intentional
space attacks, either during peacetime or a crisis. Here, Iran and North
Korea are probably bigger threats, though their ASAT capabilities are
far from proven. North Korea has a pattern of crazy military moves
designed to extort concessions from South Korea and the West; it could
extend that behavior to space. Iran, according to Zenko, \"already views
space as a legitimate arena in which to contest US military power.\" He
worries that Iran might fire missiles into space \"during a major
crisis, especially if it believes war is imminent --- an assessment that
could have self-fulfilling consequences.\" But even if none of these
scenarios for war are likely, preparing and **[testing]{.underline}**
for space war [is **intrinsically dangerous**]{.underline}. **[Space
debris don\'t discriminate between military and non-military
satellites]{.underline}**; [[the **more ASAT
testing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the
**more**]{.underline}]{.mark} hazardous space travel becomes for
everyone. As satellites become increasingly important to the economy and
scientific research, even preparation for [[**space war** becomes
**deadly**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Impact\-\--ASATs\-\--Russia

#### Nuclear escalation is [certain]{.underline}. Past NATO exercises prove this is the [most likely scenario]{.underline} for space war. 

**Wilson '20** \[David; October 19; Writer for Broadview; Broadview,
\"Could outer space be the world's next battleground?\"
https://broadview.org/weaponization-of-space/\]

West directed the research team for the 2019 edition of the Space
Security Index, an exhaustive annual report on developments related to
safety, security and sustainability in outer space. According to the
report, in 2018 [[the **U**nited **S**tates]{.mark}, **[Russia]{.mark}**
and China [had]{.mark} a combined total of [263]{.mark} dedicated
**military [satellites]{.mark}** [in orbit]{.mark}, in addition
to]{.underline} operating [several dozen GPS]{.underline} (or
equivalent) [satellite systems. Eighteen other countries]{.underline},
including Canada, [operate military satellites]{.underline} of their own
[or piggyback military functions on top of civilian uses]{.underline}.

"There's always been this fear of war in space, as distinct from war on
Earth," says Brian Weeden, who contributed a chapter to the report.
"It's not \[distinct\]. It's the integration of space into terrestrial
warfare, not something that happens separately."

[Within [that]{.mark} integration [lurks]{.mark} the [**trigger**
for]{.mark} a kind of **[conflict]{.mark} never seen
before**]{.underline} --- [where **[events]{.mark} on Earth**
[spark]{.mark} a **[clash]{.mark} in space**, or where events in space
**[incite hostilities]{.mark}** on Earth, [with]{.mark} **unpredictable
[consequences]{.mark}** up to and [including]{.mark} a **[nuclear
exchange]{.mark}**. "The most likely way]{.underline} to initiate a
conflict [would be one country disabling a satellite or spacecraft of
another country]{.underline}," says Dawson. ["Depending on the result,
the [**conflict could escalate** into]{.mark} **further
[destruction]{.mark}** in orbit or the beginning]{.underline} of more
[**traditional warfare** [back on Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Using projectiles to smash enemy satellites would create vast fields of
space debris that could imperil other satellites, including those
belonging to the attacker, and set in motion an escalating chain of
collisions that could ultimately render orbit unusable. For that reason,
[cyberwarfare]{.underline} --- [the electronic [jamming]{.mark},
hijacking or "spoofing" of enemy **[sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark}** so
they [send]{.mark} **misleading [signals]{.mark}** back to
[Earth]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [is the **[most likely]{.mark}** form
that a [conflict]{.mark} in space would take]{.underline}. (In fact, the
Space Security Index reports that cyber[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
[have already [taken place]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Middle East and
Ukraine, and **[[during]{.underline}]{.mark}** 2018 **[[NATO
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Finland and Norway.) [The
[**arsenals** of]{.mark} the major space powers]{.underline} are also
believed to [[include **lasers** and]{.mark} other
**[d]{.mark}**irected-**[e]{.mark}**nergy **[w]{.mark}**eapons, as well
as **stalker satellites**]{.underline} that can manoeuvre alongside an
enemy spacecraft to spy on it or disable it.

Verification System Thwarts Nuclear Tests", 2/9/2016,

[The]{.underline} Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty
Organization [[(CTBTO)]{.mark} -- a 24-hour international watchdog body
-- is known never to miss a beat]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} Organization's [international monitoring]{.underline}
and verification [system [has been tracking]{.mark} all [nuclear
explosions]{.mark}]{.underline} --- in the atmosphere, underwater and
underground --- including all four nuclear tests by the Democratic
Republic of Korea (DPRK) -- the only country in the world to test
nuclear weapons in the 21st century.

"The CTBTO's International Monitoring System has found a wider mission
than its creators ever foresaw: monitoring an active and evolving
Earth," says Dr. Lassina Zerbo, Executive Secretary of CTBTO, an
Organization which also monitors earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, large
storms and drifting icebergs.

He said some compare the system to a combined giant Earth stethoscope
and sniffer that looks, listens, feels and sniffs for planetary
irregularities.

[[It's the **only**]{.mark} global [network]{.mark}]{.underline} which
detects atmospheric radioactivity and sound waves which humans cannot
hear, said Dr. Zerbo.

Asked how effective the CTBTO's verification system is, Daryl Kimball,
Executive Director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association told
IPS since the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened
for signature 20 years ago, national and international test ban
monitoring and verification capabilities have improved immensely and
they now far exceeds original expectations.

He said [[there have been]{.mark} significant [advances in]{.mark} the
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} national [[monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}
and the International Monitoring System [capabilities across all of the
key]{.underline} verification [technologies deployed worldwide
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} detect and [[**deter** nuclear]{.mark} test
[explosions, including]{.mark}]{.underline} seismic, hydroacoustic,
infrasound, radionuclide, and **[[satellite
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as well as on-site inspections ---
"as demonstrated in the November 2014 integrated field exercise in
Jordan, which I observed directly."

[[With]{.mark} the **[combined capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the International Monitoring System (IMS), national technical means
(NTM), and civilian seismic networks, [[no]{.mark}
potential]{.underline} CTBT [[violator could be confident]{.mark} that
a]{.underline} nuclear [explosion]{.underline} of any military utility
[would escape detection]{.underline}.

By detecting and [[deterring]{.mark} clandestine]{.underline}
nuclear-explosion [[testing]{.underline}]{.mark}, the CTBT and its
monitoring systems effectively inhibit the development of new types of
nuclear weapons, Kimball said.

"With the option of short-notice, on-site inspections, as allowed under
the treaty once it enters into force, we would have even greater
confidence in detecting evidence of a nuclear explosion," he added.

According to CTBTO, the verification regime is designed to detect any
nuclear explosion conducted on Earth -- underground, underwater or in
the atmosphere, and the purpose of the verification regime is to monitor
countries' compliance with the CTBT which bans all nuclear explosions on
the planet.

Michael Schoeppner, Programme on Science and Global Security, Woodrow
Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton
University, told IPS the verification system of the CTBT relies on
diplomatic and technical means.

The technical verification aims at the physical proof whether a nuclear
explosion has occurred or not, he said.

"The CTBTO has built an efficient and effective system to monitor the
Earth around the clock for underground, underwater and atmospheric
nuclear explosions. It delivers data to all member states and thus
enables a sound decision-making of the international community," he
added.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} CTBT and its [verification [regime establish
a]{.mark}n **international [norm]{.mark}**]{.underline} for countries
[[to refrain from]{.underline}]{.mark} developing and [[testing]{.mark}
new nuclear weapon types]{.underline}, Schoeppner said.

Alyn Ware, Global Coordinator for Parliamentarians for Nuclear
Nonproliferation and Disarmament, told IPS the effectiveness of the
verification system provided by the CTBTO demonstrates that similar
real-time global verification required for nuclear disarmament is indeed
possible.

He said the CTBTO and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
which monitors nuclear reactors to ensure there is no diversion of
fissile materials into nuclear weapons programmes, could meet some of
the verification tasks for nuclear disarmament.

However, there would also need to be verification of the destruction of
existing stockpiles and the destruction or conversion of delivery
vehicles, he noted.

The United States has launched an International Partnership for Nuclear
Disarmament Verification which is exploring the technologies and systems
required, Ware said.

"The experience of the CTBTO shows that such verification systems can
begin operating even before disarmament agreements are fully ratified
and operational."

In addition, Ware pointed out, the CTBTO provides additional benefits
beyond the verification of nuclear tests.

Real-time information from the CTBTO network of seismic and
hydro-acoustic monitoring stations is now available for the tsunami
warning centres -- providing warning time for tsunamis when there are
earthquakes in ocean regions.

"The CTBTO network of radionuclide monitoring stations provides
information which can be useful in time of a nuclear accident, such as
the Fukushima disaster. It is likely that additional verification
systems developed to monitor nuclear disarmament agreements could also
provide spin-off benefits," he pointed out.

According to CTBTO, the verification regime consists of the following
elements: International Monitoring System International Data Centre;
Global Communications Infrastructure Consultation and clarification;
On-Site Inspection and Confidence-building measures.

The International Monitoring System (IMS) consists of 321 monitoring
stations and 16 laboratories world wide. These 337 facilities monitor
the planet for any sign of a nuclear explosion.

Asked whether there was even a remote possibility of a nuclear test
circumventing the verification system, Kimball told IPS: "No monitoring
system is one-hundred percent foolproof, but only a foolish leader would
try to conduct a clandestine nuclear weapon test explosion because the
likelihood of detection today is extremely high and the cost would be
particularly severe."

[Unfortunately]{.underline}, he said, [[Pyongyang's]{.mark} Jan. 6
[blast is a]{.mark}]{.underline}n uncomfortable [[reminder]{.mark}
that]{.underline} 20 years after the conclusion of the CTBT, [[the door
to further]{.mark} nuclear [testing **remains
ajar**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On Oct. 2, 1992, President George H.W. Bush reluctantly made history
with the stroke of a pen. One year after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev
declared a unilateral moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, Bush signed
into law an appropriations bill that placed a similar unprecedented
restriction on the United States. Ironically, the president personally
opposed this specific measure, but his signature has become one of his
lasting legacies. [The]{.underline} U.S. [nuclear testing
moratorium]{.underline} has been upheld by all of Bush's successors, and
[remains in effect today]{.underline}.

Year after year, the heads of U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories have
assessed that the U.S. stockpile is reliable, and that resuming
explosive nuclear testing is unnecessary. In fact, the Stockpile
Stewardship program, which "tests" nuclear weapons by other means,
including advanced simulations via supercomputers, has provided
laboratory scientists with more information about the U.S. stockpile
than when explosive tests were regularly occurring.

[But]{.underline} today, the Trump administration is indicating that
those assessments may not be enough. While the Obama administration's
Nuclear Posture Review included a blanket commitment not to conduct
explosive nuclear tests, the Trump administration's 2018 version of the
document argues that the United States "must remain ready to resume
nuclear testing if necessary to meet severe technological or
geopolitical challenges \[emphasis added\]." Severe technological
challenges that could merit a return to testing do not currently exist.
Specific geopolitical challenges, a new criterion, are not defined. Does
this mean the administration could resume testing if China continues
making aggressive moves in the South China Sea? If North Korea tests
another missile? If Russian hackers disrupt U.S. government websites?

In November 2017, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)
released its annual Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, the first
under the Trump administration. Buried in this 328-page document lies
new language that the agency stands ready to conduct a "simple" nuclear
test as little as six months after receiving an order. A "simple" test
is an explosion underground without full scientific instrumentation to
analyze and assess the reliability of a nuclear weapon. As former NNSA
administrator Linton Brooks told Kyodo News, such a test would be done
not for scientific or security advancement, but to demonstrate
"political resolve." The benefit of such a test, likely at what once was
the Nevada Test Site (the home of more than 900 U.S. nuclear tests),
largely amounts to nuclear braggadocio at the expense of U.S. national
security.

Combined, the two documents suggest that the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is laying the groundwork [to resume]{.mark}]{.underline}
explosive nuclear [[testing]{.mark} at its discretion. History reminds
us that this [would have **catastrophic consequences**]{.mark}. Resumed
nuclear testing would [bring]{.mark} with it [not just **environmental
and health risks**, but]{.mark} also the erosion of an important
international norm and the likely **[set]{.mark}**ting [off an
**international**]{.mark} **testing [race]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- with
no benefits for the United States.

Over the course of nearly 50 years prior to Bush's signature, the United
States conducted over 1,000 explosive nuclear tests (five underwater,
approximately 200 in the atmosphere, and about 800 underground), the
most of any country on Earth. These tests, particularly the atmospheric
explosions, created environmental, social, and health consequences
through radiation dispersal and other effects, some of which continue to
be evident.

[New explosive [tests]{.mark}, even if only underground,]{.underline}
would also [present many dangers]{.underline}. Visitors in high-rise
hotels in sprawling Las Vegas, 70 miles south of the test site, would
physically feel the ground shake. And since underground tests sometimes
leak, the surrounding [area may be **[expose]{.mark}**d [to
**radioactive fallout**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **[geopolitical consequences]{.mark}** would be **[worse]{.mark}**,
amounting to a **nuclear testing race**]{.underline}. In 1961, the
Soviet Union caught the world by surprise and broke its pledge with the
United States and Great Britain to refrain from testing, conducting well
over 100 tests over the next two years. The United States rushed to keep
up, also carrying out more than 100 tests, mostly underground, by the
end of 1962. France and Great Britain also tested during this time
period, and China conducted its first test in 1964.

If the United States were to resume nuclear testing today, a similar
international reaction would likely occur. [[**Russia** and
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark}, attempting to keep up,
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} almost certainly [[resume]{.mark} testing
themselves. [**India** and **Pakistan**]{.mark}, bitter archrivals that
both reserve the right to resume nuclear testing,
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely see a [**[green light]{.mark}** to
explode nuclear weapons once more. India may]{.underline} see an
opportunity to [test [new, **unproven**]{.mark} **thermonuclear
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- which it is allegedly pursuing --
[and Pakistan would be compelled to respond]{.underline}, similar to the
infamous nuclear tests conducted by both countries in 1998.

In the early 1960s, with nuclear explosions taking place at a rate of
roughly every other day, international and domestic pressure brought the
United States, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union to the negotiating
table once again. (The Cuban Missile Crisis was also a major factor).
What resulted was the Limited Test Ban Treaty, a 1963 agreement still in
effect that bans all nuclear explosions, except underground.

It took three more decades, and the end of the Cold War, for a complete
international nuclear test ban to appear. The United States was the
first of 183 countries to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban
Treaty, which bans all explosive nuclear tests anywhere on earth. Only
North Korea, a non-signatory, has explosively tested nuclear weapons in
the 21st century.

But the United States has not yet ratified the treaty, meaning that it
has signaled its intent to follow the treaty but is not legally bound by
it. Because the U.S. Senate has yet to provide its advice and consent to
ratify, some hawkish voices argue the United States can -- and should --
resume explosive nuclear testing. Former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), for
example, has argued that "the reliability of U.S. nuclear weapons still
cannot be guaranteed without testing them." This is patently untrue, and
[it ignores the **[serious]{.mark} geopolitical and health
[consequences]{.mark}** that [resumed]{.mark} nuclear testing could
cause]{.underline}.

#### Each scenario causes extinction

Yorker, 5/24/2018,
https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-growing-dangers-of-the-new-nuclear-arms-race

The [advent of [hydrogen bombs]{.mark}]{.underline} seemed to
[[endanger]{.mark} no less than [the **future of humanity**]{.mark}. The
new weapons could be made]{.underline} hundreds, if not [[**thousands,
of times more powerful** than]{.mark} the bomb that destroyed
[Hiroshima]{.mark}]{.underline}. J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the
"father of the atomic bomb," opposed the development of the H-bomb, and,
in 1951, he strongly advocated the development of low-yield, "tactical"
nuclear weapons that would be aimed at military targets. He hoped to
minimize civilian casualties and limit the scale of a nuclear war. If
the Soviet Union invaded Western Europe, Oppenheimer supported using
tactical weapons against tanks, troops, and airfields. The idea of
bringing "the battle back to the battlefield" was later endorsed by a
young Harvard academic, Henry Kissinger, who imagined nuclear wars in
which adversaries fired only tactical nuclear weapons at each other,
obeyed rules of engagement, paused the fighting to negotiate, and agreed
to spare cities from harm.

Confronted with a choice between tactical weapons and more powerful
strategic weapons, the United States decided to build both. The Navy got
nuclear depth charges, torpedoes, cruise missiles, gravity bombs, and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The Army got nuclear artillery
shells, land mines, anti-aircraft missiles, ground-to-ground missiles,
and even the Davy Crockett, a recoilless rifle carried by infantrymen
that shot a small nuclear projectile. The U.S. Special Forces got
"backpack nukes" for sabotage missions behind enemy lines. And the Air
Force got the most lethal nuclear weapons of all, mounted on cruise
missiles, ballistic missiles, and bombers.

American war plans relying on tactical weapons and those relying on
strategic weapons were in many ways incompatible. The Atomic Energy Act
of 1946 specified that the President had the sole authority to order the
use of a nuclear weapon. That authority was later embodied in America's
main nuclear-war plan, the Single Integrated Operational Plan (siop)---a
highly-centralized scheme that launched nuclear weapons in an all-out
attack on the Soviet Union and its allies. But a Soviet invasion of
Western Europe might sideline the siop: tactical weapons would only be
effective on the battlefield if they could be used immediately. The
commander of an American infantry division, about to be overrun by the
Red Army, might not have time to call the White House and wait for
Presidential approval before authorizing the firing of his nuclear
artillery shells and Davy Crocketts.

As a result, during the Eisenhower Administration, the authority to use
nuclear weapons was secretly delegated to relatively low-level American
officers assigned to nato. They could decide when to go nuclear. Once
the first tactical weapon detonated on a battlefield, the escalation of
the conflict would be hard to control. Communications could prove
impossible amid the nuclear blasts, and a Third World War might begin
without the President's knowledge or approval. By deploying large
numbers of both tactical and strategic weapons, the United States
embraced a nuclear decision-making process that was simultaneously
centralized and decentralized---and bound to be chaotic in a crisis.

Throughout the Cold War, the proper size and composition of America's
nuclear arsenal was a continual source of debate, as each military
service championed its own role in any conflict. During the Kennedy and
Johnson Administrations, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded
that the United States should have enough nuclear weapons to fulfill two
objectives: deter a Soviet attack and limit the damage of such an attack
by destroying Soviet nuclear forces. If deterrence failed, at a bare
minimum, regardless of the circumstances, McNamara believed that the
United States should always be able to kill at least a quarter of the
Soviet population and eliminate at least two-thirds of its industrial
capacity. That level of "assured destruction," he later told President
Lyndon B. Johnson, "would certainly represent intolerable punishment to
any industrialized nation and thus should serve as an effective
deterrent." But the nuclear-weapon requirements for "damage limitation"
could become endless, as the Soviet Union expanded its nuclear arsenal
and the number of military targets there multiplied.

The U.S. Air Force initially wanted ten thousand long-range ballistic
missiles to attack Soviet nuclear forces, leadership bunkers, and other
strategic targets, but later settled for a tenth of that number. The
Army wanted a hundred and fifty-one thousand tactical nuclear weapons to
hit battlefield targets, but eventually obtained about a twentieth of
that number. The Navy argued that a few hundred nuclear warheads,
mounted atop missiles in its submarines and aimed at Soviet cities,
would keep the peace, guarantee deterrence, and render all those Army
and Air Force weapons unnecessary. Although the Navy's strategy of
"minimum deterrence" would limit the size of America's nuclear arsenal,
it would focus almost entirely on slaughtering civilians.

The interservice rivalries and competing nuclear strategies led to a
remarkable degree of overkill. America's first nuclear-war plan approved
by the joint chiefs, known as Halfmoon, had assumed that dropping fifty
atomic bombs on the Soviet Union would devastate the country. By the
late nineteen-eighties, the United States had more than twenty thousand
nuclear weapons, and planned to use almost four hundred of them just to
strike targets in Moscow. The Soviet Union built a similar mix of
tactical and strategic forces to deter the United States---and had more
than forty thousand nuclear weapons at the end of the Cold War.

The world's other nuclear powers harbored much smaller arsenals and
simpler ambitions. In China, Chairman Mao was dismissive of America's
"small stack of atom bombs," suggesting that his country's huge
population could survive any attack and wouldn't be "cowed by U.S.
atomic blackmail." China pursued a policy of minimum deterrence, planned
only to destroy American cities, and never had more than a few hundred
nuclear weapons. The United Kingdom showed little interest in hitting
Soviet military targets, and its nuclear-war plans increasingly focussed
on "the Moscow criterion," a threat to destroy the capital of the Soviet
Union. France had a nuclear policy known as "deterrence of the strong by
the weak," operating a command structure independent of nato and
targeting Soviet cities. President Charles de Gaulle compared the
thinking behind the strategy to that of a man walking in an ammunition
dump with a cigarette lighter. "Of course, if he lights up, he'll be the
first to blow," de Gaulle explained. "But he will also blow all those
around."

The Fourth Geneva Convention extends legal protection to civilians
during wartime. The rules against deliberately harming noncombatants
were expanded by two additional protocols, in 1977. "The civilian
population . . . shall not be the object of attack," Protocol II states.
"Acts or threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread
terror among the civilian population are prohibited." Despite that
admonition, today's nuclear-targeting policies in many ways resemble
medieval hostage-taking. The innocent are threatened with murder in
order to preserve the peace.

Pakistan is now moving away from that sort of minimum deterrence to a
more complex strategy known as "full-spectrum deterrence," building
tactical nuclear weapons to offset India's superiority in troop strength
and conventional weapons. Much like nato during the Cold War, Pakistan
assumes that tactical weapons will deter an invasion or defeat the
invading army without endangering cities. But
[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} now faces many of the same risks and
challenges that nato once encountered.

To be effective on the battlefield, [**[tactical]{.mark}**
weapon**[s]{.mark}** need to be widely dispersed and available for
immediate use]{.underline}, making them more vulnerable to theft,
sabotage, and unauthorized use. [They]{.underline} may also [[make
**nuclear war**]{.mark} more [likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because the
destructive effects of tactical weapons are smaller, the temptation to
use them may be greater. [[Once the]{.mark} **"nuclear [taboo]{.mark}"**
has been **[broke]{.mark}**n, nobody can be certain what will happen
next]{.underline}. At Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons were used
against a nation that didn't have them.

Russia and the United States possess about ninety per cent of the
world's approximately fifteen thousand nuclear weapons, maintaining
arsenals large and diverse enough to hit a variety of targets. The most
recent Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States, issued by the
Obama Administration, in 2016, is a veritable jobs program for weapons
of mass destruction. It emphasizes the importance of destroying
counterforce (military) targets rather than countervalue (civilian)
targets, and it vows to "minimize collateral damage to civilian
populations," in keeping with international law. The Trump
Administration's Nuclear Posture Review advocates a strategy that sounds
oddly elegant: "tailored deterrence." Its objectives include preventing
a nuclear attack on the United States, protecting American allies from
attack, and, if deterrence fails, ending "any conflict at the lowest
level of damage possible and on the best achievable terms."

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has also changed its nuclear strategy.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union claimed that it would never be the
first to use nuclear weapons. But Russia is no longer confident that its
conventional forces are superior to those of NATO, and so it has
[[embraced]{.mark} an **["escalate to de-escalate"]{.mark}** strategy,
raising the possibility of the use of tactical weapons against NATO
troops]{.underline}. The strategy is based on a faith that low-yield
nuclear blasts will impose "tailored" damage on NATO, de-escalate the
conflict, and force a ceasefire. The strategy presumes that NATO won't
retaliate by using nuclear weapons, too. The change in Russian doctrine
has prompted the Trump Administration to seek new low-yield, tactical
weapons. The Administration believes that its new tactical weapons will
deter the Russians from ever using their own---reversing a bipartisan
consensus that for the past quarter century has regarded these weapons
as gravely and needlessly dangerous.

At the height of the Cold War, the United States kept about seven
thousand tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. The utility of those
weapons was always in doubt. During Carte Blanche, a war game conducted
in 1955, three hundred and thirty-five nato tactical weapons were used
against invading Soviet tanks and troops, for the most part on
battlefields in Germany. Robert McNamara later outlined the results: "It
was estimated that between 1.5 and 1.7 million people would die and
another 3.5 million would be wounded---more than five times the German
civilian casualties in World War II---in the first two days." Those
estimates did not include deaths from illness, radiation poisoning, or
Soviet nuclear weapons. Subsequent war games confirmed the findings of
Carte Blanche: if NATO ever used tactical weapons to defend Germany, it
would destroy Germany. [The mere existence]{.underline} of tactical
weapons [could **destabilize** a crisis and make it **end
badly**]{.underline}. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F.
Kennedy and his advisers didn't know that the Soviet forces on the
island and in the sea surrounding it not only had tactical weapons but
also had the ability to use them without consulting Moscow. An American
attack---contemplated for days at the White House and nearly set in
motion---would have unwittingly led to a nuclear war.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, the United States
unilaterally removed all of its tactical weapons from South Korea and
almost all of them from Europe. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff at the time, General Colin Powell, had trained in the employment
of tactical nuclear weapons as a young officer and thought that they
"had no place on a battlefield." With the support of every member of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell persuaded Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney
and President George H. W. Bush to get rid of them, and over the years
the size of nato's tactical nuclear stockpile fell by ninety-seven per
cent.

Today, the United States keeps about two hundred tactical weapons at six
nato bases in Germany, Belgium, Turkey, Italy, and the Netherlands. The
weapons are B-61 bombs designed to be carried by fighter planes. They
have no assigned role in nato's war plans, and their military usefulness
is "practically nil," according to General James Cartwright, a former
commander of the United States Strategic Command. The B-61 bombs have
been retained as symbols of America's commitment to the defense of nato,
despite concern that the weapons are vulnerable to theft by terrorists,
sabotage, and attack, especially in Turkey. A few B-61s could fit in the
bed of a pickup truck.

The Trump Administration is moving forward with plans to modernize the
B-61 and would like to mount low-yield tactical warheads on
submarine-based missiles. The advantage of basing tactical weapons on a
submarine is that they will be hidden underwater---and therefore will be
less likely to be stolen, attacked, or become the subjects of political
protests. The disadvantage is that Russia will have no way of knowing
whether a missile launched from a submarine is carrying a tactical
warhead meant to destroy a tank battalion on the battlefield or a
strategic warhead fired to destroy an underground leadership bunker in
Moscow.

The glaring problem of how the President of the United States and the
President of Russia might reliably communicate and negotiate during a
limited nuclear war has never been resolved. The Moscow-Washington
Direct Communications Link, known as the "hotline," isn't a voice link
with matching red telephones, as portrayed in Hollywood thrillers. It's
a dedicated computer link that transmits encrypted e-mails between the
Kremlin and the Pentagon. A recent photograph of the hotline is not
reassuring: it looks like a computer terminal you might find in the
business center at a Marriott hotel.

The return of tactical weapons is the most controversial aspect of
Trump's Nuclear Posture Review. The new policy assumes that American
tactical weapons will deter the use of Russian tactical weapons, raising
"the nuclear threshold" and making "nuclear employment less likely." Sam
Nunn, a former chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services
and a co-founder of the Nuclear Threat Initiative, has argued against
that sort of thinking for more than forty years. He fears that the
chance of accidents, miscalculations, and blunders with tactical
weapons---as well as the pressure to "use them or lose them" in
battle---greatly increase the risk of an all-out nuclear war. Like so
many of the disagreements about nuclear strategy, this one cannot be
settled with empirical evidence, and selecting the wrong policy could be
catastrophic. As Nunn observed in 1974, after a tour of nato's tactical
nuclear units, "Nobody has any experience in fighting nuclear wars, and
nobody knows what would happen if one were to start."

On the morning of August 6, 1945, Setsuko Thurlow, then thirteen years
old, was preparing to decode messages on the second floor of the Army
headquarters in Hiroshima. About twenty girls from her school worked
beside her, and thousands of other middle schoolers were employed at
patriotic tasks throughout the city as part of the Student Mobilization
Program. Thurlow noticed a bright bluish-white flash outside the window
at 8:15 a.m. She never saw the mushroom cloud; she was in it. She felt
herself fly through the air, blacked out, and awoke pinned in the rubble
of the collapsed building, unable to move. Lying there in silence and
total darkness, she had a feeling of serenity. And then she heard the
cries of classmates trapped nearby: "God, help me!," "Mother, help me!"
Someone touched her, removed the debris on top of her, and told her to
crawl toward the light. She somehow made it out safely and realized that
what was left of the headquarters was on fire. A half dozen or so other
girls survived, but the rest were burned alive.

The smoke and dust in the air made the morning look like twilight. As
Thurlow and a few classmates left the city center and walked toward the
hills, they witnessed one grotesque scene after another: dead bodies;
ghostly figures, naked and burned, wandering the streets; parents
desperately searching for lost children. She reached an Army training
ground in the foothills, about the size of two football fields. Every
inch of ground was covered with wounded people begging for water. There
seemed to be no doctors, no nurses, no medical help of any kind. Thurlow
tore off strips of her clothing, dipped them in a nearby stream, and
spent the day squeezing drops of water from them into the mouths of the
sick and dying. At night, she sat on the hillside and watched Hiroshima
burn.

Thurlow was reunited with her parents. But her sister and her sister's
four-year-old son died several days later. Her sister's face had grown
so blackened and swollen that she could only be recognized by her voice
and her hairpin. Soldiers threw her body and that of her son into a
ditch, poured gasoline on them, and set them on fire. Thurlow stood and
watched, in a state of shock, without shedding a tear. Her favorite aunt
and uncle, who lived in the suburbs outside Hiroshima and appeared
completely unharmed, died from radiation poisoning a few weeks after the
blast.

More than seven decades later, on the afternoon of December 10, 2017, I
watched Thurlow accept the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the
International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ican). It was a
remarkable moment, as she slowly walked to the podium with a cane, and
the crowd in Oslo's City Hall gave a standing ovation. After the
bombing, Thurlow attended universities in Hiroshima and Lynchburg,
Virginia. Later, she earned a master's degree in social work at the
University of Toronto. She married a historian and settled in Canada.
She began her anti-nuclear activism in 1954, and became a leading
advocate for survivors of the atomic bombings, known as the hibakusha. A
few years ago, I spent time with her in Stockholm, meeting with
academics and legislators to discuss the nuclear threat. In her early
eighties, she was sharp, passionate, tireless, and free of bitterness.
"Today, I want you to feel in this hall the presence of all those who
perished in Hiroshima and Nagasaki . . . a great cloud of a quarter of a
million souls," Thurlow said in her Nobel speech. "Each person had a
name. Each person was loved by someone. Let us insure that their deaths
were not in vain."

The movement to abolish nuclear weapons began soon after the destruction
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In January, 1946, the first resolution of the
United Nations General Assembly called for "the elimination from
national armaments of atomic weapons," and during the Cold War every
American President supported that goal, with varying degrees of
sincerity. On September 25, 1961, addressing the U.N. General Assembly,
President Kennedy gave perhaps the most eloquent speech on behalf of
abolition. "Every man, woman, and child lives under a nuclear sword of
Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of being cut at
any moment by accident or miscalculation or madness," he said. "The
risks inherent in disarmament pale in comparison to the risks inherent
in an unlimited arms race."

That week, Kennedy also secretly met with military advisers at the White
House to discuss the pros and cons of launching a nuclear surprise
attack on the Soviet Union. American and Soviet troops were confronting
each other in Berlin, and a war between the superpowers seemed possible.
Kennedy wanted to hear the benefits of striking first. The casualties
that would result from the Single Integrated Operational Plan seemed
excessive to him: an estimated two hundred and twenty million deaths in
the Soviet Union and China (not including fatalities caused by fire). A
Kennedy aide, Carl Kaysen, had come up with a surprise-attack plan,
focussing solely on air bases and missile sites. He predicted that it
would kill "less than 1,000,000, and probably not much more than
500,000." The problem with the plan, he acknowledged, was that it might
not eliminate all of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons---which could
prove unfortunate for cities like New York and Chicago. If the United
States launched a surprise attack on the Soviets, the likely American
death toll was somewhere between five million and thirteen million. But,
if the Soviets attacked the United States first, perhaps a hundred
million Americans would die. "In thermonuclear warfare," Kaysen
observed, "people are easy to kill." Kennedy wrestled with the dilemma,
decided not to launch a surprise attack, and made his feelings clear at
the U.N.: "Together we shall save our planet, or together we shall
perish in its flames."

The height of anti-nuclear sentiment in the United States occurred
during the Reagan Administration, amid renewed tensions with the Soviet
Union. An opinion poll in 1983 found that about half of the American
people thought that they'd die in a nuclear war. The Nuclear Freeze
Movement and worldwide anti-nuclear protests helped to transform Ronald
Reagan from an ardent Cold Warrior into a nuclear abolitionist. At a
1986 summit in Reykjavik, Reagan and the Soviet leader at the time,
Mikhail Gorbachev, nearly reached an agreement to get rid of all of
their countries' nuclear weapons. After the collapse of the Soviet
Union, the fear of nuclear war receded, and arms-control agreements
between the United States and Russia cut the number of nuclear weapons
by about eighty per cent.

Republican Presidents had proved especially effective at reducing the
nuclear threat. President Richard Nixon signed the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, committing the United States to
seek "cessation of the nuclear arms rate at an early date and nuclear
disarmament." President George H. W. Bush cut the size of America's
nuclear arsenal by half. And President George W. Bush cut it in half
again.

In 2007, the abolition movement was revived by an unlikely group of
people: the leadership of the American national-security establishment.
Two former Republican Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and George
Shultz, joined two influential Democrats, former Secretary of Defense
William J. Perry and Sam Nunn, the former chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, in writing an editorial for the Wall Street Journal,
whose title aptly conveyed their goal clear: "A World Free of Nuclear
Weapons."

A new anti-nuclear group, Global Zero, was formed in 2008 by an
international assortment of military, diplomatic, and political leaders.
Both the Democratic and the Republican candidates for President that
year, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported nuclear abolition. The
revitalized movement reached its apogee on April 6, 2009, when Obama
gave a speech about nuclear weapons in Prague's Hradčany Square. He said
that the United States had a moral responsibility, as the only country
that has used nuclear weapons, to lead the international effort to
abolish them. "Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be
stopped, cannot be checked," Obama said. "Such fatalism is a deadly
adversary, for, if we believe that the spread of nuclear weapons is
inevitable, then in some way we are admitting to ourselves that the use
of nuclear weapons is inevitable."

Nine years later, [nuclear weapons have **regained** their sinister
allure. **[No]{.mark}**]{.underline}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
[has repeatedly [threatened]{.mark} to launch a nuclear attack on the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, producing elaborate
videos that show the destruction of the White House and the U.S.
Capitol. During a speech by the Russian President, Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline}, in March, computer animations projected on a large
screen behind him [showed Russian nuclear warheads descending
over]{.underline} the state of [Florida]{.underline}, perhaps aimed at
Mar-a-Lago. And President [Trump has delivered]{.underline} the sorts of
[nuclear threats]{.underline} that only Soviet leaders used to make,
promising to unleash "fire and fury" and boasting about the size of his
"button." Nuclear weapons are once again being depicted as good,
valuable things, the measure of national status and strength. The
current arms race between the United States and Russia betrays the same
assumptions as the last one: that new weapons will be better, and that
technological innovations can overcome the nuclear threat. It's a
familiar delusion.

William Perry, who's been involved in nuclear matters for more than half
a century, believes that [the [risk of]{.mark} a nuclear [catastrophe is
**greater today** than]{.mark} it was at any time [during the Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
unfortunately, agrees with him, and in January moved the hand of its
Doomsday Clock to two minutes before midnight. The Cold War arms race
between the United States and the Soviet Union has been replaced by a
multipolar nuclear competition, with far more volatile dynamics.
[**Russia** faces]{.underline} possible [nuclear attacks by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [China, France, and
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom.
[**[India]{.mark}** must [worry about **China** and **Pakistan**.
China]{.mark} must [deter]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [India, and [Russia]{.mark}.
**No**]{.underline}rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [feels threatened by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, while some politicians
in Japan and South Korea advocate developing their own nuclear weapons
to counter those of North Korea. [**Nuclear [terrorism]{.mark}** [poses
a **global threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And everyone, it seems, hates
the United States.

Moreover, the aftermath of a nuclear war may be even more dire than
anything anticipated during the Cold War. In the nineteen-eighties, the
astronomer Carl Sagan brought public attention to the danger of
**[["nuclear winter,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** a sudden and extreme form
of climate change that [[would be **precipitated**]{.mark} by the dust
and debris rising into the atmosphere as mushroom clouds from
obliterated cities]{.underline}. The latest studies suggest that
[[a]{.mark} **relatively [small]{.mark}** nuclear [exchange]{.mark}
would [have]{.mark} long-term [effects **across the globe**]{.mark}. A
[war between **India and Pakistan**]{.mark}]{.underline}, involving a
hundred atomic bombs like the kind dropped on Hiroshima, [could send
five million tons of dust into the atmosphere, **[shrink]{.mark} the
[ozone]{.mark} layer** by as much as fifty per cent, **[drop]{.mark}
worldwide [temp]{.mark}erature[s]{.mark}** to their lowest point in a
thousand years, [create]{.mark} **worldwide
[famines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and cause more than a billion
casualties. An all-out war between the United States and Russia would
have atmospheric effects that are vastly worse.

#### Irradiation causes extinction

Our Extinction'", Geoengineering Watch, 5/27/2014,
https://www.geoengineeringwatch.org/3-years-since-fukushima-nuclear-power-road-to-our-extinction/

The thing that so tragic is that [[radiation]{.mark} damage
**[accumulates]{.mark} across time** for a variety of reasons. First,
because animals and plants and [people]{.mark} all
**[bioaccumulate]{.mark}** radionuclides. And so [across time]{.mark}
people and animals and vegetation will [become **more**
contaminated]{.mark} rather than **less** contaminated. And the effects
of [radiation]{.mark} don't just affect one generation, they [affect
**multiple generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There is quite a bit of [research, done in]{.underline} the
[Chernobyl]{.underline} region, for example, by Anders Møller and
Timothy Mousseau, who [found that the increased background
[radiation]{.mark}]{.underline} from Chernobyl [[has significant effects
on **immunology**]{.mark}, **mutation** [and **disease**]{.mark}
frequency]{.underline} across animal species [and]{.underline} in fact
they [found **decline in population**]{.underline} and long-term
mutation accumulations.

[Over time, [each **gen**]{.mark}eration [inherits]{.mark} the
**[mutations]{.mark}** of their parents and acquires their own. And then
children have even more germline cell mutation and micro delusions in
DNA than their parents. [**Micro-deletions in DNA** are]{.mark}
increasingly [linked to diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} such as autism and
congenital heart disease. So we can assume that over the long-term the
health of the people in the zones and the animals in the zones -- their
health also is going to decrease as bioaccumulation, bio-magnification
and trans-generational mutations increase. And it is a human tragedy
what is occurring there.

It can happen anywhere in the world because of a solar flare that knocks
out a transformer, an earthquake, for example, that might affect Diablo
Canyon in California which is sitting on a fault, terrorism -- all of
these forces could create another Fukushima any place in the world.

Nuclear power is going to be the road to our extinction. We don't know
what the trans-generational effects are going to be, but we know they
are going to be detrimental. And [as [humans]{.mark} acquire
more]{.underline} of them, [their [ability to]{.mark} successfully
[reproduce]{.mark} is going to [decline. So we]{.mark}
might]{.underline} already have **[[forge]{.underline}]{.mark}**d [our
**[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and we are just waiting for it to
unfold.

misleading---sometimes disastrously so. This was illustrated in the lead
up the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when the United Nations cited satellite
images of "unexplained construction" as evidence Baghdad was possibly
developing nuclear weapons. It was later discovered, infamously, that no
such weapons had ever existed.

#### Norms matter\-\--despite outliers like North Korea\-\--failure causes [global]{.underline} testing and extinction

Michael **Krepon 14**, Co-Founder of the Stimson Center, "Caging the
Bomb", Arms Control Wonk, 11/25/2014,
http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/404345/caging-the-bomb/

Success has been far more elusive with nuclear newcomers, who now pose
the greatest threats to nuclear order. Each new member of the nuclear
club believes in the utility of nuclear weapons, challenging the norms
accepted with deep reluctance by earlier entrants. Newcomers increase
stockpile size to shore up systemic weaknesses or to deter stronger
states. They aren't yet ready to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
[[It will take]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[years of]{.mark} strenuous
[effort to cage the Bomb]{.mark} in]{.underline} these [hard cases. The
[pathways]{.mark}]{.underline} for doing so [are familiar,
**[includ]{.mark}**ing [constraints on]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear
[[testing]{.underline}]{.mark}, the slow accretion of nuclear
risk-reduction measures, and diplomacy to ameliorate security concerns.

Caging the bomb in the hardest cases seems as unlikely now as during the
first decades of the U.S.-Soviet competition. [Nevertheless, **[progress
is possible]{.mark}**]{.underline} when unlikely combinations of
national leaders permit. [[**Norms still matter, even for outliers**:
Who wants to join **No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [in
**testing**]{.mark} nuclear weapons]{.underline} and threatening to use
them? Caging the Bomb in hard cases is still possible because disgrace
as well as [incalculable danger will result from]{.underline} the first
battlefield [use]{.underline} of nuclear weapons after a hiatus of
almost 70 years. [If]{.underline}, by a combination of luck, common
sense, and wise leadership, [the [superpowers could avoid
**Armageddon**, India and Pakistan may be able to]{.mark}]{.underline},
as well. But they aren't working nearly hard enough to succeed.

Trend lines reflecting the Bomb's diminishing utility for major powers
have withstood the advent of new states (also less than predicted)
possessing nuclear weapons. [**[Sudden shocks]{.mark}** to]{.underline}
well-established norms [[remain]{.mark} entirely
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline}, and one of these days, we may finally be
shaken from our sense of complacency against all things nuclear except
for Iran. Even then, major powers will have great difficulty finding
utility in weapons too powerful to test, let alone use.

### Impact\-\--ASATs\-\--Recon\-\--Laundry List

#### Testing breakout causes [extinction]{.underline}

- Arms racing

- Space militarization

- Bioweapons

Rebecca **Johnson 1**, Executive Director of the Acronym Institute for
Disarmament Diplomacy, The Guardian, 7/17/2001, Lexis

Then the international arms control and non- proliferation regimes
collapsed. Americans weren\'t bothered at first, for hadn\'t the
government promised a super-sophisticated force field round the whole
nation that no terrorist or missile would ever penetrate? So [[nuclear
testing resumed]{.underline}]{.mark} in Nevada [[for new
warheads]{.underline}]{.mark} to improve the kill prospects of missile
interceptors and to penetrate deep into enemies\' bunkers. [[India had
been waiting for]{.mark} just such [a go-ahead, and Pakistan]{.mark}
soon [followed]{.mark}; both raced to test warheads to fit on to
missiles, [upping]{.mark} the [tension in Kashmir and]{.mark} along the
borders [with China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Free now to resume its own
testing, [[China boosted its programme]{.mark} to modernise]{.underline}
and increase the size of [its]{.underline} small nuclear
[arsenal]{.underline}. Somewhat reluctantly, [[Russia
followed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moscow suspended all further reductions
and cooperative security and safety programmes for its still-large
nuclear arsenal and facilities. Within a few short years, [the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty was]{.underline} just another
[discarded]{.underline} agreement. [[Many]{.mark}
governments]{.underline} with nuclear power programmes developed nuclear
weapons as well, while others [[fitted **anthrax** or **sarin** on to
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, just in case. [Most hadn\'t wanted to, but
fearful that their neighbours would, all felt compelled. [Regional
rivalries grew quickly into major international problems**.** Alliances
collapsed]{.mark} amid suspicion and recriminations]{.underline}. The
burgeoning [[arms races]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[spread
into]{.underline}]{.mark} outer [[space]{.underline}]{.mark},
threatening military surveillance, as well as public communication,
entertainment and navigation. No one knew who had what. [[Deterrence was
empty]{.underline}]{.mark}, as defence analysts calculated the
advantages of the pre-emptive strike. In that terrified atmosphere of
insecurity and mistrust, [[someone launched first]{.underline}]{.mark}.
And then it was too late to speak out. The Republicans hadn\'t yet
managed to get missile defence to work. [Such [a doomsday scenario is
not]{.mark} so [fanciful]{.mark}]{.underline}. On July 7, the New York
Times announced that President Bush wants to ditch the comprehensive
test ban treaty. A week before, the administration asked nuclear
laboratories to work out how quickly the US could resume testing after
its nine-year moratorium. [If Bush were [to]{.mark}]{.underline} back
out of the test ban treaty or [[break the moratorium on]{.mark} nuclear
[testing]{.mark}]{.underline} - [undertaken with China, Russia, Britain
and France]{.underline} - [he [would]{.mark} also explicitly [breach
agreements]{.mark}]{.underline} made last May, when 187 countries
negotiated measures [to strengthen and implement the non- proliferation
treaty]{.underline}. [The test ban is no outdated cold war instrument,
but a fundamental tool to prevent new, destabilising developments in
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Over several decades, from the Arctic to
the Pacific, from the capitals of Europe to the deserts of Nevada,
people have marched, petitioned, demonstrated and even sailed or hiked
into test sites. Many have been imprisoned, and some even lost their
lives trying to stop the nuclear weapons governments from polluting our
oceans and earth with radioactivity from nuclear explosions, conducted
for one purpose only - to make \"better\" nuclear bombs. It took three
arduous years to complete negotiations on the comprehensive test ban
treaty. It isn\'t perfect. No product of compromise ever is. The
verification system is very thorough, but it also had to be affordable,
financially and politically. The treaty stopped short of closing and
dismantling the known test sites or banning laboratory testing, which
the weapon states said they needed to assure the safety and reliability
of weapons in the stockpiles (pending achievement of their other treaty
obligations to eliminate the nuclear arsenals com pletely). But it does
ban all nuclear test explosions in all environments. India panicked,
because the treaty would close off its nuclear options. It refused to
sign, and then let off a string of nuclear explosions in May 1998.
Pakistan followed, to prove it could. Even so, the treaty held. Neither
government has felt able to keep testing, which means their options for
further developments were curbed. [Bush has embarked on [a very slippery
slope]{.mark} that [could]{.mark} potentially [put at risk the
future]{.mark} of the citizens of even the most advanced military
nation]{.underline}. Mumbling and grumbling won\'t keep us safe. It is
time to speak out.

[What would it take [to **turn the world into one big fusion reaction,

rock?**]{.underline} Asking for a friend. Graphic from the 1946 film,
"One World Or None," created by the National Committee on Atomic
Information, advocating for the importance of the international control
of atomic energy. One might wonder whether that kind of question
presented itself while I was reading the news these days, and one would
be entirely correct. But the reason people typically ask this question
is in reference to the story that scientists at Los Alamos thought
[[there was a]{.underline} **[non-zero chance]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[that]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Trinity [[test]{.mark}
might]{.underline} **[[ignite the atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}**
during the first wartime test. [The basic idea is]{.underline} a
[simple]{.underline} one: [[if you heat]{.mark} up]{.underline} **[very
light atoms]{.underline}** [(like **[hydrogen]{.mark}**) to very high
temperatures, they'll **race around like mad**, and the [chances]{.mark}
that [they'll **collide**]{.mark} **into each other [and undergo]{.mark}
nuclear [fusion]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[become]{.underline} [**much
greater**. If that happens]{.underline}]{.mark}[, they'll release more
**energy**. What if the first burst of [an **atom**]{.mark}ic [**bomb**
**start**]{.mark}**ed [fusion]{.mark} reactions [in the air]{.mark}
around it**]{.underline}, say between the atoms of oxygen or nitrogen,
[and [those]{.mark} fusion reactions generated enough energy to [start
more reactions, and so]{.mark} on, **[across the entire
atmosphere]{.mark}?**]{.underline} It's hard to say how seriously this
was taken. It is clear that at one point, Arthur Compton worried about
it, and that just the same, several scientists came up with persuasive
reasoning to the effect that this could not happen. James Conant, upon
feeling the searing heat of the Trinity test, briefly reflected that
maybe this rumored thing had, indeed, come to pass: Then came a burst of
white light that seemed to fill the sky and seemed to last for seconds.
I had expected a relatively quick and bright flash. The enormity of the
light and its length quite stunned me. My instantaneous reaction was
that something had gone wrong and that the thermal nuclear \[sic\]
transformational of the atmosphere, once discussed as a possibility and
jokingly referred to a few minutes earlier, had actually occurred. Which
does at least tell us that some of those at the test were still joking
about it, even up to the last few minutes. Fermi reportedly took bets on
whether the bomb would destroy just New Mexico or in fact the entire
world, but it was understood as a joke. The introduction of the
Konopinski, Marvin, and Teller paper of 1946. Filed under: "SCIENCE!" In
the fall of 1946, Emil Konopinski, Cloyd Marvin, and Edward Teller (who
else?) wrote up a paper explaining why no detonation on Earth was likely
to start an uncontrolled fusion reaction in the atmosphere. It is not
clear to me whether this is exactly the logic they used prior to the
Trinity detonation, but it is probably of a similar character to it. In
short, there is only one fusion reaction based on the constituents of
the oxygen that had any probability at all (the nitrogen-nitrogen
reaction), and the scientists were able to show that it was not very
likely to happen or spread. Even if one makes assumptions that the
reaction was much easier to initiate than anyone thought it was likely
to be, it wasn't going to be sustained. The reaction would cool (through
a variety of physical mechanisms) faster than it would spread. This is
all a common part of Manhattan Project lore. But I suspect most who have
read of this before have not actually read the Konopinski-Marvin-Teller
paper to its end, where they end on a less sure-of-themselves note:
[There remains the]{.underline} **[distant possibility]{.underline}**
[that some other less simple mode of burning may **maintain itself in
the atmosphere.** [Even if the reaction is **stopped**]{.mark} within a
**sphere of a few hundred meters radius**, [the]{.mark} resultant
**[earth-shock]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[radioactive contamination]{.mark} of the atmosphere]{.underline}**
[[might become]{.underline} **[catastrophic on a world-wide
scale]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. One may conclude that the arguments of
this paper make it unreasonable to expect that the N+N reaction could
propagate. An unlimited propagation]{.underline} is even [less likely.
However, the **complexity**]{.underline} [of the argument and the
**absence of satisfactory experimental foundations**]{.underline} [makes
further work]{.underline} on the subject [highly desirable]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--ASATs\-\--Recon\-\--Chalko

#### Mass testing causes [planetary core overheating]{.underline}\-\--extinction

Australia, "Can a Neutron Bomb Accelerate Global Volcanic Activity?",
Scientific Engineering Research, 3-3,
http://sci-e-research.com/neutron_bomb.html

Consequences of using modern nuclear weapons can be far more serious
than previously imagined. These consequences relate to the fact that
most of the heat generated in the planetary interior is a result of
nuclear decay. Over the last few decades, all superpowers have been
developing so-called \"neutron bombs\". These bombs are designed to emit
intensive neutron radiation while creating relatively little local
mechanical damage. Military are very keen to use neutron bombs in
combat, because lethal neutron radiation can peneterate even the largest
and deepest bunkers. However, the military seem to ignore the fact that
a neutron [radiation is capable to reach significant depths in the
planetary interior]{.underline}. [In the process of passing through the
planet and losing its intensity, [a neutron beam stimulates nuclei
of]{.mark} radioactive [isotopes]{.mark} naturally present [inside the
planet to disintegrate]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark}
[disintegration in turn, [generates more]{.mark} neutrons and other
[radiation. The]{.mark} entire [process]{.mark} causes
[increased]{.mark} nuclear [heat generation in the planetary interior,
**far greater** than the initial energy of the
bomb]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It typically takes many days or even weeks
for this extra heat to conduct]{.underline}/[convect to the surface of
the planet and cause increased seismic/volcanic activity]{.underline}.
[Due to this variable delay, nuclear tests are not currently associated
with seismic/volcanic activity]{.underline}, simply because it is
believed that there is no theoretical basis for such an association.
Perhaps you heard that [[after every]{.mark} major series of [nuclear
test there is]{.mark} always a period of increased [seismic
activity]{.mark} in some part of the world]{.underline}. This observable
fact CANNOT be explained by direct energy of the explosion. [The
mechanism of neutron radiation accelerating decay of radioactive
isotopes in the planetary interior]{.underline}, however[, is a VERY
PLAUSIBLE and realistic explanation]{.underline}. [The process of
accelerating volcanic activity is nuclear in essence.]{.underline}
Accelerated decay of unstable radioactive isotopes already present in
the planetary interior provides the necessary energy. [The TRUE danger
of modern nuclear weaponry is that their neutron [radiation]{.mark} is
capable to induce global overheating of the planetary interior, global
volcanic activity and]{.underline}, in extreme circumstances,
[[may]{.mark} even [cause the **entire planet to

Miscalculation resulting in deterrence failure

[Miscalculation]{.underline} in crisis can [resulting]{.underline} [a
**failure to deter**]{.underline} the outbreak of [war]{.underline} via
the same pathways as above. First, in a crisis, [either side
could]{.underline} continue to **[miscalculate]{.underline}** the scope
of the other's [interests]{.underline}. Although the immediate interests
at stake in a crisis would become clear, [Blue might
**underestimate**]{.underline} [Red's willingness to **exploit the
crisis**]{.underline} [to secure a]{.underline} related
[interest]{.underline}; Red might seize on the crisis to engage in
horizontal escalation. For instance, [Russia]{.underline} **[annexed
Crimea]{.underline}** [weeks into the]{.underline} Euromaidan
[crisis]{.underline}. Second, [a crisis could **escalate to
war**]{.underline} [through Blue or Red's]{.underline} **[failure to
assess]{.underline}** the other's **[resolve]{.underline}**. [Although
Blue and Red]{.underline} [will have **strong incentives**]{.underline}
[to **signal their resolve** in a crisis]{.underline} [over]{.underline}
vital [interests]{.underline}, [in a **more complex**
crisis]{.underline}, [**miscalculations** of resolve may]{.underline}
accompany miscalculation of interests. In the Crimean crisis, [NATO did
not see a need]{.underline} [to **signal resolve**]{.underline}
[because]{.underline} [it **miscalculated** Russia's]{.underline}
[interests]{.underline}. [If a crisis arises]{.underline} from a mishap,
[Blue]{.underline} may [be **hesitant**]{.underline} [to engage in
**overt shows of resolve**]{.underline} [to avoid]{.underline}
[provoking]{.underline} rather than deterring Red. [A crisis
atmosphere]{.underline} [may]{.underline} also [make **signaling
harder**]{.underline} [due to a complex]{.underline} and contested
[information environment]{.underline}, [further]{.underline} [limiting
each side's "strategic]{.underline} [vocabulary]{.underline}." Third, a
crisis may exacerbate the risk of miscalculating the military balance.
All sides will have incentives to be less transparent and predictable.
To preserve warfighting advantages, Blue may be hesitant to reveal
decisive capabilities, especially those that depend on secrecy. Blue may
also hesitate to court escalatory risk through signaling capabilities
while Red may conceal forces used for hybrid warfare.

Miscalculation resulting in inadvertent escalation

In a crisis, **[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}** [can
**result**]{.underline} [from miscalculation]{.underline} of the intent
behind mishaps, [responses to mishaps]{.underline}, [or
shifts]{.underline} [in the **military balance**]{.underline}.
[Although]{.underline} [status]{.underline} [quo-oriented
powers]{.underline} may [seek to **avoid war**]{.underline} [and
thus]{.underline} may [be **generous**]{.underline} [with their
interpretations]{.underline} [of complex]{.underline} and uncertain
[events]{.underline}, a [sufficiently **tense atmosphere**]{.underline}
[could **exacerbate paranoia**]{.underline},
[risk-aversion]{.underline}, [and **mistrust**]{.underline}, [fueling
escalation]{.underline}. The impact of military behaviors during a
crisis on escalation risk are not clear. Blue might respond to a mishap
in a way that increases the resilience of their forces, which could
allow Blue to avoid further escalation while it assesses the cause of
the mishap. Red or Blue might also be aware of the potential for
inadvertent escalation and actively seek to manage this risk. Greater
senior decision maker attention to military matters during a crisis
could contribute to risk management. At the nuclear level, escalation
would almost certainly involve deliberate decision making by both sides,
reducing the risk. Conversely, [crises **increase incentives** for
opacity]{.underline}, [**limiting** the ability]{.underline} [to
distinguish]{.underline} [between]{.underline} true [**mishaps** and
guises]{.underline} [for aggression]{.underline}. [Changes in **force
readiness**]{.underline} [could]{.underline} also [be
**escalatory**]{.underline} in some contexts, while conventional forces
could interactin ways that escalate the conflict even if national
leaders do not decide to escalate. Measures to enhance resilience and
signal resolve may also cast a nuclear shadow on a crisis and provoke
unanticipated escalation. If Blue or Red do not anticipate inadvertence,
they might overestimate their ability to control escalation.

Miscalculation in war

[**Miscalculation** resulting]{.underline} [in a **failure to
deter**]{.underline} vertical or horizontal [escalation]{.underline}.
Although each side's core interests might be well understood when the
fighting begins, the war itself may lead Red or Blue's interests to
evolve in ways that increase the risk of miscalculation. [Red might
**view the war** as an **opportunity**]{.underline} [to
pursue]{.underline} other [interests]{.underline}, [but Blue might
**miscalculate**]{.underline} [Red's]{.underline} [ambitions and **fail
to deter**]{.underline} horizontal [escalation]{.underline}. [Red
might]{.underline} also **[miscalculate]{.underline}** [Blue's
interests]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} conduct of the
[war]{.underline}, such as Blue's reputational interest in punishing
violations of the nuclear taboo. [**Miscalculating** Blue's]{.underline}
[interests]{.underline}, [Red could then see]{.underline} [an
**opportunity to gain advantage**]{.underline} [through]{.underline}
[limited]{.underline} [nuclear escalation]{.underline}. In a war, both
sides will also have strong incentives to signal resolve. [Yet the **fog
of war**]{.underline}, as well as a [**breakdown** of]{.underline}
diplomatic [relations]{.underline} [and a **shift to a
wartime**]{.underline} domestic information [environment]{.underline},
could [make it **difficult** to send]{.underline} [and **receive such
signals**]{.underline}. The conduct of the war itself could also
complicate strategic messaging. Forces that might be used to send
signals could be committed to other operations or destroyed in the
fighting, constraining each side's strategic "vocabulary."

Each side's actions in war may reveal information about the military
balance, which could reduce the potential for miscalculation of
capabilities. Yet [inherent **uncertainties**]{.underline} [about the
outcomes of certain]{.underline} military **[contests]{.underline}** may
[contribute to **miscalculation**]{.underline}. Some [forms of
miscalculation]{.underline} [may be]{.underline}
**[advantageous]{.underline}**. For instance, the US has an interest in
encouraging Red to be extremely pessimistic about the outcome of any
nuclear exchange. By the same token, however, [Red]{.underline} [may be
**prone to overestimate**]{.underline} [its ability to
fight]{.underline} [a **nuclear war**]{.underline}. The uncertainty of
how a nuclear war would unfold could make it difficult to dispel Red's
overconfidence without engaging in actions that themselves risk further
escalation.

2 The Applications of Space Platforms

Since the dawn of the space age, [outer space]{.underline} has been
regarded [as the **ultimate high ground**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} [could provide a]{.underline}
**[decisive]{.underline}** military [advantage to the State]{.underline}
[that retains **superiority**]{.underline} [over it]{.underline} \[2\].
[In the context of NATO]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}
**[space-based assets]{.underline}** [play an **essential
role**]{.underline}, [providing]{.underline} a [multitude of
services]{.underline} [for more]{.underline} [than 35
years]{.underline}. [Some of the most advanced]{.underline}
[space-faring States are]{.underline} [part of the
**alliance**]{.underline} \[3\]. It is highly anticipated that in the
next leaders' summit taking place in London NATO will recognize space as
a domain of warfare \[4\].

[Since NATO does]{.underline} [not **own any satellites**]{.underline}
in orbit, [it **relys** on services provided by
governments]{.underline}, military, civilian and commercial entities.
[NATO has]{.underline} [**terrestrial** SATCOM]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline} [and units]{.underline} (terrestrial SATCOM
anchor stations, transportable satellite ground terminals and
equipment). The C2 for SATCOM is managed by NATO Communication and
Information Agency (NCIA) and operated by NATO CIS Group (NCISG) \[5\].

[Space-based assets]{.underline} [function as **force
multipliers**]{.underline}, [providing **support**]{.underline} [and
crucial **information**]{.underline} [during]{.underline} the
[strategic]{.underline}, operational and [tactical levels of
war]{.underline}. According to the Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and
Space Operations, [space capabilities]{.underline} [provide a **wide
range** of applications]{.underline} [such as]{.underline}:
[global]{.underline}, strategic and [**intra-theatre**
satellite]{.underline} [communications]{.underline} (SATCOM);
**[positioning]{.underline}**, [navigation, and **timing**]{.underline}
(PNT) services; terrestrial and space environmental monitoring; space
situational awareness ([SSA]{.underline}); [intelligence]{.underline},
surveillance, [and **reconnaissance**]{.underline} (ISR); [NATO
**S**hared **E**arly **W**arning]{.underline} \[6\].

1\. Satellite Communications ([SATCOM]{.underline}): [One of the
most]{.underline} **[widespread functions]{.underline}** [of
satellites]{.underline}, either civilian or military, [is
**telecommunications**]{.underline}. [SATCOM]{.underline} [provides
support to C2]{.underline} [through]{.underline} its [multiple
**applications**]{.underline}, [such as the establishment]{.underline}
[of **communications**]{.underline} in regions [with
minimal]{.underline} or even non existent
**[infrastructure]{.underline}**; [transmission of
**intelligence**]{.underline}; relay of messages and control of UVs.

2\. Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT): [The PNT data provided by
space]{.underline}-based assets [are **essential**]{.underline} [for the
**prosecution** of NATO]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}, since
[they]{.underline} are [used for **precision targeting**]{.underline};
tracking of friendly and enemy forces; [provision of **precise
timing**]{.underline} which is also [**vital** for]{.underline} [the
function of networks]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[accurate]{.underline} navigation of [troops]{.underline}.

3\. Environmental Monitoring: Meteorological and oceanographic data
collected by satellites are crucial to NATO forces since they play an
important role in the planning of missions and the selection of the
optimal weapons system to be deployed based on weather conditions. Also
the knowledge of the conditions on the theater of operations allows
forces to take advantage of them, for example the prediction of flooding
based on maps developed in Afghanistan was used enhancing military
operations and provide humanitarian support \[7\].

4\. Space Situational Awareness (**[SSA]{.underline}**): Space
situational awareness is the knowledge regarding the outer space
environment, natural and operational, and its effects on NATO
operations. SSA [applications]{.underline} [includes
knowledge]{.underline} [regarding]{.underline} [the **operational
capabilities**]{.underline} [and **limitations** of]{.underline} both
[allied and adversary]{.underline} **[space platforms]{.underline}**;
[tracking]{.underline} of [space **debris**]{.underline};
[observation]{.underline} [of **space weather**]{.underline};
[tracking]{.underline} [of]{.underline} adversary [activities in outer
space]{.underline} [and **detecting attacks** against space]{.underline}
[based assets]{.underline}. SSA is essential for the function of
satellites and the conducting of their missions.

5\. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance
(**[ISR]{.underline}**): [Space based]{.underline} [assets]{.underline}
equipped with sophisticated sensors [provide]{.underline} a host of
services, such as intelligence gathering, including Signal Intelligence
(SIGNIT); [target **information**]{.underline} [and **damage
assessment**]{.underline}; [warning of attacks]{.underline} and
situational awareness.

6\. NATO Shared Early Warning (**[SEW]{.underline}**): Dedicated
[sensors]{.underline} onboard satellites can [**detect** the **launch**
of ballistic]{.underline} [missiles]{.underline} [and track]{.underline}
their [trajectory]{.underline}. [Satellites]{.underline} also [provide
NATO]{.underline} [with the capacity]{.underline} [to **detect nuclear
explosions**]{.underline} (**[N]{.underline}**uclear
**[D]{.underline}**etonation **[D]{.underline}**etection
**[S]{.underline}**ystem) which is [**essential** for
identifying]{.underline} any [**violations** of international **treaties
banning**]{.underline} nuclear [detonations]{.underline} (e.g. the
Partial Test Ban Treaty).

[Since the late 1950s, [we]{.mark} have [launched]{.mark} around [6600
satellites]{.mark}, approximately 1130 of which are still operational.
However, **[many of the non-operational satellites are]{.mark}** still
[in space]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[There have been]{.mark} approximately
[240 explosions]{.mark} in space [and many collisions]{.mark}, two of
which were major events.]{.underline} [All of [this]{.mark} has
[contributed to]{.mark} the current space [debris]{.mark}
issue]{.underline}. [[The amount]{.mark} of this space debris **[is
daunting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Estimates indicate]{.mark} **[about
6000 tons]{.mark}**, with some 5000 pieces greater than 1 meter in size,
22,000 greater than 10 cm, 700,000 greater than 1 cm, and 150,000,000
bits greater than 1 mm]{.underline}. Even the smaller pieces, given the
closure speeds, can create worrisome effects upon impact. As an example,
an impact speed of 12 km/sec has approximately 10 times the energy
density of dynamite. [A quote from a 2011 National Research Council
report entitled Limiting Future Collision Risk to Spacecraft, summarizes
that year's outlook, which is becoming ever more serious: "When a
handful of reasonable assumptions are [use]{.mark}d in [NASA's
models]{.mark}, [scenarios are uncovered that conclude]{.mark} that [the
current]{.mark} orbital debris [environment]{.mark} has **[already
reached a 'tipping point,']{.mark}** meaning [the amount of
debris]{.mark} currently [in orbit]{.mark}--in terms of the population
of large debris objects, as well as overall mass of debris in
orbit--[has reached a threshold where it will]{.mark} **[continually
collide with itself]{.mark}**, further [increasing the
population]{.mark} of orbital debris]{.underline}." [The [increase
in]{.mark} orbital [debris]{.mark} will [lead to]{.mark} corresponding
[increases in spacecraft failures]{.mark}, which will only result in
more debris in orbit]{.underline}. [The [increase]{.mark} thus far [has
been]{.mark} most **[rapid in LEO]{.mark}**, [with GEO]{.mark}
potentially [suffering the same fate]{.mark}, although over a much
longer time period]{.underline}. The exact timing and pace of this
exponential growth are uncertain, but the serious implications of such a
scenario require careful attention because of the strategic and
commercial importance of U.S. space operations. [In the literature, this
[cascading of collisions producing]{.mark} ever more [debris
until]{.mark} the [space]{.mark} region [is]{.mark} essentially
**[unusable]{.mark}** is termed the Kessler Effect. Given the increasing
worldwide reliance upon space assets, our positional Earth utilities
have made space debris an increasingly serious problem]{.underline}.

The words "space debris" refer to the uncontrolled and unwanted fall
onto Earth of no longer functional space vehicles or parts of any size
(no asteroids involved whose trajectories and their potential dangers
are considered uninsurable acts of God). This definition1 excludes
whatever is generated at launch areas, which are conceived to encompass
this risk[. Since the beginning of human activities]{.underline} in
space, the number of [variously defined [objects in
orbit]{.mark}]{.underline} around the Earth has [[increased
exponentially]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the trend is up now more than
ever with the new wave of the so-called small satellites. NASA (US
National Aeronautics and Space Administration) and ESA (European Space
Agency) estimate in their webpages that [[there are over 150 million
"objects"]{.mark} orbiting between the LEO]{.underline} (low Earth
orbit)---up to 10,000 km from Earth's surface---and GEO (geostationary
Earth orbit), above this mark, [[for a total weight of]{.mark} more than
[5000 tons.]{.mark}]{.underline} This definition applies to objects
ranging from submillimetric (propellant dust, paint flakes, etc.) to
"baseball" sizes (ca. 20,000 objects) and more. Figure 1 offers, based
on the same aforementioned sources, a dynamic ownership's graph of these
objects, divided by the launching State's property. The sharp rise of
newcomers like China appears very clearly[.]{.underline}

Fig 1. Space debris: how dangerous is it to people on Earth (Source:
Globalnews.ca---Nicole Mortillaro \[1\])

We reasonably estimate that [by the **end of the decade**]{.underline},
[the overall quantity will **at least triple**]{.underline} for the
combined effect of the big increase of small satellite cheap launches
(Google---Planet Labs, OneWeb, SpaceX, etc.), space and suborbital
tourism finally becoming popular in the more dangerous LEOs. What [could
amplify these fears is]{.underline} mostly [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
so-called **[[Kessler]{.mark} [syndrome]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[2\],
[which [is the]{.mark} massive [propagation of debris ensuing collisions
in space.]{.mark}]{.underline} As an evidence of this, ESA reports that
[[65% of the]{.underline}]{.mark} ca. [[20,000]{.mark} notable orbiting
[objects]{.mark} [result from]{.mark} 250 breakups and from [just 10
collisions]{.mark}]{.underline} \[1\]. As an example, consider that the
Chinese Feng Yun SO1C antisatellite test, in 2007, created 3300 pieces
of sizeable debris, and in February 2009, 2200 more fragments were
created by the crash between the US Iridium 33 and the Russian Kosmos
2251 satellites. Consider in fact [that [at an average speed of 30,000
km/h]{.mark}]{.underline} in LEO, where gravity is stronger \[3\],
[[even 1-cm-large]{.underline}]{.mark} (there are approximately 300,000
of them) [[items]{.mark} can [destroy a satellite]{.mark},]{.underline}
while [risk mitigating techniques]{.underline}, such as vehicle route
monitoring and adjustments, debris cleaning, onboard protections, etc.,
[are still shy of being effective]{.underline}. Although 75% of objects
launched into space are recorded as they re-entered into the atmosphere
in a controlled way (by saving fuel for the end-of-life assisted
deorbiting and demise) and the atmosphere itself, should these
manoeuvers fail, is a natural "firewall" that destroys anything
re-entering at that speed, [the risk of impacts on Earth is surging, and
its magnitude might be soon perceivable]{.underline}, on persons, land
and properties. An elaboration on NASA-NORAD's archive of catalogued
space debris shows that [[the]{.mark} actual [rate of one reported
uncontrolled impact a day]{.mark}]{.underline} (\>10 wide objects) \[4\]
[[could increase from **three to ten** times]{.mark} [by the **end of
the decade**]{.mark}, including large items. Our work examines **case
studies**]{.underline} [and various levels of debate on the impact of
space debris on Earth]{.underline} (legal, liability, surveillance and
tracking, debris cleaning techniques, insurance) to identify possible
risk management solutions to be developed in the future.

[This article **does not suggest**]{.underline} [that **o**rbital
**debris** is the **only way**]{.underline} [to **deter**
attacks]{.underline} in space. [Nor does it suggest]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} [we should **ignore**]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
deepening [problem of **space debris**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
by [itself poses a **significant threat** to]{.underline} international
[space]{.underline} interests. It does highlight some of the dangers of
rushing into a solution without considering the unintended consequences.
While others discuss the potential danger posed by the militarization of
technological solutions to debris removal, this article suggests that
the danger posed by debris also prevents states from targeting orbital
objects more than they otherwise would, simply as a result of
international norms or existing law. [One **cannot prove** that debris
is a **deterrent**]{.underline} [to states]{.underline}
[using]{.underline} kinetic [**interceptors** in space]{.underline}.
However, if we assume rational actors and that states understand the
potential threat that debris pose to their own interests, then they
should be reluctant to take actions that will increase the probability
they suffer that cost. As a result, there is a downside to cleaning up
debris, which is to weaken its deterrent effects.

#### In fact, it [increases]{.underline} conflict!

Ian **Sample 16**. Science editor at The Guardian. "Rise in space junk
could provoke armed conflict say scientists." The Guardian. 1-22-2016.

//EM

The [**steady rise** in]{.underline} space [junk]{.underline} [that is
**floating**]{.underline} [around the planet]{.underline} could
[**provoke** a]{.underline} political row and even **[armed
conflict]{.underline}**, according to scientists, [who warn that even
tiny]{.underline} pieces of [debris]{.underline} [have enough
**energy**]{.underline} [to damage]{.underline} or destroy military
[satellites]{.underline}.

Researchers said [fragments]{.underline} of spent rockets and other
hurtling hardware [posed a "special **political danger**]{.underline}"
[because]{.underline} [of the **difficulty**]{.underline} [in
confirming]{.underline} [that an **operational satellite** had been
struck]{.underline} [by]{.underline} flying [debris]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} had [not]{.underline} fallen victim to an intentional
**[attack]{.underline}** by another nation.

Space agencies in the US and Russia track more than 23,000 pieces of
space junk larger than 10cm, but estimates suggest there could be half a
billion fragments ranging from one to 10cm, and trillions of even
smaller particles.

The junk poses the greatest danger to satellites in low Earth orbit,
where debris can slam into spacecraft at a combined speed of more than
30,000mph. This realm of space, which stretches from 100 to 1200 miles
above the surface, is where most military satellites are deployed.

In a report to be published in the journal Acta Astronautica, [Vitaly
Adushkin]{.underline} at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow
[writes]{.underline} [that]{.underline} impacts from [space
junk]{.underline}, especially on military satellites, [posed a
"**special political danger**]{.underline}" [and "may **provoke**
political]{.underline} [or even **armed conflict**]{.underline}
[between]{.underline} [space]{.underline}-faring [nations]{.underline}.
The owner of the impacted and destroyed satellite can hardly quickly
determine the real cause of the accident."

Adushkin adds that in recent decades there have been repeated sudden
failures of defence satellites which have never been explained. But
there are only two possibilities, he claims: either unregistered
collisions with space debris, or an aggressive action by an adversary.
"This is a politically dangerous dilemma," he writes.

The warning comes after an incident in 2013 when a Russian satellite,
Blits, was disabled after apparently colliding with debris created when
China shot down one of its own old weather satellites in 2007. The
Chinese used a missile to destroy its satellite, an act that
demonstrated its anti-satellite capabilities, and left 3,000 more pieces
of debris in orbit.

According to the report, the amount of debris cluttering low Earth orbit
has risen dramatically in half a century of spacefaring. Without efforts
to clean up the space environment, Adushkin warns of a "cascade process"
in which chunks of debris crash into one another and produce ever more
smaller fragments.

Data in the study from the Russian space agency show that the
International Space Station took evasive action five times in 2014 to
avoid space debris. Even small flecks of paint that have flaked off
spacecraft can be hazardous. Nasa's space shuttle was struck by flying
paint several times in orbit, forcing ground staff to replace some of
the spaceship's windows.

The report follows a report commissioned by [Nasa]{.underline} in 2011
which [warned that the **level of space junk**]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} **[rising exponentially]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} had [reached a **"tipping point"**]{.underline} [in
the threat it posed to **satellites**]{.underline} and the International
Space Station.

As end-of-humanity scenarios go, that bleak vision from Fritz Leiber's
1951 short story "A Pail of Air" is a fairly remote possibility.
[[Scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} who ponder such things
[[think]{.underline}]{.mark} a self-induced [catastrophe such as
[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark} [or]{.mark} a bioengineered
[pandemic]{.mark} is [most likely to do us]{.mark} in]{.underline}.
[[However]{.mark}, a number of other extreme **[natural
hazards]{.mark}**]{.underline}---including threats [[from
**space**]{.underline}]{.mark} and geologic upheavals here on
Earth---[[could]{.mark} [still]{.mark} **[derail life]{.mark}** as we
know it, **[unraveling]{.mark}**]{.underline} advanced
[**[civilization]{.mark}**, **[wipi]{.mark}ng [out billions]{.mark}** of
people,]{.underline} or potentially [[even **exterminating** our
species]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet there's been surprisingly little
research on the subject, says Anders Sandberg, a catastrophe researcher
at the University of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute in the United
Kingdom. Last he checked, "there are more papers about dung beetle
reproduction than human extinction," he says. "We might have our
priorities slightly wrong." Frequent, moderately severe disasters such
as earthquakes attract far more funding than low-probability apocalyptic
ones. [Prejudice may also be at work]{.underline}; for instance,
[scientists who pioneered studies of asteroid and comet impacts
complained about confronting a pervasive "giggle factor."]{.underline}
[Consciously or unconsciously]{.underline}, Sandberg says, [many
researchers consider catastrophic risks the province of fiction or
fantasy]{.underline}---not serious science. A handful of researchers,
however, persist in thinking the unthinkable. [[With enough
**knowledge**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} proper **[planning]{.mark}**, they
say, [it's possible]{.mark} [to]{.mark} prepare
for]{.underline}---[or]{.underline} in some cases
[[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}---rare but [**[devastating]{.mark}**
**[natural disasters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Giggle all you want, but
[the [**survival** of human civilization]{.mark} could be **[at
stake]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Threat one: **[[Solar
storms]{.underline}]{.mark}** One threat to civilization could come not
from too little sun, as in Leiber's story, but from too much. Bill
Murtagh has seen how it might start. On the morning of 23 July 2012, he
sat before a colorful array of screens at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder,
Colorado, watching twin clouds of energetic particles---known as a
**[coronal mass ejection (CME)]{.underline}**---erupt from the sun and
barrel into space. A mere 19 hours later, the solar buckshot blazed past
the spot where Earth had been just days before. If it had hit us,
scientists say, we might still be reeling. Now the assistant director of
space weather at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
in Washington, D.C., Murtagh spends much of his time pondering solar
eruptions. [CMEs]{.underline} don't harm human beings directly, and
their [effects can be spectacular. By [funnel]{.mark}ing [**charged
particles** into]{.mark} Earth's **[magnetic field]{.mark}**,
they]{.underline} can [[trigger **geomagnetic storms**]{.mark}
that]{.underline} ignite dazzling auroral displays. But those storms can
also [induce dangerous electrical currents in long-distance power
lines]{.underline}. The currents last only a few minutes, but
[they]{.underline} can [**[take out electrical grids]{.mark}** by
destroying high-voltage transformers]{.underline}---particularly at high
latitudes, where Earth's magnetic field lines converge as they arc
toward the surface. The worst CME event in recent history struck in
1989, frying a transformer in New Jersey and leaving 6 million people in
Quebec province in Canada without power. The largest one on record---the
Carrington Event of 1859, named after the U.K. astronomer who witnessed

**Hurska, 16**

(Joel, citing Joseph N. Pelton, the former dean of the International
Space University, "Space invasion: Solar storms pose critical threat to

Ordinarily, the Earth's magnetosphere shapes the Van Allen Belts and
deflects the charged particles emitted by the sun (called the solar
wind), while the VABs act to block high-energy electrons. Periodically,
however, the sun releases solar flares. These [[flares are **high-energy
events**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}]{.mark} release a concentrated
burst of energy in a particular direction. If that direction happens to
be towards us, it can temporarily compress the magnetic field and allow
high-energy particles through the Van Allen Belts. [The largest flares
are sometimes accompanied by a coronal mass ejection]{.underline} ---
and as Pelton notes, [these have the potential to [wreak serious damage
on]{.mark} both [**satellites** and **Earth
infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There's certainly reason for
concern. On September 1, 1859, the most powerful geomagnetic storm of
modern times hit the Earth. Aurorae, normally visible only at high
latitudes, reached the Caribbean. The glow over the Rocky Mountains was
so bright, gold miners reportedly exited their tents and began preparing
breakfast. Telegraphs failed across the world --- though in some areas,
they continued to send and receive messages, even after being
disconnected from their electrical supplies. The event became known as
the Carrington Event, after British astronomer Richard Carrington ---
but what caused small problems and unusual events in the 1800s would be
absolutely devastating today. The handful of moderate **[[geomagnetic
storms]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the last 40 years have caused
significant damage to the grid; a full hammerblow would [[destroy the US
electrical grid for **several years**.]{.underline} [The **economic
impact**]{.underline}]{.mark} of a similar disaster today [is
[estimated]{.mark} at **[\$2.6 trillion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Often,
when online publications write disaster-themed science stories, there
are a number of comforting facts buried below the lede to take the edge
off. Sure, a dinosaur-level extinction event could make for a really
rocky millennium or two on Earth, but the chances of a rock that big
hitting the planet are minuscule. Reading up on the potential impact
\[PDF\] a coronal mass ejection (CME) could have on Earth offers no such
comfort. The truth is, **[[solar flares]{.underline}]{.mark}** as large
as the one that caused the 1859 Carrington Event [[happen]{.mark} fairly
[regularly]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since we started monitoring the Sun's
solar cycle, **[[we've gotten lucky]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a number
of occasions --- CMEs that would have hit us even harder than 1859 have
merely glanced us due to a non-ideal trajectory. Meanwhile,
[the]{.underline} United States' [grid is more vulnerable]{.underline}
to such events [than ever before --- our transformer grid is, on
average, nearly 40 years old, high-voltage power lines are carrying far
more energy than they used to on a day-to-day basis, and
[there's]{.mark} virtually [no way to]{.mark} quickly **[repair the
damage]{.mark}** such a storm would cause. **Cloudy with a chance of
civilization**]{.underline}-~~crippling~~**[\[destroying\]
electromagnetic forces]{.underline}** Just how much of a threat is this?
We consulted the Department of Energy's own research to get a better
idea. According to that report, transformers are custom-designed, highly
intricate, take up to two years to manufacture, cost between \$5-7
million apiece, and weigh between 100 and 400 tons. Ordinary
transformers are far too bulky and heavy to ship by road, and must be
moved around the country in specially-designed railcars. Smaller models
are available, but are typically more expensive. **[[The]{.mark} United
States power [grid is utterly incapable of weathering a devastating
geomagnetic storm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In worst-case scenarios, the
sheer amount of energy flowing down the high-voltage wire would blow
transformers in quick succession. The automatic load balancing and
considerable safety margins that are built into plants are designed to
deal with terrestrial disasters, not space invasions. Offline power
capacity normally used for supplementing baseline power during peak
hours might survive, but these plants are not staffed or fueled for long
duration. Up to 92% of the Northeast's power generation capability could
be taken offline for periods of several years. A **[[cascade
failure]{.underline}]{.mark}** that took out such a huge swath of our
power generation [[would have **untold downstream
effects**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as people [lost]{.mark} the ability to
contact **[emergency services]{.mark}**, lost **[water
pressure]{.mark}** in areas that rely on electrical pumps, [and]{.mark}
were forced to rely on [limited **generator
power**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The damage estimates aren't just
theoretical --- we know the electrical grid is sensitive to such
geomagnetic storms after a surge in 1989 caused a major failure of a
hydroelectric generator in Quebec. In the wake of that event, some of
the US-based power companies instituted safeguards, but they're woefully
lacking compared to what could hit us. Infrastructure protection Even
moderate geomagnetic storms cause significant damage or accelerate
failures in equipment. Two years after the 1989 storm, 12 mid-sized
transformers had failed --- all of them significantly earlier than had
otherwise been expected. During solar storms on April 3-5 1994, major
transformers failed in Illinois at the Zion Nuclear plant as well as
facilities in Braidwood and at the Powerton coal plant. The good news
is, **[[there are ways to protect the grid]{.mark} and mitigate the
damage]{.underline}** that another Carrington event would cause. The bad
news is, [**[we're]{.mark}** mostly **[not doing
them]{.mark}**]{.underline}, despite the catastrophic damage such an
event will cause. The Washington DC/New York City corridor is considered
to be most at-risk, with 20-40 million people in danger. It would cost
several billion dollars to protect existing lines, far less than the
\$2.6 trillion quoted above from an actual impact.

[Could space weather threaten]{.underline} our
[civilization?]{.underline} It's not a question most people think about.
I started thinking about it for the first time in 2010 when I did the
research for my novel Patriarch Run. That research introduced me to a
lot of interesting people, and it brought me inside a pretty eclectic
community: the small group of experts who understand just how close it
is our civilization has chosen to dance to the apocalypse. The sun
emitted a mid-level solar flare, peaking at 3:01 p.m. EDT on Oct. 2,
2014. NASA\'s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which watches the sun 24-hours
a day, captured images of the flare. [[Solar flares]{.underline}]{.mark}
are powerful bursts of radiation. Harmful radiation from a flare cannot
pass through Earth\'s atmosphere to physically affect humans on the
ground, however \-- when intense enough \-- they [[can disturb the
atmosphere]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the layer [where
GPS]{.mark}]{.underline} [and communications [signals
travel]{.mark}.]{.underline} This flare is classified as an M7.3 flare.
M-class flares are one-tenth as powerful as the most powerful flares,
which are designated X-class flares. The Old Man RSS It was that
community of experts who invited me in April to the Space Weather
Workshop in Broomfield, Colorado. The workshop had three co-sponsors:
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Space Weather
Prediction Center National Science Foundation (NSF) Division of
Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Heliophysics Division So I got to hang out with
the world\'s foremost experts on the subject of space weather. And let
me tell you it was quite surreal to be in a room full of scientists who
understood that the factual conversation they were having in the
conference hall would be dismissed as the stuff of conspiracy theories
if it were to be heard on the street. The gist of what they were talking
about is this: over the course of the last century, our
[[civilization]{.mark} [has]{.mark}]{.underline} unintentionally
[evolved to [become]{.mark}]{.underline} [utterly [dependent
on]{.mark}]{.underline} an [[electronic]{.mark}
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} that was [[built]{.underline}
[without a full understanding of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
[havoc]{.underline} [[space weather]{.mark} could wreak on]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} [critical components]{.underline}. In other words, our
[critical infrastructure is]{.underline} [**[ridiculously
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[the sun\'s]{.mark}
normal [weather]{.mark} patterns]{.underline}. Diffuse gas---called
plasma---flows outward from the sun as the "solar wind" and carries with
it solar magnetic field lines that become entangled with the Earth\'s
own magnetic field lines. Location of \"holes\" were detected in
indicated pink layers, near Earth. One of the most unsettling moments
occurred at a talk tucked away in the basement of the hotel given by
Bill [Murtagh]{.underline}, [the Assistant Director of Space Weather for
the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]{.underline}
(OSTP). Murtagh [summarized]{.underline} what the scientific community
currently understands about the impact severe space weather could have
on modern civilization. It was a pretty grim analysis. "[[These]{.mark}
space]{.underline} [weather [events are
**massive**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Murtagh spread his hands as wide as
his arms would allow and said, "If this represents the size of a large
coronal mass ejection, the earth would be about the size of a grain of
sand between my hands being buffeted by that storm." Although such
events seem rare on a human timescale, [[the probability is **near
certainty**]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[Earth will be hit by very
large storms]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Such storms]{.underline}]{.mark}
could result in economic catastrophe. But it gets worse. [A
storm]{.underline} large enough could **[[pose an existential
threat]{.mark} to the human species]{.underline}**. At this point, there
are two important questions to answer. 1. How is it that weather from
space could threaten electronic systems like the power grid? 2. And how
is it that humanity has become so dependent on electricity that the
sudden collapse of that infrastructure could threaten systems as rooted
in the soil as our food supply? [When]{.underline} a coronal [mass
ejection disturbs]{.underline} [the Earth\'s magnetic
field,]{.underline} geomagnetically induced [currents]{.underline}
(GICs) are created that [can fry circuits and]{.underline}
[melt]{.underline} the windings of heavy-duty
[transformers]{.underline}. If large transformers at enough substations
were to fail, **[[the entire]{.underline}]{.mark}** electric **[[grid
could go down]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [prolonged]{.underline} power
[outage]{.underline} [could last]{.underline} anywhere [between a few
weeks to forever]{.underline}, depending on the severity of the damage.
One of the many issues we\'d be facing in such a crisis would be the
[replacement]{.underline} of the transformers. The windings for these
large transformers are handcrafted, and it [takes months]{.underline},
[if not years]{.underline}, to fulfill an order when the electrical
infrastructure is intact. [In the event of a crisis, [it
would]{.mark}]{.underline} [[be very difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}, [if
not impossible, [to fulfill]{.mark}]{.underline} a large order of
[[replacement]{.mark} transformer[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [repair
couldn\'t happen quickly]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, if the power
is out across the country, a lot of bad things will take place. There is
an historical example of this phenomenon. [In 1859 the]{.underline}
[earth was buffeted by a coronal mass ejection]{.underline} known as the
Carrington Event. [That]{.underline} storm [took down the electrical
infrastructure of the planet]{.underline}. Fortunately for the people
alive in 1859 (and their descendants), civilization wasn\'t yet
dependent on that infrastructure. At this point, I\'ll transition and
answer the second question. If you\'d like to learn more about space
weather and the mechanisms of destruction to our critical
infrastructure, you could read other posts on this blog (there are some
great resources at the links in this post) or you could read the
intelligence report given to Jack in Patriarch Run. The second
question\... [100 years ago you didn\'t]{.underline} [need electricity
to feed the population]{.underline}. The \"pre-electrical\" carrying
capacity of the planet was less than 2 billion people. Our electrical
infrastructure has increased the planet\'s carrying capacity to 7.5
billion. Before refrigeration, food was grown just outside the urban
centers. In other words, everybody ate locally. [[You can\'t feed our
population]{.underline}]{.mark} of 325 million Americans (and growing)
[without]{.underline} [our electrical infrastructure]{.underline}. The
[loss of the grid wasn\'t]{.underline} an [existential]{.underline}
threat [100 years ago]{.underline} because our grandparents were more
self-reliant. [They had more agricultural area]{.underline} per capita
[around their urban]{.underline} [centers]{.underline} to meet their
needs, as there were only 76 million Americans in 1900. [It\'s just not
possible for today\'s population]{.underline}, which is [4 times
as]{.underline} [large]{.underline}, to live as close to the land (as
locally) as our grandparents did 100 years ago. It is a statement of
fact to say that our major [metropolitan centers have
outstripped]{.underline} their [local carrying capacities]{.underline}.
To meet the human need we now outsource the production of food and basic
goods from around the world. That [[outsourcing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[makes us]{.mark} quite [vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark}
an [interruption in]{.mark}]{.underline} [[supply]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Moreover, [there is a whole list of things we can\'t do without
electricity]{.underline}: [irrigate]{.underline} crops, [refine fuel,
produce fertilizer, produce pesticides, process food, refrigerate food,
transport food, etc.]{.underline} So let\'s examine a worst-case
scenario. [Without electricity]{.underline}, [[we could not
distribute]{.mark} clean [water]{.mark}]{.underline} to our cities or
[[provide]{.underline} [sanitation or healthcare]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[There would be no commerce]{.underline} as we have come to know it.
[Such a [collapse would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[result in
**widespread starvation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the **[[reintroduction
of diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}** vanquished by modern sanitation,
[**[unprecedented social unrest]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} a
**[skyrocketing mortality]{.underline}**]{.mark} rate. But what if it\'s
just a little storm? When the big players in Washington, like FEMA,
wrapped their heads around the potential catastrophe, they asked Bill
Murtagh to answer a couple very important questions. \"[[If we were to
prepare]{.underline}]{.mark} for a 100 year storm, [[what does that look
like?]{.underline}]{.mark} What about a 1,000 year storm?\" Murtagh\'s
answer. \"[[We don\'t know]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This is a]{.mark}
fairly [new science, and we don\'t have enough]{.mark} [data]{.mark}
yet.\"]{.underline} The Washington players wanted to know just how big
the Carrington Event was? \"What do we need to do to prepare for a storm
like that?\" The answer. \"We don\'t have enough data to know how big
that storm was.\" \"Well, then what\'s the maximum? What\'s the most the
sun can throw at us?\" Murtagh\'s answer. \"We don\'t know.\" [[What we
do know is]{.underline}]{.mark} that [there are [critical
components]{.mark}]{.underline} [to our infrastructure that [cannot be
easily replaced]{.mark}]{.underline}, which means that [[there is a
damage threshold]{.mark} that [if crossed]{.mark} [would render the
situation **unrecoverable**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### It is a [systemically underestimated]{.underline} risk.

**Rosen '16** \[Julia; July 14; Ph.D. and science reporter for the Los
Angeles Times; Science Mag, "Here's how the world could end---and what

As end-of-humanity scenarios go, that bleak vision from Fritz Leiber's
1951 short story "A Pail of Air" is a fairly remote possibility.
[Scholars]{.underline} who ponder such things [think]{.underline} a
self-induced catastrophe such as [**nuclear war** or]{.underline} a
**[bioengineered pandemic]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} most [likely
to do us in.]{.underline} [However]{.underline}, a number of other
extreme **[[natural hazards]{.underline}]{.mark}**---including threats
**[[from space]{.underline}]{.mark}** and geologic upheavals here on
Earth---[could still derail life]{.underline} as we know it,
**[unraveling]{.underline}** advanced **[civilization]{.underline}**,
**[[wiping out billions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of people,]{.underline}
or potentially even **[[exterminating our
species]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Yet there's]{.underline} been [surprisingly]{.underline} [little
research on the subject]{.underline}, says Anders Sandberg, a
catastrophe researcher at the University of Oxford's Future of Humanity
Institute in the United Kingdom. Last he checked, "there are more papers
about dung beetle reproduction than human extinction," he says. "We
might have our priorities slightly wrong."

Frequent, moderately severe disasters such as earthquakes attract far
more funding than low-probability apocalyptic ones.
[[Prejudice]{.underline} [may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be at
work]{.underline}]{.mark}; for instance,
[[scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} who pioneered studies of asteroid and
comet impacts [[complained about]{.underline}]{.mark} confronting [a
pervasive "**[giggle factor]{.mark}**."]{.underline} [Consciously or
unconsciously]{.underline}, Sandberg says, many [researchers consider
catastrophic risks]{.underline} the [province of **fiction or
fantasy**]{.underline}---not serious science.

A handful of researchers, however, persist in thinking the unthinkable.
[With]{.underline} [enough]{.underline} [knowledge and proper
planning]{.underline}, they say, [it's possible to]{.underline} [prepare
for---or]{.underline} in some cases [prevent]{.underline}---[rare but
devastating natural disasters]{.underline}. [[Giggle all you want,
but]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[survival of]{.mark} human [civilization
could be at stake]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Threat one: **[Solar storms]{.underline}**

One threat to civilization could come not from too little sun, as in
Leiber's story, but from too much. Bill Murtagh has seen how it might
start. On the morning of 23 July 2012, he sat before a colorful array of
screens at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space
Weather Prediction Center in Boulder, Colorado, watching twin clouds of
energetic particles---known as a coronal mass ejection (CME)---erupt
from the sun and barrel into space. A mere 19 hours later, the solar
buckshot blazed past the spot where Earth had been just days before. If
it had hit us, scientists say, we might still be reeling.

Now the assistant director of space weather at the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy in Washington, D.C., Murtagh spends much
of his time pondering solar eruptions. [CMEs]{.underline} [don't harm
human beings directly]{.underline}, and their effects can be
spectacular. [By]{.underline} [funneling charged]{.underline}
[particles]{.underline} [into Earth's magnetic field]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} can [trigger **geomagnetic [storms]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} ignite dazzling auroral displays. But those storms can
also [induce dangerous electrical currents]{.underline} in long-distance
power lines. The currents last only a few minutes, but
[they]{.underline} can [**take out electrical grids** by destroying
high-voltage transformers]{.underline}---particularly at high latitudes,
where Earth's magnetic field lines converge as they arc toward the
surface.

The worst CME event in recent history struck in 1989, frying a
transformer in New Jersey and leaving 6 million people in Quebec
province in Canada without power. [The largest one on
record]{.underline}---the [Carrington Event of 1859]{.underline}, named
after the U.K. astronomer who witnessed the accompanying solar
flare---was up to 10 times more intense. It sent searing currents racing
through telegraph cables, sparking fires and shocking operators, while
the northern lights danced as far south as Cuba.

"It was awesome," says Patricia Reiff, a space physicist at Rice
University in Houston, Texas. But [if another storm that size struck
today's infrastructure]{.underline}, she says, "[there would
be]{.underline} [**[tremendous consequences]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

Some researchers fear that [another Carrington-like event could destroy
tens to hundreds of transformers, plunging vast portions of [**entire
continents** into the dark]{.mark} for weeks or
months]{.underline}---[perhaps even years]{.underline}, Murtagh says.
That's [because]{.underline} the custom-built, house-sized replacement
[transformers]{.underline} [can't be bought off the shelf]{.underline}.
Transformer manufacturers maintain that such fears are overblown and
that most equipment would survive. But Thomas Overbye, an electrical
engineer at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, says nobody
knows for sure. ["We don't]{.underline} [have a lot of data]{.underline}
associated with large storms because they are very rare," he says.

[What's clear]{.underline} is that [widespread blackouts could be
**catastrophic**]{.underline}, especially in countries that depend on
highly developed electrical grids. "[We've done a marvelous job creating
a **great vulnerability** to this threat]{.underline}," Murtagh says.
[Information technologies, fuel pipelines, water pumps, ATMs,
[everything]{.mark} with a plug would be **[rendered useless]{.mark}**.
"That's going to affect our ability to govern]{.underline} the country,"
Murtagh says.

**[defenceless]{.underline}**]{.mark} [against such
reckless]{.underline} [power]{.underline}. Solar flares are
highly-charged streams of gaseous energy particles violently ejected
from the Sun out into the solar system. When solar flares strike the
atmosphere, they create beautiful displays of light near the North and
South Poles, known as aurora. But [solar flares also have the power to
wipe out communications satellites, disable electronic devices and cause
aeroplanes to malfunction]{.underline}. At their worst, [solar flares
can blow out power stations, disable GPS navigation and ground emergency
services]{.underline}. Speaking live on Coast to Coast AM Radio, Dr Kaku
said **[[solar flares]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[on this
scale]{.underline}]{.mark} are rare -- they only
[[strike]{.underline}]{.mark} once [[every 100]{.underline}]{.mark} to
200 [[years]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [the last]{.underline} known solar
flare [this powerful struck]{.underline} **[150 years
ago]{.underline}**, [[suggesting the planet]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[could be due]{.underline}** [a]{.underline}]{.mark}[nother [solar
attack **soon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dr Kaku said: "These are rare
events, maybe once in 100 years or once in 200 years, but is **[[it is
inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [And once the solar flare does
strike, the effects will be **much more devastating**]{.underline} than
the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In 1859, a major solar flare struck
the planet, lighting up the night skies from the North Pole all the way
down to Cuba. The flare was caused by a so-called Coronal Mass Ejection
(CME) from the surface of the Sun and has caused one of the largest
geomagnetic storms on record. Dr Kaku said: "**[It's a matter of
time]{.underline}**, you know, [we've had a big one 150 years ago in
1859. We've had a huge solar flare that hit the Earth. One of these days
one of these solar flares is going to hit the Earth]{.underline} Dr
Michio Kaku, Theoretical physicist "[Back then they only had telegraph
poles but even they got shorted out]{.underline} and you could read the
newspaper in Cuba at night by the light of the Northern Lights, the
Aurora Borealis, as far south as Cuba. "From that, we physicists can
recalculate how big that solar flare of 1859 must have been. "[If we
were hit by another one like that, it would fry our satellites,
communications would go down instantly, power plants would be shorted
out, and]{.underline} in the worst case -- remember this a worst case
scenario -- we physicists believe that [it could be]{.underline}
20-times worse than Hurricane Katrina. "So image **[20 [Hurricane

[simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and you can begin to estimate
the kind of damage if there is a direct hit from one of these solar
flares.]{.underline} "And [[we're **headed toward the
maximum**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [so]{.underline} **[more flares are
going off the Sun]{.underline}** -- [we had a **big one last

radiating from the star has been known to change the weather on Earth.
According to Dr Kaku, [the]{.underline} [solar maximum is the **most

hit the Earth]{.underline}. He said: "[**So far** we've **dodged the

How long do you think you could survive without technology? A week? A
month? How about years? Unfortunately, the sad truth is that almost
**[none of us]{.underline}** [would be able to survive more]{.underline}
[than a **few days**]{.underline} [without]{.underline} aid from some
type of [technological advancement]{.underline}. [With our
**civilization** becoming more technologically dependent, even if we
think we're moving into the future, we're actually moving
backwards]{.underline}. We're capable of doing far more than our
ancestors were ever able to thanks to these advancements but i[f we were
to be entirely stripped of them, we would be far worse off]{.underline}.
[[Being **stripped away** of]{.mark} **every possible**
[tech]{.mark}-equipment in the world]{.underline} may seem impossible
but it's \[it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}\] actually
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[reality that is quickly
approaching]{.underline}]{.mark}**; all that is required is contact from
an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) to Earth from space, and [unfortunately,
**it's coming**]{.underline}. [[**Experts**]{.mark} have [estimated that
there is a **significant chance** of the Earth sustaining a **direct hit
by** a **massive**]{.mark} geomagnetic [solar storm,]{.mark} consisting
of solar flares, which are sudden bursts of solar radiation that occur
when the Sun suddenly releases a buildup of magnetic energy and coronal
mass ejections- massive bursts of magnetic field and plasma that arise
from the solar corona]{.underline}- [by **2022**]{.underline}. Although
these types of space weather events are rare, [scientists have
**recognized for decades** that they're potential threats to our
modern-day, **technology-driven society** and **economy**]{.underline}.
[If the Earth were to be hit by a storm such as this]{.underline}, [[the
EMP would be **so strong**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that it'll **easily be
able to wipe out every piece of tech**]{.mark}**nology found [across the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Electric [grid]{.mark} line[s]{.mark},
telephone poles [and satellites]{.mark}, [would be **shut
down**]{.mark}, leaving us powerless and [sending
civilization]{.mark}]{.underline} as we know it [[to a **complete
stop**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This may sound far-fetched]{.underline},
almost to the point of coming across [as]{.underline} an [apocalyptic
science fiction]{.underline}, [but we have]{.underline} **[reason to
worry]{.underline}**, [as the Earth **already** went through an event
like this in **1859**]{.underline}. The Carrington event caused
telegraph equipment everywhere to spark, shut down and in some cases
even catch fire, with widespread power failure occurring all over North
America and Europe. [The results of that space storm in 1859 were
devastating. We can infer that the results of this upcoming storm will
be worse especially since our global economy is even more dependent on
power grids, communications and navigation systems than ever
before]{.underline}. "Frankly, [this could be]{.underline} one of [the
**most severe natural disasters**]{.underline} [that the country, and
major portions of the world, could face]{.underline}," John Kappenman, a
space weather consultant, told Gizmodo. "Imagine large cities without
power for a week, a month or a year," Daniel Baker, a geophysicist of
the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space
Physics, said in an interview with National Geographic. "[The losses
could be \$1 to \$2 trillion, and the effects could be felt for
years]{.underline}." He said.

3\. Potential CME Impacts to an Electronically

Dependent Civilization

Eastwood et al. (2017), the National Academy of Sciences

(2008), and the Royal Academy of Engineering (2013) outline

the potential economic impacts of severe space weather. In

particular, major direct impacts from a Carrington-class CME

could be outlined as including the following.

1\. Power grid failure due to destruction of large transformers

by geomagnetically induced currents. The large transformers in question
here generally cost about \$1 million per

unit and require about 18 months to manufacture, ship, and

install. The National Academy of Sciences (2008) report

estimates such a power grid failure would cost \$1--2 trillion

per year6 and last four to ten years.

2\. Outages or failures of LEO (low Earth orbit) space assets

due to enhancement of the inner Van Allen belt. A severe

solar storm can also cause ionospheric uplift which can

dramatically increase satellite drag (Tsurutani et al.

2012). Additionally, LEO spacecraft operation could be

disrupted by solar energetic protons (SEPs) generated in

2 At an average speed of 2300 km s--1

, this was faster than a typical CME and

about five times faster than the average solar wind speed.

3 The initial discovery of co-rotating interaction regions was reported
by

Smith & Wolfe (2016). 4 Named for the Sumerian god of wind and storms. 5

6 The NAS report does not specify if this is a cost for replacing U.S.
power

grid components or a global cost, but one could infer from the source
that the

\$1--2 trillion cost might be only to the U.S. and that the global cost
could be

greater.

the shock of the CME passage through the solar wind

(Royal Academy of Engineering 2013).

3\. Outages or failures of GEO (geosynchronous equatorial

orbit) space assets due to enhancement of the outer Van

Allen belt or due to SEPs generated in the shock of the

CME passage (Royal Academy of Engineering 2013).

4\. GPS outages due to GEO spacecraft outages or failures,

or GPS degradation due to ionospheric uplift and

enhancement, potentially lasting several days or longer.

5\. Communications outages due to high-frequency and ultrahigh-frequency
radio blackouts, as well as cellular communication network and internet
collapse due to extended

power outages beyond the limits of generators and stored

fuel. In particular, although optical fiber cables are the

foundation of much of the global communication network,

electrical power is still needed to power optical repeaters

and transmitters (Royal Academy of Engineering 2013).

6\. Increased radiation doses to astronauts and airline

passengers (Royal Academy of Engineering 2013). This

is more of a risk for long-haul airline flights or manned

spaceflight.

Major indirect effects could include, but are by no means

limited to, the following:

1\. water and waste water shortages due to reduced or

eliminated pumping from power grid failure;

2\. fuel shortages due to reduced or eliminated pumping

from power grid failure, which could result in transportation stoppages;

3\. food shortages due to transportation stoppages, which

could contribute to increased death rates and incite rioting

and/or looting;

4\. reduced hospital care due to water shortages and power

outages, which could contribute to increased death rates

and rates of infection; and

5\. a years-long power grid and internet degradation or

outage might irrevocably damage the global economy, in

turn greatly prolonging the time to restore the power grid

beyond the estimate of four to ten years.

If one recalls major disasters caused by terrestrial weather

events like hurricanes Katrina (New Orleans, 2005) and Maria

(Puerto Rico, 2017), one can imagine the sorts of major effects

on people and life in those areas. The most striking difference is

that, whereas humanitarian aid came to bear on these disasters, a

Carrington-class event would be a global catastrophe with little

or no aid forthcoming. Much greater loss of life could result, and

our civilization could be driven back to a much more fractured

and pre-electronic one. For the purposes of another planet's

Drake equation, our civilization would be eliminated from

the calculation. Conversely, another planet whose electronic

civilization were struck by a Carrington-class CME would be

eliminated from our calculation.

Riley (2012) estimates the probability of another Carringtonclass event
occuring within the following decade at about 12%.

This estimate preceded the solar storm of 2012, but a good rule of

thumb would be to estimate this to be the probability of having a

Carrington event during any given solar cycle. Love (2012) and

Kataoka (2013) have calculated probabilities in rough agreement,

but there are a wide range of probabilities in the literature, ranging

from once per 60 years (Tsubouchi & Omura 2007) to once per

500 years (Yermolaev et al. 2018). This work will retain the result

of Riley (2012), which is also used in National Academy of

Sciences (2008) and Royal Academy of Engineering (2013). This

roughly agrees with the "once in a century" designation usually

given to the Carrington event. Royal Academy of Engineering

\(2013\) indicates that this designator is not well understood given

the relative lack of data, but also that there are several tens of

Carrington-class CMEs every century that either miss Earth or

have lesser impact due to a northward orientation of the

interplanetary magnetic field. As shown in Figure 1, such a

CME has a very wide angular extent (in the 2012 July event, the

CME extended in about a 135° arc from the Sun), which could

strike Earth in three out of eight occurrences.

There is also some indication that a solar storm could trigger

other Great Filter events. Knipp et al. (2016) outlines a solar

storm in 1967 May that nearly triggered a nuclear war, as

American radar operators initially mistook a solar storm for

Soviet jamming. It might also be possible that a Carrington-class

event could unleash or exascerbate an infectious disease due to

reduced hospital care at a critical time, resulting in a pandemic.

As end-of-humanity scenarios go, that bleak vision from [Fritz Leiber's
1951 short story "A Pail of Air"](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51461)
is a fairly remote possibility. **[[Scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}** [who
ponder]{.underline} such things [[think]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
self-induced catastrophe such as **[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[or a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[bioengineered
[pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is most likely to do us
in.]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a number of
other [[extreme natural hazards]{.underline}]{.mark}---[including
**threats [from space]{.mark}**]{.underline} and geologic upheavals here
on Earth---[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} still **[[derail]{.mark} life as
we know it]{.underline}**, unraveling advanced
**[[civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [wiping out
billions]{.underline} of people, [or]{.underline} potentially even
**[[exterminating our species]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Yet [there's been
**surprisingly little research**]{.underline} [on the
subject]{.underline}, says Anders Sandberg, a catastrophe researcher at
the [University of Oxford's Future of Humanity
Institute](http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/) in the United Kingdom. Last he
checked, "**[there are [more]{.mark} [papers about]{.mark} dung [beetle
reproduction than]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he
says. "We might have our priorities slightly wrong."
[[Frequent]{.underline}]{.mark}, [moderately severe]{.underline}
[[disasters]{.underline}]{.mark} such as earthquakes
[[attract]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[far more]{.underline}]{.mark}**

ones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**Prejudice** may]{.underline} also [be at
work]{.underline}; for instance, scientists who pioneered studies of
asteroid and comet **[[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** complained about
[[confront]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[a **pervasive "giggle
factor."**]{.underline}]{.mark} [Consciously or
[unconsciously]{.mark}]{.underline}, Sandberg says,
[[many]{.underline}]{.mark} [researchers]{.underline}
[[consider]{.underline} [catastrophic risks]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
province of **[fiction]{.mark} or fantasy**]{.underline}---**[not
serious science]{.underline}**. A handful of researchers, however,
persist in thinking the unthinkable. With enough knowledge and proper
planning, they say, it's possible to prepare for---or in some cases
prevent---rare but devastating natural disasters. **[[Giggle all you
want]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[but the **survival of human civilization
could be at stake**]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Threat one: Solar
storms]{.underline}** [[One **threat to civilization** could
come]{.mark} not [from]{.mark} too little sun, as in Leiber's story, but
from too much]{.underline}. Bill Murtagh has seen how it might start. On
the morning of 23 **[July 2012]{.underline}**, he sat before a colorful
array of screens at the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's Space Weather Prediction
Center](http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) in Boulder, Colorado, watching twin
clouds of energetic particles---known as [[a]{.mark} coronal mass
ejection]{.underline} (**[[CME]{.underline}]{.mark}**)---erupt from the
sun and barrel into space. A mere 19 hours later, the solar buckshot
[blazed past]{.underline} the spot where **[Earth]{.underline}** [had
been **just days before**]{.underline}. [If it had hit us]{.underline},
[scientists say, we might **still be reeling**]{.underline}. Now the
assistant director of space weather at the [White House Office of
Science and Technology
Policy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp) in
Washington, D.C., Murtagh spends much of his time pondering solar
eruptions. CMEs don't harm human beings directly, and their effects can
be spectacular. By funneling charged particles into Earth's magnetic
field, [[they]{.mark} can [trigger **geomagnetic
storms**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} ignite
dazzling auroral displays. But those storms can also induce dangerous
electrical currents in long-distance power lines. The currents last only
a few minutes, but they can **[[take out]{.mark} electrical
[grids]{.mark}]{.underline}** by destroying high-voltage
transformers---particularly at high latitudes, where Earth's magnetic
field lines converge as they arc toward the surface. The worst CME event
in recent history struck in 1989, frying a transformer in New Jersey and
leaving 6 million people in Quebec province in Canada without power.
[The largest one on record---the Carrington Event of 1859, named after
the U.K. astronomer who witnessed the accompanying solar flare---was up
to 10 times more intense.]{.underline} It sent searing currents racing
through telegraph cables, sparking fires and shocking operators, while
the northern lights danced as far south as Cuba. "It was awesome," says
Patricia Reiff, a space physicist at Rice University in Houston, Texas.
[But if another storm that size struck today's infrastructure, she
says]{.underline}, "**[there would be tremendous
consequences]{.underline}**." Some researchers fear that another
Carrington-like event could destroy tens to hundreds of transformers,
[[plunging]{.underline}]{.mark} vast portions of **[[entire
continents]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[into the dark
for]{.underline}]{.mark} weeks or months---perhaps even
**[[years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Murtagh says. That's because the
custom-built, house-sized replacement transformers can't be bought off
the shelf. Transformer manufacturers maintain that such fears are
overblown and that most equipment would survive. But Thomas Overbye, an
electrical engineer at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,
says nobody knows for sure. "We don't have a lot of data associated with
large storms because they are very rare," he says. What's clear is that
[[widespread blackouts could be **catastrophic**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[especially in countries that depend on highly developed electrical
grids]{.underline}. "We've done a marvelous job creating a great
vulnerability to this threat," Murtagh says. [Information technologies,
**fuel**]{.underline} pipelines[, **water**]{.underline} pumps[, ATMs,
**[everything with a plug]{.mark}** would be [rendered
**useless**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "That's going to affect our ability to
govern the country," Murtagh says. [A **major event** could occur
**[within our lifetimes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Research
suggests]{.underline} that [Carrington]{.underline}-like [storms strike
Earth]{.underline} once every few centuries; a recent study found
[a]{.underline} **[12% chance]{.underline}** [that such a storm will
occur in **the next decade**]{.underline}.

[[With **key space weather satellites expected to

[[replacement]{.underline}]{.mark}s, "small [[satellites may be the
**only way of averting a bleak future**]{.underline}]{.mark}," said
Daniel Baker, director of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for
Atmospheric and Space Physics. [[**Many** of the instruments the U.S.

beyond**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[their]{.underline}]{.mark} [anticipated
[life spans]{.mark}]{.underline}. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) is sending new instruments into orbit on its
latest generation of geostationary weather satellites but other updates
to the space weather constellation are likely to fly years after current
instruments fail. That's prompting government, industry and academic
experts to consider how cubesats and small satellites could help. "Most
of the measurements we're making for operational space weather certainly
can be done with smaller satellites," said Douglas Biesecker, NOAA
National Space Weather Prediction Center's research and customer
requirements section lead. "For certain problems, you want a bunch of
distributed satellites." [To date, large government satellites have been
packed with multiple state-of-the-art sensors to provide exquisite
detail of the space weather environment at a single point in
space]{.underline}. [While cubesats are **not likely to replace** the
large observatories at the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point anytime
soon]{.underline}, a constellation of the miniature spacecraft orbiting
Earth at all longitudes and various altitudes would be helpful in
monitoring energetic particles and magnetic fields, said Biesecker, a
solar physicist and program scientist for NOAA's Deep Space Climate
Observatory, a 570-kilogram satellite launched in 2015 to track solar
wind from L1, a gravitationally stable perch 1.5 million kilometers from
Earth. An aging observing network **[[Key space weather

**2024**]{.underline}. The Deep Space Climate Observatory
\[**[DSCOVR]{.underline}**\] has performed many of the same jobs at L1
since 2015 but it [**doesn't have ACE's ability** to measure energetic
particles]{.underline}. One of NASA's two Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory or STEREO satellites, sent in 2006 to orbit the sun and
provide imagery of coronal mass ejections and other phenomena, still
works but by 2022 [it will be too close to Earth to act as an L5 proxy,
meaning it will no longer offer the **unique vantage point** to detect
solar activity days before it reaches Earth]{.underline}. [[Space
weather forecasters face **multiyear gaps** in]{.mark} several [**key
monitoring capabilities**]{.mark} even as existing satellites such as
**ACE**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[SOHO]{.underline}** [continue

[solar panels are expected to reach the point where they **no longer**
provide necessary power. SOHO has monitored the sun's coronal mass
ejections from L1 since 1995]{.underline}. To make up for those
shortfalls, NOAA launched Geostationary Operational Environment
Satellite-16 in 2016 and GOES-17 in 2018 with four space weather
instruments. The next satellite in the series, GOES-T, is equipped with
the same sensors and was slated to launch in 2020 before NASA discovered
problems with the Advanced Baseline Imager's cooling system. NOAA is
seeking funding to install a fifth instrument, a Naval Research
Laboratory compact coronagraph, on GOES-U set to launch in 2024. In
addition, NASA began soliciting information in October on future space
weather satellites, instruments and services in anticipation NOAA's
proposed Space Weather Follow-On, an observatory at L1 to gather imagery
of coronal mass ejection and monitor solar wind. Meanwhile, Ball
Aerospace is installing an energetic charged particle sensor on Weather
System Follow-on-Microwave, an Air Force satellite to track ocean
surface winds and tropical cyclone intensity. Starting in the early
2020s, the Air Force plans to install energetic charged particle sensors
on all spacecraft. Filling in holes The [new programs promise **valuable
data** but [space weather monitoring is an **enormous
job**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[It requires **ongoing
observation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of the sun,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[its magnetic field and solar wind as well as Earth's magnetosphere,
ionosphere and thermosphere]{.underline}. "[The space weather
environment is **vast**,]{.underline} reaching from the surface of the
sun almost to the surface of the Earth," said Dave Klumpar, director of
Montana State University's Space Science and Engineering Laboratory.
"[It is a large, highly complex, dynamic and nonlinear
system]{.underline}." [[The new programs]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[not likely]{.underline}]{.mark}** "[[to
**fill the holes** in our observing platform]{.underline}]{.mark}; to
look at sun in three-dimensions and understand its interactions with
nearEarth space," Baker said. In 2012, Baker and NASA associate
administrator Thomas Zurbuchen cochaired the National Research Council's
decadal survey on solar and space physics. That committee recommended
annual expenditures of \$100 million to \$200 million, or \$1 billion to
\$2 billion over a decade, for an operational space weather system. "The
agencies and Congress have not had the stomach for doing that," Baker
said. "We have a better chance of getting some pieces of this with small
satellites rather than with large satellites."

#### Redundancy prevents collapse

Paul **Brodsky 18**, Senior Analyst at TeleGeography, \"Submarine Cable
Redundancy, Explained,\" No Publication,
https://blog.telegeography.com/what-is-submarine-cable-redundancy

Most [cable]{.underline}-using [[companies follow a "safety in
numbers]{.mark}" approach, **[spreading their networks' capacity over
multiple cables]{.mark}** so that if [one goes down, their network will
run smoothly]{.mark}]{.underline} over other cables while service is
restored on the damaged one. This is redundancy.

When multiple [[submarine cables are available between two nodes, data
transmission may take multiple paths.]{.underline}]{.mark} Two cables
traveling between nodes provide one level of redundancy. Three provide
two levels of redundancy, and so on.

So take David Belson's story for Dyn, which explains that "[[with
multiple submarine cables landing in]{.underline}]{.mark} Western
African countries that provide service between countries...[[network
providers in these countries have an opportunity to take advantage of
this redundancy]{.underline}]{.mark} to mitigate the potential impact of
problems."

[[**Every couple of months** a]{.mark} major [report is released that

[[produced]{.underline}]{.mark} in an effort [[to **shock people into
reading** the report]{.underline}]{.mark} and then promote the author's
solution to the problem. A recent example of this comes from storage
behemoth EMC which cited that by 2019 the internet would collapse under
the weight of content being relentlessly generated. The general theme of
[EMC's report is that]{.underline} our desire to consume and share is
ever present. In fact, the accepted assumption now is that if you're an
organisation, you want the content you create to spread globally. By
doing that, combined with all you can eat storage offers from the likes
of Dropbox and Microsoft, [we are all heading for a technological
apocalypse]{.underline} as our data centre infrastructure crumbles under
the pressure of our storage needs. **[But actually, [that's]{.mark} just
[not the case]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Technology has a knack of
**relentlessly improving its capacity** to support
our]{.underline}]{.mark} insatiable [[demand]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Gordon [Moore could be the father of the modern]{.underline} global
[economy when]{.underline} in 1965 [he analysed the density with which
you can put transistors onto a silicon wafer. The paper]{.underline} he
wrote, called, 'Cramming more components onto integrated circuits',
Electronics Magazine 19 April 1965, [noted that the number of components
in integrated [circuits]{.mark} had **[doubled every year from the
invention]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the integrated circuit in 1958 until
1965. The [paper concluded saying that that [there was no reason
this]{.mark} consistent '**[upgrade' would ever stop]{.mark}**. . What
is striking is that **[the paper was right]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
hard disk you bought 10 years ago cost the same, but the volume is 1000
times more. The networks we use are 100 times cheaper and bigger in both
direction. [The shift to cloud computing is as much about efficiently
using silicon as convenience for the customer]{.underline}. [Whether
it's to make financial trading faster, take photos]{.underline} with
millions of pixels [or watch TV]{.underline} on the train, we simply
want to do everything everywhere all the time, faster.
[**[Tech]{.mark}nology simply [looks at what's hindering us and removes
it]{.mark}**. Making technology the **ultimate convenience
enabler**]{.underline}. [So will technology just keeping on improving,
enabling us to keep up with demand? **It might**]{.underline}, but
there's a second powerful factor to consider, and that's our fickle
nature as human beings. Our love of convenience feeds our impatience. So
if, a great social media site gets overly exploited by people trying to
sell to you, or your inbox gets rammed full of promotions we simply
switch off and move on to the new thing. Despite all the choice

Exercises

With the upcoming end of the International Security Assistance Force's
(ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, NATO is expected to shift its emphasis
from operational engagement to operational preparedness through its CFI.
CFI is intended to build on the Alliance's recent experience in
Afghanistan and ensure the Allies can work even more effectively
together in the future.102 [A key pillar of this initiative]{.underline}
[is **increased exercises**]{.underline} as "[an **essential
means**]{.underline} [for forces to practice **tactics**]{.underline},
techniques and [procedures]{.underline}, [**promote** and gauge
**interoperability**]{.underline}, **[validate training]{.underline}**
and, when required, [certify **headquarters**]{.underline}, [units and
**formations**]{.underline}."103

[In order to ensure]{.underline} the [Alliance]{.underline} [is able
to]{.underline} fully [**exploit** space capabilities]{.underline},
[**space** operations]{.underline} [should be
**incorporated**]{.underline} [into a **variety** of
tactical]{.underline}, operational, and **[strategic]{.underline}**
level [exercises]{.underline} [and war games]{.underline}. At the
tactical level, [this could **include**]{.underline} such things as a
[multi-national **RED FLAG exercise**]{.underline}. [RED FLAG is a
**realistic**]{.underline} [combat training exercise]{.underline}
[involving]{.underline} [the **air forces**]{.underline} [of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its allies]{.underline}. Conducted on the vast bombing and gunnery
ranges of the Nevada Test and Training Range, RED FLAG was established
in 1975 to maximize the combat readiness, capability and survivability
of participating units by providing realistic training in a combined
air, ground, space and electronic threat environment as well as a free
exchange of ideas between forces.104 Participating units execute
missions against an opposing "Aggressor" force specially trained to
replicate the tactics and techniques of potential adversaries. While Red
Flag originally developed a flyer\'s combat proficiency, the last eight
years have slowly incorporated space and cyberspace capabilities.105
Previously segregated from the CAF participants, space and cyber
operators are now fully integrated at the tactical level as a primary
training audience.

[At the **operational** level]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} [could
**participate** in a BLUE FLAG]{.underline} [exercise]{.underline}.
[BLUE FLAG]{.underline} [is an U.S. Air Force]{.underline} "Air Combat
Command-sponsored [exercise program that]{.underline}
[provides]{.underline} [**doctrinally-correct** air, space]{.underline},
[and cyberspace]{.underline} crisis **[action planning]{.underline}**
(CAP) [and]{.underline} command and control (**[C2]{.underline}**)
[training for joint]{.underline}/coalition [air
**components**]{.underline} [and **operational**]{.underline}-level
[headquarters]{.underline} at the operational level of war."106 Just as
RED FLAG is intended to increase the combat survivability of tactical
forces, the [goal]{.underline} of BLUE FLAG [is to train
**commanders**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} staff [officers at the
**operational level of war**]{.underline} [so]{.underline} "[they
can]{.underline} immediately [**participate** in directing]{.underline}
[an air war]{.underline} and make smart decisions during the critical
first days of an engagement."107

Interoperability has been an issue in the land, air, and maritime
domains. [Space-assets]{.underline} planning [would
**benefit**]{.underline} from the lessons learned in those domains --
for instance, [by **studying** and understanding]{.underline} [the
**complexities**]{.underline} [involved in
**intelligence**]{.underline}- [and]{.underline}
**[information-sharing]{.underline}** [across all domains]{.underline}.
[Allies]{.underline} could **[allocate funds]{.underline}** [towards a
body of work]{.underline} [that could focus on]{.underline}
**[interoperability]{.underline}** in space. [**Doctrines** and
**standardization**]{.underline} [could help]{.underline} [to improve
interoperability]{.underline} [among **allied systems**]{.underline}.
Yet, [allies]{.underline} should also [realize that
**standardization**]{.underline} [would mean]{.underline}
[using]{.underline} the **[same vectors]{.underline}** [as a
baseline]{.underline}, thus leading to an increase in risk (in the
remaining vulnerabilities) across the alliance as a whole.

> Allies should realize that standardization would mean using the same
> vectors as a baseline, thus leading to an increase in risk across the
> alliance as a whole.

In order to share secure information through SATCOM units, France,
Germany, Norway and the US have formed the multilateral Coalition
Network for Secure Information Sharing (CoNSIS). Through secure
communications systems, CoNSIS's objective is to enable better and more
accurate decision-making, within a shorter period of time.71 In order to
ease interoperability, CoNSIS uses commercial standards as its
baseline.72 For future applications, it is advisable to check whether
commercial standards meet cybersecurity demands for military
requirements.

[Interoperability]{.underline} in technology [is desirable]{.underline}
but remains a challenging construct. [It could become the **role of
NATO** to make **national space services**]{.underline}
[interoperable]{.underline}. [Creating a **catalogue**]{.underline} of
national services [might be a **good starting point**]{.underline}.
[Interoperability]{.underline} could also [be established
at]{.underline} [the **product level**]{.underline} (for example, [in
the **field of space**]{.underline} [weather]{.underline} information)
[where the products]{.underline} [are **standardized**]{.underline}
across the alliance. In order to incentivize nations to invest in this
endeavour, it might be helpful to calculate the cost of inadequate
interoperability across the alliance to demonstrate current or potential
monetary losses.

**The AFF is key to [conflict mitigation]{.underline}\-\--otherwise
[miscalc]{.underline} is [inevitable]{.underline}.**

[The demand for the services offered by]{.underline} the [geospatial
technologies for different applications, such as utilities,
transportation, defense & intelligence, infrastructural development, and
others, has **grown significantly** over the years]{.underline}.
[[Geospatial tech]{.mark}nology is [an **evolving** ]{.mark}**area** of
interest that comprises Remote Sensing, Global Positioning System, and
Geographic Information System]{.underline}. Companies operating in the
[geospatial tech]{.underline}nology field [offer **satellite imagery,
aerial survey mapping services, and satellite data
services**]{.underline}, among others. [This technology allows us to
obtain information about the Earth's surface which is used for further
analysis and visualization.]{.underline} The rising advancements and
miniaturization of sensors have opened new prospects for geospatial data
collection. The smaller versions of the existing systems, for instance,
mini-satellites to drones, which are equipped with various sensors, are
allowing the experts to gather data that seemed impossible in the past
decade. [Geospatial technology is playing a **crucial role** in
**revolutionizing space missions**]{.underline}. A few years back,
designing, launching and operating satellites used to be an expensive
deal. But, with the advent of small satellites and CubeSats, which are
integrated with geospatial technology, space missions are becoming more
economical. With the modernization of military technologies, [the manner
in which the wars are being fought today has **completely**
**transformed**]{.underline} over the years. Today, the [defense forces
have to be prepared against the insurgency strategies, advanced
weaponry, and the emerging virtual warfare, which makes the use of
intelligence regarding the prediction and prevention of such
movements]{.underline} just as **[crucial]{.underline}** as
on-the-ground warfare operations. [Geospatial tools [provide]{.mark} the
[ability to **predict, monitor**, and **counter threats**, and help to
**plan and support the field operation**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline}. The
[[use of **cutting-edge** geospatial]{.mark} analytics software, Big
Data, and advanced imaging technologies along with the high-resolution
Remote Sensing satellites, drones, and other sensors]{.underline}. This
[allows a smooth flow of crucial data among law enforcement and
intelligence agencies to address pre, actual, and post-war scenarios.
The real-time images and insights of the affected areas are
[**critically important** to enhance the emergency response time
particularly in **highly risky zones**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
national borders. [Considering the fact that the situations can
completely transform **at any time**, the importance of **situational
awareness** has been acknowledged by the defense authorities across the
world. Geospatial data is quite helpful for]{.underline} the border
[security operations to [provide **precise situational
awareness**]{.mark} information [permitting **fast
decision-making**]{.mark}, [while]{.mark} on the other hand, [**reducing
the risks**, and **increasing national security**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
To support the army operations across the world and help army units stay
ready for any unfavorable circumstances, [the U.S. Army Environmental
Command's (**USAEC**) Geospatial Information & Services team makes use
of the geospatial technologies]{.underline}. It uses the technologies
[to effectively collect, store, interpret, examine and display the
information to **enhance** the **decision making** of the defense
forces.]{.underline} The Israel defense forces are modernizing their
equipment to be at par with the capabilities of the global forces. In
line with the modernization programs, the Israeli Navy Hydrographic
Branch (INHB) is shifting towards the adoption of Geographic Information
System (GIS) technology. This forms a part of completely advanced Marine
Spatial Data Infrastructure (MSDI) in the country. Some of the prominent
players that offer geospatial technologies for defense and security
applications are ESRI, Trimble Inc., Maxar Technologies, and Harris
Geospatial Solutions, Inc., among others. The companies have been
investing in R&D and technological advancements to offer more efficient
geospatial technologies for defense and security purposes. For instance,
in January 2020 Maxar Technologies signed a long-term subscription deal
for SecureWatch (cloud-based earth intelligence platform) with the
Defence Geographic Agency (DGeo) of The Netherlands Ministry of Defence.
Maxar Technologies also renewed international defense and intelligence
contracts for customers in the Middle East and Asia region worth more
than \$120 million in July 2020. Besides this, in 2017 DigitalGlobe,
Esri, and Harris Corporation partnered to provide the expertise of
Geospatial Deep Learning and Big Data analytics technologies to Esri's
ArcGIS (Geographic Information System) users. The challenges associated
with geospatial data are regarding its processing and analysis. These
issues can be easily rectified and the valuable geospatial data can be
effectively used by the application of technologies such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). A good understanding of
geospatial intelligence is crucial for battlespace situational awareness
for the defense forces. With the growing digitization of intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and sensors, there is
an increased demand for Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Machine
Learning tools to collect, store, and analyze an ever-increasing size of
satellite images and intelligence data. AI and ML processes can evaluate
images and videos and identify threats more rapidly and more effectively
than human operators can. Project Maven- a United States Department of
Defense program to create an AI-powered investigation system for
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is based on the AI and ML algorithms
which is presently using a TensorFlow-based platform to prepare
predictive analytics of drone footage. [Geospatial technologies hold
great prospects in strengthening the defense and security forces by
offering real-time images and insights of the affected areas that help
in strategizing the military operations.]{.underline} The incorporation
of Big Data and AI with geospatial technologies further enhances the
usability of the geospatial data. [Geospatial data plays an important
role in detecting the developments and movements of the armies. It helps
in preparing the strategies to counter the attacks and minimize the
losses to weaponry and save the lives of soldiers in a battleground.

havoc across the world and severely impacted the cash flow into the
defense sector as more and more budget had to be allocated for
supporting the healthcare systems. The small and medium-sized players
are severely impacted by the economic crisis and are struggling to
continue their operations. With the start of COVID-19 vaccination
programs across the world, the threats regarding the infection are
diminishing and the normalcy in businesses across the world is
anticipated to resume soon. This is expected to give a boost to
government investment in the defense and security sector, which will
benefit the geospatial technology market in the future. The

[NATO neither has its own Space assets nor operates any]{.underline}. It
relies on Space capabilities that Alliance nations provide on a
voluntary basis. [NATO operations strongly depend on Space
services]{.underline}, [so SDA also becomes a key resource for NATO and
it needs more than just a 'donation' from Member States]{.underline}.
First of all, [[NATO could]{.mark} be the [leading entity to]{.mark}
[promote]{.mark} the [**importance** of **SDA**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[encouraging]{.mark} the **[development]{.mark}** [and
**improvement**]{.mark} of the current architectures [and]{.mark}
[advocating]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [ideas]{.mark} ranging from the SSA

**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efence [[and]{.mark} [Command]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [Control]{.mark} [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, without jeopardizing the independence of a single nation to
use its assets as it prefers, [[NATO]{.mark} could [play]{.mark} the
[role of coordinator]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [various national
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [integrating them [to]{.mark}
[have]{.mark} a **[clearer picture of Space]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} to
[be able to detect]{.mark} any [change]{.mark} [or]{.mark} **potential
[threat]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the [Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline},
similarly to what happens in civil contexts (e.g., EUSST). [[Our]{.mark}
[nations']{.mark} use of and [dependence on Space requires]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [policies]{.mark} and doctrine, tools
[and resources]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark} the **[Alliance's
superiority]{.mark}** [in Space]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned
before, [no country can face this situation alone]{.underline}. The
birth of the new NATO Space Centre at Allied Air Command in Ramstein,
Germany,8 could represent the first NATO step in that direction.

#### deterrence

[Alliances]{.underline}, [international cooperation]{.underline}, [and
the global prolif]{.underline}eration [of space power]{.underline} also
[play a **significant role** in deterrence by denial]{.underline}. This
[international dimension influences deterrence in several
ways]{.underline}. First, the [prolif]{.underline}eration [of states
operating]{.underline} or deriving benefits from [satellites creates
stakeholders who would]{.underline} likely [prefer that their satellites
were not put in **jeopardy**]{.underline}. States outside of the
deterrence relationship may have their satellites affected negatively if
deterrence fails and conflict ensues, such as by orbital debris from
kinetic attacks or the indiscriminate effects of broad radio-frequency
jamming. Second, the deterring state may provide a global or
multinational space-derived service, such as the US Global Positioning
System satellites, which if attacked could potentially draw countries
reliant on this service into the conflict on the side of the
non-aggressor (Harrison et al. 2009). In these situations, an aggressor
may be hesitant to attack space systems if it will have to potentially
contend with an international response (Sheldon 2008). Third, allied or
partner states may assist the deterring state when a conflict breaks
out. The [space systems of friendly countries can complement and
supplement the deterrer's own capabilities]{.underline}, such as
[through data sharing **agreements**]{.underline},
**[interoperability]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} even [by assisting
in the **reconstitution** of lost space capabilities]{.underline}.
[Adversary leadership may be **deterred** from **targeting US
satellites** if they perceive that the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could leverage the capabilities of its allies to
**nullify** any anticipated benefit]{.underline} (Sheldon 2008).

Some security experts consider the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline}) as being [**uniquely positioned** to bolster
deterrence in space through its **cooperative alliance**]{.underline}.
The [alliance is increasingly reliant on space for its collective
defense]{.underline} and economic prosperity, [and an attack on the
space assets of any one ally impacts the security of all
allies]{.underline} (Schulte 2012). Security experts assert that [while
NATO is dependent on space-enabled capabilities]{.underline}, its [space
doctrine and planning have **not kept up**]{.underline}. Presently, NATO
officials are considering how the alliance should address the growing
military capabilities of Russia and China, to include issuing NATO's
first strategy for space. The strategy is expected to make space an
official domain of operation, giving structure to discourse on military
developments in space and NATO's response. The alliance may also decide
that attacks in space would trigger the organization's Article 5
provisions on collective defense, although internal differences on the
subject remain. [Analysts have long held that NATO should continue to
build the expertise and capacity to conduct operations enabled by
space]{.underline}; [ensure that **doctrine**]{.underline},
**[requirements]{.underline}**, [and **planning account** for the
operational advantages provided by space]{.underline}; [and adapt
**exercises** and **training** to ensure forces can **effectively
exploit** space-based capabilities]{.underline} (Schulte 2012). It is
still uncertain whether NATO's space strategy will implement these
recommendations.

"At the 2021 Brussels Summit, [Allies **agreed** that attacks
to]{.underline}, [from]{.underline}, [or within **space** present a
**clear challenge** to the **security of the Alliance**]{.underline},
[the impact of which could **threaten national** and Euro-Atlantic
**prosperity**]{.underline}, [security]{.underline}, [and
**stability**]{.underline}, and could be as harmful to modern societies
as a conventional attack. Such attacks could lead to the invocation of
Article 5. A decision as to when such attacks would lead to the
invocation of Article 5 would be taken by the North Atlantic Council on
a case-by-case basis," [the document
states](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_190862.htm).

Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty states that an attack on any one of
the 30 allies will be considered an attack on them all. Until now, it
has only applied to more traditional military attacks on land, sea, or
in the air, and more recently in cyberspace.

Considering that [members have recognized that **space is essential** to
NATO's **deterrence** and **defense**]{.underline}, NATO will consider a
range of potential options, for council approval, across the conflict
spectrum to deter and defend against threats to or attacks on allies'
space systems, it said.

Around 2,000 satellites orbit the earth, over half operated by NATO
countries, ensuring everything from cellphone and banking services to
weather forecasts. Military commanders rely on some of them to navigate,
communicate, share intelligence, and detect missile launches.

[In]{.underline} December [2019]{.underline}, [**NATO leaders** declared
space to be the alliance's]{.underline} "**[fifth domain]{.underline}**"
[of operations]{.underline}. Many [member countries]{.underline} are
[**concerned** about]{.underline} what they say is [**increasingly
aggressive** behavior in space by China and Russia]{.underline}.

[Space has become]{.underline} "**[increasingly
important]{.underline}**" [for the security and prosperity of NATO
members]{.underline}, the alliance added.

"[Space is an inherently **global environment**]{.underline} and [any
conflict that extends into space has the potential to affect **all
users** of space]{.underline}. [Even in cases where NATO is **not
involved** in conflict]{.underline}, [**Allies' space systems** could be
affected]{.underline}," the document reads.

NATO noted that a number of nations are developing counter-space and
anti-satellite systems.

"Potential adversaries" in particular are pursuing the development of a
wide range of capabilities from non-kinetic (such as dazzling, blinding,
and jamming of space assets) to kinetic destructive systems (such as
direct-ascent anti-satellite missiles, on orbit anti-satellite systems,
and laser and electromagnetic capabilities), it said.

"Such space destruction, disruption, degradation, and denial
capabilities are further exacerbated by the susceptibility of space to
hybrid approaches and the associated difficulty of attributing harmful
effects to space systems. Some threats, such as signal jamming and cyber
attacks, can potentially be caused also by non-state actors, including
terrorist organizations."

The document says, "[Many **threats** to **Allies' space systems**
originate in the **cyber domain** and are **likely to
increase**]{.underline}."

HBisevac)

[NATO]{.underline} will [consider an attack against a member country\'s
**assets** in **space** as an assault on the **alliance**]{.underline},
and such actions could lead to a coordinated armed response from all
members if necessary, according to NATO\'s first formal, public space
policy released Monday. Why it matters: The [policy reflects the
**increasing importance** of space to more countries]{.underline}. It
also [normalizes NATO\'s intentions in space as]{.underline} China,
Russia, India and [other countries **push forward** on
their]{.underline} science and military [ambitions in **orbit and
beyond**]{.underline}. It is being [published]{.underline} roughly two
months [after Russia endangered the **I**]{.underline}nternational
**[S]{.underline}**pace **[S]{.underline}**tation [and its crew by
testing an **anti-satellite** **weapon** against one of its]{.underline}
defunct [satellites and amid **heightened tensions** between Moscow and
NATO]{.underline} from the crisis over Ukraine. Details: The [policy
**expands** on NATO\'s]{.underline} 2019 classified [**space policy**
and a communique]{.underline} released by the heads of member states
last year, which said an attack against one member in space will be
considered an attack against all. The [new policy from NATO goes
**further** and **defines** its key roles in space]{.underline},
[including coordinating allies\' space capabilities to help NATO\'s
deterrence and defense efforts in other operational
domains]{.underline}: land, maritime, air and cyberspace. It [includes a
list of principles and tenets the alliance seeks to uphold in accordance
with]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline},
including that the use of outer space for peaceful purposes is in the
common interest of all nations and that no country can claim space as
its own. Of note: NATO said it is not aiming to become \"an autonomous
space actor\" with its own capabilities but will rather rely on member
countries that voluntarily provide \"space data, products, services or
effects that could be required for the Alliance's operations, missions,
and other activities.\" What they\'re saying: NATO has yet to define
what constitutes an attack, says Kaitlyn Johnson, a space policy expert
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It\'s unclear how
it would respond to forms of satellite warfare that temporarily disable
or blind targets without permanently damaging them. \"They\'re restating
that there\'s a connection to Article 5 and Article 6, but reading that
and interpreting it, we as the public don\'t know how serious this is,
or where are these redlines,\" she said. \"I think the alliance is
intentionally being vague about this to leave its options open.\"
Johnson added that NATO\'s commitment to rely on allies\' space
capabilities is notable, considering it was one of the first entities to
deploy strategic satellites starting in the 1970s. The big picture:
[Militaries **around the world** have already become **reliant** on
space-based tech]{.underline}nologies, and [**increased competition** in
space]{.underline} may [pressure more countries to pursue]{.underline}
or improve their [anti-satellite weapons in order to **dominate** their
enemies or deter attacks]{.underline} on their satellites or private
industries.

instituting a new NATO COE -- and executing multi-national space
operations in general -- [is **security classification**]{.underline}
[and **data sharing**]{.underline}. [The **release** of
classified]{.underline} [information]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
multi-national [partners is **governed** by]{.underline} the national
**[disclosure policies]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [each NATO
member]{.underline}. [In order to **effectively execute**]{.underline}
Allied [space operations, the Alliance would need to
**share**]{.underline} missile [warning]{.underline},
**[s]{.underline}**pace **[s]{.underline}**ituational
**[a]{.underline}**wareness, and other space related data. [This is
**already being done**]{.underline} [to some level with]{.underline}
[**b**allistic **m**issile **warning** data via the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**hared **[E]{.underline}**arly
**[W]{.underline}**arning System (SEWS) [program through which
the]{.underline} [U.S. **Air Force** "provides NATO]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} a [**continuous** enhanced]{.underline} [Space-based
early warning]{.underline} [data feed]{.underline}...[in support of
the]{.underline} \[**[b]{.underline}**allistic **[m]{.underline}**issile
**[d]{.underline}**efense\] mission. \[[Through SEWS]{.underline},\]
[NATO]{.underline} [receives data]{.underline} from space- based sensors
[with the same]{.underline} **[accuracy]{.underline}** [and
**timeliness** as US forces]{.underline}."98

Moreover, NATO is working on a Coalition Shared Data (CSD) server
project that will "allow commanders to instantly tap into real-time data
from a number of NATO and national systems...regardless of where those
products are stored."99 The concept was successfully tested during
NATO's BOLD AVENGER/TRIAL QUEST 2007 as well as German Bundeswehr
experiment Common Shield 2008 and could be extrapolated for use in a
broader NATO space data sharing enterprise.

[A **second challenge** is **ensuring**]{.underline} member [nation
systems]{.underline} [have]{.underline} some minimum level of
**[interoperability]{.underline}**. [NATO does already]{.underline}
[have a **multitude** of]{.underline} Standardization Agreements
([STANAGs]{.underline}), [some of which]{.underline} [address **space
related systems**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[components]{.underline}** such as STANAG 4636: [Space]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [Nuclear **Hardening**]{.underline} Guidelines [for
**Military Satellites**]{.underline}, STANAG 4633: NATO Common ELINT
Reporting Format, and STANAG 7023: NATO Primary Image Format. However,
in light of the Smart Defence initiative which "encourages nations to
get the most capability from their defense spending by focusing on
greater prioritization, specialization and multinational cooperation in
equipment acquisition,"100 NATO should take a fresh look at the spectrum
of space systems and determine if new STANAGs should be developed.

[**Digging deeper** into [NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} [approaches to
**space**]{.underline}, the authors distinguish four key
responsibilities that the Alliance associates itself with. They [include
**integrating**]{.underline} the [space factor into]{.underline} the
[delivery of **collective defence**]{.underline} [and crisis
**management**]{.underline} tasks; [conducing]{.underline}
[political-military **consultations**]{.underline} on space-related
matters; [providing **space support**]{.underline} to the members'
missions; [ensuring **interoperability**]{.underline} [between allies'
space]{.underline} [products]{.underline}. To implement these roles, it
is required to activate efforts in---at least---nine directions,
embracing both technological advancements and measures to ensure
political and military cohesion.

[Generally speaking]{.underline}, [the [Space
Policy]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[is not at all]{.underline}** [about
**devising**]{.underline}]{.mark} brand-new [**[cooperation]{.mark}**
mechanisms, [to which we can]{.mark} assign]{.underline}
[**[increas]{.mark}ing** [joint]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**pace **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**omain
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**wareness, [[ensuring
**interoperability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of space
capabilities]{.underline} [[and **converging**]{.mark} **approaches** to
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[defense and resilience]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} [space]{.underline}. Some of the proposed actions have
already been in place---take the envisaged mutual trainings and
exercises. For some 25 years, the U.S. has been initiating multiple
wargames, the most well-known of which are Schriever games\[1\]. [The
latter are **popular** for three key reasons]{.underline}:
[wide]{.underline} geographic [**scope** of participants]{.underline}
including those from NATO, [contribution to the **analysis** of **key
patterns**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} future [conflicts]{.underline}
in space, [**attraction** of both allied]{.underline}
**[military]{.underline}** and commercial [partners]{.underline}---all
of those are reflected in the current Space Policy. Another example of
NATO formalizing its previous experiences is the provision regarding
application of space assets for solving other domain tasks. Actually,
these were operations that NATO members conducted in the late 1990s till
the early 2000s, and they have made the global community think of space
as an integral component of military planning. Therefore, it may be
assumed that the objective of the document was not only to explore new
tracks of cooperation but also to officially accumulate the previous
ones under the NATO umbrella, thus adding authority points to the
organization.

All in all, [with the [Space Policy]{.mark} **endorsed**]{.underline},
[NATO gained a **feasible plan**]{.underline} [of how to
**[transform]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[space]{.underline}
[into]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[fifth]{.mark} operational
[domain]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This domain may be "activated", on the
one hand, if there are attacks to, from, or within space, and on the
other hand, if there is a need to increase the effectiveness of
operations in other domains. Thus, there are almost no visible
constraints for benefitting from space as the high ground.

//EM

STUTTGART, Germany -- Amid the global race toward a militarized space
domain, NATO sees its role firmly planted as a coordinator and
interlocutor amidst its member states, but demurs from becoming a
space-based actor itself, a recently released document shows.

For the past several years, leaders from the alliance and its 30 member
states have declared space an operational domain, trumpeting the need
for more holistic and coordinated technology investments. NATO's
"overarching space policy" -- which was established in 2019 but made
publicly available for the first time on Monday -- represents a big step
for the alliance to finally codify the importance of the space domain
for its wider interests and activities. But certain vague language also
makes clear that the partners still diverge in how NATO can concretely
involve itself in space, observers said.

The document tries to strike "a balanced tone," acknowledging the need
for NATO to be an active player in the space domain, while shying away
from the notion that the alliance is militarizing space, "given
sensitivities among allies on this concept," said Lauren Speranza,
director of the Transatlantic Defense and Security program at the Center
for European Policy Analysis (CEPA).

Over six pages, NATO describes itself as a point of contact for its
members' ambitions in the space domain, focusing on several "key roles"
where it can serve a coordinating function and as a forum for
discussion. The document says the alliance "requires" space systems in
specific capability areas, but won't become an "autonomous space actor,"
or develop its own platforms for use in the domain.

Where's the investment?

The capability areas include: space situational awareness; intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); space-based monitoring of
Earth-based domains; satellite communications; position, navigation, and
timing; and shared early-warning assets.

A NATO official confirmed to Defense News on Wednesday that the alliance
has no intent to collectively develop space-related capabilities for the
foreseeable future, noting that it's more affordable to pay for relevant
services when needed.

That's a missed opportunity, said Nicholas Nelson, a senior fellow with
CEPA's Transatlantic Defense and Security program. NATO has developed
its own sovereign capabilities before -- most notably its fleet of
Boeing E-3A Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft.

The "vast majority" of NATO members don't have access to sophisticated
space equipment, and having access to a joint asset, such as a common
satellite bus, would be "value-accretive, both for the cohesion of the
alliance, as well as the capabilities," he noted.

The document overall provides key insight into NATO's collective
thinking of the space domain, said Simona Soare, a research fellow for
defense and military analysis at the International Institute for
Strategic Studies.

"The focus on interoperability and sharing best practices is welcomed as
key to the allies' and the alliance's ability to ensure its core tasks,
most important of which remains collective defense, in a context in
which an increasing number of allies and partners are considering
developing their own space capabilities and assets," she said.

The policy release follows the alliance's concerted focus in recent
years on seven so-called "emerging and disruptive technologies," or
EDTs. NATO has advocated for its 30-strong members to invest more
holistically and strategically in these EDTs, and this year, the
alliance released -- or made public -- three related policies, on
artificial intelligence, on cyber, and now on space.

Where's the red line?

The space policy is essentially the same document that the alliance
agreed upon in 2019, the NATO official told Defense News. The main
update comes toward the end of the document, in a section that describes
how members agreed that attacks to, from, or within space on an ally
could trigger an Article 5 decision on a "case-by-case basis."

But the publicly released document still provides scant details about
how NATO allies actually plan to respond to hybrid threats in and from
space, likely because member-nations don't completely agree on where the
red lines should be, analysts noted.

"I think the possible response options are less fleshed out in space,
and allies will be less comfortable reaching consensus and taking
action," Speranza said.

NATO has purposefully maintained ambiguity about its red lines in other
operational domains. The alliance's new cyber policy, released in June,
revealed the decision to consider that certain "lower-level" malicious
cyber attacks by the same threat actor can be as destructive as a
single, large-scale cyber attack, and could, at least in theory, trigger
the treaty's Article 5 collective defense mechanism.

The document also avoids naming any specific state or non-state actors
as threats in the space domain, and focuses instead on the types of
capabilities and effects that could threaten allies in space. This could
be related to differences of perspective among the allies when it comes
to responding to these actors with either dialogue, or deterrence, Soare
said.

More to come?

Parts of the new space policy make clear that NATO's role in the domain
is still a work in progress. A section involving "deterrence, defense,
and resilience" states that the alliance "will consider" a range of
"potential" options to counter threats against a member state in space,
and that NATO "should develop" a common understanding of concepts "such
as the role of space in crisis or conflict." Certain guidelines "will
need to be developed" on the way to secure NATO's access to space data,
products and capabilities, it adds.

It's critical that NATO eventually establishes common terminology for
its EDTs, but finding agreement there may be one of the biggest
obstacles for the alliance to really define its collective space
strategy, Nelson said. "The nomenclature they use for space -- as well
as cyber -- still differs when you're talking to different
stakeholders."

While individual member nations like the United States, France, and the
United Kingdom have already developed their own defense-related space
doctrines, a collective NATO strategy is still in progress, the alliance
official explained. But this space policy is meant as a lasting policy,
and the goal is to now implement that policy through concrete actions,
like completing the nascent NATO Space Center at Ramstein Air Base in
Germany and launching the future NATO space center of excellence in
Toulouse, France, according to the official.

Analysts expect NATO to more concretely define its stance on space in
future documents, and certainly in the lead-up to the 2022 summit, to be
held in June in Madrid. There, leaders plan to unveil the alliance's new
"Strategic Concept" white paper, the first update since 2010.

"I am optimistic about the direction NATO is going," Nelson said. "I
would like them to move faster, ... but with that said, this is a good
first step."

capability on 1 January 2020.

At the ceremony, the Assistant Secretary General for Defence Investment
Camille Grand said:

\"NATO depends on space for a wide range of activities, from
intelligence gathering and navigation, to tracking forces around the
globe and detecting missile launches\". Adding that space is essential
for the Alliance\'s deterrence and defence, he said that \"NATO also
aims to serve as a forum for political-military consultations and
information sharing on relevant deterrence and defence related space
developments\".

Last year, NATO authorized 1 billion EUR for satellite communications
(SATCOM) services for the next 15 years. [The]{.underline} NATO
Communications and Information (**[NCI]{.underline}**) Agency [is
**responsible**]{.underline} [for **operating**]{.underline} [the

agreement with the service-providing Nations. This landmark agreement
will provide a greater, more resilient and more flexible space
capability for NATO to conduct its operations and exercises. National
experts will be embedded with the NCI Agency to deliver this critical
capability.

## Cybersecurity

**[If You Can't Properly Define]{.underline} Cybersecurity[, How Can You
Know What It Is?]{.underline}**

[It's clear that the cybersecurity industry hasn't been able to agree
upon what cybersecurity is and isn't. Even NIST]{.underline}, who is
responsible for the definition of technical terms used by the U.S.
Federal Government, [has four different definitions of cybersecurity! At
a minimum, there are dozens of different definitions of]{.underline}
[cybersecurity currently in use. Nearly all are **incomplete in scope**,
some are **horridly wrong,** and nearly all fail to differentiate
between cybersecurity and its **information security
cousin**.]{.underline}

Background

If you look up the definition of "cybersecurity," most of the answers
you get are laughable. Most appear to be written by some "expert" with
no actual concept of what cybersecurity is. [Nearly all of those
definitions sound as though they were written by an academic
pontificating what he thinks cybersecurity theoretically should
be]{.underline}, without himself ever having done any actual hands-on
cybersecurity engineering.

Until July 2019, the sole "official" definition of cybersecurity (as
defined by NIST) was: "The ability to protect or defend the use of
cyberspace from cyber attacks." Hyper-informative, wasn't it? It's about
like telling a man who's never seen a donut that, "A donut is a pastry
shaped like a donut torus." \[See note 1.\]

Then, just when you think it can't get worse, it does. Now NIST can't
even agree within itself what cybersecurity is! It now four different
definitions of cybersecurity! None of them tell you anything
particularly useful about cybersecurity. Those definitions of
cybersecurity are: \[2\]

Prevention of damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers,
electronic communications systems, electronic communications services,
wire communication, and electronic communication, including information
contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity,
authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

The ability to protect or defend the use of cyberspace from cyber
attacks.

The process of protecting information by preventing, detecting, and
responding to attacks.

The prevention of damage to, unauthorized use of, exploitation of, and
--- if needed --- the restoration of electronic information and
communications systems, and the information they contain, in order to
strengthen the confidentiality, integrity and availability of these
systems.

If you search online for a definition of cybersecurity, most definitions
are just as bad --- if not worse --- than the definitions NIST provides.
Here are some examples:

Measures taken to protect a computer or computer system (as on the
Internet) against unauthorized access or attack. \[3\]

The art of protecting networks, devices, and data from unauthorized
access or criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of information. \[4\]

May also be referred to as information technology security. \[5\]

The preventative techniques used to protect the integrity of networks,
programs and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. \[6\]

The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital
attacks. \[7\]

The protection of information assets by addressing threats to
information processed, stored, and transported by internetworked
information systems. \[14\]

Notice [the pattern? The definitions all talk about defending
**computers**, **networks**, and **data**]{.underline}. [That isn't what
cybersecurity is. That's what **information security** is! Plus, the
scope is strictly digital in many cases]{.underline}. Clearly, [whoever
wrote those definitions have no experience with **industrial controls
security**, where **even analogue devices can be at risk of
attack**]{.underline}. \[8\]

We have two problems here. First, we have failed to define what
cybersecurity adequately or accurately is. Worse, [we are trying to
somehow shoehorn cybersecurity into being either the same as information
security]{.underline} or some subset of information security. It isn't,
and I'll go into detail why in a minute.

So, if we can't even agree upon what cybersecurity is, how can we
possibly expect to create reasonably secure systems and products that
depend upon an in-depth understanding of cybersecurity?

Clearly, we can't.

And, the problem is compounded by the mindset that the same tools and
techniques used for information security are applicable to
cybersecurity. Yes, most information security tools and techniques can
be applied to cybersecurity, but cybersecurity requires tools and
techniques which go far beyond those of information security.

[How can we expect to secure our systems when we are using the wrong
tools]{.underline}? Or, at best, an incomplete set of tools?

Again, clearly, we can't.

In my professional opinion, the root of the problem we're facing is that
too many "cybersecurity experts" began their careers as "information
security experts" and never have had actual hands-on cybersecurity
experience beyond applying partial aspects of cybersecurity to
information systems. Thus, we are left with information-centric
definitions of cybersecurity, where the "experts" have tried to mold
cybersecurity into the shape of information security.

Well, it's time to break that mold!

Let's get started with a few definitions.

Definitions

First, [let's define security:]{.underline}

[Security is the protection of assets from threats.]{.underline}

That's fairly clear, but let's dissect it to ensure the subtleties are
covered:

Assets are anything tangible or intangible that has value. In the
context of security, usage of the word ["asset" usually refers to a
"protected asset."]{.underline}

[Protected Assets are any asset protected by a security
service]{.underline}. Examples of protected assets could include: data
or information (electronic or physical), network and computing
infrastructure, software, products and associated intellectual property,
people (employees, customers, vendors), real estate and personal
property, and utilities and other critical infrastructure. That is,
anything of value is a potential protected asset.

Security Services are any threat reduction capability provided by
security. There are five generally recognized security services:
Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, and
Access-Control. (See the blog post, What Are The Fundamental Services
Provided By Security? Hint: CIA Is Not The Answer for additional
details.)

[Threats are anything with the potential to cause harm]{.underline}. For
example, the potential for an attack to occur. Threats can be either
[intentional]{.underline} (e.g., [sabotage]{.underline}) or
[accidental]{.underline} (e.g., [aircraft]{.underline} bird strike), and
they can be both [man-made events]{.underline} (e.g., [human
errors]{.underline}, cyber attacks, power failures, and network outages)
[or natural events]{.underline} (e.g., fires, floods, earthquakes,
hurricanes, and tornados). Also, see security threats, below.

Attacks are any action taken against an asset with the intention of
causing harm.

[Security Threats are anything that may cause harm to a protected
asset]{.underline} and/or associated entities. For example, whereas a
security threat that discloses personally identifiable information would
most likely inflict minimal harm to the asset that held the disclosed
information, the disclosure itself could do considerable harm to both
the organization's brand and to the individuals whose information was
disclosed. There are seven generally recognized categories of security
threats: Denial of Access, Forgery, Spoofing, Repudiation, Unauthorized
Access, Unauthorized Disclosure, and Unauthorized Modification (see blog
post referenced in Security Services for more details.).

Entities, in the context of security, are anything that attempts to use
a protected asset. An entity can be a person, software, robot, or
anything else that attempts to use a protected asset.

Okay, I lied: That definition has a lot of subtly buried within it.
Hopefully, now the definition of security has a deeper meaning for you.

So, that's the definition of the mission of security across all of the
organization's security domains. In most organizations, [there should be
three top-level security domains]{.underline}:

**[Corporate Security]{.underline}**

**[Information Security]{.underline}**

**[Cyber Security]{.underline}**

Now, let's define each of those security domains.

Corporate Security

[Corporate Security is those aspects of an organization's security not
directly related to technology]{.underline}.

That is, in general, [corporate security is those aspects of security
that pre-date technology or technological security solutions, or are
unrelated to technology]{.underline}. Falling under the corporate
security domain would be aspects of security related to employee
services, safety, environmental services, or facilities; or which are
intellectual property, legal, or regulatory in nature. (This is not an
all-inclusive list.)

In other words, much of what you would think of as an organization's
security before the advent of digital technologies falls into the
corporate security domain.

Today, corporate security often makes extensive use of technology. But,
corporate security's technology is often not under the auspices of
information security or cybersecurity. Without close collaboration
between security groups, serious gaps in security defenses will occur.

Worse, [there often isn't a corporate security group in the
organization]{.underline}. Instead, you often find aspects of corporate
security disbursed between multiple (and, often non-communicating)
groups, such as human resources, facilities, safety, plant protection,
legal, risk management, and environmental.

I plan to discuss corporate security in more detail in an upcoming blog
post, Corporate Security: The Forgotten Security Domain.

Information Security

[Information Security is the protection of information in any form and
at all times]{.underline}.

That's pretty much the classic paragraph-long definition of information
security, summarized into one sentence.

Now, let's dissect it to get a deeper understanding of what that means.

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Protection is the rendering safe from harm. Protection is passive
security. That is, security that does not offer a response to an attack.
It is equivalent to putting a lock on a door to secure your house.

In any form means it includes both physical (e.g., printed documents)
and electronic (e.g., files and databases) information.

At all times means the information must be protected, whether it is at
rest (i.e., in storage), in use, or in motion (e.g., electronic
information sent over a network, or a printed document transported by a
courier).

Thus, we define information security as the protection of information.
Note that we didn't place any constraints upon the scope of protection.
That is, if we have to protect computers and networks to protect
information, then that would be within the scope of information
security. But, keep in mind that the objective is the protection of
information. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Cyber Security

We've already shown that there isn't a commonly agreed-to definition for
cybersecurity. Now, [I'm going to propose a definition for cybersecurity
which covers all aspects of cybersecurity]{.underline} --- something
which is lacking from other definitions --- [while providing a clear
distinction from information security.]{.underline} \[10\]

[Cybersecurity is the **protection** and defense of **both analogue and
digital electronic devices**]{.underline}, **[their communications
channels]{.underline}**, and [their **processing-and-control logic and
algorithms**]{.underline}.

Now, let's dissect that definition to get a deeper understanding of what
it means and its ramifications.

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Protection is the rendering safe from harm. Protection is passive
security. That is, security that does not offer a response to an attack.
It is equivalent to putting a lock on a door to secure your house.

Defense is an action taken to resist an attack. Defense is active
security. This means that you have dynamic security with ever-changing
defenses --- which can include offensive actions to stop an attack. It
is the equivalent of confronting an intruder in your house with a loaded
weapon.

Digital Devices are any electronic device that uses discrete data and
processes for all its operations. This clearly includes computers, cell
phones and tablets, routers, switches, WiFi access points, and
firewalls, but it also includes all other digitally networked devices,
such as all IoT devices, VoIP telephones, digital security cameras,
smart badge readers, etc.

Analogue Devices are any electronic device that uses continuous data and
processes for all its operations. This would include landline
telephones, fax machines, most nuclear reactor control systems, older
radar systems, older industrial controls, some satellite and other space
systems controls, and literally thousands of other devices. In
industrial controls situations, analogue devices often serve as failsafe
backups to digital controls.

Communications Channels are the means by which a device is connected to
other devices. For analogue device communications, this could be a
simple wire or wire-pair, coax cable, analogue radio, or similar
technologies. For digital device communications, it would include any
type of wired or wireless network. For digital to analogue device
communications, it could include any of the previously mentioned means
of analogue device communications used to communicate to an analogue
interface in the digital device.

Processing Logic and Algorithms are the means by which a device
accomplishes its designated purpose. For analogue devices, this is all
done in hardware. For digital devices, this includes both hardware and
software (microcode, firmware, operating systems, applications, etc.).

Control Logic and Algorithms are the means by which a device regulates
its processing. For analogue devices, this is all done in hardware. For
digital devices, this includes both hardware and software (microcode,
firmware, operating systems, applications, etc.).

Now, let's put the phrases together and detail the bigger picture.

[Is the protection and defense is cybersecurity's first significant
difference from information security. Cybersecurity not only offers
protection like information security, but it also offers defense. In
other words, cybersecurity can take the offensive actions necessary to
defend systems]{.underline}.

Of both analogue and digital electronic devices is the next significant
difference from information security, as information security's tools
seldom address analogue devices. It is also different in that
information security offers protection of non-electronic information
(e.g., printed), whereas cybersecurity only deals with electronic
devices and their data. \[11\]

This definition means that protection and defense are also offered to
the electronic devices (components) combined to construct a more complex
electronic device. For example, protection and defense would be offered
to CPUs, GPU, FPGAs, ASICs, NICs, DACs, memory, controllers, and all the
other various analogue and digital components that comprise a modern
end-purpose electronic device, such as a smartphone or a computer. In
other words, cybersecurity protects and defends any security-sensitive
electronic device, be it analogue or digital, and be it an end-purpose
device or a component of such a device.

Their communications channels is again a difference between
cybersecurity and information security. Cybersecurity provides both
protection and defense of the electronic communications channels
themselves, both analogue and digital. Whereas, information security
only provides for the protection of the information conveyed over those
communications channels.

Additionally, [information security also provides for the protection of
information communicated by non-electronic means]{.underline} (e.g.,
printed documents), **[which is outside the scope of
cybersecurity]{.underline}**.

And their processing-and-control logic and algorithms is the final
difference between cybersecurity and information security. Cybersecurity
offers protections to both hardware and software, and can take actions
to defend both from attack. By contrast, **[information security only
provides passive protection to information.]{.underline}**

So, that is the definition of cybersecurity and an explanation of its
scope.

To recap, cybersecurity provides security for all electronic technology,
except for the information processed by such technology (information is
protected by information security).

Or, another way to view the difference between information security and
cybersecurity is that information security secures the information
itself, and cybersecurity secures everything that creates, uses,
processes, stores, or communicates that information.

Where Information Security Fails Us

In my blog introduction, I state that "trying to treat cybersecurity
problems as though they are information security problems" is one of the
fundamental mistakes we are making in security today. The lack of an
understanding of the differences between information security and
cybersecurity is the root cause of this problem.

As we have seen in the preceding definitions, [information security is
"data-centric," and cybersecurity is "device-centric.]{.underline}"
Trying to apply information security principals to "device security"
creates two problems: First, you can't adequately secure "hardware"
using the same controls used to secure data; And second, there is
nothing in information security that provides for an active defense.

Let's look at some of the issues that the premises supporting
information security fail to address. To do this, we'll examine an
example from product security.

[The overwhelming **insecurity**]{.underline} [of **IoT** products has
filled the news recently]{.underline}. Why? Many would say that it's a
simple matter of companies trying to produce products on the cheap.
However, I would argue that [the]{.underline} [issue is more likely the
product's designers' failure to recognize the potential for security
problems in their products.]{.underline}

I believe that fundamentally, such product failures are compounded by an
incomplete view of security: a view driven by an information security
focus. A focus that, for embedded systems products (such as IoT
devices), is incomplete, at best. Why incomplete? Because [most security
issues with IoT devices are not information related. Rather the problems
are with the devices themselves.]{.underline}

Let's begin by listing some of the security questions that product
designers should be asking, but are obviously not asking. And, with most
product security practitioners coming from an information security
background, those product security architects probably do not even know
they should be asking these questions.

After all, why should they know better? Nothing they had learned in the
scope of information security would indicate that these are issues with
which to be concerned. The types of product security questions (that is,
cybersecurity questions) which all product security architects should be
asking include:

How do you prevent reverse engineering of the product?

How do you prevent tampering with the product?

How do you prevent the production of unlicensed clones of the product?

How do you prevent access to the hardware interfaces used for
development debugging of the product?

How do you prevent access to the hardware interfaces used for
manufacturing testing of the product?

How do you perform failsafe firmware updates of the product (such that a
failed update does not brick the product)?

How do you prevent unauthorized modification of the product's firmware?

How do you prevent your firmware from running on third-party devices?

How do you ensure the integrity of your supply chain?

How do you prevent unauthorized modification of the device itself?

How do you prevent misuse of the device from damaging the device itself
(e.g., using a USB port on a device for other than its intended purpose,
and drawing too much power)?

How do you prevent misuse of the device from creating a safety incident
(e.g., using an aerosol can to create a vapor fog to trigger a motion
detector to unlock a door)?

How can this device be abused by an attacker to cause harm?

How can we verify that our UI is always unambiguous to its intended
audience?

How can we verify that our UX is always intuitive to its intended
audience?

How can we verify that our UI creates neither security or safety issues?

How can we verify that our ID creates neither security or safety issues?

And this is just a very small sample of the questions that every product
development organization should be asking, but which is clearly failing
to occur.

Now, I can already hear the objections: "These are hardware engineering
issues, not information security issues, and that's why they're not
covered by information security." Well, that's half wrong and half
right. Wrong, in that they are not hardware engineering issues; rather,
they are hardware security issues. Right, in that they are not
information security issues; rather, they are cybersecurity issues.
\[12\]

These, and tens of thousands of other similar issues, are being left
unaddressed during product development because information security
doesn't address these types of issues. Nor should it, as those issues
are cybersecurity issues and not information security issues.

Nothing in an information security professional's background or training
would prepare them to even know that they should be asking the types of
questions I posited. And, that's what should be expected, because these
are not information security issues and I would not expect an
information security professional even to have half-a-clue that such
problems exist. It's for precisely this reason that cybersecurity exists
and is different from information security.

The problem is really simple: **[Information security exists to protect
information]{.underline}**. Nothing in the fundamentals of information
security was ever intended to secure anything other than information.
Thus, we need to stop trying to use an information security mindset to
secure "stuff" that isn't information. We must recognize that
cybersecurity's scope is beyond that of information security, and thus
apply cybersecurity principals to cybersecurity problems.

Defense

We also need to remember that [cybersecurity]{.underline} [allows for
active measures to defend devices. There's a reason that the military
and intelligence agencies refer to their security operations as
cybersecurity, and that's because they take active countermeasures to
attacks]{.underline}. You don't do that when your objective is to secure
information. In fact, that entire concept is an anathema to the
information security principals and mindset.

Cybersecurity defense is a big rabbit hole I don't plan to explore
further in this posting, other than to remind you that cybersecurity's
objective is the protection and defense of assets.

Summary

There is an old saying, "When the only tool you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail." With no real cybersecurity experience,
too many information security experts are trying to hammer cybersecurity
into becoming an information security nail. We need to reset the
thinking of those information security professionals and teach them that
cybersecurity is more like a bolt than a nail, and that you use a
wrench, not a hammer, when installing or removing a bolt.

Now, a quick review...

In most organizations, there are three security domains with which it
must be concerned:

Corporate Security, which protects (and sometimes defends) people; and
real, corporate, and intellectual property.

Information Security, which protects information (data).

Cybersecurity, which protects and defends: hardware, communications, and
software.

The diagram below illustrates those relationships among the
organization's security domains.

![Security Domain
Relationships](media/image9.jpeg){width="4.16971019247594in"
height="3.374405074365704in"}

We established the following definitions in support of those security
domains:

Security is the protection of assets from threats.

Corporate Security is those aspects of an organization's security not
directly related to technology.

Information Security is the protection of information in any form and at
all times.

Cybersecurity is the protection and defense of both analogue and digital
electronic devices, their communications channels, and their
processing-and-control logic and algorithms.

Trying to treat cybersecurity problems as though they are information
security problems is one of the fundamental mistakes we are making in
security today. We have to remember that information security is
"data-centric," and cybersecurity is "device-centric." Trying to apply
information security principals to "device security" creates two
problems:

You cannot adequately secure "hardware" using the same controls used to
secure data, and

[There is nothing in information security that provides for active
defense.]{.underline}

If you search the Internet, you will find that many so-called
"information security experts" claim that cybersecurity is a subset of
information security. But, compared to information security,
cybersecurity has a substantially broader scope, addresses a more
complex set of security threats, and offers active defenses not provided
by information security.

If anything, we should view information security as a subset of
cybersecurity. However, that's not accurate either, as what those two
domains are attempting to secure is different --- data vs. hardware,
software, and communications. Some overlap between the two is
unavoidable, but at the most fundamental levels, they are attempting to
solve different problems. \[13\]

Thus, we need clear, concise, unambiguous definitions of both
cybersecurity and information security.

Hopefully, you will find the definitions provided here meet those
criteria.

So, don't let alleged information security experts try to tell you what
is and is not cybersecurity! Those so-called "information security
experts" are precisely that, and nothing more, because they clearly do
not understand cybersecurity!

Please leave cybersecurity to actual cybersecurity practitioners.

Thank you!

### ADR CP\-\--2AC

#### Widespread [SSA]{.underline} abilities are a [pre-requisite]{.underline} to ADR capabilities\-\--we can't [collect]{.underline} something we can't find!

Jason **Forshaw et al., 20** (Jason Forshaw, Mike Lindsay, Charity
Weeden, John Auburn, Chris Blackerby, 9-18-2020, accessedon 6-23-2022,
Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies Conference,
"An Exploration of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Needs for Active
Debris Removal ADR) Operators",
https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2020/Poster/Forshaw.pdf, HBisevac)

Comprehensive Space Situational Awareness ([SSA]{.underline}) [data
allows users to accurately interpret and characterize the activity of
satellites]{.underline}, [improving operational safety and reducing the
risk of collisions by increasing ability to
recognize **abnormal**]{.underline} or off-nominal
**[behavior]{.underline}**. In the years since its origin, there have
been increasing use cases for SSA, such as asset investment protection,
insurance claims, and safety of flight. Now with the advent of new
In-orbit Servicing (IOS) missions such as Active Debris Removal (ADR),
SSA becomes an important part of operational services. 

Astroscale is one of the few companies in the world proposing to aid in
the removal of orbital debris through the provision of the following
in-orbit services: end-of-life (EOL) targeting the LEO constellations,
ADR targeting existing larger space debris, and life-extension targeting
GEO satellites. As we grow our business, develop our capabilities, and
become closer to fully operational services, Astroscale is developing a
clearer understanding of SSA needs for its future ADR missions. This
paper aims to address those specialized needs, understanding the key
technical drivers. 

2\. SSA NEEDS FOR ADR 

In a classical ADR mission, we have a **[servicer]{.underline}** ([the
satellite doing the removal]{.underline}) [and a **client**]{.underline}
([the asset in space being removed]{.underline}). We will be using this
terminology throughout the paper. 

We break down our SSA needs into 5 categories: 

\(1\) Pre-launch Assessment 

[Important data can be provided by SSA even before a servicer is
launched]{.underline}, [such as **client position**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, in some cases, [**client attitude** and **tumbling
rate**]{.underline}. ADR services in future will have inherent fixed
tumbling rate servicing limits -- if a client tumbling rate is too high,
then a client may be unserviceable to begin with. [Such
information **needs** to be ascertained **before** a **service
commences**]{.underline}, otherwise this places risk on the ADR provider
if they launch a servicer only to find that they can't perform the
intended removal. 

\(2\) Search and Approach 

[SSA is **mandatory** for **future search** and **approach
maneuvers**]{.underline}. Generally, [the client is defunct]{.underline}
and the satellite has failed in a way such that it needs removal. [In
this case]{.underline}, [absolute positioning systems
on-board]{.underline} e.g. GPS [are not functional and]{.underline} thus
[the client's position can **only be known** through use of **SSA
services**]{.underline}. One of the [first steps in a servicer
rendezvousing]{.underline} with a client [is]{.underline} the "[search
and approach]{.underline}" phase (see CONOPS section below)
[which]{.underline} thus [**requires use** of an SSA
service]{.underline}. 

\(3\) Failure Analysis 

SSA services can provide some form of failure analysis capability to
analyze the conditions surrounding the  failure of the client. For
example, if the client is tumbling in a specific way, or has unusual
trajectory motion,  this might indicate a GNC or propulsion failure.
Understanding such information before rendezvous, could be  very
valuable to the ADR service provider.  

\(4\) Collision Analysis and CAM Alerts 

CAM (Collision Avoidance Maneuver) alerts are a core stable of
[conventional SSA]{.underline} provision and are [also needed in **ADR
missions**]{.underline}. The [servicer must be able to move out of the
way]{.underline} of other satellites, or trackable debris.  However,
depending on the accuracy of the SSA data, [SSA providers]{.underline}
may be able to [provide **independent tracking** to]{.underline} help
[prevent **collisions** during **R**endezvous and **P**roximity
**O**perations]{.underline} (RPO). 

\(5\) Independent Monitoring for Ensuring Transparency 

Finally, regarding safety and security, SSA can provide independent
monitoring for ensuring transparency for any regulatory and potential
insurance compliance. In particular, tracking of the servicer during the
course of the mission can provide confidence that no malicious behavior
is being undertaken. 

It is to be noted that [the needs for SSA for ADR]{.underline} do differ
than the broader [needs]{.underline} of SSA for [**mass observation**
of satellites]{.underline}. In a conventional SSA scenario (e.g.
government operational intelligence, general tracking of debris),
SSA providers scan for, or track, a very large database of objects. SSA
for ADR differs in that, specifically for Needs #1 to #3, ADR customers
are looking for specific tracking of just 2 entities -- the servicer and
the client. Thus, high-quality data on 2 objects is far more valuable
than low quality data on a very large number of objects. 

#### It [fails]{.underline} AND causes [escalation]{.underline} because they are [perceived]{.underline} as ASATs!

Leonard **David 21**. Author of Moon Rush: The New Space Race (National
Geographic, 2019) and Mars: Our Future on the Red Planet (National

//EM

[A Space]{.underline} [Age]{.underline} "**[tragedy]{.underline}** of
the commons" [is **unfolding** right **under our
nose**]{.underline}---or, really, right over our head---[and **no
consensus**]{.underline} yet [exists on **how to stop it.**]{.underline}
[For more than]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
half-**[century]{.underline}**, [humans have]{.underline} [been
**hurling objects** into]{.underline}
**[l]{.underline}**ow-**[E]{.underline}**arth **[o]{.underline}**rbit
[in ever]{.underline} [**growing** numbers]{.underline}. And with few
meaningful limitations on further launches into that increasingly
congested realm, the prevailing attitude has been persistently
permissive: in orbit, it seems, there is always room for one more.

After so many decades of the buildup of high-speed clutter in the form
of spent rocket stages, stray bolts and paint chips, solid-rocket-motor
slag, dead or dying satellites and the scattered fragments from
antisatellite tests---all of which could individually damage or destroy
other assets---low-Earth orbit is finally on the verge of becoming too
crowded for comfort. And the problem is now poised to get much worse
because of the rise of satellite "mega constellations" requiring
thousands of spacecraft, such as SpaceX's Starlink, a broadband Internet
network. Starlink is but one of many similar projects: Another mega
constellation from a company called OneWeb is already being deployed.
And Amazon's Project Kuiper is seeking to create a mega constellation of
up to 3,200 satellites in the near future.

As the congestion has grown, so too have close calls between orbiting
assets. The International Space Station, for instance, regularly tweaks
its orbit to avoid potentially hazardous debris. Worse yet, there has
been an uptick in the threat of full-on collisions that generate
menacing refuse that exacerbates the already bad situation. Consider the
February 2009 run-in between a dead Russian Cosmos satellite and a
commercial Iridium spacecraft, which produced an enormous amount of
debris.

Finding ways to remove at least some of all that space junk should be a
top global priority, says Donald Kessler, a retired NASA senior
scientist for orbital debris research. In the late 1970s he foretold the
possibility of a scenario that has been dubbed the Kessler syndrome: as
the density of space rubbish increases, a cascading, self-sustaining
runaway cycle of debris-generating collisions can arise that might
ultimately make low-Earth orbit too hazardous to support most space
activities.

"There is now agreement within the community that the debris environment
has reached a 'tipping point' where debris would continue to increase
even if all launches were stopped," Kessler says. "It takes an
Iridium-Cosmos-type collision to get everyone's attention. That's what
it boils down to\.... And we're overdue for something like that to
happen."

As for the Kessler syndrome, "it has already started," the debris expert
says. "There are collisions taking place all the time---less dramatic
and not at the large size scale," Kessler adds.

UP AND OUT

Kessler's nightmare scenario has yielded no shortage of possible
debris-flushing fixes: nets, laser blasts, harpoons, giant foam balls,
puffs of air, tethers and solar sails---as well as garbage-gathering
robotic arms and tentacles---have all been proposed as solutions for
taking out our orbital trash.

A new entrant in grappling with this worrisome state of affairs is the
just launched End-of-Life Services by Astroscale Demonstration (ELSA-d)
mission. ELSA-d is a two-satellite mission developed by Astroscale, a
Japan-based satellite services company: it consists of a "servicer"
satellite designed to safely remove debris from orbit and a "client" one
that doubles as an object of interest. The project aims to showcase a
magnetic system that can capture stable and even tumbling objects,
whether for disposal or servicing in orbit. Following a multiphase test
agenda, the servicer and client will then deorbit together,
disintegrating during their fiery plunge into Earth's atmosphere.

ELSA-d is now circling in Earth orbit. The mission was lofted on March
22 via a Russian Soyuz rocket that tossed scads of other hitchhiking
satellites into space. Following the liftoff, Astroscale's founder and
CEO Nobu Okada said ELSA-d will prove out debris-removal capabilities
and "propel regulatory developments and advance the business case for
end-of-life and active debris removal services." The launch is a step
toward realizing "safe and sustainable development of space for the
benefit of future generations," he said.

Although ELSA-d and other technology demonstrations of its ilk are
unquestionably positive developments for clearing orbital debris, they
should not be mistaken for cure-alls. Despite their modest successes,
such missions are falling short of addressing the dynamic dilemma at
hand, and the proliferation of space junk continues essentially
unabated.

ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL SOLUTION?

"From my perspective, the best solution to dealing with space debris is
not to generate it in the first place," says T. S. Kelso, a scientist at
CelesTrak, an analytic group that keeps an eye on Earth-orbiting
objects. "Like any environmental issue, it is easier and far less
expensive to prevent pollution than to clean it up later. Stop leaving
things in orbit after they have completed their mission."

[There simply is **no "one-size-fits-all** solution]{.underline}"
[to]{.underline} the problem of **[space junk]{.underline}**, Kelso
says. [Removing **large** rocket bodies]{.underline} [is a
**significantly different**]{.underline} [task than
removing]{.underline} the equivalent [mass]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
a lot more **[smaller objects]{.underline}**, which are in a wide range
of orbits, he observes. Meanwhile **[innovations]{.underline}** [by
companies such]{.underline} [as SpaceX]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
dramatically **[lowering launch costs]{.underline}**,
[opening]{.underline} the **[floodgates]{.underline}** [for far
more]{.underline} [satellites]{.underline} [to reach
**l**]{.underline}ow-**[E]{.underline}**arth **[o]{.underline}**rbit,
[where]{.underline} [some will **inevitably fail**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [become **drifting**]{.underline}, debris-generating
hazards (unless they are removed by ELSA-d-like space tugs). "Many of
these operators are starting to understand the difficulty and complexity
of continuing to dodge the growing number of debris."

Space junk ranges from nanoparticles to whole spacecraft such as the
European Space Agency's Envisat, which is the size of a double-decker
bus and at the top of everyone\'s removal hit list, says Alice Gorman, a
space archaeologist and space junk expert at Flinders University in
Australia.

There are also objects such as despin weights, which are solid lumps of
metal, and thermal blankets, which are paper-thin. "They'll cause
different types of damage and may need different strategies to remove.
There is no way that a one-size-fits-all approach is going to do it,"
Gorman says.

The most serious risks, she says, come from debris particles between one
and 10 centimeters in size. "There's far more of them than whole defunct
spacecraft, and there is a far greater probability of collision," Gorman
says. "While debris this size might not cause a catastrophic breakup,
collision with it can certainly damage working satellites and create new
debris particles."

Turning her attention to satellite mega constellations, Gorman worries
about their effects in a low-Earth orbital environment that is already
congested. "We also know that orbital dynamics can be unpredictable,"
she says. "I want to see some of these mega constellation operators
releasing their long-term modeling for collisions as more and more
satellites are launched."

[There is **no doubt** that]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**ctive
orbital **[d]{.underline}**ebris **[r]{.underline}**emoval [is
**technically challenging**]{.underline}, Gorman says. "However, [the
big issue is that any]{.underline} successful [technology]{.underline}
[that **can remove**]{.underline} [an **existing piece**]{.underline}
[of debris]{.underline} [can]{.underline} also [be used as
an]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**nti**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
[weapon]{.underline}," she says. "[This is a whole other **can of
worms**]{.underline} that requires diplomacy and negotiation and, most
importantly, trust [at the **international level**]{.underline}."

Indeed, the ability to cozy up to spacecraft in orbit and perform
servicing or sabotage has spurred considerable interest from military
planners in recent years, says Mariel Borowitz, an associate professor
at the Georgia Institute of Technology's Sam Nunn School of
International Affairs. "These rapidly advancing technologies have the
potential to be used for peaceful space activities or for warfare in
space," she says. "[Given the **dual-use**]{.underline}
[nature]{.underline} [of their **capabilities**]{.underline}, [it's
**impossible to know**]{.underline} for sure [in advance]{.underline}
**[how they'll be used]{.underline}** on any given day."

**[Catching]{.underline}** orbital [debris will **not be

[and **drag it out**]{.underline} of orbit [without

No one has ever fought a nuclear war, and no two nuclear powers have
engaged in a prolonged, high-intensity conventional conflict. Now that
conventional systems have become implicated in space technologies for
reconnaissance, targeting, and communications, leaders will have to make
very difficult, very careful decisions on what enemy capabilities they
want to disrupt. Acton and MacDonald propose a straightforward ban on
attacks against nuclear satellite infrastructure, which would also
require agreement to keep nuclear and conventional communications
networks separate. This is the little ask; countries should plan to
fight more carefully. [The [big ask is for]{.mark} a **[multilateral

The destabilizing effect of space weapons and their potential

most serious challenges to the peaceful exploration and use of outer
space. As existing international law only prohibits certain categories
of space weapons, urgent actions need to be taken to fill the lacuna.

A 'responsible' way forward?

The apparent popularity of a ban on destructive ASAT testing and the
related but less demanding goal of establishing rules for proximity
operations could yield real substance from the new OEWG process if the
participating parties are prepared to produce tangible results. Yet
[Russia]{.underline} [and China]{.underline} [have **expressed
reservations**]{.underline} [about this **new forum** and]{.underline}
may [take steps to **disrupt it**]{.underline}. [Moving
beyond]{.underline} [an **exchange of views**]{.underline} [to an
actual]{.underline} **[negotiation]{.underline}** [is not]{.underline}
often a **[straightforward]{.underline}** process, [and there are
**already signs**]{.underline} [of disagreement]{.underline}
[among]{.underline} participating [states]{.underline}. [The
**organizational meeting**]{.underline} for the OEWG [that took
place]{.underline} on 7 and 9 February 2022 [**did not agree** to
hold]{.underline} [the OEWG's]{.underline} [first]{.underline}
substantive [meeting that **same month**]{.underline}, so this was
pushed back to mid-May. Despite these birthing pains, the OEWG on
'Reducing Space Threats' appears to be the most promising diplomatic
avenue for progress in preventing an arms race and reducing the danger
of actual armed conflict in outer space. The OEWG, as a functioning
diplomatic process, has at long last provided a forum to discuss and
take action on space security free from the straitjacket that the CD has
imposed on this subject.

[That]{.underline} [said]{.underline}, [a **functional**]{.underline}
negotiating [forum is a **necessary** but not a **sufficient
condition**]{.underline} [to ensure]{.underline} real
[progress]{.underline}. While [much will depend]{.underline}
[on]{.underline} [whether]{.underline} [**leading** space]{.underline}
[powers]{.underline} [**opt** for cooperation]{.underline}
[concerning]{.underline} space-security **[norms]{.underline}**, it will
also be important for other states and interested parties to advocate
for negotiations on cooperative security measures. Civil-society
organizations are becoming increasingly vocal on space security: in
October 2021, a 'Joint Statement on Outer Space' prepared by
civil-society actors called upon states 'not to deliberately disrupt,
damage or destroy space assets' and urged them to consider an open
letter signed by scores of former politicians, officials and civilian
space experts exhorting the UN General Assembly to begin work on a
treaty banning debris-causing ASAT tests.25

[If and when **serious negotiations**]{.underline} [on
space]{.underline} [security get under way]{.underline}, [there will be
a **need for flexibility**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the part of
[participating states]{.underline} as to whether the product of any
negotiations will be legally binding. [Given the **longstanding
differences**]{.underline} [among states]{.underline} on this issue, [it
might be]{.underline} [**prudent** to set the status]{.underline} [of
any agreed]{.underline} [measures]{.underline} to one side, [to be
**determined**]{.underline} [at a **later stage**]{.underline} [of
negotiations]{.underline}. Establishing common ground on how to define
and assess threats to space security will be necessary for the OEWG (or
any other process) to succeed. In the absence of common understandings
of what constitutes a threat to space operations or any collective
commitment to reduce such threats, [debates]{.underline} over defining
'responsible' behaviours in outer space may [not yield]{.underline}
[**meaningful** results]{.underline}.

Notwithstanding these assessments, [most Russian **analysts** display a
**severe fear**]{.underline} [of U.S]{.underline}. [and
allied]{.underline} technological [superiority]{.underline}. [Although
these fears may **reflect**]{.underline} [an extreme **worst-case**
scenario,]{.underline} many Russian military analysts share them.
Therefore, [they argue]{.underline}, [the **dependence** of
U.S.]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[NATO forces]{.underline}** [on
**space-based** assets]{.underline} [is a **vulnerability**]{.underline}
[of which Russia **cannot fail to take advantage**]{.underline} in a
crisis. [Russian military commentators]{.underline} [claim
**ASAT**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other [counterspace
weapons]{.underline} [will **deter aggression**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [offer]{.underline} war-fighting
**[advantages]{.underline}** [if deterrence fails.]{.underline}26

[These Russian]{.underline} **[motivations]{.underline}** [pose
**profound challenges**]{.underline} [to pursuing lasting]{.underline}
space [**arms control** measures]{.underline}. Several proposed
nonbinding behavioral norms may stall the testing of ASAT weapons for
the near term. For instance, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen
Hicks recently argued for a global ban on ASAT tests that create
debris.27 These norms can be diplomatically pursued through multilateral
dialogues, including at the UN. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken reiterated a U.S. desire to develop informal norms to
standardize acceptable behavior in space operations. In a speech at the
UN Conference on Disarmament, he said the United States wants to engage
in "developing standards and norms of responsible behavior in outer
space."28 He further noted, "\[W\]e should be reducing tensions in outer
space, not making them worse."29

Such diplomatic engagements would provide the United States and its NATO
allies with some transparency into Russia's ASAT and counterspace
programs and motivations. Similarly, Russia would gain transparency into
U.S. and NATO programs and concerns. Diplomatic engagements can also
help communicate redlines and establish a shared understanding of
pathways that could lead to conflict escalation in space.30

[In the end]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [there are **limits**
to what dialogue]{.underline} and voluntary [behavioral **norms** can
**accomplish**]{.underline}. Without mutual restrictions on aerospace
weapons and combat operations, Russians will continue to argue that U.S.
and NATO forces retain a significant war-fighting superiority that can
be offset only with counterspace systems. Addressing Russia's perceived
vulnerabilities to modern aerospace campaigns will require deeper
engagement and structured arms control, possibly with an instrument
similar to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. [Such
**binding**]{.underline} [agreements are a **difficult
proposition**]{.underline} [in the **prevailing**]{.underline}
geopolitical [environment]{.underline}, but they are essential to
achieve comprehensive space security and strategic stability.

Russia's Response to Space Sanctions and Short-Term Effects

[Russia's **initial response**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} Western
[space-related]{.underline} **[sanctions]{.underline}** [constituted
**little more**]{.underline} [than Roscosmos]{.underline} head Dmitry
Rogozin launching a **[furious]{.underline}** [Twitter
tirade]{.underline}, threatening to cease Russian technological support
to the International Space Station. But more [**concrete responses**
followed]{.underline}: [Russia]{.underline} [**suspended** its launch
operations]{.underline} [with the]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion; [**cut off** rocket
engine]{.underline} **[servicing]{.underline}** and exports [to
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates; [and
has held at least]{.underline} one previously [contracted
commercial]{.underline} [satellite]{.underline} [**launch
hostage**]{.underline} in an attempt to extort a NATO member state.
Along the way, the mercurial Rogozin has continued to bluster on social
media and in the Russian press, threatening that the 500-ton
International Space Station could be deorbited over the United States or
Western Europe, that the loss of Russian rocket technology would force
the United States and its allies to access space on "broomsticks," that
continued partnership in the International Space Station and other joint
projects was contingent on the lifting of Western sanctions, and,
several weeks later, that [Russia would]{.underline}, in fact,
[**leave** its long-standing]{.underline} [partnership in
the]{.underline} **[I]{.underline}**nternational **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[S]{.underline}**tation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been less strident than Rogozin, at
least in terms of Russian space activities. Downplaying the effects of
Western sanctions, Putin has insisted that Roscosmos will continue its
civil-space missions --- including the Luna-25 Moon mission (one of the
lunar missions in which the European Space Agency canceled its
collaboration), broadband-providing satellite services, and nuclear
propulsion technology development --- without international
collaboration. Putin himself has not commented on the future of the
International Space Station.

From the perspective of NASA and the United States, Russia's
counter-sanctions and threats have had little short-term impact. NASA
announced its intent to continue partnering with Roscosmos on the
maintenance of the station shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, and
while Russia has symbolically canceled some joint space station
experiments in retaliation for Western sanctions, most International
Space Station operations are proceeding as normal. This has included
(despite breathless articles about possible "stranded" astronauts) the
return of U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei to Earth in a Soyuz crew capsule
at the end of March and, at least until mid-May when some media outlets
reported the cancellation of the agreement, plans to fly a Russian
cosmonaut to the International Space Station on a SpaceX Crew Dragon
capsule later this year. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has consistently
characterized Rogozin's threats as mere bluster and stated that he
"see\[s\] nothing that has interrupted \[the\] professional
relationship" between NASA and Roscosmos in International Space Station
operations. As a number of experts have noted, Rogozin's comments
concerning the space station do not signal Russia's immediate intentions
and recognize Roscomos's obligation to provide at least a year's advance
notice prior leaving the International Space Station partnership --- a
notification that, to date, has not been provided. Additionally,
Rogozin's media statements are not significantly different from those of
Russian government officials made prior to the invasion of Ukraine
regarding Russia's intention to potentially leave the partnership after
the 2024 conclusion of the station's current international operating
agreement.

Unfortunately, the short-term effects of the Western sanctions campaign
have been far more significant for Europe. The European Space Agency's
decision to cancel its joint projects with Roscosmos effectively ended
almost 30 years of space collaboration between the two organizations. In
addition to the canceled, suspended, or indefinitely postponed joint
civil-space missions, the Russian embargo on Soyuz flights for European
payloads has resulted in the cancellation of approximately 16 satellite
missions between 2022 and 2024. This has left almost 200 satellites,
including several Galileo geo-navigation satellites and a number of
other high-profile European satellite missions, without an immediate
method of reaching orbit. While a number of launch providers have
attempted to adjust their launch schedules and manifests to accommodate
these missions, it remains to be seen whether there will be sufficient
space on current launches to undertake these missions in the short term.
Furthermore, non-space related sanctions, particularly those targeting
Russia's oil, coal, gas, and energy exports, are already causing
economic hardship to European economies.

Long-Term Effects

[As **sanctions**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [counter-sanctions
between]{.underline} [the West]{.underline} [and Russia]{.underline}
**[proliferate]{.underline}**, and as the war in Ukraine grinds on in an
ever more brutal fashion, it is difficult to predict exactly what
long-terms effects these sanctions will have in the space domain. A
number of factors will likely contribute to the long-term effects,
including, at a minimum, the length and outcome of the Russo-Ukrainian
war; whether Western sanctions are lifted when the conflict concludes;
and the extent to which Russia is able to evade Western sanctions or
find alternative sources of money and materiel, whether by seeking
greater engagement with other international partners (China being the
primary candidate) or through other means.

First, how will the Russian civil-space program be affected over the
long-term by the current sanctions? [The Biden administration has
**insisted**]{.underline} that current [sanctions will
**halve**]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} high-tech
[imports]{.underline} and radically affect its defense and aerospace
industries, particularly over a period of years. Others counter that
such export controls are more likely to constitute a short-term "flesh
wound" from which Russia will be able to recover over the long-term by
shifting to other supply sources. It seems, however, that sanctions are
already wreaking havoc within Russia's industries: The loss of high-tech
electronic and computer equipment imports has reportedly forced
shutdowns of a number of military manufacturing plants, including tank
factories and surface-to-air missiles production facilities. New
military systems under development by the Russian defense industry were
described as being "hostage to many new technologies and systems" as
early as 2019. Now, with the bite of sanctions, it is unclear whether
such systems can be produced in sufficient numbers to contribute to
Russia's military efforts in Ukraine. Additionally, reports out of
Ukraine indicate that sanctions have already reduced Russian forces to
jerry-rigging military equipment with semiconductors and computer chips
from household appliances. While nothing has been publicly released
concerning the effects of sanctions on Russia's space activities, the
apparent effects of sanctions throughout Russia's military and
technology production do not bode well for the long-term health of the
country's space industries.

Russia's space program has suffered heavily over the past decade ---
particularly in the wake of previous Western sanctions imposed after
Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. As space expert James Clay Moltz
notes, since 2014, the Russian space program has "become less innovative
and more militarily focused" and its "civil and commercial space
technology has failed to keep up with world standards," already
drastically reducing its competitiveness. Even before the present crisis
in Ukraine, [the]{.underline} **[F]{.underline}**rench
**[I]{.underline}**nstitute of **[I]{.underline}**nternational
**[R]{.underline}**elations [theorized that the Russian **space
program**]{.underline} [was on a path of]{.underline} [**significant
decline** that might not be **averted**]{.underline} [without
Russian]{.underline} **[reengagement]{.underline}** with the West and
partnership with Europe. [Such reengagement **now seems
impossible**]{.underline}, [with both the]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[A]{.underline}**gency and individual European governments [**turning
back** toward]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [for space **partnerships**]{.underline}.
Should these trends continue, Western sanctions and European
disengagement may prove devastating to a Russian space program already
weakened by pre-2022 sanctions, budget cuts, and aging technology.

With respect to long-term civil-space cooperation between the United
States and Russia, there is no immediate threat (despite Rogozin's
bombastic statements) to the International Space Station partnership.
However, [between Russian officials' **publicly stated**
intentions]{.underline} [to leave the]{.underline}
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[S]{.underline}**tation [sometime in the next]{.underline} **[several
years]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the [generally
**deteriorating**]{.underline} geopolitical [relationship between
**Russia**]{.underline} [and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [it]{.underline} [is by **no means
clear**]{.underline} [that civil-space cooperation]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} [**continue** in a **meaningful** way]{.underline}
after the decommissioning of the space station. [Russia]{.underline}
[has already sought]{.underline} civil-[space partnerships]{.underline}
[with China]{.underline}, signing a five-year space cooperation
agreement with the Chinese government and agreeing to jointly construct
a lunar research station. [A shift by Russia away]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} civil-space [cooperation with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Europe]{.underline} [would **further solidify**]{.underline} [the
growing **perception** of "**strategic competition**]{.underline}"
between the West and a Russian-Chinese bloc --- a competition already
widely seen as existing and growing in the context of military and
intelligence-related outer-space operations.

Elusive definitions

[Treaties that **ban or control** weapons]{.underline} [must
define]{.underline} what, **[exactly]{.underline}**, [they **aim to
ban**]{.underline} or control. [Without an **ASAT
definition**]{.underline} [that is **simultaneously
inclusive**]{.underline} and precise, international
[regimes]{.underline} [preventing]{.underline} the
**[development]{.underline}**, **[deployment]{.underline}**, [and use of
ASATs]{.underline} [are]{.underline} **[ineffective]{.underline}**. Two
obstacles make constructing a useful definition nearly impossible:
weaponry diversity and the dual-use problem.

[By the most **literal interpretation**]{.underline} of this PPWT
language, [almost **everything can be classified**]{.underline} [as an
ASAT]{.underline} and cannot be put into space.

The variety of potential ASAT weaponry presents a problem. ASAT weapons
are any technology that can temporarily or permanently disable or
destroy a satellite's functionality. [This means **lasers**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} other directed [energy weapons]{.underline}, [air- and
land-**launched**]{.underline} kinetic **[missiles]{.underline}**,
[cyber **uplink**]{.underline} [and downlink **attacks**]{.underline},
**[radiofrequency]{.underline}** jamming [attacks]{.underline}, [attacks
on ground stations]{.underline}, [and **maneuverable**]{.underline}
attack [satellites]{.underline} **[are all ASAT weapons]{.underline}**.

[The diversity of ASAT]{.underline} weapon[s makes]{.underline}
**[articulating]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} sufficiently
**[comprehensive]{.underline}** [and precise definition]{.underline}
**[impossible]{.underline}**. [Any attempt to do so]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} [**inevitably** leave **significant
loopholes**]{.underline} because each technology exists in a separate
domain defined by unique operational requirements, norms, and
expectations that require specific rules and regulations to control.

[Controlling these technologies]{.underline} [is]{.underline} especially
[difficult]{.underline} [given most have]{.underline} legitimate,
**[peaceful]{.underline}**, or commonplace [uses]{.underline}.
Satellites are fragile. It takes little force to render them temporarily
or permanently ineffective. When a target is defined by fragility,
everything becomes a weapon, meaning innocent and commonplace
technologies can be weaponized. Remotely operated repair satellites, for
instance, are being developed to revitalize failing satellites.\[5\] But
the same capabilities used to repair can be repurposed to destroy.
Similarly, any satellite equipped with a radiofrequency antenna
necessary to receive signals can also emit them with sufficient strength
to jam the communications of nearby satellites.\[6\] [This **dual-use
problem**]{.underline} [presents an **obstacle** for]{.underline} ASAT
[arms control]{.underline} [by pitting legitimate]{.underline} and
peaceful **[operational freedom]{.underline}** [against]{.underline}
national [security]{.underline}.

#### 2. [VERIFICATION]{.underline}\-\--it's impossible to [prevent]{.underline} development.

Verification problems

[To **identify**]{.underline} [and **differentiate**]{.underline}
[between compliance]{.underline} and disobedience, [the international
community]{.underline} [must be **able to identify**]{.underline} and
characterize [objects in orbit.]{.underline} International arms control
[treaties]{.underline} **[cannot rely on goodwill]{.underline}** alone.
[Verification]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline} [must]{.underline}
therefore [be an **inherent part** of]{.underline} [any]{.underline}
[agreement that **restricts**]{.underline} [the use]{.underline} or
deployment [of weaponry]{.underline}.

But it won't be in outer space---[no reliable **verification
capabilities**]{.underline} currently **[exist]{.underline}**. [Once an
asset is **deployed**]{.underline} in orbit, [it's **remarkably
difficult** to tell]{.underline} [what it is]{.underline} [and what it
is **capable of doing**]{.underline}. For non-physical weapons, like
cyber and jamming capabilities, there are no means to verify compliance.
Any attempt to ban non-physical ASAT weapons would rely exclusively on
trust. The PPWT seeks to bar signatories from placing "any weapons in
outer space."\[8\] It's mere finger-wagging more than an enforceable
rule without a means to verify compliance.

[Effective]{.underline} verification [mechanisms]{.underline} [would be
**costly**]{.underline}, [complicated]{.underline}, [and
**ineffective**]{.underline}. And without verification capabilities,
[useful]{.underline} arms control [agreements are
**hopeless**.]{.underline}

Advocates for ASAT arms control would disagree, pointing to modern space
situational awareness capabilities that can detect space launches and
track the orbital inclination of their payloads through space-based
infrared and infrasound monitoring systems.\[9\] Even if states can
track objects that are placed into orbit, "verifying the function of a
particular space object already in orbit is significantly more
difficult."\[10\] The "PAXSAT A" study demonstrated that uncovering the
functionality of satellites in orbit is possible by utilizing a
four-satellite constellation.\[11\] But this investigation method relies
on the ability of the constellation to position itself near the object
in question and the assumption that form follows function. Two problems
are presented here. First, we do not have the infrastructure to conduct
on-orbit investigations. Second, the logic that form follows function is
fallible. Because space launches are expensive, advocates argue that the
extra weight and cost needed to obscure the true function of an ASAT
weapon in orbit with facade architecture is too expensive to be
realistic. But basing arms control agreements on the predicted frugality
of nation-states seems illogical, at best.

[Even with **perfect**]{.underline} launch [monitoring
capabilities]{.underline}, [significant **unknowns
remain**]{.underline}. [Many **space-related armaments**]{.underline}
are ground-based, meaning these weapons [can be developed]{.underline}
and deployed [**outside of the scope** of **current** ASAT]{.underline}
**[monitoring]{.underline}** systems. Also, for non-physical weapons,
verification is simply impossible. No mechanism exists, for example, to
verify compliance with moratoriums against developing or deploying
cyberweapons or jamming capabilities.

#### 3. [ATTRIBUTION]{.underline}\-\--there's [no way]{.underline} to find who did it!

Brian **Britt 21**. M.A. candidate at Georgetown University's Security

Attribution problems

[Attribution]{.underline}, the ability to identify a violation and
legitimately tie it to an actor, [is a **key ingredient** of
arms]{.underline} [control **agreements**]{.underline}. [The ability to
**attribute violations**]{.underline} [is key to
**justifying**]{.underline} [the **invoking of
punishments**]{.underline} [in accordance]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} international [treaty law]{.underline}. Thus,
[attribution]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline} [are the
**foundation** of a **deterrence**]{.underline} [mechanism]{.underline}
[that makes arms]{.underline} [control]{.underline} agreements
**[attractive]{.underline}** [and **practical**]{.underline}.

[Attribution]{.underline} capabilities, or the lack thereof, [**present
another problem** for ASAT]{.underline} arms [control]{.underline}.
[Some forms of ASAT]{.underline} [attacks]{.underline} [are
**attributable**]{.underline}. [**Others are not**.]{.underline}
[Non-physical threats]{.underline}, for instance, [are **particularly
difficult**]{.underline} to tie actions to national actors.

In the event a laser, for example, is used against a space asset,
satellite operators would have a difficult time identifying the actor
responsible for the attack. In the harsh environment of space, systems
frequently fail without explanation. Unless the targeted satellite is
equipped with sensors that could identify "a spike in thermal energy or
sudden saturation of optical sensors," there is no way to differentiate
between a random satellite failure and a malicious laser attack.\[12\]
And even if such capabilities exist, there is no guarantee one could
attribute the laser's use to a national actor.

[Russia and China **proposed**]{.underline} [the PPWT
**specifically**]{.underline} [because]{.underline} [it]{.underline}
satisfies the political hunger for ASAT arms control while
**[permitt]{.underline}**ing [**loopholes** for a variety]{.underline}
[of ASAT possessions]{.underline}.

[Jamming]{.underline} attacks [are **similarly difficult** to
attribute]{.underline}. [Satellites]{.underline} [use a **narrow
range**]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} [electromagnetic]{.underline}
[spectrum to **communicate**]{.underline}. The crowded nature of orbits
today means it is common for multiple space assets to use similar or
identical frequencies and, as a result, routinely unintentionally jam
the communications of a neighboring satellite.\[13\]
[Differentiating]{.underline} [between **intentional**]{.underline} [and
**unintentional jamming** is]{.underline} difficult, [if not
**impossible**]{.underline}. In this environment, verification and
compliance mechanisms are complicated to construct.

#### 4. [ADVERSARIES]{.underline}\-\--they won't [comply]{.underline}.

Adversarial interests

[**International** participation]{.underline} [is **another key
ingredient** of effective]{.underline} ASAT arms control
[regimes]{.underline}. [But many of America's]{.underline} key
space-capable [**competitors** perceive]{.underline} [ASAT]{.underline}
weapon [possession]{.underline} [as a **strategic
necessity**]{.underline}. In other words, [the interests of
America's]{.underline} [rivals **decrease the likelihood** of
reaching]{.underline} [a]{.underline}n international [**consensus** on
an]{.underline} anti-[ASAT treaty]{.underline}, [which is a **necessary
ingredient**]{.underline} [for a successful]{.underline} ASAT [arms
**control regime**]{.underline}. The United States relies on its space
assets for a "diverse array of political, military and economic
activities" fundamental to its national security.\[15\] This
[overreliance is seen as a **weakness**]{.underline},
[something]{.underline} America's [adversaries]{.underline} [can
**reliably exploit**]{.underline} when conventional American military
capabilities outstrip theirs.

#### Ban fails

Brookings Institution, 2011, "Balancing U.S. Security Interests in
Space," in Toward a Theory of Spacepower: Selected Essays,

Overall, [[space arms control **should not be a top
priority**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the United States in the future,
contrary to what many arms control traditionalists have concluded. Some
specific accords of limited scope, such as a treaty banning collisions
or explosions that would produce debris above a certain (low) altitude,
and confidence-building measures such as keep-out zones near deployed
satellites, do make sense. But [the [inability to verify]{.mark}
compliance with]{.underline} more [[sweeping
prohibitions]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[inherent
**a**]{.mark}nti**[sat]{.mark}**ellite [capabilities of]{.mark} many
[missile defense]{.mark} systems, and the military need to counter
efforts by other countries to use satellites to target American military
assets]{.underline} all [[suggest]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[comprehensive [accords banning]{.mark} the [weaponization]{.mark} of
space [are]{.mark}]{.underline} both **[[impractical]{.mark} and
undesirable]{.underline}**. That said, the United States should not want
to hasten the weaponization of space and indeed should want to avoid
such an eventuality. It benefits from its own military uses of space
greatly and disproportionately at present. It should take unilateral
action, such as by declaring that it has no dedicated antisatellite
weapons programs, to help buttress the status quo as much as possible.

One type of [arms control]{.underline} accord on activities in space
would be quite comprehensive, [calling for no testing, production, or
deployment of ASATs]{.underline} of any kind, based in space or on the
ground, at any time; no Earth-attack weapons stationed in space, ever;
and formal, permanent treaties codifying these prohibitions. These
provisions are in line with those in proposals made by the Chinese and
Russian delegations to the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. They
also are supported by some traditional arms control proponents who argue
that space should be a sanctuary from weaponization and that the Outer
Space Treaty already strongly suggests as much.14

These provisions [suffer from]{.underline} three main
**[flaws]{.underline}**. To begin, [[it is difficult to be
sure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[other countries\' satellite payloads
are not ASATs]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is
**[[especially]{.underline}]{.mark}** true in regard to
[**[microsatellites]{.mark}**, which are hard to track. [Some]{.mark}
have [proposed inspections of all payloads]{.mark}]{.underline} going
into orbit, [but [this would not prevent a \"breakout]{.mark},\" in
which [a country]{.mark}]{.underline} on the verge of war
[[would]{.mark} simply [refuse to continue to abide]{.mark} by the
provisions. Since [microsats can be tested]{.mark} for maneuverability
[without making them look like ASATs]{.mark}]{.underline} and are being
so tested, [it will be difficult to preclude this scenario. A [similar
problem arises with]{.mark}]{.underline} the idea of **[[banning]{.mark}
specific types of [experimentation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as
outdoor experiments or flight testing.15 [[A laser can be tested]{.mark}
for beam strength and pointing accuracy [as a **b**]{.mark}allistic
**[m]{.mark}**issile **[d]{.mark}**efense [device **without being
identified as an ASAT**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [A microsat can be
tested]{.underline}]{.mark} [for maneuverability **[as a scientific
probe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even if its real purpose is different,
[since maneuvering microsats capable of colliding with other satellites
may have no visible features]{.underline} clearly [revealing
their]{.underline} intended [purpose]{.underline}. [[Bans on]{.mark}
outdoor [testing of declared ASAT]{.mark} device[**s** would **do little
to impede**]{.mark} **their [development]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Banning one system is useless -- adversaries shift

Michael **Krepon 12**, Co-Founder of the Stimson Center, 3/6/12, "Toward
a Space Code of Conduct,"
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/11680/toward-a-space-code-of-conduct>

Paradoxically, the [reasons for prior restraint in the military space
competition]{.underline} also [have made space arms control very
difficult. [Because there are **so many ways** to interfere]{.mark}
with]{.underline}, disable [[or destroy satellites]{.mark} \-- including
by means of launch platforms]{.underline} that are [indispensable for
other military uses]{.underline} \-- [[a ban on **all**]{.mark} of
[these means is **inconceivable**. A ban on "dedicated" ASAT]{.mark}
weapons]{.underline} specifically designed and [intended for use against
satellites is conceivable, but it [is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[**not
credible**, since **so many other ways**]{.mark} to counter satellites
will [remain unconstrained]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[A treaty banning space warfare]{.mark}, the use of ASATs or dedicated
ASAT weapons]{.underline} therefore [[runs]{.mark} aground on [a
Catch-22: To be **effective**]{.mark}, the [scope must be]{.mark}
sufficiently [broad as to be unrealizable]{.mark}, while [a narrower
scope would be **unreliable**]{.mark}. This]{.underline} Catch-22
[becomes even more severe when effective verification standards are
considered]{.underline}. What can be verified is insufficient, since
[[bans on]{.mark} dedicated [ASATs can be circumvented by hiding them in
warehouses]{.mark}, while extant military [capabilities with ASAT
potential can be **declared**]{.mark} **as intended [for other
purposes]{.mark}**. These circumstances make it extremely difficult to
engage in classical arms control treaty negotiations for]{.underline}
the global commons of [space]{.underline}. But the existence of
considerable military capabilities with ASAT potential also makes it
extremely unwise for major powers to strike first against each other's
satellites, since retribution and unintended escalation \-- including
escalation across the nuclear threshold \-- might well follow.

Where arms control advocates go wrong

Despite these challenges, [some argue that ASAT]{.underline} arms
[**control** agreements]{.underline} [are a **necessary**]{.underline}
[aspect]{.underline} [of a]{.underline} safe, **[secure]{.underline}**,
and **[stable]{.underline}** space [environment]{.underline}. [Advocates
for]{.underline} arms [control maintain]{.underline}
[agreements]{.underline} [could prevent an]{.underline} ASAT [arms
race]{.underline}. **[This is wrong]{.underline}**. Arms control
[agreements]{.underline} [will do more to **shape the direction**
of]{.underline}, [rather than **prevent**]{.underline}, an ASAT [arms
race.]{.underline} [Because any agreement]{.underline} [will be **less
than comprehensive**]{.underline}, [states]{.underline} [will
seek]{.underline} to develop [ASAT]{.underline} weapon[s]{.underline}
that fall **[outside of the agreement's jurisdiction]{.underline}**. If
the agreement bans kinetic ASAT weapons, for instance, space-capable
nations will push to develop more diverse, more effective non-kinetic
weapons.

In addition, [any agreement]{.underline} [will]{.underline} likely
**[increase]{.underline}** [the **incentives to
camouflage**]{.underline} [and disguise]{.underline} ASAT technology,
[**worsening a problem** that]{.underline} the [arms

force**]{.underline} [nations]{.underline} [to make]{.underline} ASAT
[capabilities]{.underline} increasingly [integrated with **innocent
infrastructure** to **avoid detection**]{.underline},
[furthering]{.underline} [the **dual-use problem**]{.underline}, seeding

Satellites and microwaves.

[The use of satellites for intelligence communication can be traced back
to the dawn of the space age when]{.underline} the first satellite
[(Sputnik) was launched]{.underline} by the Soviet Union on October 4,
1957. [Thousands of communication satellites have been launched since
then for reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering]{.underline}. By the
2000s, [the [U.S.]{.mark} and global [satellite industry are in **rapid
flux**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with new technological innovations adding
increased capability. For example, numerous new U.S. spy satellites now
have measurement- and signature-intelligence sensors, designed to focus
in on, track, and describe mobile or fixed targets. In 1995, the CIA and
Department of Defense created a Central MASINT Office (CMO) in the
Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), subsequently upgraded in 1998 to a
quasi-autonomous DIA organization; 1998 was also the year that the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the NRO and air
force, moved ahead with plans to develop two satellites with
synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and moving-target-indicator (MTI)
ability. This is for a planned constellation of 24-48 satellites in all,
at 1-meter resolution for imaging of 29,000 square kilometers every
hour, able to give the U.S. Air Force an all-weather surveillance
capability. [[A]{.mark}nother [innovation in]{.mark}]{.underline} recent
U.S. geostationary [[satellite tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} the
development of]{.underline} the Kuvstur Global Positioning System [(GPS)
made for **nuclear-targeting and navigation**, as well as **[detection
of nuclear explosions]{.mark}**, in a constellation of 21 operational
satellites and three active spares]{.underline}, deployed in six arrays
of four satellites. Increasingly, GPS data is also being sold for
commercial use in a host of areas, and has entered the consumer
satellite-image market. Countries the United States is sharing or plans
to share GPS satellite data with include Russia and Israel, though
Israel is also launching its own satellites. The data will also be
shared with NATO allies through the 270 LinkedOperations Intelligence
Center, Europe (LOCE) terminals, servicing the United Kingdom, Canada,
Norway, Greece, Belgium, France, and Spain. Data from the U.S.
Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) High and Low, will go solely to
allies cooperating with space-based military programs, such as Italy and
Germany. [[Satellites are]{.mark} becoming ever more [integral for
a]{.mark} **wide [range of]{.mark} U.S. [foreign policy tasks]{.mark}**,
including **global power projection capability**. As warfare and related
intelligence becomes more capital-intensive and high-tech,
**[demands]{.mark}** for satellites are [increasing. Yet]{.mark} with

in the early 2000s, [[the Pentagon faces a **massive shortage** of
satellite]{.mark}-transmission **[bandwidth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
U.S. military estimated in the 1990s that by 2005 there would be some
1,000 new satellites for the Pentagon to draw on for weapons dependent
on space-based wireless communications, and decided in 1996-97 to lease
capacity from the then-burgeoning commercial satellite industry.

National Security Agency (NSA), working with the National Reconnaissance

Network (DSN) allows it to \"acquire telemetry data from spacecraft,
transmit commands to spacecraft, and track spacecraft position and
velocity . . . measure variations in radio waves for radio science
experiments, gather science-data \[and) monitor and control the

information]{.underline}. This is probably what was done in December
2002, when North Korea reactivated its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. Such
communication also controls the satellites and confirms that they are
carrying out the intelligence mission they are tasked to perform.

From its inception in 1961, the NRO has in a variety of different ways
come under the shared authority of the DCI/DNI and DOD/Air Force. In
addition, given the nature of the space industry, it is difficult to
conceive that current problems could be resolved, or even realistically
addressed, if the NRO were essentially transferred from DOD to the DN1.
It is noteworthy that a prominent group of experts on space issues
recently took a diametrically opposite approach, recommending thai the
NRO be removed from the Intelligence Community and placed under a
national security space authority who would report to both the DNI and
the secretary of defense and to whom would be assigned the functions
currently assigned to the NRO, the Air Force Space and Missile Systems
Center, and other organizations and possessed of authority to formulate
and execute budgets for space efforts across the government. (Institute

Realists in this regard are from Missouri, the "show me" state, and ask
utopians to explain how, why, and when a powerful new cooperative
international norm with corresponding international institutions will
become a reality. [Realists point to the unhappy history of the unmet
claims and dashed hopes of the]{.underline} **[1928 Kellogg-Briand
Pact]{.underline}** (intended to prevent offensive war by global legal
agreement), [the]{.underline} **[League of Nations]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[the United Nations]{.underline}**. To be sure, the
future does not have to be bound by the past, but before moving further
toward nuclear disarmament, [realists want to see some clear evidence of
the emerging transformation of the global order]{.underline}---[**not
just the claim** that it can occur if all key leaders are so willing,
faithful, and visionary and can "embrace a politics of
impossibility."]{.underline}12 [As the old English proverb says, "If
wishes were horses, then beggars would ride."]{.underline}

But [has not everything changed in the twenty-first
century?]{.underline} [Has not the end of the Cold War ushered in a new
global commitment to cooperation]{.underline}, [the rule of
law]{.underline} globally, [and benign conflict resolution? **The
unarguable answer is no.**]{.underline} **[Russian military
actions]{.underline}** [against **Georgia** in 2008 and
**Ukraine**]{.underline} [since 2014]{.underline} (the latter in direct
violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum signed by Russia, Great
Britain, and the United States) [are]{.underline} **[sufficient
empirical evidence]{.underline}** [to demonstrate that **Thucydides'
stark description of reality is alive and well**]{.underline}.
[**China's** expansionist claims and military pressure against its
neighbors in the East and South China Seas teach the same
lesson]{.underline}.

**[Why is this reality significant in the consideration of nuclear
weapons?]{.underline}** [Because in the absence of reliably overturning
the powerful norm of raison d'État]{.underline} and Thucydides'
explanation of international relations, [states with the capability and
felt need will **continue to demand nuclear capabilities** for their
**own protection** and, in some cases, to provide **cover for their
expansionist plans**]{.underline}. To wit, if Ukraine had retained
nuclear weapons, would it now fear for its survival at the hands of
Russian aggression? Former Ukrainian defense minister Valeriy Heletey
and members of the Ukrainian parliament have made this point explicitly,
lamenting Ukraine's transfer of its nuclear forces to Russia in return
for now-broken security promises of the Budapest Memorandum.13

This lesson cannot have been lost on other leaders considering the value
of nuclear weapons. Nor is it a coincidence that US allies in Central
Europe and Asia are becoming ever more explicit about their need for US
nuclear assurances under the US extended nuclear deterrent (i.e., the
nuclear umbrella). They see no new emerging, powerful global collective
security regime or cooperative norms that will preserve their security;
thus, they understandably seek the assurance of power, including nuclear
power. The Polish Foreign Ministry observed in a recent press release
that "the current situation reaffirms the importance of NATO's nuclear
deterrence policy."14 [This reality stands in **stark
contrast**]{.underline} [to **utopian claims** that powerful **new
global norms** and international institutions will **reorder the
international system**, overturn Thucydides, and allow individual states
to **dispense with nuclear weapons** or the nuclear protection of a
powerful]{.underline} ally. [As the Socialist French president Francois
Hollande has said]{.underline}, "**[The international context does not
allow for any weakness]{.underline}**. . . . [The era of nuclear
deterrence is **therefore not over**]{.underline}. . . . In a dangerous
world---and it is dangerous---France does not want to let down its
guard. . . . [The possibility of future state conflicts concerning us
directly or indirectly cannot be excluded]{.underline}."15 [There could
be no clearer expression of Thucydides' description of international
relations and its contemporary implications for nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

[Opponents of the administration's plan to **modernize the US
triad**]{.underline} now [double down on the utopian narrative by
insisting that the United States instead **lead the way in establishing
the new global norm** by showing that Washington no longer relies on
nuclear weapons]{.underline} and does not seek new ones. Washington
cannot expect others to forgo nuclear weapons if it retains them, they
say, and thus it must lead in creation of the new norm against nuclear
weapons by providing an example to the world. For instance, "by
unilaterally reducing its arsenal to a total of 1,000 warheads, the
United States would encourage Russia to similarly reduce its nuclear
forces without waiting for arms control negotiations."16 A good US
example supposedly can help "induce parallel" behavior in others.17 If,
however, the United States attributes continuing value to nuclear
weapons by maintaining its arsenal, "other countries will be more
inclined to seek" them.18

**[Nuclear realists respond]{.underline}**, however, [that the United
States already has reduced its nuclear forces **deeply** over the last
25 years]{.underline}. [America cut its tactical nuclear weapons from a
few thousand in 1991 to a "few hundred" today]{.underline}.19 Moreover,
US-deployed strategic nuclear weapons have been cut from an estimated
9,000 in 1992 to roughly 1,600 accountable warheads today, with still
more reductions planned under the New START Treaty.20 [The United States
has even decided to be **highly revealing of its nuclear capabilities**
to **encourage others to do so,**]{.underline} [with **no apparent
effect on Russia, China, or North Korea**]{.underline}.21 [America has
**adhered fully** to the reductions and restrictions of the 1987
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty---the "centerpiece of arms
control"---but the **Russians now are in open violation**]{.underline}.
As former undersec- retary of state Robert Joseph stated recently,
**[decades of deep US reductions "appear to have had no moderating
effect on Russian, Chinese or North Korean]{.underline}** **[nuclear
programs]{.underline}**. Neither have U.S. reductions led to any
effective strengthening of international nonproliferation efforts."22
Utopians want the United States to lead the world toward nuclear
disarmament by its good example, but no one is following.

Recent reports suggest that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump
insistently asked an anonymous foreign-policy expert why the United
States should not use nuclear weapons more readily. This has led to a
chorus of voices decrying the way in which Trump is reported to have
spoken about the nuclear option, with many insisting the United States
should only ever employ nuclear weapons in retaliation after an opponent
has used them first. It is certainly right that such terrible weapons
should only be used in extreme circumstances (a point of view Trump
appears to have expressed earlier this year), but the conventional
wisdom is wrong in suggesting the United States should under no
circumstances be the first to use nuclear arms. This controversy is not
merely another spark of the campaign season, for, according to reports,
President Barack Obama himself is considering implementing a
"no-first-use" pledge regarding nuclear weapons --- that is, a promise
never to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Such a pledge would be
exceedingly unwise. Nuclear weapons are horrible instruments of
destruction, but they are also associated with the longest period of
major-power peace in human history. And they only work because
potentially ambitious states believe their use is plausible enough that
starting a war or escalating one against a nuclear-armed state or its
allies would just be too risky to countenance. [The point of [reserving
the right to use nuc]{.mark}lear weapons [first]{.mark}]{.underline}
(which, it must be emphasized, is different from a policy of preemption
or heavy reliance on them[) is not to convey a madman's itchy trigger
finger on the button]{.underline}. Rather, [its purpose is to
[communicate]{.mark} clearly [to any potential aggressor that attacking
one's vital interests]{.mark} too harshly or successfully]{.underline}
--- [even without resorting to nuclear weapons]{.underline} --- [[risks
prompting a devastating nuclear response]{.underline}]{.mark}, something
that, at scale, [**is [far more costly than any realistic
gains]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A no-first-use pledge would undermine this
pacifying logic. **[If the policy were believed]{.underline}**, then
**[it would make the world safe for conventional war.]{.underline}**
**[Since [potential aggressors would write the risk of nuclear use
down]{.mark} to zero]{.underline}**, **[[they would feel they could
safely start]{.mark} and wage fierce [conventional
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Conventional wars can be]{.mark} small,
quick, and decisive, which is why they can also be
[appealing]{.mark}]{.underline} --- just ask Napoleon, James Polk, Otto
von Bismarck, or Moshe Dayan. But [[they can]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[escalate]{.mark} dramatically and unpredictably]{.underline},
especially [when major powers are involved.]{.underline} Thus, **[the
[most likely route to nuclear use is]{.mark} via a nasty [conventional
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as happened in World War II. In such
circumstances, high-minded pledges made in peacetime may well seem
foolish or too burdensome. A believable no-first-use pledge would likely
raise, rather than diminish, [the likelihood of nuclear weapons being
used by lightening the shadow of nuclear weapons over the
decision-making of potential combatants]{.underline}. Better for
everyone to think as carefully and clearly as possible about nuclear
weapons before a war is underway. Alternatively, if the no-first-use
pledge were not believed, what would the point of such a promise be
other than diplomatic window dressing? It is for these reasons that the
United States has never adopted a no-first-use policy. During the Cold
War, the United States relied on its nuclear deterrent to compensate for
perceived Soviet and Warsaw Pact conventional advantages in Europe. But
even in the post-Cold War period of American military supremacy, when
Washington sought to diminish its strategic reliance on nuclear weapons,
it judged the future was too uncertain to dispense with the reserved
right to go first. While other countries such as China and India have
declared no-first-use policies (though there is a great deal of
skepticism about how reliable Beijing's pledge is), [Washington and the
allies that depend on its nuclear umbrella have always recognized that a
no-first-use pledge]{.underline} by the United States [would be unwise
because of the breadth of defense commitments it has assumed. If the
U.S. nuclear arsenal were solely designed to deter attacks]{.underline}
on the continental United States, [a no-first-use pledge might have more
merit]{.underline}, as launching such an assault would be incredibly
difficult. But Washington also seeks to deter attacks on its allies in
areas like Eastern Europe and East Asia, where U.S. conventional
superiority is far less assured. The main reason why a no-first-use
pledge does not make sense for Washington, then, is the reality that the
United States cannot always expect to maintain the military upper hand
everywhere, and a no-first-use pledge is not the kind of commitment a
nation can turn on and off without damage to its credibility and
reputation. [But [can anyone]{.mark} plausibly [challenge the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [in a conventional war]{.mark} in the
near to medium term? The answer is [yes; **China**]{.mark} **might well
be able to**]{.underline}. **[[Russia]{.mark} and North Korea are also
very dangerous to the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[and its allies]{.underline}** in their own ways, and [Moscow
could]{.underline} plausibly hope [to take on the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [conventionally if it could localize a conflict in
its "near abroad" and keep it short]{.underline}, but neither can
reasonably expect to challenge the United States in a serious, prolonged
conventional war and hope to prevail. But **[China at some point in the
not-too-distant future might.]{.underline}** A range of authoritative
sources are showing that the [conventional military balance of power
between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
China]{.underline} with respect to points of contention in East Asia
such as Taiwan and the South and East China Seas [is,]{.underline} at
the very least, [becoming increasingly competitive.]{.underline} Beijing
is fielding more and more highly capable forces in the Western Pacific
that present a growing challenge to America's ability to effectively
project military power in the region. The days are therefore passing
when the United States could easily swipe away any effort by the
People's Liberation Army at power projection in the Western Pacific.
Instead[, **[any future fight]{.mark} in the region** between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies on the one hand
and China on the other **[would be]{.mark} hard and
[nasty]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And the trend lines are not moving in a
good direction. Indeed, within a decade, China might be in a position
where it could reasonably expect to confront a U.S. ally or partner in
the Western Pacific and hope to prevail if the conflict remained
relatively limited. If the United States adds to this a credible
guarantee that it would not use nuclear weapons first, it would
strengthen China's confidence that it could wage a short, sharp
conventional war and gain from it, just as such confidence is rising and
becoming more plausible to decision-makers in Beijing already
contemplating the use of force in the region. According to a recent
Reuters report, for instance, [influential voices in the Chinese
military establishment are]{.underline} already [pushing for firmer
security policies and]{.underline} even [military action in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea --- and this at
a time when the United States still enjoys the conventional upper hand.
[These voices are likely to seem more credible and appealing in the
councils of power in Beijing as Chinese military advantages grow, and
they would only be emboldened by a U.S. statement that it will not use
nuclear weapons first.]{.underline} [**A [no-first-use pledge would
therefore increase the chances of war in Asia]{.mark}**. Indeed, [rather
than excluding the possibility]{.mark} of American nuclear first
use]{.underline}, **[[Washington should be emphasizing
it.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This does not mean the United States should
ever use its nuclear weapons lightly. Rather, Beijing should simply
understand that, even if it is able to gain conventional military
advantages in the Western Pacific, Washington is prepared to seriously
consider using nuclear weapons first to vindicate its own vital
interests and those of its allies --- for instance with respect to their
territorial integrity. More than that, Beijing should understand clearly
that if it pushes forward with its military buildup, it will spur the
United States to rely even more on its nuclear forces to compensate ---
and, if that is not enough, the real possibility that U.S. allies will
be impelled to pursue nuclear arsenals of their own. Communicating all
this to Beijing does not require any Strangelovian contortions. But it
does require the United States to firmly and consistently say (or
otherwise communicate) that it is prepared to use nuclear weapons first
if truly pressed; to build the forces, such as a next-generation
standoff cruise missile and intercontinental ballistic missile, useful
in making such a declaration credible; and to exercise and deploy its
forces in ways that show Beijing its earnestness about such a
declaration. Such a policy is more likely to contribute to peace and
stability than a no-first-use pledge. China is very unlikely to turn
away from its effort to achieve military dominance in East Asia and the
Western Pacific based on appeals to goodwill or competitions in moral
preening. What might actually work is persuading Beijing that succeeding
in this effort is likely to backfire by resulting in little to no gain
and a more menacing and dangerous set of opposing militaries. Does China
want a U.S. defense posture for Asia that relies more on nuclear
weapons? A proliferated Asia-Pacific? [Washington must make Beijing
understand that if it continues its military buildup, those are very
real probabilities.]{.underline} A no-first-use pledge would suggest to
Beijing just the opposite --- that continuing to build up, and perhaps
even using, its military power may not be sufficiently dangerous or
costly after all. That would be far worse for Asia and America than a
perhaps unfashionable reminder that **[there will be a [grim nuclear
risk if Beijing]{.mark} ever [seeks to capitalize on]{.mark} its
[growing conventional]{.mark} military [strength]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Many brave barrels of ink and intrepid pixels have gone to their fate to
advance a better understanding of nuclear weapons. However, prior to
2016, few of these seriously grappled with the implications of a figure
like [Donald Trump]{.underline} in the Oval Office. His arrival [has
precipitated a reexamination of long-settled questions in nuclear
analysis --- most importantly the president having the **sole
authority** to launch a nuclear weapon]{.underline}. Although such
reconsideration of common wisdom is always welcome, the increasingly
popular answer to the question of presidential nuclear authority is not:
that the United States should adopt a policy requiring authorization
from multiple actors to fire nuclear weapons. In fact, [multiple
authorization remains a bad idea, even if the alternative places formal
control of America's fate in hands of uncertain stability]{.underline}.
The debate over how to authorize the use of nuclear weapons is one facet
of the "always/never" problem that was identified by Peter Feaver:
[States want high assurance that nuclear weapons will always be used
when directed and that they will never be used otherwise]{.underline}.
The problem is that there tends to be a tradeoff between "always" and
"never." [Measures that add safeguards against accidental or
unauthorized use tend to reduce operational efficacy in situations where
speed and tight control are crucial, while command-and-control
arrangements that prioritize flexibility and speed tend to be more
vulnerable to abuse and/or mishaps]{.underline}. The balance between
"always" and "never" can be set in a number of different ways, and
states can reasonably make adjustments depending on the circumstances.
For instance, **[warfighting doctrines]{.underline}** (either for a
damage-limiting first strike or for battlefield use) [**are more
operationally challenging,** often depending on speed, coordination, and
adaptability]{.underline}. By contrast, [doctrines emphasizing
retaliatory punishment do not necessarily depend on a quick response,
though credibility may be more fundamental for deterrence]{.underline}.
Likewise, in peacetime, [the need to prioritize successful nuclear
operations would appear to be less than during a crisis or
war]{.underline}, while the threat of unauthorized use is also lower.
The key policy question is, under what circumstances, if any, is making
changes to the authority to launch nuclear weapons a good way to push
the balance toward "never?" [Several recent articles]{.underline} argue
that such circumstances were created with Trump's election. Whether
referring to the president explicitly or not, they all [express the fear
of an unstable or irrational actor launching a nuclear war. These
arguments for multiple authorization come in]{.underline} several
flavors. More [restrictive arguments aim to require the explicit
approval of]{.underline} other constitutional actors --- either [the
Supreme Court]{.underline} or a majority of a specially constituted
congressional committee --- or the uniformed military. [Less restrictive
arguments suggest that the president should be compelled to consult with
other civilian and military actors]{.underline}, time and circumstances
permitting, without actually giving them veto power. How Effective Are
Legal Restrictions [One problem with]{.underline} arguments like these
is that the most [[effective restrictions on]{.mark} an irrational
[president's nuclear authority]{.mark} are informal, not legal, and by
and large [already exist]{.mark}. In the case of a bolt-from-the-blue
peacetime attack, resistance from the armed forces]{.underline} ---
perhaps even vigorous resistance --- [can]{.underline} probably [be
expected]{.underline} regardless of the legal situation. Jeffrey Lewis
and Bruno Tertrais note that "[captains of US SSBNs]{.underline}
\[ballistic missile submarines\] are expected to [make communications
contact in the event of \[an\] unexpected launch]{.underline} order that
seems out of place or character," citing one former captain who is on
record saying "that, [in the event of a peacetime launch, he would
insist on confirmation and a justification]{.underline}." Similarly, at
the height of the Watergate scandal, when President Richard Nixon was
drinking heavily and talking bombastically about nuclear weapons,
Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger famously gave orders that
military commanders needed to double check with him or Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger before executing any order for a nuclear launch.
Personally, I think [a bolt-from-the-blue attack order is more likely to
precipitate a soft coup than it is actual nuclear use]{.underline}. In
such a case, the constitutional fallout is likely to be significant and
thus it ought to be the focus of our attention. At the same time,
[during a crisis or conventional war, legal requirements are not likely
to stop a determined president, rational or otherwise]{.underline}. For
instance, President Dwight [Eisenhower noted]{.underline} in public
that, [regardless of Congress' formal power to declare war, any
president who didn't act with alacrity to order a nuclear attack when
needed to protect the American people "should be hanged.]{.underline}"
He privately reassured members of Congress that "in the event of a real
emergency," he "would not come to Congress, but" would "go ahead" and
act on his own. Even when America was at peace, [Eisenhower circumvented
the legal restrictions of the Atomic Energy Act, which forbade sharing
custody of nuclear weapons]{.underline} with American allies. [He set up
a system where American controls over nuclear weapons in Europe were
extremely loose]{.underline}. As Eisenhower put it, "we are willing to
give, to all intents and purposes, control of the weapons. We retain
titular possession only." Congressional reports howled with outrage, but
the policy was not changed until a new administration decided to change
it. Eisenhower was an exceptional president in many ways, but not with
regard to legal restrictions and foreign policy. In any event,
[[requiring a president to consult]{.mark} with other
actors]{.underline} prior to launching a nuclear weapon, as envisioned
by less restrictive proposals, [will probably take place anyway in the
form of the chain of command pushing back during peacetime]{.underline},
as described above. [More restrictive proposals]{.underline} for
checking presidential nuclear authority [would need to be aimed at very
difficult, and rare, cases]{.underline}: situations where a determined
but irrational president wants to launch a nuclear strike and is
unsuccessfully opposed by military and perhaps other civilian
authorities, likely during a war or crisis. [The only way to stop
nuclear use under these circumstances is to require multiple
authorizations, with each party possessing an effective
veto]{.underline}. This is the kind of command arrangement that was
pursued by the Soviet Union during the Cold War and is still in place in
Russia today. Tilting Too Far Toward "Never" However, this leads to a
second problem, which is that [proposals for multiple authorizations
tilt the dial much too far toward "never" at the expense of "always."
The costs of]{.underline} [such an approach]{.underline} should not be
dismissed as fanciful, as there are many [signs that the world could be
[head]{.mark}ed [for **increased nuclear
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Keir Lieber and Daryl Press point
out that [technological change has made nuclear arsenals more
vulnerable]{.underline} than ever before. I argue that these technical
trends, along with [unstable beliefs about mutually assured destruction
and domestic hurdles to arms contro]{.underline}l, have
[**[heightened]{.mark} the global** [**risks** of peacetime nuclear
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [the]{.underline} 2018
[Nuclear Posture Review highlights]{.underline} the [increasing
emphasis]{.underline} that [American adversaries are placing on their
nuclear forces]{.underline}. Analysts like Brad Roberts have made
similar observations. Even [states with historically stable nuclear
force postures]{.underline}, like India, [are moving toward
counter-force competition. If these trends persist,
requiring]{.underline} multiple [levels of authorization could be
**costly during war and crises**]{.underline}, as well as peacetime.
[[In]{.mark} the event of a [war]{.mark}, the [time needed to
surmount]{.mark}]{.underline} a [congressional or Supreme Court
[veto]{.mark} could **[spell doom]{.mark} in instances where a [first
strike]{.mark} might be [justified]{.mark}**, such as an attempt to
preempt a North Korean nuclear force about to fire]{.underline}.
Moreover, [additional veto concerns of any sort make retaliatory
missions much more challenging, since they increase the demands on the
secure communications capabilities and continuity of government
procedures]{.underline} necessary to ride out an attack. During a
crisis, [[adding veto power]{.mark} beyond the president could
[encourage American adversaries to take]{.mark} more [nuclear
risks]{.mark} in the belief that Washington will have a relatively lower
risk tolerance]{.underline}. The [[result]{.mark} could be more nuclear
[crises with **worse outcomes**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the end, almost
the entire [value of nuclear weapons comes from]{.underline} the (at
least implicit) [threat to use them]{.underline}. Standing up before the
world and ostentatiously ma[king them more difficult to use during a
crisis sends exactly the wrong signal]{.underline}. A complex system
[requiring multiple authorizations could impose peacetime
costs]{.underline} as well. The experience of the Soviets is instructive
here. In the later part of the Cold War, [Soviet military officers and
civilian analysts alike were deeply pessimistic about the survivability
of the Soviet nuclear command system]{.underline}. In part, this was a
technical problem, but these worries were also caused by political
decisions about Soviet command and control, including the multiple
actors needed to authorize a launch. [The command system necessitated
buying heavily redundant nuclear forces and early warning
capabilities]{.underline} to compensate for decapitation risks. [It also
caused a ferocious civil-military upheaval, with the
General]{.underline} Staff of the Armed Forces of the U.S.S.R. [pressing
strongly for greater ability to launch on warning]{.underline}. Chief of
the General Staff Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov was eventually removed in
response, at least in part, to this controversy. Importantly, Soviet
command arrangements did not go unnoticed in Washington. [When the CIA
learned of the Soviet multiple authorization system]{.underline} in
1977, National Security Adviser Zbignew [Brzezinski]{.underline} flagged
the issue for President Jimmy Carter. Brzezinski [noted that a Soviet
decision to retaliate was not "the choice...of a single
individual]{.underline}." Instead, it was "probably a three-man
collegial decision." [Brzezinski concluded that]{.underline}
consequently "[it might be very difficult for the USSR to 'launch from
under attack']{.underline} unless the three men are kept constantly in
touch --- no separate vacations." The Carter administration's interest
in Soviet command and control was part of a broader learning process
[that indicated]{.underline} that [Soviet nuclear forces were much more
vulnerable]{.underline} than policymakers had initially anticipated. In
conjunction with other changes in the intelligence picture, [these
discoveries led to a **more aggressive American nuclear
posture**]{.underline} during Carter's last three years in office.
Domestic Considerations [A third problem with]{.underline} command and
control based on [multiple authorizations is its effects on domestic
politics]{.underline}. Though some analysts claim to use Trump only as a
foil to highlight structural risks that would exist in any
administration, one cannot help but notice that there was a conspicuous
dearth of interest in presidential control of nuclear weapons during the
Barack Obama years. Whatever one thinks of Trump, [it seems like a bad
idea to change long-standing defense structures in response to
displeasure with the current]{.underline} Oval Office
[occupant]{.underline}, however justified. [Such a move would set a
**bad precedent**, worsen political polarization, and be perceived as
highly partisan]{.underline}. Some would defend the motives behind
instituting a multiple authorization protocol as a reconstitution of
congressional authority in national security matters. Congress is, after
all, granted the sole power to declare war under Article I of the
Constitution. One would think that Obama's robust defense of
presidential prerogatives over the use of force and Congress' craven
abdication on most national security issues of significance would have
cured analysts of this particular anachronism. It has the air of special
pleading about it --- one doubts that any analysts calling to restore
congressional dignity are really prepared to embrace a thorough-going
originalist approach to the constitution, or even the kind of foreign
policy that a legislature could manage. There is much to be said against
the new understanding of [the constitution]{.underline} that arose,
largely without amendment, in the 20th century. But one of its great
virtues is that is has [provided a viable political order under modern
conditions, including a global foreign policy, as well as a massive
technological revolution]{.underline} in warfare. Together, these
[conditions increase the need for making speedy decisions about nuclear
war]{.underline} while making those decisions largely [immune to
legislative oversight]{.underline}. For good or for ill, both Congress
and the executive recognized this fact during the Cold War. Attempting
to close our eyes to it now seems unwise. The romantic in me would like
to enhance congressional authority in foreign policy, and much else
besides. The realist in me, however, has learned to stop worrying and to
love leviathan, who, as Hobbes promised us, at least provides the most
promising route to survival. Moreover, I would argue that [the president
is optimally situated to provide domestic legitimacy to nuclear
decision-making]{.underline}, insofar as such legitimacy is possible at
all. The president owes his authority to victory in a nation-wide
election, conducted according to the procedures mandated by the
Constitution. [No other elected official]{.underline} who might be
[included in the chain of command can claim]{.underline} as much, while
the mandate of civilian appointments like the secretary of defense or
the Supreme Court justices is even more tenuous. And, of course,
military officers have no [democratic mandate]{.underline} at all, their
many other virtues notwithstanding. [If democracy is to have the high
national value]{.underline} it is generally accorded, surely [decisions
of national survival should be made by the one office
elected]{.underline} by the majority of the entire nation. In the end,
nuclear weapons force policymakers to face uncomfortable truths. No sane
person wants to see these weapons used. But [[for America to]{.mark} be
able to [effectively deter]{.mark} its enemies, it [must be prepared to
use its arsenal]{.mark} in extreme circumstances and use it [with speed
and certainty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Eisenhower, again, put it best: In
nuclear operations, "[the United States would be applying a force so
terrible that one]{.underline} simply [could not be meticulous as to the
methods by which this force was brought]{.underline} to bear."
[America's national interests]{.underline} and, indeed, its survival,
[require a clear chain of command headed by the only individual who has
a democratic and constitutional claim]{.underline} to speak for the
entire nation: [the president]{.underline}. Even if that president is
Donald Trump.

Summary: [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its allies [will
face]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly [sophisticated and **dangerous
[weapons of catastrophic destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline} [due
to]{.underline} the [accelerating]{.underline} advance and dissemination
of [technology]{.underline}. [**[Nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} will **[play a key role in
[deter]{.mark}ring]{.underline}** [the use of [these weapons]{.mark} by
state or non-state opponents]{.underline} as long as the United States
continues credibly to threaten retaliation, to include nuclear usage, in
response to catastrophic strikes. A "**[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**o
**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se" posture
[[would be **incompatible**]{.mark} with an **effective
deterrent**]{.underline} of this kind, and the Commission should
consider stating so. Nuclear weapons will not, however, be sufficient to
deter catastrophic attacks. Instead, the Commission should consider
voicing support for the Administration's commendable but poorly
implemented policy of expanding deterrent threats to include those who
enable or support catastrophic attacks against us or our allies. Text:
[Accelerating advances across science and technology]{.underline}, to
include [in]{.underline} **[[computing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[nanotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**,
**[[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, [as well as in]{.underline}
the more **[[mature nuclear field]{.underline}]{.mark}**, combined with
our staggering advantages in conventional warfare, [make it a near
certainty that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark} in the
coming decades [face]{.mark} increasingly **powerful, sophisticated, and
[dangerous weapons]{.mark}**, tools, and systems]{.underline}. Though
traditional state rivals will likely be the principal wielders of these
new technologies, their dissemination outwards to marginal states and
downwards to non-state actors means that the U.S. will confront threats
from a variety of types and groupings of actors. While the parameters of
these new technologies are uncertain, we can be confident that they will
be not only tremendously powerful, disruptive, and damaging, but also
supremely elusive and cost-efficient. Non- and counter-proliferation
efforts will be a critical mitigant of these deleterious trends, but,
given that they are the necessary obverse of the benefits of new
innovation and that challenger powers will so clearly benefit from them,
they cannot be halted. They instead must be managed. U.S. nuclear
weapons should play a partial but central role in dealing with the rise
of these threats. **[[Our nuclear arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}** will do
so because, so long as it is maintained at a sufficient level of quality
and quantity and appropriately postured, it **[[constitutes]{.mark} a
decisive [asymmetric retaliatory capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} ipso facto [makes the use of any weapon of
catastrophic consequence]{.underline}, however novel, [against us or our
allies more costly than beneficial]{.underline}. Further, by ensuring
this decisive asymmetry they allow us and our allies the freedom not to
have to match (either with similar weapons or defensively) every advance
in weapons technology our opponents and rivals may make (though
maintenance of an edge in some fields is advisable and even necessary).
As with the NATO allies' effective decision not to match Warsaw Pact
capabilities after the failure of the Lisbon Treaty commitments and the
formal decision to forswear chemical and biological weapons in the face
of massive Soviet superiority (the latter clandestine) in those fields,
the U.S. and its allies in the 21st century can reliably invest in
maintaining an assured nuclear deterrent to render catastrophic acts of
destruction irrational as such rather than seeking symmetry in
armaments. This logic would counsel continuing to resist adopting a "no
first use" doctrine and perhaps even considering, as our opponents and
rivals begin to field disruptive new technologies, reminding them of our
willingness to respond to catastrophic aggression of any kind with the
tools most suited to our purposes. This would point towards restraining
and perhaps walking back what has, in light of overwhelming conventional
U.S. military superiority over the last two decades and an unusually
calm international scene, become an informal "no first use" policy. More
broadly, it would counsel shoring up the credibility of our threats to
respond asymmetrically as we deem appropriate, whether with nuclear
weapons or otherwise. This approach would have both direct deterrent as
well as dissuasive benefits. [[Opponents facing]{.mark} the real
prospect of **firm and potentially [severe
retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by the U.S. [will price the reality
of this]{.mark} American [commitment into their strategic
calculations]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus [rendering arms competitions
less likely.]{.underline}

### Cyber CP\-\--NFU Plank\-\--AT: De-Alert

#### De-alert fails and undermines crisis stability

Peter **Huessy 19** {Peter Huessy is Director of Strategic Deterrent
Studies at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and President of
his own defense consulting firm, GeoStrategic Analysis. 8-9-2019. "A
Dangerous Nuclear Agenda."
https://www.theepochtimes.com/a-dangerous-nuclear-agenda_3035909.html}//JM

Should America Take Its Missiles Off Alert? Now [another idea is to take
American land-based missiles "off alert"]{.underline} (like unplugging
an appliance) to lengthen the time between a crisis occurring, and when
the United States commanders can actually launch our ballistic missiles.
The idea is that in a crisis if the American President can't quickly
launch our land-based missiles, because the missiles are "unplugged" or
de-alerted, the extra time it takes to put America's missiles back on
alert will be exactly the time needed for the crisis to be defused.
(Since it takes only seconds to put a missile back on alert to be ready
to fire, such an assumption is ridiculous.) Now such ideas as
[[de-alerting]{.underline}]{.mark} has been proposed before. And such
ideas [have [always]{.mark} been [determined to be highly risky and
dangerous]{.mark}.]{.underline} [First]{.underline}, the
"**[[de-alerting]{.underline}]{.mark}**" or unplugging of America's
missiles [[is **not verifiable**]{.mark}. Even if all nuclear powers
de-alerted their missiles, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates or its
adversaries [could place their own missiles back on alert in a **matter
of seconds**]{.mark}]{.underline} and no one would be the wiser. We
would not want American leaders to assume that Russian missiles could
not be launched because they had been "de-alerted," because America's
guard might be down, and our inaction assumed to reflect passivity.
[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[lack of]{.mark} any [effective
verification]{.mark}]{.underline} for such "de-alerting action"
[[heightens uncertainty in a crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} For exampl[e,
in a crisis, [Russia might assume the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[would rush to put our missiles **back on alert**]{.mark}]{.underline}
to thus be able to launch them at Russia. But [Russia could not verify
whether our missiles were or were not on-alert and ready to launch or
"turned off."]{.underline} That [**uncertainty** [might]{.mark} easily
[pressure]{.mark} the Russian [national leadership
to]{.mark}]{.underline} decide it would be better to
**[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian missiles at the United States
[[as soon as possible]{.mark} in order [to "**get the first punch**
in]{.mark}."]{.underline} In short, given there is no way to verify
whether a U.S. missile is on-alert or not on-alert, or can or cannot be
launched, such uncertainty could easily lead a Russian leader to panic
and during a crisis, make a rash decision to launch Russian missiles at
America first. In doing so, the Russians would hope to destroy as many
of our fixed, silo-based land based missiles as possible, under the
assumption that even if the United States radars and early warning
satellites see the Russian missiles coming at our silos, the American
missiles will not have time to be put back in launch status because the
United States "de-alerted" its own missiles and thus literally the
[[American missiles]{.mark} will [remain]{.mark} "**[sitting
ducks]{.mark}**."]{.underline} So, in a crisis, because America will
assume to have de-alerted, the Russians might then to decide to "go
first" and launch its nuclear missiles and "hope for the best!" [Such a
"U.S. race to re-alert" is hardly reassuring.]{.underline}

asteroids, according to a NASA report\", Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/the-white-house-is-considering-plans-to-nuke-asteroids-2018-6?r=UK&IR=T

The US has an official strategy for dealing with Near-Earth Objects
(NEOs) that threaten the planet --- and yes, it involves nukes. You
might know them as \"asteroids\", or \"comets\", but rocks and balls of
ice and gas aren\'t the only objects that could potentially destroy a
chunk of life on Earth. There\'s more detail on what an NEO is in the
20-page report prepared for the White House to look at, along with
things like \"procedural actions\", \"international cooperation\" and
\"computational tools\". But for now, let\'s cut straight to Goal 3 ---
\"Develop Technologies for NEO Deflection and Disruption Missions\".
There are really only two options --- deflection and disruption.
\"Multiple technologies may be suitable for preventing NEO impacts that
are predicted well in advance,\" the report states. \"While [[disruption
via **nuclear explosive device**]{.underline} [may be the **only
feasible option for NEOs that are**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[very [large
or come with short warning time]{.mark}]{.underline}**.\"Here are the
technologies the White House is considering: Concepts for rapid response
NEO reconnaissance missions. Including \"mission concepts in which the
reconnaissance spacecraft could also carry out deflection or
disruption\". International launch vehicle infrastructure to support
planetary defense missions. Including \"processes for accomplishing
rapid response planetary defense space-lift\". Identify technologies
required to prevent NEO impacts. This is the one which includes
\"kinetic impactors, nuclear devices, and gravity tractors for
deflection, and nuclear devices for disruption\". Let\'s stop there, at
\"kinetic impactors, nuclear devices and gravity tractors\". A kinetic
impactor is simply smashing a spacecraft into the NEO in the hopes of
deflecting it. A nuclear device is obviously your straightforward,
\"call Bruce Willis\" case scenario. The gravity tractor is something
NASA is a couple of years away from testing. It performs a little bit
like this: \[graphic omitted\] Back in 2016, NASA announced its plan to
target the 400-metre wide asteroid 2008 EV5 in 2021 with the gravity
tractor technology. Another important part of its mission, which the NEO
white paper alludes to, is to grab a boulder off the surface of EV5:
\[graphic omitted\] Because if we\'re going to blow up asteroids, it\'s
important to know exactly what it\'s made of. Best of all, we might not
have to wait for a Armageddon-sized asteroid to threaten us before we
get to blow it up. The White House paper also makes sure to mention that
test runs on harmless NEOs are essential to make sure this type of
action will work. It will, obviously, cost billions. But what are the
chances of a decent ROI on all that spending and cooperation? For one,
the NEO white paper mentions that any asteroid exploration and material
testing can be done in partnerships with private industry, because
asteroids can potentially be worth trillions. Fortunately for private
industrialists, in 2015, US Congress passed the SPACE Act, giving US
space firms the rights to own and sell natural resources they mine from
bodies in space. But NASA has often referred to the fact there is \"no
record in modern times of any person being killed by a meteorite\" and
that even an asteroid 1.5 kilometres across only hits the Earth every
million or so years. \"In fact, as best as we can tell, no large object
is likely to strike the Earth any time in the next several hundred
years,\" it says. [Here are a couple of reasons why [the need for an
**official response playbook** has **escalated**]{.mark} in the past few
years]{.underline}. For starters, this is [the damage an object the size
of the Tunguska object could inflict on **New York**]{.underline}:
\[graphic omitted\] [The object that exploded over Tunguska]{.underline}
and destroying 2,000 square kilometres of forest [was]{.underline}
**[40]{.underline}**-60 **[metres across]{.underline}**. [[The asteroid
that exploded over Chelyabinsk]{.mark} in Russia **[with the power
of]{.mark} 20-[30 atomic bombs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, damaging 7,200
buildings and injuring 1,500 people, [[was **just 20 metres**]{.mark}
**across**]{.underline}. [[Here\'s the **rise in NEOs** we\'ve spotted
larger than 140 metres]{.mark} since US Congress directed NASA to really
start properly looking for them in 2005]{.underline}. **[We\'re up to
18,000 on just 3,500 since then:]{.underline}**

[[NASA estimates there are over **10 million NEOs larger than**]{.mark}
**the [Chelyabinsk]{.mark} asteroid**]{.underline}, [and **300,000
objects larger than 40 metres**]{.underline}, \"[[that]{.mark} could
pose an **impact hazard** and [would be **very challenging to detect
more than a few days in advance**]{.mark}]{.underline}\". [[The big
ones]{.underline}]{.mark} --- larger than one kilometre across --- are
those that **[have the potential to [severely disrupt life on Earth as
we know it.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[The **dinosaurs** found out the
**hard way**]{.mark} 65 million years ago when a 10-kilometre asteroid
hit the Yucatan peninsula]{.underline}. But NASA says it\'s found and
catalogued almost all of those, and none are on a collision course with
Earth. NASA\'s NEOWISE survey, for example, has been tracking, and
improved its ability to track, asteroids for four years now: That\'s
where the other half of the report is focused --- on improving tracking
methods, data processing and processes for identifying hazardous
asteroids and the best way to deal with them. [Because]{.underline}
[while we are close]{.underline} to 100% certain that no
extinction-level asteroids we\'ve spotted are on a collision course with
Earth, **[[we\'re not 100% sure we\'ve spotted all]{.mark} the
[extinction-level asteroids]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [As the NEO report
**admits**, there is some chance that \"**large comets** from the outer

• CBMs in the Security Sector

In the security sector, CBMs in inter-state conflicts can be
differentiated from CBMs in intra-state conflicts. [Classical military
[CBMs]{.mark} focus on avoiding escalation triggered by a
misunderstanding of signals]{.underline},16 In a highly hostile
atmosphere, any behaviour of the other side is generally interpreted as
being hostile, rather than as being a deterrent. [The
[aim]{.mark}]{.underline} of these kinds of CBMs [is [to clarify]{.mark}
the difference between an intended aggressive [behaviour]{.mark} and the
background noise of normal military activities]{.underline}, in order
[[to avoid]{.mark} unintended [escalation. Examples include]{.mark}
**communication [hotlines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, exchange of military
maps, joint training programmes, information on troop movements,
exchange of military personnel, establishment of a demilitarized zone,
border tension reduction through joint patrolling, or no fly zones.17

In the context of peace processes between a government and an armed
non-state actor, security issues can be dealt with simpty as technical
questions, or they can be used in a CBM logic to build trust and a
working relationship between former adversaries. Joint monitoring teams,
for example, have a specific security goal as they verify ceasefire
violations. At the same time, security personnel from both sides of the
divide work together and can thereby build trust. From a mediator\'s
point of view, joint monitoring teams, as well as other security
arrangements, should not be seen as only increasing security. They have
significant potential to create trust and help parties develop a working
relationship across the conflict cleavage. Designed and used in a \"CBM
logic\", they can have positive spillover effects into the political
sector10 (see Box 4 on how the Joint Military Commission helped to
create trust between the parties in the Nuba Mountains).

• Economic and environmental CBMs

Economic and environmental CBMs focus on joint economic endeavours or
activities dealing with natural resource management and environmental
challenges. Opening trade routes can help to ease tensions and benefit
both actors. Co-operation over economic issues can often be a first step
in collaborating across conflict lines. In Somalia, for example, actors
from different clans and ideological inclinations are often very
pragmatic about working together when it comes to doing business, for
example trading in livestock across conflict lines. These
economically-motivated collaborations can be seen as CBMs that could
provide the building blocks for a bottom-up approach to a more
comprehensive peace process. Other examples of economic CBMs include
agreements to allow actors from different groups to access markets
safely (for example, in the Kenya border area); agreements to open trade
routes (for example, for pastoralists to access water points, or opening
international transport routes to facilitate trade); joint economic
development projects (such as the Korean Kaesong industrial region, or
ideas for international pipelines); joint preparation against natural
disasters; or peace parks (for example, in Southern Africa).20

• Social, humanitarian and cultural CBMs

Some of the very first CBMs used, even before negotiations begin, are
typically humanitarian CBMs. If parties agree on some basic humanitarian
principles, not using anti-personnel mines for example, they signal
commitment to international norms and possibly their preparedness to
also try political means to reach their goals. Such CBMs help the
affected population, but also provide conflict parties with the fresh
start that is needed if they seek to try negotiations. Through such
CBMs, they can signal to the other side an intention to change the
status quo, A prisoner exchange is another typical humanitarian CBM (for
example, the Gilad Shalit Fall 2011 exchange between Israel-Palestine,
even if the trust-building goal did not seem to be the main or only
motivation). Humanitarian ceasefires, that often include CBMs, can
indicate the readiness of both sides to test an alternative approach
(see Box 4). The negotiations surrounding such CBMs also help prepare
the parties for future political negotiations, as negotiators pick up
the necessary skills and know-how when negotiating the CBMs. Some of the
Southern Sudanese actors involved in negotiating the Operation Lifeline
Sudan in 1989 gained negotiation expertise that proved very helpful
later on in the Sudan North South CPA negotiations.22

Social CBMs can include the release of information on missing persons
(for example, in Bosnia Herzegovina), or allowing family visits (see box
3 for the Western Sahara example and box 8 when it comes to North-South
Korea). Joint cultural events or student exchange programmes are other
opportunities that can be used at all levels of society to humanize the
other and build relationships. Joint sports activities have also been
used in numerous cases to ease frozen relations and pave the way for
negotiations (for example, between China and the U.S., see Box 5),
Agreements which allow minorities to have rights to their religion and
language can also be used as CBMs. even if they often go further than
normal CBMs in terms of addressing the root causes of a conflict. In the
implementation phase, joint language and educational projects may help
to create trust throughout the wider society.

Links between sectors: The links between sectors, and how CBMs in one
sector relate to other sectors, is one of the most vital aspects for
mediators to be aware of and consider. Synergies and traction can be
created through these links. At the same time, links between the sectors
have to be clarified to avoid doing any harm. Links can also be
developed by cross-matching activities and actors. Examples would be to
have military actors involved in economic activities or businessmen
involved in security CBMs,23 Lists of CBMs are useful in showing how
creative and diverse CBMs can be, but care is needed so as not to
suggest that ideas can be copied and used on any given conflict.
Template solutions and CBMs that are not developed with the parties will
not tit the given case, not be owned by the parties, and will not build
trust. Since a mediator is the hub that connects the various topics and
experts in the peace process, he or she is responsible for making sure
the links between the different CBMs are used well. Clustering different
types of CBMs and learning from other cases can be useful to develop
ideas, but in the end it is vital that mediators design CBMs with the
parties to ensure they are tailored to the specific conflict.

3.6 When should CBMs be used?

CBMs can be used in all phases of a peace process, but their nature and
function changes if they are used before, during or after peace
negotiations.

Many processes today are more complex than the classical, linear phase
model of peace negotiations (informal talks, pre-negotiations,
negotiations and implementation) with dffferent actors being involved in
different phases that take place at the same time. Nevertheless, the
phases still give some orientation as to when to use CBMs:

• Before a peace process begins and during pre-negotiations

Even before a peace process begins, CBMs can be envisioned without
necessarily focusing on using them to initiate a negotiation process.
They can simply aim to build bridges between conflicting parties and
minimize the damage of the conflict, even if the parties are not
considering negotiations. In this early

phase, CBMs are likely to be non-binding, social and humanitarian, but
could possibly also include partial steps in the security field (such as
a non-binding cessation of hostilities to allow a market to happen or to
allow a celebration to occur). It is hard for any conflict actor to
disagree with minimal humanitarian principles and actions and this is
the reason why simple humanitarian agreements can often be a starting
point (for example, not using anti-personnel mines). Economic CBMs (such
as allowing access to the market place in Wajir. Kenya), which build on
an economic rationale, can also be useful. In the \"pre-negotiation\"
phase, parties are starting to consider negotiations more seriously as a
credible strategy to solve their conflicts, even if it is not yet clear
how. when and under which mediation framework this will happen. In
addition to humanitarian and economic CBMs, the importance of political
and security CBMs increases in this phase. The aim is for the parties to
signal to each other their intention of testing negotiations and to show
a certain degree of goodwill to try and enter the negotiation process.

• During negotiations

During the negotiation phase, CBMs that increasingly address aspects of
the conflict can help to push the process forward. Depending on the
nature of the conflict and design of the meoSation process, CBMs will
play a different role. In some cases, parties can agree to key
fundamental principles in a very general manner at the outset of a
negotiation process, before the \"sticky\' details are negotiated.
Through the initial agreement on principles, some trust is created. In
this scenario, CBMs may still be used and may be important but they are
not the only, or main, way to build trust. The Sudan North-South process
between 2002 and 2005 successfully used CBMs to \"humanize\" the
negotiators and push the process forward, even if there was an agreement
earty on about some of the key principles (see Box 6).

In other processes, which do not have such an initial framework
agreement on basic principles, trust will be built more incrementally
and they will thus rely more heavily on CBMs, In the incremental
approach, a series of agreements are used to slowly tackle the more
difficult core issues later on. In this approach, CBMs are used as
stepping stones to create traction,-5 Agreements on CBMs early on help
to build trust and interest in negotiating more complex agreements at a
later stage. In this sense, CBMs represent opportunities for parties to
collaborate on something that is not strategically important to them
and, in so doing, build the trust needed to subsequently address the
strategic issues. CBMs pull parties away from the obstacle they are
blocked on. the rock they can\'t get off the road. Once there is
confidence, it is then easier to later address this obstacle,1\* The
metaphor of steps in the ladder also highlights the incremental nature
of building trust which takes time and an accumulation of small steps.
This is the reason why some practitioners speak about a confidence
building process,-7 Once a first set of CBM has been established, more
comprehensive undertakings can be developed. The peace process between
Israel and Jordan illustrates the incremental use of CBMs (see Box 7).

• During the implementation

During the implementation phase, CBMs can also be useful to maintain and
increase the level of trust. In addition to external guarantees,
external force and clear implementation modalities, this trust is vital
to implementing and reinforcing peace agreements. CBMs among the wider
public are important as benefits from the peace agreement affecting the
broader community may not be tangible immediately, CBMs that deliver
something tangible to the parties can help the constituencies live with
the consequences of a peace agreement.

As the peace process develops, the nature of CBMs generally moves from
non-binding, to politically-binding and sometimes even to
legally-binding. In a similar manner, unilateral signals of good
intention should develop into reciprocal CBMs that are balanced between
the parties.

3.7 Challenges and options

Five [challenges need to be considered when planning to use
CBMs]{.underline} in a peace process.

• [Challenge 1: Avoid using CBMs when lack of trust is not a core
problem]{.underline}

Mediators are often confronted with at least three major obstacles in
their work: the parties lack trust between each other and in the
mediation process; the parties lack the political will to change the
status quo31; and the parties lack a common understanding of the
conflict and how to address it.32 These three obstacles are strongly
interdependent; for example, trust tends to increase the better the
actors understand each other. At the same time, the greater the trust,
the easier it is to listen and develop common understanding. An actor\'s
will to change the situation can also develop hand-in-hand with an
increase in trust and common understanding. Nevertheless, these three
obstacles are also distinct from each other. In some conflicts, there is
common understanding and even trust, but no political will to change the
status quo. The UN-led peace talks on Cyprus seem partially to
illustrate this dynamic, even if this dynamic was also greatly
influenced by the incentives set by the European Union (Greek EU
membership without agreement on Cyprus).33 In other cases CBMs can help
to ease tensions and pave the way for negotiations (such as the U.S. -
China rapprochement in the 1960s outlined in Box 5 or the Nuba Mountain
Ceasefire Agreement outlined in Box 4).

This differentiation is important, because it only makes sense to use
CBMs in cases where lack of trust is a key factor in hindering
negotiations. [In cases [where]{.mark} trust exists, but [there is lack
of]{.mark} common [understanding]{.mark} (which also includes factual
knowledge, for example on technical issues) or will, [CBMs are
**not**]{.mark} **the [right]{.mark} tool**]{.underline}. In such cases
techniques such as capacity-building workshops, dialogue workshops
seeking to clarify misunderstandings related to different perceptions,
bringing in experts with technical expertise and bringing in moral
authorities to discuss values that shape the will to change the status
quo, may be more appropriate.

One way to deal with this challenge, is to assess how far lack of trust,
lack of will and lack of common understanding are hindering the process,
and then to design appropriate measures.

• Challenge 2: [Take care that CBMs are not used as a **stalling or
cover-up tactic**]{.underline}

Another aspect to assess when considering CBMs is the possibility that
[[parties]{.mark} will [use CBMs as a **stalling tactic**]{.mark} and as
an **excuse** for not negotiating. CBMs can be used by parties to signal
to the international community or their constituencies that \"they are
doing something\'\' even if, in reality, [they have **no intention**
of]{.mark} changing the status quo or **[listening]{.mark}** to the
other side. In this way, parties can jeopardize the very idea of CBMs -
to build trust - if they only use them as a cover up for stalling. CBMs
can]{.underline} also [be used to **deflect** or **postpone**
negotiations on more significant issues]{.underline}.34 In some cases,
it seems [CBMs were used to play for time]{.underline}, while in fact a
military strategy to solve the conflict was pursued. For example, in the
Ivory Coast in 2005, a so-called \"Confidence Zone\' had been
established that ran across the country to separate the rebel-held north
and the government-held south. The zone should have provided for basic
security of ordinary citizens living in the zone. Over time the
situation deteriorated and gave rise to citizens\' feeling of
insecurity, rather than increased confidence,35 In other cases, the
actual negotiations of the CBMs took so long, that it stole away time
for negotiating more substantive issues. For example, on numerous
occasions in the Cyprus peace process this seemed to be the case, even
if one can also argue that the parties may not have wanted to address
the substantive issues and so working on CBMs was better than doing
nothing.36

A mediator's main option in dealing with this challenge is to clarify
the motivations of the parties for using CBMs, whether bilaterally with
the parties or together in plenary meetings.

• Challenge 3: [Be aware of \"overly successful\" CBMs that can
**distract** from real negotiations]{.underline}

Yet another consideration when thinking of using CBMs is to assess
whether they will distract from negotiations because they are too
successful. [[CBMs address **symptoms**]{.mark} of the conflict, [rather
than]{.mark} the **[root causes]{.mark}**. If CBMs are overly
successful, [they]{.mark} may **[take]{.mark} the [pressure
away]{.mark}** from the parties [to address]{.mark} the [key
issues]{.mark} and they may no longer have an incentive to
negotiate]{.underline}. In this case, mediators will seek enough
successful CBMs to initiate negotiations or move the negotiations on the
root causes forward, while avoiding so many CBMs that they can be
misused for strong public relations purposes by the parties or they
limit the negotiation process only to CBMs. Both having too many CBMs
and only focusing on CBMs may take the pressure off the negotiations on
substantive issues. Enough [dissatisfaction]{.underline} with the status
quo [is needed to negotiate an agreement]{.underline}. Discussing this
dilemma with the parties may be useful to assess the balance needed.

• Challenge 4: [Watch out for **[unilateral]{.mark}**, asymmetric and
\"false\" [CBMs]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In some cases, it might be easier for the mediator to ask one of the
parties to commence with a unilateral CBM to which the other party can
respond in a positive manner. However, there is a risk that, in such a
unilateral approach, one of the parties might lose face or might claim
victory over the other side. In the Korean peninsula. South Korea
[felt]{.mark} the CBMs were [not]{.mark} being sufficiently
**[reciprocated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially from 2008 onwards
(see Box 8). [Premature concessions that are not reciprocated can
**[increase mistrust]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3\*1 In cases where power
asymmetry is significant, the more powerful actors can sometimes
initiate a change in relationship through a unilateral CBM, and due to
their relative power, not risk very much. Thus, in situations where it
is the only way to break the deadlock, the mediator might (with the
tacit agreement of all parties involved) ask one of the parties to make
a unilateral gesture.

In most cases, however, CBMs are most effective if they are designed in
a \"symmetric manner\", whereby all the parties agree to, and implement,
a joint CBM at the same time. However, [even symmetrical CBMs can lead
to asymmetrical impacts, where generally the weaker party is
disadvantaged]{.underline}. \"False\" CBMs are built to look like CBMs
but only affect one side instead of both, or all, sides. Even if
mediators seek to design balanced CBMs, they may end up as false CBMs,
and mediators will end up being perceived as biased. Truly symmetric
CBMs should have symmetric impacts, which make it impossible for any one
side to either lose face or claim victory. This approach will also help
the mediator to preserve impartiality as none of the parties is being
seen as responding to a demand of the mediator.

For these reasons, mediators need to carefully plan and discuss the CBMs
with the involved parties, and assess their impact on the ground. The
timing and degree of commitment needed for the CBMs to work has to be
negotiated with the parties.\*\' Equality is a key principle in the
design of CBMs. However, if equal CBMs lead to unequal impacts, CBMs
must be designed in such a way that more is demanded from the party
claiming superiority.41 As mediators take care of the process, and
parties of the content, the final responsibility and decision on what
type of CBMs will be chosen rests with the parties. Mediators can bring
in experts and comparative experiences from other cases but, in the end.
the parties need to decide how far they want to go and what risks they
are willing to take.

• Challenge 5: [[Avoid **unrealistic**]{.mark}, fuzzy, non-verifiable
and [**non-implementable** CBMs]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Agreements]{.mark} on CBMs often **[lack]{.mark} sufficient
[details]{.mark}** [on **how**]{.mark} they will be implemented and
[measured]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 [The danger of [CBMs]{.mark} that are
[**not clear** and **not verifiable**]{.mark} is that they are not
implemented, or that they are asymmetrically implemented. This can [lead
to **greater distrust**]{.mark} than before]{.underline}. This is why
CBMs need clarity on their implementation, including verification
mechanisms such as implementation reviews or Joint Commissions. A modest
CBM that has clear implementation modalities is preferable to ambitious
CBMs that are unclear in terms of how they will be implemented,
verification mechanisms can be integrated into the CBMs to help the
parties measure and report on the implementation. These verification
mechanisms ideally involve the parties as well as some acceptable third
party.43

#### Compliance will be [selective]{.underline}

Moonis **Ahmar 1**, Scholar of International Relations and Conflict
Resolution from Pakistan, 2001, "Changing Relevance of Non-Military CBMs
in South Asia," 331, "The Challenge of Confidence-Building in South
Asia,"

The differing working results of CBMs in both cases raises a critical
question: why are they more effective in one case than another? The
answer lies in the analysis of different conflict situation, perception
of the leaders and their overall priorities. [First, [there is a problem
of **commitment**. CBMs are seen as]{.mark} a political arrangement that
does **[not]{.mark} entail legal [binding]{.mark}** or commitment. Thus,
the contracting [parties have **selective compliance**]{.mark} to CBMs
and use them according to their needs.]{.underline} This argument is
more relevant to Pakistan. [Second, [conflict
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} in the India- Pakistan case
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[complex]{.underline}]{.mark} than the
India-China case. [[This **undermines**]{.mark} **the
[effectiveness]{.mark}** of CBMs. Third, when]{.underline} the
[contacting parties, mostly the weaker ones, perceive CBMs as a peaceful
way to dilute their original conflict goal, they seek to undermine the
agreed CBMs]{.underline}. Many India-Pakistan CBMs have become redundant
or dysfunctional because of this perception held by the latter. [Fourth,
coupled with it is the feeling of one or both parties that [CBMs]{.mark}
are the ways to avoid or [postpone]{.mark} finding [a solution]{.mark}
to their problem.]{.underline} This is more widespread in the minds of
Pakistan; even India had the same feeling vis-à-vis China. [Fifth,
destabilizing vicissitudes of domestic politics often curtail the
prospects of success of CBMs]{.underline}. This is demonstrated more in
the India-Pakistan case than in the India-China case. [Finally, CBMs
fail because the states of the [contracting parties **remain
suspicious**]{.mark} of each other as they refuse to have mutual trust;
at the same time, developing mutual understanding between their peoples
is highly undesirable for them. In most cases]{.underline}, non-military
[[CBMs]{.mark} suffer or [**fail** because of]{.mark} this sort of
[politically motivated fixation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Hotlines CP\-\--China\-\--1AR

#### China will [never]{.underline} use hotlines, especially in a crisis

[It would be **extremely regrettable** if the MOUs regarding [CBMs were
**one-way** documents]{.mark} that limited the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[without]{.mark} ensuring [Chinese
participation. **Beijing declines**]{.mark} many [opportunities to
communicate]{.mark} during a crisis and reduce risk that Washington
suggests. For example, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will immediately accept a call from anyone in
China's chain of command at any time; Chinese defense officials will
**not take an immediate call**]{.underline}.17 [[Even though]{.mark}
China is [given 48 hours]{.mark} to take a call, **[there is]{.mark} no
public [ev]{.mark}idence that the [DTL has]{.mark} actually [ever been
used]{.mark}** during a crisis. [Before]{.mark} introducing **[new
dialogues]{.mark}**, the [two]{.mark}]{.underline} sides [[need to make
sure]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[existing
**mech**]{.mark}anism**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} for communication [can
[withstand a crisis]{.mark}---currently]{.underline} an
**[[unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** prospect. When the Countering
America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act went into effect in 2018,
for example, China recalled Admiral Shen Jinlong from the International
Seapower Symposium, withdrew General Wei Fenghe from the Diplomatic and
Security Dialogue, canceled the Joint Staff Dialogue Mechanism (the
premier communications path between the two countries' joint staffs),
and canceled the Ronald Reagan Carrier Strike Group's visit to Hong
Kong. While China later reversed two of these decisions, [the situation
reflected [a **decades-old problem**: when tensions
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is precisely the most important time to
talk, [[Beijing **cuts comm**]{.mark}**unication[s]{.mark}**[. And
when]{.mark} China is [willing]{.mark} to communicate, [it
**shuns**]{.mark} **the [hotline]{.mark}**]{.underline} that the two
sides labored to establish [[in favor of]{.mark} going through
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} Defense Attaché Office at the U.S.
[[Embassy]{.underline}]{.mark} in Beijing.

### Orbital-Use Fees CP\-\--2AC

#### OUF won't [solve]{.underline}\-\--does not [remove]{.underline} existing debris, fails to [deter]{.underline} collisions, AND would [need]{.underline} to be [global]{.underline} which is [impossible]{.underline}\-\--only the AFF can [solve]{.underline}.

Ruth **Stilwell 20**. Senior Non-Resident Scholar at the Space Policy
Institute of George Washington University and Adjunct Professor at
Norwich University. "The Space Review: Orbital use fees won't solve the
space debris problem." The Space Review. 6-22-2020.
https://www.thespacereview.com/article/3971/1 //EM

[When it comes to]{.underline} space [debris]{.underline}, the numbers
are repeated often: more than 21,000 objects ten centimeters across or
larger, approximately half a million objects between one and ten
centimeters in diameter. Across the space community, [there is **general
agreement**]{.underline} [that space debris]{.underline} [is an
existing]{.underline}, and [**worsening**, problem]{.underline}. Many
point to the free and open access to space, while others argue that
proposed "mega-constellations" will take low Earth orbit to the breaking
point. In response, [some argue that]{.underline} economic
**[disincentives]{.underline}**, [like **orbit fees**]{.underline} or
taxes, [could be used to **reduce demand**]{.underline} [by increasing
the cost]{.underline} of a satellite in orbit. Some argue that
additional satellites create additional debris risk solely based on the
increase in the satellite population. But is this the problem we are
trying to solve?

[The **principal sources**]{.underline} [of orbital]{.underline}
[debris]{.underline} [are **satellite explosions**]{.underline} and
**[collisions]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline} **[intentional
destruction]{.underline}**.

[The problem of]{.underline} space [debris]{.underline} and congestion
[is not one of **operational**]{.underline} [satellites]{.underline},
[but rather]{.underline} one created by [**non-maneuverable**
debris.]{.underline} **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[s]{.underline}**ituational **[a]{.underline}**wareness [and
conjunction]{.underline} **[alerting systems]{.underline}** [seek to
**prevent collisions**]{.underline} [by maneuverable]{.underline}
[objects]{.underline}, [further **reducing**]{.underline} [the
risk]{.underline} they impose. [It is not the]{.underline} [operational
satellite]{.underline}, [but the behaviors]{.underline} [associated
with]{.underline} [**putting the satellite** in orbit]{.underline} [and
**removing** it at end of life]{.underline}, [that
**increases**]{.underline} the [debris]{.underline} risk.

In developing appropriate mitigation strategies for orbital debris, it
is imperative to consider the primary causes of orbital debris and
develop approaches that address those causes. The principal sources of
orbital debris are satellite explosions and collisions, including
intentional destruction. High-risk orbital behaviors are well known: old
launch vehicle upper stages left in orbit with residual propellants and
high-pressure fluids, defunct satellites that are not deorbited, and
anti-satellite weapons testing. These are the primary contributors to
orbital debris and should be the focus of debris mitigation strategies.

State, commercial, and non-government users of space have a shared
interest in creating the long-term sustainability of space operations,
and global progress requires international agreement. [Proposers for an
orbital use tax]{.underline} **[mention]{.underline}** [that it would
need to be **globally harmonized**]{.underline} [but **fail** to
recognize the]{.underline} [**difficulty** in reaching]{.underline}
[such an agreement]{.underline}---[if such an agreement]{.underline} [is
**even possible**]{.underline}. [The recent collapse]{.underline} [of
the **OPEC pact**]{.underline} and the subsequent oil price war
[illustrates]{.underline} [the **fragility** of]{.underline}
[international]{.underline} economic [collaboration]{.underline}. By
contrast, international agreements on standards and regulation for
international operators, as we see in the maritime and aviation
industries, tend to endure. It is important to recognize that diplomatic
resources are limited and efforts to reach international agreement
should focus on areas that can provide the most benefit and have the
greatest chance for success.

[An orbital use tax]{.underline} [would put an **additional financial
penalty**]{.underline} [on the user]{.underline} [that]{.underline} is
able to **[prevent]{.underline}** [the collision]{.underline} risk [but
**do nothing to change**]{.underline} [the behavior that]{.underline}
[created]{.underline} [the collision]{.underline} risk.

For the long-term sustainability of space, the answer is not to make
space more expensive to use, but rather to ask the users, both civilian
and military, to be responsible to the goal of sustainable use. This
requires a focus in three critical areas: collision avoidance, limiting
debris-generating behaviors, and debris removal. As we ask the space
community to be more responsible, it is important to define what that
means. [As **illustrated** by recent]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite [missile
tests]{.underline}, the community can be alarmed, [but we are
functionally]{.underline} [**unable to hold** each other]{.underline}
[to **standards**]{.underline} of behavior if those standards do not
exist. Efforts at international agreement should be focused on reaching
agreement in these areas if we are to have a sustainable and accountable
orbital domain.

#### Widespread [SSA]{.underline} abilities are a [pre-requisite]{.underline} to solving debris\-\--we can't [stop collisions]{.underline}!

Jason **Forshaw et al., 20** (Jason Forshaw, Mike Lindsay, Charity
Weeden, John Auburn, Chris Blackerby, 9-18-2020, accessedon 6-23-2022,
Advanced Maui Optical and Space Surveillance Technologies Conference,
"An Exploration of Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Needs for Active
Debris Removal ADR) Operators",
https://amostech.com/TechnicalPapers/2020/Poster/Forshaw.pdf, HBisevac)

Comprehensive Space Situational Awareness ([SSA]{.underline}) [data
allows users to accurately interpret and characterize the activity of
satellites]{.underline}, [improving operational safety and reducing the
risk of collisions by increasing ability to
recognize **abnormal**]{.underline} or off-nominal
**[behavior]{.underline}**. In the years since its origin, there have
been increasing use cases for SSA, such as asset investment protection,
insurance claims, and safety of flight. Now with the advent of new
In-orbit Servicing (IOS) missions such as Active Debris Removal (ADR),
SSA becomes an important part of operational services. 

Astroscale is one of the few companies in the world proposing to aid in
the removal of orbital debris through the provision of the following
in-orbit services: end-of-life (EOL) targeting the LEO constellations,
ADR targeting existing larger space debris, and life-extension targeting
GEO satellites. As we grow our business, develop our capabilities, and
become closer to fully operational services, Astroscale is developing a
clearer understanding of SSA needs for its future ADR missions. This
paper aims to address those specialized needs, understanding the key
technical drivers. 

2\. SSA NEEDS FOR ADR 

In a classical ADR mission, we have a **[servicer]{.underline}** ([the
satellite doing the removal]{.underline}) [and a **client**]{.underline}
([the asset in space being removed]{.underline}). We will be using this
terminology throughout the paper. 

We break down our SSA needs into 5 categories: 

\(1\) Pre-launch Assessment 

[Important data can be provided by SSA even before a servicer is
launched]{.underline}, [such as **client position**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}, in some cases, [**client attitude** and **tumbling
rate**]{.underline}. ADR services in future will have inherent fixed
tumbling rate servicing limits -- if a client tumbling rate is too high,
then a client may be unserviceable to begin with. [Such
information **needs** to be ascertained **before** a **service
commences**]{.underline}, otherwise this places risk on the ADR provider
if they launch a servicer only to find that they can't perform the
intended removal. 

\(2\) Search and Approach 

[SSA is **mandatory** for **future search** and **approach
maneuvers**]{.underline}. Generally, [the client is defunct]{.underline}
and the satellite has failed in a way such that it needs removal. [In
this case]{.underline}, [absolute positioning systems
on-board]{.underline} e.g. GPS [are not functional and]{.underline} thus
[the client's position can **only be known** through use of **SSA
services**]{.underline}. One of the [first steps in a servicer
rendezvousing]{.underline} with a client [is]{.underline} the "[search
and approach]{.underline}" phase (see CONOPS section below)
[which]{.underline} thus [**requires use** of an SSA
service]{.underline}. 

\(3\) Failure Analysis 

SSA services can provide some form of failure analysis capability to
analyze the conditions surrounding the  failure of the client. For
example, if the client is tumbling in a specific way, or has unusual
trajectory motion,  this might indicate a GNC or propulsion failure.
Understanding such information before rendezvous, could be  very
valuable to the ADR service provider.  

\(4\) Collision Analysis and CAM Alerts 

CAM (Collision Avoidance Maneuver) alerts are a core stable of
[conventional SSA]{.underline} provision and are [also needed in **ADR
missions**]{.underline}. The [servicer must be able to move out of the
way]{.underline} of other satellites, or trackable debris.  However,
depending on the accuracy of the SSA data, [SSA providers]{.underline}
may be able to [provide **independent tracking** to]{.underline} help
[prevent **collisions** during **R**endezvous and **P**roximity
**O**perations]{.underline} (RPO). 

\(5\) Independent Monitoring for Ensuring Transparency 

Finally, regarding safety and security, SSA can provide independent
monitoring for ensuring transparency for any regulatory and potential
insurance compliance. In particular, tracking of the servicer during the
course of the mission can provide confidence that no malicious behavior
is being undertaken. 

It is to be noted that [the needs for SSA for ADR]{.underline} do differ
than the broader [needs]{.underline} of SSA for [**mass observation**
of satellites]{.underline}. In a conventional SSA scenario (e.g.
government operational intelligence, general tracking of debris),
SSA providers scan for, or track, a very large database of objects. SSA
for ADR differs in that, specifically for Needs #1 to #3, ADR customers
are looking for specific tracking of just 2 entities -- the servicer and
the client. Thus, high-quality data on 2 objects is far more valuable
than low quality data on a very large number of objects. 

### Russian Arms Control CP\-\--2AC

#### Russia says [no]{.underline}\-\--they have [strategic incentives]{.underline} to avoid [caving-in]{.underline}.

Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. "Russia's
Anti-Satellite Weapons: An Asymmetric Response to U.S. Aerospace
Superiority." ArmsControl. 3-7-2018.

//EM

Notwithstanding these assessments, [most Russian **analysts** display a
**severe fear**]{.underline} [of U.S]{.underline}. [and
allied]{.underline} technological [superiority]{.underline}. [Although
these fears may **reflect**]{.underline} [an extreme **worst-case**
scenario,]{.underline} many Russian military analysts share them.
Therefore, [they argue]{.underline}, [the **dependence** of
U.S.]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[NATO forces]{.underline}** [on
**space-based** assets]{.underline} [is a **vulnerability**]{.underline}
[of which Russia **cannot fail to take advantage**]{.underline} in a
crisis. [Russian military commentators]{.underline} [claim
**ASAT**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other [counterspace
weapons]{.underline} [will **deter aggression**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [offer]{.underline} war-fighting
**[advantages]{.underline}** [if deterrence fails.]{.underline}26

[These Russian]{.underline} **[motivations]{.underline}** [pose
**profound challenges**]{.underline} [to pursuing lasting]{.underline}
space [**arms control** measures]{.underline}. Several proposed
nonbinding behavioral norms may stall the testing of ASAT weapons for
the near term. For instance, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen
Hicks recently argued for a global ban on ASAT tests that create
debris.27 These norms can be diplomatically pursued through multilateral
dialogues, including at the UN. Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State
Antony Blinken reiterated a U.S. desire to develop informal norms to
standardize acceptable behavior in space operations. In a speech at the
UN Conference on Disarmament, he said the United States wants to engage
in "developing standards and norms of responsible behavior in outer
space."28 He further noted, "\[W\]e should be reducing tensions in outer
space, not making them worse."29

Such diplomatic engagements would provide the United States and its NATO
allies with some transparency into Russia's ASAT and counterspace
programs and motivations. Similarly, Russia would gain transparency into
U.S. and NATO programs and concerns. Diplomatic engagements can also
help communicate redlines and establish a shared understanding of
pathways that could lead to conflict escalation in space.30

[In the end]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [there are **limits**
to what dialogue]{.underline} and voluntary [behavioral **norms** can
**accomplish**]{.underline}. Without mutual restrictions on aerospace
weapons and combat operations, Russians will continue to argue that U.S.
and NATO forces retain a significant war-fighting superiority that can
be offset only with counterspace systems. Addressing Russia's perceived
vulnerabilities to modern aerospace campaigns will require deeper
engagement and structured arms control, possibly with an instrument
similar to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. [Such
**binding**]{.underline} [agreements are a **difficult
proposition**]{.underline} [in the **prevailing**]{.underline}
geopolitical [environment]{.underline}, but they are essential to
achieve comprehensive space security and strategic stability.

### Solar Shield CP\-\--2AC

The [innovation of Solar Shield is its ability to deliver
**transformer-level predictions**]{.underline}. Pulkkinen explains how
it works:

\"[Solar Shield springs into **action** when we see a **c**oronal

[While]{.underline} the [CME]{.underline} is [**crossing** the sun-Earth
divide]{.underline}, a trip that typically takes 24 to 48 hours, the
[Solar Shield team prepares to **calculate ground
currents**]{.underline}. \"We work at Goddard\'s Community Coordinated

place [where leading researchers]{.underline} from around the world have

moment]{.underline} comes about 30 minutes before impact when the [cloud
sweeps past **ACE**]{.underline}, a spacecraft stationed 1.5 million km
upstream from Earth. [Sensors onboard ACE make]{.underline} in situ
[measurements of the CME\'s **speed**]{.underline},
**[density]{.underline}**, [and **magnetic field**]{.underline}. These
[data]{.underline} are [transmitted to **Earth** and the waiting **Solar

\"We [quickly feed the data into **CCMC computers**]{.underline},\" says
Pulkkinen. \"Our [models **predict fields** and **currents** in Earth\'s

**ground**]{.underline}.\" With less than 30 minutes to go, [Solar
Shield can **issue an alert** to utilities with detailed
info]{.underline}rmation [about GICs]{.underline}.

**\<\<\<NEG ENDS HERE\>\>\>**

[Pulkkinen stresses that [Solar Shield]{.mark}]{.underline} is
**[[experimental]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} has
[**[never]{.mark} been [field-tested]{.mark}**
[during]{.mark}]{.underline} [a]{.underline} severe geomagnetic

far, though, the sun has been mostly quiet [with **only a

that Solar Shield is experimental and has never been field-tested during
a severe geomagnetic storm. A small number of utility companies have
installed current monitors at key locations in the power grid to help
the team check their predictions. So far, though, the sun has been
mostly quiet with only a few relatively mild storms during the past
year. The team needs more data. \"[We\'d like more [power companies to
join our research effort]{.mark},\" he adds. \"The more data we can
collect from the field, the faster we can test and improve Solar
Shield.\"]{.underline} Power companies work with the team through EPRI,
the Electric Power Research Institute. Of course a few good storms would
help test the system, too. They\'re coming. The next solar maximum is
expected around 2013, so it\'s only a matter of time.

The second set of [challenges are **technical**]{.underline} and may be
those that are most open to exploitation by STM providers hoping to
establish or increase their contribution. [Despite the number of sensors
and actors, [there are]{.mark} still [**significant difficulties** in
**understanding** and **predicting**]{.mark} the [movements of]{.mark}
pieces of orbital **[debris]{.mark}**. One of these is related to the
**size** of debris that can be tracked]{.underline}, although the US Air
Force will have greater capability in detecting smaller objects
following the completion of the Space Fence in 2021.27 [Many of the
[models]{.mark} used to predict debris movements [do not take into
account]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[effects of [solar
radiation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and [**internal dynamics**, such
as]{.mark} **residual [radiation pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline} [from

result, [while it is possible to detect]{.mark} objects over a certain
size, [it is **not always possible to track**]{.mark}
**them**]{.underline}. Research is required to further understand the
behaviour of certain materials when they are subjected to radiation and
to how internal radiation and tumbling affect the orbit of a piece of
debris. [**[Technical challenges]{.mark}** also [relate to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[sharing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
[info]{.mark}rmation. Although more data sources used to create
positional information increases reliability, [there can
be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[difficulty]{.mark} in [incorporating

#### Countries [collect]{.underline} SSA for [military]{.underline} purposes\-\--which means [classification]{.underline} is key\-\--absent that, it opens a [window]{.underline} for attacks.

The first element of STM is data. In order to effectively manage space
activities, [it is essential to have information about what is in orbit,
where it is at a given time, and who]{.underline} (if anyone) [controls
it. This information is known as Space Situational Awareness (SSA)
data]{.underline}. Currently, [[SSA]{.mark} data are]{.underline}
[**[collected]{.underline}** [through a **variety of
systems**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [by a number
of]{.underline} [**[different actors]{.mark}**, but the
U.S.]{.underline} Space Situational Network (SSN) [is the most
comprehensive and accessible]{.underline} of these systems.7

[The SSN system is a network of sensors that collect]{.underline}
**[on-orbit data]{.underline}**. It is managed by the Combined Space
Operations Center (CSpOC), which is part of the U.S. military\'s Joint
Force Space Component Command. [The primary mission of the SSN system
[is to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[protect military]{.mark} space
[assets]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and **assure military access to
space**]{.underline}. However, [CSpOC has been **statutorily
authorized**]{.underline} [to **share** these data
globally]{.underline}.8 [This [sharing is]{.mark} designed [to **protect
national security**]{.mark}]{.underline} [by making available the most
sensitive SSA data only to other U.S. government entities and allies.
The most widely available data]{.underline}, on the other hand, [only
contain what is known as the Two-Line Element sets, which carry the most
**basic information**]{.underline} [on the **location**]{.underline} [of
an object in orbit, and are **publicly available**]{.underline} [through
Space-Track.org]{.underline} with the creation of a user account.9

While the SSN system is the most comprehensive source of SSA data,
[there are other states, notably]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**
[and **China**]{.underline}, [that also collect SSA data. Some
**nonstate entities**]{.underline} such as the Space Data Association
(SDA) [collect these data as well. SDA is an organization of satellite
operators that share SSA data with each other.]{.underline} Notably,
[SDA has signed an agreement with CSpOC for]{.underline} **[bilateral
sharing]{.underline}** [of data between the two]{.underline}. There is,
however, no comprehensive data pool for SSA data, and much of the data
is still considered sensitive and restricted.

[Foundational to any proposed STM project are data, and the **[data must
be standardized]{.mark}**]{.underline} [so that actors within the system
can access them and contribute their own data]{.underline}. Further,
**[data [integrity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[must be maintained]{.mark}
within the system [to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[avoid]{.mark}
mistakes]{.underline}**. [This means that a [multilateral]{.mark} STM
[system will need to]{.mark} **[adopt]{.mark} data
[standards]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to **[integrate data]{.mark}** from
**multiple sources** [and **compile**]{.mark}]{.underline} [it into
a]{.underline} **[single database]{.underline}**. [Since SSA data are
currently collected by **various entities**]{.underline} [using a
**variety of sensors**, ensuring that the data are]{.underline}
**[harmonized]{.underline}** [will be important]{.underline}.
Additionally, [STM will require an]{.underline} **[open data
system]{.underline}** [so that data are **public**]{.underline} [and
verifiable. The need for **openness is rooted in trust**. STM will
require some satellite operators to **move their on-orbit
assets**]{.underline} [in order to avoid conjunctions]{.underline} with
other space objects. [If the data underlying the decision-making process
are unavailable to operators, then they may]{.underline} **[balk at
requests to maneuver]{.underline}** on orbit. [The [ability to
verify]{.mark} data [is implicit to trust in that
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, [[this is **not so easy to
implement**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Currently, [[most]{.mark} [states
collect]{.mark}ing [SSA data]{.mark} do so [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[national security]{.underline}**]{.mark} [reasons, and importantly
the three major collectors]{.underline}---[[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates, [China, and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[all
maintain **adversarial positions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in relation to
the others]{.underline}. Additionally, [the data that are publicly
available are **incomplete**]{.underline} [at best]{.underline}. An open
data structure will need to find a way to balance between openness and
national security concerns.

#### In fact, SSA becomes [divided]{.underline}\-\--solving [none]{.underline} of the second advantage.

[There is [trend towards]{.mark}]{.underline} **[functional
[modularization]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} the [SSA]{.mark}
system: it [is becoming]{.mark} **more segmented**]{.underline} [such
that different actors and organizations can **service each
part**]{.underline} (data collection, data processing and the creation
of data products) of the system. [This is [a **significant
departure**]{.mark}]{.underline} [from the current SSA system, in which
the DoD performs all three parts]{.underline}; now, organizations
providing sensor data do not need to process it, and organizations
processing data or fusing different sources of data together do not need
to be the ones collecting. [[This]{.mark} trend]{.underline}---which
[[enables organizations]{.mark}, particularly in the **private sector**,
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[operate
independently]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and innovate new products or
services]{.underline}---[is already occurring, particularly in private
firms]{.underline} in Europe or the United States. In many cases,
[investors are funding certain aspects of the system]{.underline} (e.g.,
data collection companies), [and firms are offering products and
services on a subset of system. Experience in other industries that grew
out of government investment]{.underline} (e.g., computing) [has also
shown that entrance of the private sector is a precursor not only to
**falling cost**]{.underline} [and **greater innovation**, but also
to]{.underline} **[growing democratization]{.underline}**. However, [the
[case studies indicate]{.mark} that [globally SSA]{.mark} activities
[will]{.mark} likely [remain **dominated by national
security**]{.mark}**-oriented [organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[even as they collaborate with]{.underline}]{.mark} [their [civil and
commercial]{.mark} space [counterparts]{.mark}]{.underline},
domestically and internationally; as a result, SSA will likely be slower
to democratize than other sectors.

The first problem that demands a US Space Force is the reality that
**[adversaries are]{.underline}**, or are **[becoming]{.underline}**,
**[more capable of space warfare]{.underline}** than the United States.
One will often hear that the US dominates in space. This is objectively
true if one is measures the number of platforms deployed or the ability
to find, fix, and track space objects. Neither provide a meaningful
combat edge to the US on orbit. [More platforms mean more dependency and
more targets]{.underline}. While being able to watch satellites is
extremely useful, it cannot be determinative if the adversary has the
same ability. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** Combined Space Operations
Center's (**[[CSPOC) catalog of virtually all orbital objects is the
envy of everyone else vested in space]{.mark}, whether government or
commercial]{.underline}**. This space catalog, which draws data for
predictive surveillance from sensors located around the globe, allows
anyone with a calculator to predict the location of almost every object
in orbit at a chosen time. The US has made the catalog publicly
available and is working through the Department of Commerce to share
even better quality data across a wider commercial spectrum in the
interest of responsible space traffic management. While a thoroughly
commendable and wise policy choice from a safety of flight perspective,
**[[such data sharing reduces]{.underline}]{.mark}** much of [the [US's
orbital military advantage **enabling**]{.mark} **potential [adversaries
to target satellites for intel]{.mark}**ligence **[gathering]{.mark}**,
interference or destruction]{.underline}. Simultaneously,
[[those]{.mark} same [adversaries]{.mark} have [recognized that the
US]{.mark}, [is deeply committed to utilizing space as a crucial domain
for military support]{.mark} [and commercial]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} (communications, environmental
monitoring, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR),
Precision Navigation, and Timing (PNT), etc.). However, [[the US is not
well prepared to]{.mark} conduct operations [to prevent an adversary
from using anti-satellite capabilities]{.mark} to deny the advantages
derived from the US's space assets.]{.underline} **[This [makes space a
potential Achilles heel for the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or
at very least a center of gravity); [lots of capability on which there
is a great dependency, but not a lot of ability to protect it.
[This]{.mark} vulnerability [put the US at greater]{.mark} [risk to
attacks]{.mark} on space assets. It is unlikely an enemy would allow
another to maintain such a comparative advantage when it can be so
easily negated.]{.underline} The US does not need a Space Force to
enable or launch more capabilities into space. The [**[US needs a Space

**Stone 15** \[Christopher Michael Stone, M.S. from Missouri State in
Defense and Strategic Studies, "Reversing the Tao: A Framework for
Credible Space Deterrence," Fall 2015, *MSU Graduate Theses*, 1505\]

How does the PLA organize their concept for space deterrence? First,
according to PLA writings, the integration of space with other military
forces is important in order to form the most effective military force
possible. By having the strongest military force possible, says Chinese
authors, can a nation deter other nations from attacking it. 144 This
view has been seen in recent orders by President Xi Jinping for space to
become integrated in all aspects of Chinese military operations. 145
Second is having a credible counterspace capability to threaten other
nation's space assets in order to deter the opponent from using its
counterspace capabilities. "In this way, both sides would be reluctant
to attack the others space assets lest they also come under attack."146
In addition to having a credible counterspace capability for effective
space deterrence, [the Chinese advocate that they should reveal "firm
resolve to dare to and prepare to use this capability" in order to
create "certain psychological pressure on and fear in the adversary, and
\[force\] the adversary to dare not conduct space operations with
initiative."]{.underline} 147 This includes conducting "limited space
operational activities with warning and punishment as goals" as a means
of de-escalation of the crisis.148 [This view of forcedependent
deterrence reads more like a traditional deterrent model than even the
present DoD space deterrence framework that purposely avoids a credible
threat of counteraction in the event of an attack on U.S. space
assets]{.underline}. As PLA writers state, the goal of deterrence is to
"choose appropriate deterrence means to display the horribleness,
severity, and urgency of the consequences."149 [If a "period of tension"
arises, Chinese writers state that it is vital to achieving strategic
objectives terrestrially to "deliver destructive strikes to the enemy
using maximum power in order to fight rapidly]{.underline}, conclude the
operation rapidly and to withdraw from the confrontation."150 As seen in
the Chinese strategic culture that views the world and the international
system in a holistic manner, the same holds true with their view of the
many "zones" that the space domain covers with respect to space
deterrence. "\[It\] covers vast areas (zones) from the cosmos at tens of
thousands of kilometers from the Earth to the Earth's surface, with many
areas \[zones\] forming an organic whole...space military
struggle...\[is\] a synthesis of many types of correlated military
activity, including space to space, space to ground, and ground to
ground." 15 [[The **Chinese do not "share**]{.mark} **the same
[interests]{.mark}" [in]{.mark} the [space]{.mark} domain**]{.underline}
or a view of enhancing the status quo of a U.S.-dominated international
order. **[[They are]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to many scholars,
**[on a "quest for wealth and power."]{.underline}** 152 As one author
stated, the Chinese are "no longer guided by Maoist proletariat
ideology, \[and\] now see \[space\]...technology as a major factor in
its rise as a world power as it seeks increased influence and
independence. [China's pursuit of spacepower is a reflection
of]{.underline} this emphasis on technology and [its grand strategy to
"**regain the nation's former status as a great power that controls its
own fate."**]{.underline} 153 Despite the NSSS' goal of preventing the
development, testing, and deployment of space weapons systems, [the
Chinese possess the most rapidly maturing space program in the
world]{.underline} and are using on-orbit and ground based assets to
support China's national economic, military and political goals and
objectives.154 China has, according to a recent Pentagon report,
"invested in advanced space capabilities, with particular emphasis on
satellite communications, intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance
(ISR), satellite navigation, and meteorology, as well as...a vast ground
infrastructure supporting spacecraft and space launch vehicle
manufacture, command and control, and data downlink."155 In addition to
this supporting infrastructure, the PLA "continues to develop a variety
of capabilities designed to...prevent the use of space...by adversaries
during a crisis or conflict including the development of directed-energy
weapons and satellite jammers."156 In addition, since the ASAT test in
January 2007, the Chinese have continued to develop and test ground
launched kinetic interceptors for space attack, with testing since 2007
being non-destructive. The 2015 DoD Report to Congress on Chinese
Military Developments discusses several tests of Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
capable interceptors as well as tests that appear to highlight a
Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) capable interceptor capable of reaching
at least 22,300 miles. These test programs indicate that while the DoD
space deterrence framework speaks to the DoD's stated deterrence and
dissuasion of testing of counterspace weapons systems, China has not
given any indication of ceasing these tests or of PLA development of
doctrine for space warfighting because of the four element approach of
DoD space deterrence. Why would this be? According to Chinese military
authors, testing and development of space and counterspace technology is
important for effective space deterrence: "Even in a relatively peaceful
period, under circumstances where a hostile relationship is unclear, the
presence and development of one side's space systems and the boosting of
its space capability, still can potentially influence and constrain the
military activity of other nations and generate a certain deterrent
effect." 157 As mentioned earlier, [[some]{.mark} DoD analysts
[believe]{.mark} that **[transparency]{.mark} of military space
activities**]{.underline} [[is vital]{.mark} for preventing the use of
outer space for military engagements]{.underline} of either reversible
or destructive means. **[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[given the
very]{.mark} [different worldview and strategic culture of Chinese
decision makers]{.mark}]{.underline}** to the space domain [and their
historical and long term view of the international order, [this
foundational view]{.mark}]{.underline} of the DoD Space Deterrence
framework **[[has not improved the]{.mark} [security of American assets
in space]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The Western mindset sees
"transparency]{.underline} and openness [as the surest way to
peace"]{.underline} and believes that "when one state can effectively
monitor another, fears of surprise attack are mitigated, and the
tendency to overestimate a potential opponent's capacities and
intentions are minimized. With transparency, the security dilemma is
obviated and cooperation is possible."158 However, **[[this is not the
way]{.mark} [the Chinese see transparency and
openness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As one author correctly describes:
**[[To a \[Chinese\] strategist, letting an]{.mark} [opponent know
precisely one's strengths and weaknesses merely invites attack. The key
to stability in this view is uncertainty]{.mark}\--]{.underline}** not
knowing how strong or how weak an opponent is and never, under any
circumstances, revealing one's own strengths or weaknesses. The more
sure the knowledge, the more crafty the countervailing plan, the more
likely its success. 159 Why should we shun transparency, embrace
adaptability and unpredictability in our spacepower strategic support
planning? Xi Jinping sums this view up when he stated that: Boasting a
vast land of 9.6 million sq km, a rich cultural heritage and a strong
bond among the 1.3 billion Chinese people, we are resolved to go our own
way.... We must not blindly copy the...models of other countries nor
accept their dictation...[As a Chinese saying goes, "Standing firm when
assailed by rain and wind from all directions, our confidence is
supported by our core values]{.underline}" 160 Given the long history of
"humiliation" and weakness at the hands of Western "unequal treaties"
and the establishment of the current UN system (created without the
Chinese Communist Party's involvement) transparency is not something
that can be assumed with the Chinese government[. It goes against the
Chinese strategic culture of secrecy and deception in negotiation style
as mentioned earlier and would create an impression of weakness
domestically and internationally of the CCP]{.underline}. Due to this
the CCP may view the sharing of such information as detrimental to their
survival as the keepers of the strategic culture, governance and the
PLA's power and not a mutually beneficial path toward preservation of a
Western dominated status quo. **[[If capabilities are shared with the
potential "enemy" it would be to "selectively\...reveal China's space
tech]{.mark}nology and space capability]{.underline}**, and adopt an
oppositional mode **[to reduce their expectations for space
weaponization and to increase their degree of difficulty and costs in
space weaponization.]{.underline}**"161 [During peacetime]{.underline}
however, [[PLA]{.mark} strategic [guidance]{.mark} on deterrence
**[recommends]{.mark} a combination of [hiding one's capabilities and
keeping a low profile with active actions for]{.mark}**]{.underline} war
preparations such as testing and escalation control to include
**[[low-intensity warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}** "**[until our
deterrence goal is realized]{.underline}**."162 **[[This highlights the
value of avoiding transparency]{.underline}]{.mark}** as part of a long
term stratagem ignoring the ineffective American course of action of
transparency as part of the NSSS deterrence concept. Instead, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[should utilize uncertainty like the Chinese, given uncertainty
enables friction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that can create **foundational
strategic impediments for the adversary**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The
current strategic situation in space]{.underline} and on Earth, due to
American and allied inaction, [enables the Chinese to gather information
and offensive capabilities]{.underline} [needed to shape the strategic
environment]{.underline} to the PLA advantage [while giving the U.S.
leadership the perception that the United States is winning when in fact
they are losing to complex Chinese deterrence activities **imposing
friction on US and allied space operations and terrestrial
strategy**.]{.underline} 163 Clausewitz describes this phenomenon well
when he stated: Friction (which includes the intersection of many
factors, such as uncertainty, psychological/moral forces and effects,
etc.) impedes activity. Friction is the only concept that more or less
corresponds to the factors that distinguish real war from war on
paper.164 A more recent strategic theorist, Colonel John Boyd, USAF,
stated: Operate inside adversary's
observation-orientation-decision-action loops to enmesh adversary in a
world of uncertainty, doubt, mistrust, confusion, disorder, fear, panic
chaos ...and/or fold adversary back inside himself so that he cannot
cope with events/efforts as they unfold. 165 Why would these two
strategic thinkers focus on friction and uncertainty? Because the
atmosphere of war is friction, **[[friction is generated and magnified
by menace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ambiguity,
**[[deception]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rapidity, uncertainty,
**[[mistrust]{.underline}]{.mark}**, etc. [These are the actions that
the Chinese are engaged in space]{.underline} and in their increasingly
belligerent and expansionist activities in the Asia Pacific region.
[This friction in the strategic sense, is the opposite and
de-stabilizing]{.underline} side of the strategic Tao, with
harmony/initiative generated by "rapidity and variety" leading to
strategic success for China using the Observation, Orient, Decision,
[Action loop]{.underline} or also known as the Decision Calculus
Loop.166 As Sun Tzu was cited as saying, "Those who use arms well,
cultivate the Way (Tao)..."167 Orientation, seen as a result, represents
what Boyd referred to as "images, views or impressions of the world
shaped by genetic heritage, cultural tradition, previous experiences,
and unfolding circumstances."168 In other words, Boyd is defining what
is called strategic culture today and is defined by Kartchner as "that
set of shared beliefs, assumptions, and modes of behavior, derived from
common experiences and accepted narratives (both oral and written), that
shape collective identity and relationships to other groups, and which
determine appropriate ends and means for achieving security
objectives."169 [Once the DoD strategists and policymakers grasp these
important aspects of strategic context, understanding that the Chinese
are doing the same thing as part of their analysis, they can take that
information and orient the nation's strategic posture based on the
patterns discerned relating to adversary activities and at the same time
**denying our adversary the possibility of discerning patterns that
match our activity**]{.underline} as part of our strategy execution.170
A few examples of Chinese strategic patterns of behavior include their
use of force within crisis situations over time. For example, surprise
is a very important pattern of force projection within the PLA. In
October 1962, China conducted operations against India due to
territorial disputes. The Chinese launched major, rapid attacks, which
succeeded immediately. After a short pause, "the Chinese renewed their
attacks in midNovember" using the doctrines of the classic Chinese
strategist, Sun Tzu. These include: "all warfare is based on
deception....therefore, when capable, feign incapacity; when active,
inactivity....Pretend inferiority and encourage \[adversary\]
arrogance...Attack where he is unprepared; sally out when he does not
expect you....These are the strategist's key to victory. It is not
possible to discuss them beforehand."171 Thus in order to be victorious,
it is not beneficial to achieve strategic success through TCBMs; rather
surprise attacks and deception are key to strategic victory. Secondly,
**[[another pattern is achievement of psychological and political
shock]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [While some commentators]{.underline} such
as Michael Krepon [may believe that Chinese offensive deterrence strikes
are "unlikely,"]{.underline} **[this highlights the lack of real
observational understanding of the strategic culture and doctrines of
the PLA]{.underline}**.172 **[[Psychological or political shock of a
pre-emptive strike may be the payoff that the PLA is
looking]{.underline}]{.mark}** for rather than simply trying to gain a
complete military advantage over U.S. capabilities. As a result, a
rapid, destructive, [limited attack with kinetic energy
anti-satellites]{.underline} (KE ASATs) [could create conditions that
lead the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[or its
allies to "become disheartened and defeatist as a result of the
unexpected revers]{.underline}**e he has suffered and may be induced to
reduce his war aims" or perhaps change U.S. policy objectives in the
Pacific to the Chinese advantage.173 What is more, is that **[[achieving
such a]{.underline}]{.mark}** psychologicalpolitical **[[shock is
magnified in the]{.mark} [case of a military force that has
limited]{.mark}]{.underline}** forceprojection and **[[sustainment
capabilities]{.mark},]{.underline}** such as the current posture of the
DoD space forces that only contains reversible means of counterspace
operations. An example of psychological shock leading to policy changes
for an adversary is again found in the 1962 India campaign where the PLA
adopted a punishment strategy that undercut Indian self-confidence174.
By doing so, "the Chinese achieved a more rapid and decisive change in
policy than would likely have emerged from a long-drawn-out negotiation
in which the Chinese tried to trade the captured territory for an Indian
recognition of Chinese ownership of the territories they held before the
border war began."175 Some may argue that a Chinese attack on U.S. or
allied space systems is unlikely because the \[military\] benefits would
not outweigh the costs. However, a counterargument can be made that DoD
strategists and policymakers lack sufficient understanding of the
strategic culture needed to properly orient the American space posture
to be prepared to decide and act when necessary to protect space
systems. In addition, it is important to note that [China has even used
force not only to settle a crisis such as that with India, but also have
"typically used force to create a crisis]{.underline}."176
[[Understanding]{.mark} this unique strategic orientation of [the PLA
forces is **vital to**]{.mark} **[understand the strategic reality as it
is,]{.mark} and not as some would like it to be, to ensure American**
strategic interests and homeland are properly secured in]{.underline}
space and terrestrially. The view of having space weapons as a means of
CCP survival and territorial integrity through robust military power is
key to understanding the linkage that Chinese military writers have of
spacepower with nuclear weapons as well. [The Chinese view the nexus of
spacepower and nuclear weapons not as separate domains of operations,
but rather as "an integrated-whole composite strength for strategic
deterrence."]{.underline} 177 As one PLA author stated: The party that
enjoys superiority in space will secure its survival by weakening the
enemy's nuclear deterrent capabilities, thereby increasing tremendously
one's nuclear deterrent power. Space forces constitute both a space
shield and a space sword.178 This quote highlights another disturbing
yet important reality for American strategic planners to grasp: [the
development of space attack systems and a credible deterrent threat
against U.S. systems also include the attacking of nuclear command and
control space support segments]{.underline}. As the same PLA author
describes this in further detail: "Commanders should actively take the
initiative to strike at an enemy's vital targets because "only through
active offensive operations and counter-attacks can one seize and
maintain the initiative. Specifically, [vital targets include
information, command and support systems. Hitting these vital targets
through concentrated strikes is especially recommended in cases where
the PLA faces a "powerful enemy equipped with high technology weapons
and equipment]{.underline}" rather than conduct wars of
annihilation...the first targets of a campaign...are the detection,
command and telecommunications information systems, whose degradation or
destruction will negate or reduce the enemy's ability to control
information and create conditions for later combat." 179 [Chinese
military strategists recommend attacking these key information and
command and control nodes because PLA analysts assess that space-based
information "...will become a deciding factor in future wars, that space
will be the dominant battlefield, and that in order to achieve victory
on Earth]{.underline} and preserve sovereignty control of Chinese
territory and expanding core interests, the PLA must first seize the
initiative in space. This will require China to achieve space supremacy,
defined as the ability to freely use space and to deny the use of space
to adversaries." 180 Moreover, "the assessment that space is the
dominant battlefield \[emphasis added\] has led PLA analysts to conclude
that war in space is inevitable." 181

[[While the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been seeking to
develop]{.mark} a US-centric SSA [sharing]{.mark} plan internationally,
it seems some countries, particularly **[Russia and China, would
rather]{.mark} seek to build and [expand their own SSA]{.mark}
networks**]{.underline}. Russia holds the second-most advanced SSA
capabilities in the world. Just like the United States, the Russian
Space Surveillance Systems (RSSS) was built as missile warning systems
in the 1960s \[21\]. Thus, many radar systems were deployed along the
periphery of the Soviet Union territory, some of which are now outside
of Russian territory, such as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, and
Belarus \[22\]. Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia
holds control over the radar networks by making a series of bilateral
agreements with those countries \[23\]. Additionally, the Keldysh
Institute of Applied Mathematics (KIAM), a part of the Russian Academy
of Science, take the initiative in coordinating the International
Scientific Optical Network (ISON). With 37 observation facilities in 15
countries, and 79 telescopes, ISON covers geostationary (GEO) belt as
well as geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), highly elliptical orbit
(HEO), and low-earth orbit (LEO) \[24\]. [While the United States seeks
to share SSA information bilaterally, **Russia is proposing** a
centralized approach **with the UN** as the center]{.underline}. At the
fifty-ninth session of the COPUOS in June 2016, Russia submitted its
working paper on establishing a UN platform that is designed to collect
the SSA information, maintain a database, and share the data
internationally \[25\]. [In addition to Russia, China has already
developed and utilized a wide range of space applications]{.underline}.
Although China has published little information on its SSA capabilities,
considering the current space capabilities China has built, it is
reasonable to assume that China has developed a considerable degree of
SSA capabilities today. One study shows that China may have six ground
stations within its territory, one in Pakistan, and one in Namibia \[21,
p. 8\]. China also operates space surveillance tracking ships, although
they are primarily to support its human space flights \[23\]. As China
continues to build its space capabilities further, its reliance on space
systems will also increase. Therefore, China will make more earnest
efforts to expand its SSA networks globally. However, **[[the outlook on
building SSA information sharing between China and the United States is
unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Unlike other US allies, [the space
[cooperation between United States and China has been limited]{.mark},
particularly after Congress decided to restrict NASA\'s official
activities with China in 2011]{.underline} \[26\]. In fact, it is said
that China is starting to expand its SSA network by partnering with some
other Asia-Pacific Space Cooperation Organization (APSCO) member
countries: Iran, Pakistan, and Peru \[27\].

[[**China's** reluctance to participate in]{.mark} and support the

to]{.mark} the fact the Code of Conduct would implicate **[China's

specifically focused space policy such as the United States, but it has
articulated a space policy of sorts in a public white paper released
March 2011. \[5\] The [policies within this white paper do not reach the
specificity and transparency that the Code of Conduct would

China has to do with the topic of **space debris**]{.underline}. Space
debris mitigation was a cornerstone of the original Code of Conduct and
figures even more prominently in the new effort. [[China has indicated
in the past that **space debris is a low national priority**]{.mark} and
therefore agreeing to abide by and exhibit the behavior
encouraged]{.underline} by the Code of Conduct would **[seem to run

Nancy **Gallagher 10**. Center for International and Security Studies at
Maryland, May, "Space Governance and International Cooperation ,"
Astropolitics, 8.2 Taylor and Francis

If proponents of greater space cooperation truly believe that collective
action problems like debris mitigation are the most important reason for
cooperation, and if they are satisfied with the rate of progress on
improving launch, operation, and disposal practices that has occurred
over the past fifteen years, then continuing to frame the case for
cooperation in these terms is a fine strategic choice. But if they
believe that progress towards sustainability in managing space as a
global commons has been inadequate, then they need to reconsider the
preference for informal self-regulation over more formal and fully
developed regulatory arrangements. And if [they were hoping to use major
successes in relatively uncontroversial types of technical space
coordination as a way to build momentum for more significant cooperation
on politically difficult space security issues, then they should think
about how those larger, more politically sensitive issues are impeding
low-priority technical coordination. [**Strategic sensitivities** impede
coop]{.mark}eration [because]{.mark} many [people whose decisions affect
space]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially from U.S. and foreign defense
policy communities, [[resist doing]{.mark} what would make sense for the
**[long-term sustainable management]{.mark}** of space as a global
commons]{.underline} [because they do not think about space in the same
way that environmentalists, international lawyers, or collective action
theorists do]{.underline}. People who believe that access to and use of
space can be controlled for strategic gains relative to potential
competitors sometimes invoke the "space as a global
[commons]{.underline}" phrase as a way to assert their own right to use
space without interference from others without acknowledging that other
users have similar rights, and that all rights in space confer
corresponding responsibilities. An [extreme form of this view argues
that the United States should become a space hegemon to police the
shared environment, protect peaceful uses, and prevent anyone else from
accessing or using space for hostile purposes.21 **[Less extreme forms
of adversarial thinking]{.mark}** also **[impede functional

test will remember that Foreign Affairs appeared absolutely clueless
about the test, both publicly and privately. And that anti-satellite
test, ironically, was responsible for an enormous increase in the amount
of space debris that may cause a collision. That [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark}]{.underline} play the responsible global
citizen and [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} conjunction **[[data to the
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** after the test only deepens the irony. Of
course, for the Chinese it's a win as [the US catalogue and tracking of
orbital data is considered the best]{.underline} there is and they are
getting direct access to it should any of their satellites be
threatened. But this also provides proof to the Chinese that playing by
international rules and norms can provide tangible benefits, which
surely played a key role in the sharing being approved. Several
attendees at the space breakfast said the Chinese request marked an
important step forward in US-Chinese military-to-military relations and
welcomed it. One of the foremost US authorities on the Chinese
military's space efforts says in an email that the Chinese move
demonstrates "first and foremost, that in the Chinese system the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs is NOT a powerful entity. This is reflected
in the basic reality that the Foreign Minister has not been a member of
the Politburo since the days of Qian Qichen, in the late 1990s." He
believes that the PLA "is most likely acting, in the first place, to
remove an unnecessary link in the chain of information, especially
important since conjunction data is perishable. "Given China's steadily
improving space situational awareness system, my own guess is that they
are accessing this data, first, to minimize the chances of a
conjunction. There have been some interesting stories in the Chinese
press about moving satellites to avoid collisions. It is unclear what
data has been used to make that determination, whether it is primarily
home-grown, from the US, from third parties, or a combination. Second,
it may be to double-check their own data: What are the Americans seeing
that we are not? This may be partly a matter of resolution, and partly a
possible source of intelligence. There was a brouhaha a few years back
where we were reporting in our space catalogs European satellites that
the Europeans denied existed." So what does America get out of this?
"For the United States," Cheng writes, "ideally this would be an
opportunity for us to gain insight into what organizations play a role
in China's space situational awareness organization. Who gets this data
(almost certainly the General Armaments Department)? Who else outside
the military gets this data? How does it get incorporated into China's
SSA system? In particular, does the China National Space Administration
(CNSA) get this data, and at what point? (I doubt the information is
going from us to CNSA)." In the end, [Cheng assesses this]{.underline}
[is **[not the beginning of a]{.mark} [fundamental change]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} US-[Chinese]{.mark} military to military
**[relations]{.mark}**. "What WON'T change is that [Chinese
space]{.mark} (and military]{.underline}, but I repeat myself)
[[officials will **NOT engage in direct**]{.mark}, US-PRC
**[communications]{.mark}**. **[Certainly not in a crisis]{.mark}**, and
probably only minimally in peacetime, even with this new
connection."]{.underline}

**[You Can't Buy Interoperability]{.underline}**

[In contrast to statistical engineering that aims to **adjust numbers**
to fit the **desired "fair share**]{.underline}," [**[true
burden-sharing]{.underline}** [would put emphasis on]{.underline}
]{.mark}[**defense [capabilities]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[operational [readiness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Shifting the emphasis
away from **abstract macroeconomic numbers**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[[practical coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}**
**[[based on strategic needs]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[should inform the
**content**]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[[which capabilities to
buy]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[not only the
**form**]{.underline}]{.mark} (defense spending
[[levels]{.underline}]{.mark}), [[of burden-sharing debates]{.mark}.
This highlights the problem that [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[cannot]{.mark} just **[buy interoperability]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[as [it requires]{.mark} **[enhanced]{.mark} cooperation and
[coordination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Although interoperability is
considered the alliance's core business, it has not been systematically
treated in the burden-sharing debate. In addition, burden-sharing that
includes the mutual-aid dimension would further refine the cash,
capabilities, contributions --- or "three C's" --- framework regularly
mentioned by the current NATO secretary-general.

[The [current]{.mark} [defense spending narrative]{.mark} is thus a
symptom of **empty formalism** in NATO that [reflects a **lack of
clarity about the alliance's purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and favors
statistical deceptions over effectively implementing the **mutual
commitment** to defend each other.]{.underline} A February 2020 poll by
the Pew Research Center revealed a worrying trend: While NATO is
generally seen in a positive light across publics within the alliance (a
median of 53 percent view NATO positively, though with double-digit
percentage point declines in Germany and France over the past 10 years),
many in 16 surveyed NATO countries seem reluctant to fulfill Article V
collective defense obligations. A median of 50 percent across 16 NATO
member countries is against their country defending an ally, while only
38 percent express willingness to come to help a fellow ally.

Future Defense Spending in Peril right, especially in the context of the
short- and long-term consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
While the scope of the economic impact is still unclear, it is likely to
reshuffle financial priorities in NATO countries. Defense ministries
will find it more difficult to reach the 2 percent spending level by
2024 or even to maintain the current defense expenditures programs.
Moreover, with economies put to halt and eventual drops in national GDP,
even if countries fulfill the 2 percent pledge, they could end up
spending less in real terms. If NATO members continue to frame fairness
in terms of the 2 percent defense spending target, it will further
aggravate the burden-sharing problem, seriously test NATO solidarity,
and ultimately endanger the alliance's ability to adapt to the
increasingly unpredictable security environment and the changing nature
of security threats.

Exercises

With the upcoming end of the International Security Assistance Force's
(ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, NATO is expected to shift its emphasis
from operational engagement to operational preparedness through its CFI.
CFI is intended to build on the Alliance's recent experience in
Afghanistan and ensure the Allies can work even more effectively
together in the future.102 [A key pillar of this initiative]{.underline}
[is **increased exercises**]{.underline} as "[an **essential
means**]{.underline} [for forces to practice **tactics**]{.underline},
techniques and [procedures]{.underline}, [**promote** and gauge
**interoperability**]{.underline}, **[validate training]{.underline}**
and, when required, [certify **headquarters**]{.underline}, [units and
**formations**]{.underline}."103

[In order to ensure]{.underline} the [Alliance]{.underline} [is able
to]{.underline} fully [**exploit** space capabilities]{.underline},
[**space** operations]{.underline} [should be
**incorporated**]{.underline} [into a **variety** of
tactical]{.underline}, operational, and **[strategic]{.underline}**
level [exercises]{.underline} [and war games]{.underline}. At the
tactical level, [this could **include**]{.underline} such things as a
[multi-national **RED FLAG exercise**]{.underline}. [RED FLAG is a
**realistic**]{.underline} [combat training exercise]{.underline}
[involving]{.underline} [the **air forces**]{.underline} [of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its allies]{.underline}. Conducted on the vast bombing and gunnery
ranges of the Nevada Test and Training Range, RED FLAG was established
in 1975 to maximize the combat readiness, capability and survivability
of participating units by providing realistic training in a combined
air, ground, space and electronic threat environment as well as a free
exchange of ideas between forces.104 Participating units execute
missions against an opposing "Aggressor" force specially trained to
replicate the tactics and techniques of potential adversaries. While Red
Flag originally developed a flyer\'s combat proficiency, the last eight
years have slowly incorporated space and cyberspace capabilities.105
Previously segregated from the CAF participants, space and cyber
operators are now fully integrated at the tactical level as a primary
training audience.

[At the **operational** level]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} [could
**participate** in a BLUE FLAG]{.underline} [exercise]{.underline}.
[BLUE FLAG]{.underline} [is an U.S. Air Force]{.underline} "Air Combat

RED FLAG is intended to increase the combat survivability of tactical
forces, the [goal]{.underline} of BLUE FLAG [is to train
**commanders**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} staff [officers at the
**operational level of war**]{.underline} [so]{.underline} "[they
can]{.underline} immediately [**participate** in directing]{.underline}
[an air war]{.underline} and make smart decisions during the critical
first days of an engagement."107

[Being integrated]{.underline} [with allies]{.underline} [means **more
than** processes]{.underline} [and **training**]{.underline}, Gardiner
added. It means recognizing the space community is small, and Australia
has limited resources. "\[That\] enables us then to understand where
those gaps are and where can we actually be putting our national
treasure towards so that we're meaningfully contributing to where it's
needed."

[There are several]{.underline} related [barriers to
**integrating**]{.underline} space **[capabilities]{.underline}**.
[Allies **do not communicate**]{.underline} [enough]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} **[capabilities]{.underline}** and gaps [to ensure
they are not]{.underline} **[duplicating efforts]{.underline}** or
leaving gaps that a nation might have the resources to fill ---
something that Gardiner said could amount to "fratricide." [One of the
**major reasons** that **communication**]{.underline}
[doesn't]{.underline} [take place is
**over-classification**]{.underline}, leaders said.

"[I've never come up against]{.underline} [as much
**classification**]{.underline} [as I have in the **space
domain**]{.underline}," said Godfrey.

"**[Unfortunately]{.underline}**, [it doesn't make it **easy to
understand**]{.underline} if [I'm looking to **develop a
capability**]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [I've just
**classified**]{.underline}, how can I then have the conversation with
my colleagues here to understand whether they're already developing that
capability, and if I actually need to go and spend money somewhere else
because they've got it," he added.

"[I think one of the **challenges**]{.underline} [that we're
working]{.underline} each and [every day]{.underline} ... [is how do we
get to a more **comprehensive sharing** amongst **allies**]{.underline}
and partners," said Dickinson. "[How do we declassify]{.underline},

The first problem that demands a US Space Force is the reality that
**[adversaries are]{.underline}**, or are **[becoming]{.underline}**,
**[more capable of space warfare]{.underline}** than the United States.
One will often hear that the US dominates in space. This is objectively
true if one is measures the number of platforms deployed or the ability
to find, fix, and track space objects. Neither provide a meaningful
combat edge to the US on orbit. [More platforms mean more dependency and
more targets]{.underline}. While being able to watch satellites is
extremely useful, it cannot be determinative if the adversary has the
same ability. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** Combined Space Operations
Center's (**[[CSPOC) catalog of virtually all orbital objects is the
envy of everyone else vested in space]{.mark}, whether government or
commercial]{.underline}**. This space catalog, which draws data for
predictive surveillance from sensors located around the globe, allows
anyone with a calculator to predict the location of almost every object
in orbit at a chosen time. The US has made the catalog publicly
available and is working through the Department of Commerce to share
even better quality data across a wider commercial spectrum in the
interest of responsible space traffic management. While a thoroughly
commendable and wise policy choice from a safety of flight perspective,
**[[such data sharing reduces]{.underline}]{.mark}** much of [the [US's
orbital military advantage **enabling**]{.mark} **potential [adversaries
to target satellites for intel]{.mark}**ligence **[gathering]{.mark}**,
interference or destruction]{.underline}. Simultaneously,
[[those]{.mark} same [adversaries]{.mark} have [recognized that the
US]{.mark}, [is deeply committed to utilizing space as a crucial domain
for military support]{.mark} [and commercial]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} (communications, environmental
monitoring, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR),
Precision Navigation, and Timing (PNT), etc.). However, [[the US is not
well prepared to]{.mark} conduct operations [to prevent an adversary
from using anti-satellite capabilities]{.mark} to deny the advantages
derived from the US's space assets.]{.underline} **[This [makes space a
potential Achilles heel for the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or
at very least a center of gravity); [lots of capability on which there
is a great dependency, but not a lot of ability to protect it.
[This]{.mark} vulnerability [put the US at greater]{.mark} [risk to
attacks]{.mark} on space assets. It is unlikely an enemy would allow
another to maintain such a comparative advantage when it can be so
easily negated.]{.underline} The US does not need a Space Force to
enable or launch more capabilities into space. The [**[US needs a Space
Force to protect the capability it already has on

[satellites]{.underline}, [including in the **military

of U.S. and allied space security and improve chances for developing
norms of peaceful international behavior.

Coalesce Allied and Partner Thinking on Space Security Concepts.

[As part of **defense**]{.underline} space [partnerships]{.underline},
[allies]{.underline} [can]{.underline} more **[thoroughly
discuss]{.underline}** [the threats to **space systems**]{.underline}
and potential space conflict scenarios. [If the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [wants to fully
leverage its allies]{.underline} and partners [in any future
conflict]{.underline} in space, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would **benefit**
from]{.underline} [having]{.underline} [more **discussions with its
allies** about the]{.underline} [possibility]{.underline} [and
**nature**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} such a
**[conflict]{.underline}**: [how it **might emerge**]{.underline},
[how]{.underline} the respective [allies]{.underline} [can
**contribute**]{.underline}, the capabilities the allies should pursue
in advance, [and the actions]{.underline} [that]{.underline} might
**[constitute "red lines"]{.underline}** [or cross
thresholds]{.underline} that are more severe than others.

In recent years, the United States has taken important steps to
collaborate with allies and partners on space threats and space
conflict. International partners participate in military space exercises
such as Space Flag, Global Sentinel, and the Schriever Wargame.22 The
Five Eyes (the United States plus Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom) along with France and Germany all are members of the
Combined Space Operations initiative. 23 Experts we spoke to told us
that the United States should continue and expand these efforts. Partner
preparation for space conflicts could be valuable from an operational
and geopolitical perspective. Todd Harrison, Director of the Aerospace
Security Project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies,
stated the following:

> Rotating allies in the \[Combined Space Operations Center as part of
> the Combined Space Operations initiative\] is important because it
> gives those countries experts on space security issues. [Let's say
> Russia or China]{.underline} [**start interfering** with
> our]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** **[c]{.underline}**ommand

> **[e]{.underline}**arly **[w]{.underline}**arning
> **[s]{.underline}**atellites. [Any allied country needs]{.underline}
> [to have their]{.underline} **[own experts]{.underline}** [so they
> **understand our response**]{.underline}---they need folks who can
> say, "Yes, I understand why the Americans are escalating over this."24

In a conflict in space, [even if an allied]{.underline}
[country]{.underline} [does not have]{.underline}
**[significant]{.underline}** defense space
**[capabilities]{.underline}**, [it should have an
**understanding**]{.underline} [why]{.underline} the United States or
other [allied]{.underline} [countries]{.underline} [are **taking the
actions**]{.underline} [that they are]{.underline}. That understanding
might help that country support the United States and allies politically
and militarily in other domains.

The United States and its [allies having a **shared
understanding**]{.underline} [of space threats]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} space conflict [will help in
**peacetime**]{.underline} too. General John Raymond, the Chief of Space
Operations, has prioritized developing norms for operating in space.25
These [could include]{.underline} something like [taking steps to **not
create debris**]{.underline} [and announcing]{.underline} **[planned
maneuvers]{.underline}** into other orbits.26 With a similar
understanding of the issues, the United States and its allies will be
better equipped to develop common ideas for responsible behavior in
space. This will also help with multilateral discussions, such as United
Nations (UN) proposals on space security. Our partners have not always
supported U.S. positions on UN space security proposals, including our
negation of proposals made by Russia and China. For example, in the 2014
UN vote on Russia's proposed draft resolution on No First Placement of
Weapons in Outer Space, only three countries voted with the United
States against the resolution and 125 voted for it with Russia.27 New
and deeper partnerships will create more commonality in assumptions and
objectives for fostering a safe and secure space environment.

Through these organizations and agreements, [NATO has
improved]{.underline} and strengthened [its **unified cyber defense
capability**]{.underline}, seemingly [positioning itself to be a
**standard bearer** for cybersecurity]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [these commitments **lack specifics**
and]{.underline} could [**hamper** NATO's ability to **respond** to an
attack because of]{.underline} bureaucratic and **[security
protocols]{.underline}**. Following the inclusion of cyber attacks under
Article 5, NATO and its allies could not agree on what kind of attack
would trigger the collective defense response. [Allies still use their
**own** incident **standards** to **define cyber incidents**
and]{.underline} in some cases [do **not** make these **standards
public**]{.underline}. [This results in an **uneven response** and makes
it **difficult** for NATO and its allies to provide a
**unified**]{.underline}, **[Article 5 response]{.underline}** to cyber
incidents. Stoltenberg has defended this vague definition by stating
that, "a clearly defined threshold only invites attacks immediately
beneath it." This [clarification does not address the larger
issue]{.underline} of which attacks would trigger an Article 5 response,
[as NATO **already** defends against low-level cyber attacks
**daily**]{.underline}. **[Ambiguous guidelines]{.underline}** could
also [cause NATO to **misappropriate** responses to cyber
attacks]{.underline}, [leading to]{.underline} potentially
[**embarrassing** **overreactions** to minor incursions or **devastating
slow responses** to]{.underline} crippling [attacks]{.underline}.
Without a clear definition, NATO will struggle to respond to attacks. As
stated earlier, NATO's focus is on deterring attacks---to such an extent
that the cost of an attack would outweigh any benefits. However, this
focus has resulted in NATO lacking the offensive capabilities to respond
in the same capacity as its allies, like the United States.

The twin shocks of the U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and the
AUKUS nuclear submarine deal --- along with the heavy toll of President
Donald Trump's tenure --- have triggered an ongoing discussion in
U.S.-Europe security relations. In particular, [given the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tate[**s'** increased focus
on the]{.underline} [Indo-Pacific]{.underline} [region]{.underline} [in
tackling]{.underline} the [China challenge]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[has been more]{.underline} [**concretely reflecting** on how to
increase]{.underline} [its **military capabilities**]{.underline} in
regions which are no longer security priorities for Washington. So far,
[the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orth **[A]{.underline}**tlantic
**[T]{.underline}**reaty **[O]{.underline}**rganization (NATO) [has been
the key]{.underline} **[military]{.underline}**
[organization]{.underline} [**responsible** for security]{.underline}
[in the **trans-Atlantic** space]{.underline}; therefore, an increased
military role for the EU raises questions about how the two
organizations would relate to each other.

NATO and the EU do have a long track record of cooperation, from
institutional cooperation to personnel exchange and joint exercises.
Over the years the two organizations have also operated in tandem, with
the EU's Operation Althea taking over the capacity-building efforts of
NATO's Stabilization Force in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2004 and with
both deploying simultaneous counterpiracy missions off the Somalia coast
--- Operation Ocean Shield (2009-2016) and Operation Atalanta
(2008-2022). Moreover, NATO and the EU seem to also have converged in
their respective strategic thinking along the lines of countering Russia
and China's aggressive behavior and malign economic influence, as well
as threats coming from disruptive technologies and disinformation.
Pressed by these challenges, NATO and the EU have progressively expanded
their traditional range of military and civilian activities so much that
their missions now partially overlap, with NATO embracing
capacity-building and cyberoperations and the EU stepping up on crisis
management.

Yet NATO-**[EU cooperation]{.underline}** [remains]{.underline} somewhat
**[limited]{.underline}** [because of **political
tensions**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} member
[states]{.underline} (which hinders intelligence sharing) [as well
as]{.underline} [weak]{.underline} European **[military
capabilities]{.underline}** [and inadequate]{.underline} **[defense
spending]{.underline}**. Over the past few years the EU has made
important progress in this domain through the establishment of the
European Defense Fund and several defense projects under the Permanent
Structure Cooperation (PESCO) mechanism. Yet, [according to **several
studies**]{.underline} in the field, the [state of **European
defense**]{.underline} [appears **insufficient**]{.underline} [to
tackle]{.underline} [more **serious military threats**]{.underline} [or
to enable the EU]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [take
**initiatives**]{.underline} [in its neighborhood]{.underline}
**[independently]{.underline}** [from the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. In its "Strategic
Compass" to be published in March 2022, the EU is supposed to adopt a
bolder approach to its defense capabilities. In parallel, in a new
strategic concept to be released in June 2022, NATO is supposed to
tackle security throughout a widened angle, looking at domains that are
not strictly defense-related.

As NATO and the EU progressively expand their scope and strategic
thinking in the context of growing global challenges, this paper
reflects on how the two organizations could engage in a deeper dialogue
to leverage each other's capabilities: [the EU should **rely on NATO's
experience**]{.underline} with [logistics and]{.underline}
[**procurement** to **strengthen**]{.underline} [its own]{.underline}
and the alliance's [military posture]{.underline}, while NATO should
rely on the EU's experience to counter disinformation, improve military
mobility, and tackle hybrid threats stemming from malign economic
influence and disruptive technolgies. Reaching such synergies is crucial
to strengthening both NATO and EU security posture and to ensure
readiness on a number of fronts, not necessarily tied to the military
domain and perhaps beyond the trans-Atlantic space itself.

Exercises

With the upcoming end of the International Security Assistance Force's
(ISAF) mission in Afghanistan, NATO is expected to shift its emphasis
from operational engagement to operational preparedness through its CFI.
CFI is intended to build on the Alliance's recent experience in
Afghanistan and ensure the Allies can work even more effectively
together in the future.102 [A key pillar of this initiative]{.underline}
[is **increased exercises**]{.underline} as "[an **essential
means**]{.underline} [for forces to practice **tactics**]{.underline},
techniques and [procedures]{.underline}, [**promote** and gauge
**interoperability**]{.underline}, **[validate training]{.underline}**
and, when required, [certify **headquarters**]{.underline}, [units and
**formations**]{.underline}."103

[In order to ensure]{.underline} the [Alliance]{.underline} [is able
to]{.underline} fully [**exploit** space capabilities]{.underline},
[**space** operations]{.underline} [should be
**incorporated**]{.underline} [into a **variety** of
tactical]{.underline}, operational, and **[strategic]{.underline}**
level [exercises]{.underline} [and war games]{.underline}. At the
tactical level, [this could **include**]{.underline} such things as a
[multi-national **RED FLAG exercise**]{.underline}. [RED FLAG is a
**realistic**]{.underline} [combat training exercise]{.underline}
[involving]{.underline} [the **air forces**]{.underline} [of
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its allies]{.underline}. Conducted on the vast bombing and gunnery
ranges of the Nevada Test and Training Range, RED FLAG was established
in 1975 to maximize the combat readiness, capability and survivability
of participating units by providing realistic training in a combined
air, ground, space and electronic threat environment as well as a free
exchange of ideas between forces.104 Participating units execute
missions against an opposing "Aggressor" force specially trained to
replicate the tactics and techniques of potential adversaries. While Red
Flag originally developed a flyer\'s combat proficiency, the last eight
years have slowly incorporated space and cyberspace capabilities.105
Previously segregated from the CAF participants, space and cyber
operators are now fully integrated at the tactical level as a primary
training audience.

[At the **operational** level]{.underline}, [NATO]{.underline} [could
**participate** in a BLUE FLAG]{.underline} [exercise]{.underline}.
[BLUE FLAG]{.underline} [is an U.S. Air Force]{.underline} "Air Combat

RED FLAG is intended to increase the combat survivability of tactical
forces, the [goal]{.underline} of BLUE FLAG [is to train
**commanders**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} staff [officers at the
**operational level of war**]{.underline} [so]{.underline} "[they

Russia's Response to Space Sanctions and Short-Term Effects

[Russia's **initial response**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} Western
[space-related]{.underline} **[sanctions]{.underline}** [constituted
**little more**]{.underline} [than Roscosmos]{.underline} head Dmitry
Rogozin launching a **[furious]{.underline}** [Twitter
tirade]{.underline}, threatening to cease Russian technological support
to the International Space Station. But more [**concrete responses**
followed]{.underline}: [Russia]{.underline} [**suspended** its launch
operations]{.underline} [with the]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion; [**cut off** rocket
engine]{.underline} **[servicing]{.underline}** and exports [to
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates; [and
has held at least]{.underline} one previously [contracted
commercial]{.underline} [satellite]{.underline} [**launch
hostage**]{.underline} in an attempt to extort a NATO member state.
Along the way, the mercurial Rogozin has continued to bluster on social
media and in the Russian press, threatening that the 500-ton
International Space Station could be deorbited over the United States or
Western Europe, that the loss of Russian rocket technology would force
the United States and its allies to access space on "broomsticks," that
continued partnership in the International Space Station and other joint
projects was contingent on the lifting of Western sanctions, and,
several weeks later, that Russia would, in fact, leave its long-standing
partnership in the International Space Station.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has been less strident than Rogozin, at
least in terms of Russian space activities. Downplaying the effects of
Western sanctions, Putin has insisted that Roscosmos will continue its
civil-space missions --- including the Luna-25 Moon mission (one of the
lunar missions in which the European Space Agency canceled its
collaboration), broadband-providing satellite services, and nuclear
propulsion technology development --- without international
collaboration. Putin himself has not commented on the future of the
International Space Station.

From the perspective of NASA and the United States, Russia's
counter-sanctions and threats have had little short-term impact. NASA
announced its intent to continue partnering with Roscosmos on the
maintenance of the station shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, and
while Russia has symbolically canceled some joint space station
experiments in retaliation for Western sanctions, most International
Space Station operations are proceeding as normal. This has included
(despite breathless articles about possible "stranded" astronauts) the
return of U.S. astronaut Mark Vande Hei to Earth in a Soyuz crew capsule
at the end of March and, at least until mid-May when some media outlets
reported the cancellation of the agreement, plans to fly a Russian
cosmonaut to the International Space Station on a SpaceX Crew Dragon
capsule later this year. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has consistently
characterized Rogozin's threats as mere bluster and stated that he
"see\[s\] nothing that has interrupted \[the\] professional
relationship" between NASA and Roscosmos in International Space Station
operations. As a number of experts have noted, Rogozin's comments
concerning the space station do not signal Russia's immediate intentions
and recognize Roscomos's obligation to provide at least a year's advance
notice prior leaving the International Space Station partnership --- a
notification that, to date, has not been provided. Additionally,
Rogozin's media statements are not significantly different from those of
Russian government officials made prior to the invasion of Ukraine
regarding Russia's intention to potentially leave the partnership after
the 2024 conclusion of the station's current international operating
agreement.

[Unfortunately]{.underline}, [the **short-term effects**]{.underline}
[of the Western]{.underline} **[sanctions]{.underline}** campaign [have
been far]{.underline} [more **significant** for Europe]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[A]{.underline}**gency**['s]{.underline}** [decision to **cancel its
joint projects**]{.underline} [with Roscosmos]{.underline} effectively
[ended **almost 30 years**]{.underline} [of space]{.underline}
[collaboration]{.underline} between the two organizations. [In addition
to the **canceled**]{.underline}, [suspended, or **indefinitely
postponed**]{.underline} [joint]{.underline} civil-space
[missions]{.underline}, [the Russian **embargo**]{.underline} [on Soyuz
flights]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [European payloads]{.underline}
[has resulted]{.underline} [in the **cancellation** of]{.underline}
approximately **[16 satellite missions]{.underline}** between 2022 and
2024. [This has left almost 200]{.underline} [satellites]{.underline},
including several Galileo geo-navigation satellites and a number of
other high-profile European satellite missions, [without an **immediate
method**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [reaching orbit]{.underline}.
While a number of launch providers have attempted to adjust their launch
schedules and manifests to accommodate these missions, it remains to be
seen whether there will be sufficient space on current launches to
undertake these missions in the short term. Furthermore, non-space
related sanctions, particularly those targeting Russia's oil, coal, gas,
and energy exports, are already causing economic hardship to European
economies.

Long-Term Effects

[As **sanctions**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [counter-sanctions
between]{.underline} [the West]{.underline} [and Russia]{.underline}
**[proliferate]{.underline}**, and as the war in Ukraine grinds on in an
ever more brutal fashion, it is difficult to predict exactly what
long-terms effects these sanctions will have in the space domain. A
number of factors will likely contribute to the long-term effects,
including, at a minimum, the length and outcome of the Russo-Ukrainian
war; whether Western sanctions are lifted when the conflict concludes;
and the extent to which Russia is able to evade Western sanctions or
find alternative sources of money and materiel, whether by seeking
greater engagement with other international partners (China being the
primary candidate) or through other means.

First, how will the Russian civil-space program be affected over the
long-term by the current sanctions? The Biden administration has
insisted that current sanctions will halve Russia's high-tech imports
and radically affect its defense and aerospace industries, particularly
over a period of years. Others counter that such export controls are
more likely to constitute a short-term "flesh wound" from which Russia
will be able to recover over the long-term by shifting to other supply
sources. It seems, however, that sanctions are already wreaking havoc
within Russia's industries: The loss of high-tech electronic and
computer equipment imports has reportedly forced shutdowns of a number
of military manufacturing plants, including tank factories and
surface-to-air missiles production facilities. New military systems
under development by the Russian defense industry were described as
being "hostage to many new technologies and systems" as early as 2019.
Now, with the bite of sanctions, it is unclear whether such systems can
be produced in sufficient numbers to contribute to Russia's military
efforts in Ukraine. Additionally, reports out of Ukraine indicate that
sanctions have already reduced Russian forces to jerry-rigging military
equipment with semiconductors and computer chips from household
appliances. While nothing has been publicly released concerning the
effects of sanctions on Russia's space activities, the apparent effects
of sanctions throughout Russia's military and technology production do
not bode well for the long-term health of the country's space
industries.

Russia's space program has suffered heavily over the past decade ---
particularly in the wake of previous Western sanctions imposed after
Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. As space expert James Clay Moltz
notes, since 2014, the Russian space program has "become less innovative
and more militarily focused" and its "civil and commercial space
technology has failed to keep up with world standards," already
drastically reducing its competitiveness. Even before the present crisis
in Ukraine, [the]{.underline} **[F]{.underline}**rench

Should these trends continue, Western sanctions and European
disengagement may prove devastating to a Russian space program already
weakened by pre-2022 sanctions, budget cuts, and aging technology.

With respect to long-term civil-space cooperation between the United
States and Russia, there is no immediate threat (despite Rogozin's
bombastic statements) to the International Space Station partnership.

[will]{.underline} [**continue** in a **meaningful** way]{.underline}

Coalesce Allied and Partner Thinking on Space Security Concepts.

[As part of **defense**]{.underline} space [partnerships]{.underline},
[allies]{.underline} [can]{.underline} more **[thoroughly
discuss]{.underline}** [the threats to **space systems**]{.underline}
and potential space conflict scenarios. [If the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [wants to fully
leverage its allies]{.underline} and partners [in any future
conflict]{.underline} in space, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [would **benefit**
from]{.underline} [having]{.underline} [more **discussions with its
allies** about the]{.underline} [possibility]{.underline} [and
**nature**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} such a
**[conflict]{.underline}**: [how it **might emerge**]{.underline},
[how]{.underline} the respective [allies]{.underline} [can
**contribute**]{.underline}, the capabilities the allies should pursue
in advance, [and the actions]{.underline} [that]{.underline} might
**[constitute "red lines"]{.underline}** [or cross
thresholds]{.underline} that are more severe than others.

In recent years, the United States has taken important steps to
collaborate with allies and partners on space threats and space
conflict. International partners participate in military space exercises
such as Space Flag, Global Sentinel, and the Schriever Wargame.22 The
Five Eyes (the United States plus Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and
the United Kingdom) along with France and Germany all are members of the
Combined Space Operations initiative. 23 Experts we spoke to told us
that the United States should continue and expand these efforts. Partner
preparation for space conflicts could be valuable from an operational
and geopolitical perspective. Todd Harrison, Director of the Aerospace
Security Project at the Center for Strategic & International Studies,
stated the following:

> Rotating allies in the \[Combined Space Operations Center as part of
> the Combined Space Operations initiative\] is important because it
> gives those countries experts on space security issues. [Let's say
> Russia or China]{.underline} [**start interfering** with

> **[e]{.underline}**arly **[w]{.underline}**arning
> **[s]{.underline}**atellites. [Any allied country needs]{.underline}
> [to have their]{.underline} **[own experts]{.underline}** [so they
> **understand our response**]{.underline}---they need folks who can
> say, "Yes, I understand why the Americans are escalating over this."24

In a conflict in space, [even if an allied]{.underline}
[country]{.underline} [does not have]{.underline}
**[significant]{.underline}** defense space
**[capabilities]{.underline}**, [it should have an
**understanding**]{.underline} [why]{.underline} the United States or
other [allied]{.underline} [countries]{.underline} [are **taking the
actions**]{.underline} [that they are]{.underline}. That understanding
might help that country support the United States and allies politically
and militarily in other domains.

The United States and its [allies having a **shared
understanding**]{.underline} [of space threats]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} space conflict [will help in
**peacetime**]{.underline} too. General John Raymond, the Chief of Space
Operations, has prioritized developing norms for operating in space.25
These [could include]{.underline} something like [taking steps to **not
create debris**]{.underline} [and announcing]{.underline} **[planned
maneuvers]{.underline}** into other orbits.26 With a similar
understanding of the issues, the United States and its allies will be
better equipped to develop common ideas for responsible behavior in
space. This will also help with multilateral discussions, such as United
Nations (UN) proposals on space security. Our partners have not always
supported U.S. positions on UN space security proposals, including our
negation of proposals made by Russia and China. For example, in the 2014
UN vote on Russia's proposed draft resolution on No First Placement of
Weapons in Outer Space, only three countries voted with the United
States against the resolution and 125 voted for it with Russia.27 New
and deeper partnerships will create more commonality in assumptions and
objectives for fostering a safe and secure space environment.

#### Specifically, Article V results in [overreactions]{.underline}.

Through these organizations and agreements, [NATO has
improved]{.underline} and strengthened [its **unified cyber defense
capability**]{.underline}, seemingly [positioning itself to be a
**standard bearer** for cybersecurity]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [these commitments **lack specifics**
and]{.underline} could [**hamper** NATO's ability to **respond** to an
attack because of]{.underline} bureaucratic and **[security
protocols]{.underline}**. Following the inclusion of cyber attacks under
Article 5, NATO and its allies could not agree on what kind of attack
would trigger the collective defense response. [Allies still use their
**own** incident **standards** to **define cyber incidents**
and]{.underline} in some cases [do **not** make these **standards
public**]{.underline}. [This results in an **uneven response** and makes
it **difficult** for NATO and its allies to provide a
**unified**]{.underline}, **[Article 5 response]{.underline}** to cyber
incidents. Stoltenberg has defended this vague definition by stating
that, "a clearly defined threshold only invites attacks immediately
beneath it." This [clarification does not address the larger
issue]{.underline} of which attacks would trigger an Article 5 response,
[as NATO **already** defends against low-level cyber attacks
**daily**]{.underline}. **[Ambiguous guidelines]{.underline}** could
also [cause NATO to **misappropriate** responses to cyber
attacks]{.underline}, [leading to]{.underline} potentially
[**embarrassing** **overreactions** to minor incursions or **devastating
slow responses** to]{.underline} crippling [attacks]{.underline}.
Without a clear definition, NATO will struggle to respond to attacks. As
stated earlier, NATO's focus is on deterring attacks---to such an extent
that the cost of an attack would outweigh any benefits. However, this
focus has resulted in NATO lacking the offensive capabilities to respond
in the same capacity as its allies, like the United States.

2 The Applications of Space Platforms

Since the dawn of the space age, [outer space]{.underline} has been
regarded [as the **ultimate high ground**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} [could provide a]{.underline}
**[decisive]{.underline}** military [advantage to the State]{.underline}
[that retains **superiority**]{.underline} [over it]{.underline} \[2\].
[In the context of **NATO**]{.underline} [operations]{.underline}
**[space-based assets]{.underline}** [play an **essential
role**]{.underline}, [providing]{.underline} a [multitude of
services]{.underline} [for more]{.underline} [than 35
years]{.underline}. [Some of the **most advanced**]{.underline}
[space-faring States are]{.underline} [part of the
**alliance**]{.underline} \[3\]. It is highly anticipated that in the
next leaders' summit taking place in London NATO will recognize space as
a domain of warfare \[4\].

[Since NATO does]{.underline} [not **own any satellites**]{.underline}
in orbit, [it **relys** on services provided by
**governments**]{.underline}, military, civilian and commercial
entities. [NATO has]{.underline} [**terrestrial** SATCOM]{.underline}
[capabilities]{.underline} [and units]{.underline} (terrestrial SATCOM
anchor stations, transportable satellite ground terminals and
equipment). The C2 for SATCOM is managed by NATO Communication and
Information Agency (NCIA) and operated by NATO CIS Group (NCISG) \[5\].

[Space-based assets]{.underline} [function as **force
multipliers**]{.underline}, [providing **support**]{.underline} [and
crucial **information**]{.underline} [during]{.underline} the
[strategic]{.underline}, operational and [tactical levels of
war]{.underline}. According to the Allied Joint Doctrine for Air and
Space Operations, [space capabilities]{.underline} [provide a **wide
range** of applications]{.underline} [such as]{.underline}:
[global]{.underline}, strategic and [**intra-theatre**
satellite]{.underline} [communications]{.underline} (SATCOM);
**[positioning]{.underline}**, [navigation, and **timing**]{.underline}
(PNT) services; terrestrial and space environmental monitoring; space
situational awareness ([SSA]{.underline}); [intelligence]{.underline},
surveillance, [and **reconnaissance**]{.underline} (ISR); [NATO
**S**hared **E**arly **W**arning]{.underline} \[6\].

Notably, [one option that has not been **examined**]{.underline}
seriously [enough]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} current [space
debate is a **possible middle-ground**]{.underline} alternative [for
reducing]{.underline} spacecraft [vulnerability]{.underline}: [that of
**creating an allied space \"network**]{.underline}.\" Specifically,
[linking space capabilities]{.underline} [**first among**
formal]{.underline} U.S. [**military allies** and then]{.underline}
[perhaps]{.underline} [with other friendly]{.underline}
[nations]{.underline} [could]{.underline} greatly reduce (if not
**[eliminate]{.underline}**) [the risks of **single-point**]{.underline}
[failures to important]{.underline} space [systems]{.underline} [and
create]{.underline} [a **new form of space deterrence**]{.underline} [by
**raising the stakes**]{.underline} [for adversaries]{.underline}
[considering **launching attacks**]{.underline} on space assets. That
is, [by spreading **capabilities** among]{.underline}
[allies]{.underline} in space [through the creation of
**inter-operable**]{.underline}, [redundant]{.underline} networks of
[satellites]{.underline}, [including in the **military
sector**]{.underline}, space-based partnerships [could]{.underline}
reduce costs, [lessen **vulnerability**]{.underline}, [and raise the
challenges]{.underline} [facing]{.underline} would-be
**[attackers]{.underline}**, [thus **obviating** the]{.underline} [need
for expensive]{.underline} and destabilizing space-based
[weapons]{.underline}. This could provide considerable benefits in terms
of U.S. and allied space security and improve chances for developing
norms of peaceful international behavior.

Therefore, [it is [vital for Washington to work]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
its [allies]{.mark} [to establish]{.mark} [what]{.mark} specific
**[space behaviors]{.mark}** [will be considered]{.mark}
**[unacceptable]{.mark}** [and to]{.mark} **communicate**]{.underline}
--- [and **[enforce]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [[such standards]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} aggressive spacefaring nations like [Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}
[should]{.mark} work collectively to [prevent]{.mark} the [testing of
weapons in space]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [**[debris]{.mark}**
[generated]{.mark} from these tests [poses]{.mark} a [**threat**
to]{.mark} the **[satellites]{.mark}**]{.underline} of all spacefaring
nations. [If more nations begin testing anti-satellite
weapons]{.underline}, [[military space systems]{.mark} could be
[inadvertently damaged]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This [situation]{.mark}
could [lead to]{.mark} an [overall **escalation** in **preexisting
tension**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies providing a **clearly defined code
of conduct** for national security space activities is a **feasible**
and **necessary step** to take in the immediate term]{.underline}.
Certainly, though no one wants a war to begin in or extend into outer
space, ignoring this possibility would be extremely negligent. The
United States possesses highly sophisticated national security space
systems that will be a prime target for capable spacefaring adversaries
if a conflict should arise. In the past, the United States has presumed
it can and will fight alone in space --- but that is no longer
necessary. [[Washington can better ensure]{.mark} its **[dominance in
space]{.mark}** [if it]{.mark} more [fully **embraces**]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Washington would be wise to build a
coalition that creates a more robust system for monitoring the space
domain]{.underline}, [reacting to space threats]{.underline}, [and
prevailing in a war that extends into outer space]{.underline}. Building
a space coalition --- especially one that includes allies from Europe,
the Middle East, and Asia --- is no simple task. But, working towards
systems integration and also a common space doctrine is positive step
forward towards increased resiliency of the space systems that are
essential for precision warfighting. Of course, technical systems cannot
be the only focus of the coalition; it should also devote attention to
the development of norms for military space activity. Hyten has stated
that ["**[trying to fight alone in space would be a mistake]{.mark}**"
--- a mistake that we cannot afford to make]{.underline}.

Sandra **Erwin, 6-22** (Sandra Erwin, Senior Staff Writer at SpaceNews,
6-22-2022, accessed on 6-24-2022, SpaceNews, "DoD Satcom: Big money for
military satellites, slow shift to commercial services",
<https://spacenews.com/dod-satcom-big-money-for-military-satellites-slow-shift-to-commercial-services/>,
HBisevac)

The [Pentagon plans to spend nearly **\$13 billion**]{.underline} over
the next five years [to **develop** and **acquire** military
communications **satellites**]{.underline}. According to U.S. Department
of Defense budget documents, this large investment supports growing
demands for connectivity and secure data networks across the U.S. armed
forces and national security agencies. The 2023-2027 spending plan
includes funding for the Pentagon's first-ever low Earth orbit broadband
constellation and smaller numbers of bespoke communications satellites
to augment or replace existing systems. These procurements of bespoke
satellites, analysts and industry executives told SpaceNews, appear to
run counter to government claims that DoD is poised to transition away
from traditional satellite procurements toward greater reliance on
commercial space services. "I think it's fair to say that [this budget
**doesn't reflect** a **pivot** to a **greater adoption** of commercial
capabilities **in** **lieu** of government-owned and operated
capabilities]{.underline}," said Mike Tierney, industry analyst at the
defense and aerospace consulting firm Velos. Unlike satellite
acquisitions, commercial satcom services are funded through revolving
accounts on a year-to-year basis and are not forecast in budget line
items, Tierney noted, so it's difficult to predict future buys. Lt. Gen.
Michael Guetlein, commander of Space Systems Command, which oversees
Space Force satellite procurements, said he is pushing for change in a
culture that favors building systems in-house. The goal is to "buy what
we can and only build what we must," he said. "You will start to see
that shift, year to year, as we go forward." The satellite acquisitions
funded in the Space Force budget, he said, reflect priorities vetted and
approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "The one thing that is always
needed is more comm," he said. "We never have enough comm to get after
what we need to do. We need more comm to support the fight." Guetlein
said the satellite industry could expect more commercial satcom
opportunities in the coming years. The U.S. Space Force's Commercial
Satellite Communications Office (CSCO) said it plans to award nearly
\$2.3 billion in commercial satcom contracts over the next two years.
CSCO buys commercial satcom capacity and services for the U.S. armed
forces and allies. The largest of the commercial opportunities is an
\$875 million multiple-award deal for low Earth orbit satellite
broadband services over 10 years. The Space Force, in a 2020 vision
document, said satcom should be an "integrated enterprise" of military
and commercial systems. According to the document, "for those frequency
bands, coverage areas or specialized capabilities not offered by the
commercial satcom industry, purpose-built constellations and payloads
will be acquired." Making these buy-vs-build decisions "requires a
little bit of calculus," said Guetlein. "We've got to really understand
how that capability is going to be used in the future, in a time of
crisis or time of conflict. And can I depend on that capability?" "If I
cannot guarantee that it will be there when I need it, then I probably
need to own it, not lease it," Guetlein said. "If industry can guarantee
that that capability will be there in times of crisis or conflict, then
I can probably buy those services. And I would rather buy those services
than have to go build something myself." One reason to buy commercial
satcom services is that it adds layers of resilience, he said. "In a
conflict, it gives us proliferation. It gives us redundancy across our
networks." At a time when U.S. adversaries are stepping up cyber attacks
that threaten terrestrial and satellite-based networks, said Guetlein,
the Space Force and its satcom suppliers will be taking a "holistic
approach to cybersecurity and not just look at it in stovepipes." NEW
SATELLITE PROCUREMENTS The projected \$13 billion worth of satellite
procurements in the 2023-2027 defense budget pay for a mix of strategic
and tactical communications systems. The lion's share is for the Evolved
Strategic Satcom, or ESS, program. The Space Force plans to spend \$5.5
billion over five years to continue the development of three proposed
payloads and ground system concepts from Boeing, Lockheed Martin and
Northrop Grumman. The companies are expected to complete prototype
designs by 2025 and conduct in-space demonstrations. The Space Force
said it plans to field ESS in the early 2030s. The ESS will provide
highly secure communications lines for the most sensitive national
security operations, including nuclear command and control. Another
big-ticket item in the budget is \$2.2 billion for narrowband
satellites. The Space Force is looking to buy two more Mobile User
Objective System (MUOS) satellites that provide Ultra High Frequency
(UHF) communications. The U.S. Navy acquired four MUOS satellites ---
made by Lockheed Martin --- plus an on-orbit spare launched in 2016. The
program has since been transferred to the Space Force. MUOS supports
mobile users with voice and low-rate data transfer. Because the
satellites are oversubscribed, DoD wants to buy two more. The Space
Force is conducting an analysis of alternatives before it decides
whether to buy two more MUOS or opt for a new design. A Lockheed Martin
spokesperson said the company has kept its production line warm and is
"ready for the next acquisition." For secure tactical communications,
DoD is budgeting \$2.5 billion for Protected Tactical Service (PTS)
satellites and a ground system called Protected Tactical Enterprise
Service (PTES). Boeing and Northrop Grumman are developing PTS payloads
and Boeing is also the PTES prime contractor. Both companies are
expected to launch prototype payloads in 2024 for on-orbit
demonstrations. The ESS and PTS constellations are intended to augment
and eventually replace the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF)
satellites made by Lockheed Martin. The sixth and final AEHF satellite
was launched in March 2020. The AEHF satellites carry strategic
payloads, which must be able to operate in a nuclear war environment,
and tactical payloads for battlefield use. The plan is to disaggregate
the capabilities of AEHF into the ESS for strategic communications, and
the PTS for tactical users. The Space Force said the ESS satellites will
provide polar coverage, which AEHF does not. The military today relies
on two Northrop Grumman-developed Enhanced Polar System satellites to
extend the AEHF network over the North Pole. While military satellites
have mostly operated from geostationary orbits, [the Pentagon is now for
the first time building its own broadband constellation]{.underline} in
low Earth orbit that will connect users across the world. [The Space
Development Agency]{.underline}, which is overseeing the project, is
[budgeting \$2.7 billion]{.underline} over five years for the Transport
Layer, [a mesh network expected to have hundreds of small
satellites]{.underline}. Even though there are commercially available
broadband services, DoD's requirements are unique, said SDA Director
Derek Tournear. The Transport Layer satellites, for example, have to be
interoperable with the Link 16 tactical data link protocol that is only
used by the U.S. military and allies. "There's no commercial market for
Link 16 as far as I know. So that's one of the areas where it is mission
specific to the DoD," said Tournear. INTEGRATION OF MILITARY AND
COMMERCIAL The five-year budget plan includes \$257 million for
"commercial satcom integration," a funding line Congress created in 2019
in response to backlash from the commercial satcom industry after
appropriators funded a new Wideband Global Satcom (WGS) satellite that
DoD did not request. Congress added \$600 million in 2018 for WGS,
arguing that the Air Force at the time was not providing sufficient
satcom capacity to meet user demand. The integration line "is not huge
dollars, and it's not to buy commercial capacity, it's just to develop
standards and interfaces for the department to plan the architecture,"
said Tierney, the industry consultant. So far, it is not clear that the
desired hybrid networks are any closer to becoming a reality, he said.
The priorities in the budget suggest that DoD remains heavily invested
in military satcom and will rely on commercial services as a "relief
valve" when it needs additional capacity. "The giant pivot people were
hoping for is just not happening, at least not as quickly as commercial
operators would have liked," Tierney added. During a panel discussion at
an Air & Space Forces Association conference in March, Guetlein said
there'd been a running dialogue on how DoD should operate with
commercial space systems during a conflict. "When we were in Afghanistan
and Iraq, it was clear to us what was military, what was intelligence,
what was commercial, what was allied," he said. But the lines between
government and commercial could become more blurred if DoD starts buying
more commercial services, Guetlein said. "As we start going into the
space fight and seek space superiority, there are those in a camp that
says the government has to own all the capability on orbit," he said.
Some factions in DoD perceive commercial systems as being less
cyber-secure than government-owned systems, but that thinking will
change as the commercial sector continues to develop novel solutions to
protect networks, said Keith Alexander, founder and chairman of IronNet,
a cybersecurity consulting firm. Alexander, a retired Army general and
former director of the National Security Agency, said satcom providers
have to gradually build trust with government customers much like
commercial cloud providers Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure did
more than a decade ago when they started to pursue military and
intelligence contracts. Questions about the security of commercial
systems "was a big issue that we had with the cloud," said Alexander.
The government eventually warmed to the idea that it could have a "top
secret cloud with a commercial vendor. I think showing that we can do
the same thing with commercial satellite communications will get us to
the same place." COMMERCIAL SATCOM INVESTMENTS Peter Hoene, president
and CEO of SES Government Solutions, said the industry is investing
billions of dollars in new capabilities and DoD should be taking
advantage of them. SES, an operator of geostationary and
medium-Earth-orbit communications satellites, will be adding 11
high-capacity broadband satellites to its MEO constellation between 2022
and 2025. "Commercial satcom will likely never be a significant player
in nuclear command and control and some other high-end missions," Hoene
said, but for the bulk of its satcom needs, DoD should be using
commercial systems. The [Space Force procurement]{.underline} office,
CSCO, needs to "[explore **effective ways** to adopt longer term
contracts]{.underline}, purchasing commercial satcom more like fiber,"
he added. CSCO so far "[has **not met industry expectations** to explore
**deeper partnerships** to ensure **critical capacity** is available to
the warfighter when and where they need it]{.underline}," Hoene said.
"The acquisition process and the way the department procures commercial
satcom is not where we believe the DoD needs to be." SES in March made a
major move to expand its military business with the \$450 million
acquisition of satcom integrator Leonardo DRS Global Enterprise
Solutions, one of the largest providers of commercial services to the
U.S. government. Hoene said this acquisition allows SES to partner with
other companies in order to meet DoD demands for multiorbit satcom. "The
satellite communications market is becoming increasingly competitive,
particularly with the entrance of low Earth orbit providers like
Starlink, OneWeb, Telesat and Amazon Project Kuiper," he said. "We see
the importance of integrated GEO-MEO-LEO and managed service solutions
for DoD customers." CULTURE IS HARD TO CHANGE Craig Miller, president of
Viasat Government Systems, said the industry would have liked to see in
the 2023 budget an "increased focus on commercial satellite
communications, although we are seeing some motion in that direction."
"For many years, we've been talking to the Air Force when they were in
charge of this, and now with the formation of the Space Force, we're
working very hard to get them to understand the value of commercial,"
said Miller. Viasat is a global provider of satellite broadband and is
looking to sign up military customers for its new Viasat-3 geostationary
constellation of three highcapacity satellites. The first ViaSat-3,
projected to launch in early 2023, will cover the Americas, to be
followed later in the year by a second satellite to service Europe, the
Middle East and Africa. A third satellite will cover Asia. DoD could
save money by using high-capacity commercial satellites for tactical
communications instead of buying systems like PTS, said Miller.
"ViaSat-3 absolutely can meet the requirements of that system and the
anti-jam requirements that are associated with that." There are other
commercial LEO, MEO and GEO systems coming online that could meet the
PTS mission, Miller added. For narrowband L-band communications, there
is Iridium and Inmarsat, although they couldn't replace MUOS because the
military uses the UHF frequency band, and that spectrum is owned and
operated by governments. A spokesman for Iridium said the company's
mobile communications network could supplement MUOS coverage in the
polar regions. The company in 2019 won a seven-year \$738.5 million DoD
contract for unlimited usage of Iridium narrowband devices for an
unlimited number of subscribers. "Since users are already on the
contract, it's an affordable option for the Iridium network to
complement MUOS with Iridium narrowband services," said the spokesman.
"We have already tested the capabilities of voice-to-voice calls from
Iridium devices to MUOS." One problem facing commercial vendors is that
DoD buyers often are not aware of what the market offers, Miller said.
"We're really optimistic that they'll open their eyes to the value of
commercial satcom and they use it because they'll see how effective it
is. I think part of it is that they don't quite know what it's capable
of yet." "Culture change is really hard," Miller said. DoD doing "more
of the same rather than doing something new is normal. But all in all, I
think that we will see more adoption of commercial." DoD's strategy to
build a global network known as "joint all-domain command and control"
requires massive communications pipelines for data sharing that can't be
achieved only with government systems, Miller noted. "When you think
about a future peer conflict with China," Miller said, "[we have to be
in a position where we can **leverage**]{.underline} our commercial
[technological advantage and then spend our defense dollars on the
things that **absolutely need** defense dollars]{.underline}, [and not
**duplicate** **things** that are being developed in the **commercial
market**]{.underline}."

Here\'s What You Need to Know: [Space war]{.underline} strategy
[continues to receive **very large amounts** of
**attention**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
**[Pentagon]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} U.S. **[Space
Comm]{.underline}**and.

If a [Russian or Chinese]{.underline} Anti-Satellite
(**[ASAT]{.underline}**) weapon [**streamed** into space]{.underline}
[and exploded U.S. military satellites]{.underline}, friendly [forces
would **instantly**]{.underline} [become]{.underline} very
**[vulnerable]{.underline}** [to significant]{.underline} and extremely
[**destructive** enemy attacks]{.underline}....\-- space-based infrared
missile detection could be destroyed, GPS communications could be
knocked out, guided weapons could jam and derail before hitting their
targets and war-critical command and control could simply be "taken
out."

Any, all or part of this could [happen in as little as **10 to 15
minutes**]{.underline} once a satellite attacking missile is launched
from the ground. Lives will hang in the balance as alerts are sent
through U.S. command and control and decision-makers scramble to
determine the best countermeasure with which to protect its space
assets. [Space war is **no longer** a **distant** prospect]{.underline}
to envision years down the road \-\-- **[it is here]{.underline}**.

Recognizing the seriousness of this vulnerability, [the
**Pentagon**]{.underline}, [U.S. **Space Comm**and]{.underline},
**[M]{.underline}**issile **[D]{.underline}**efense
**[A]{.underline}**gency [and industry are **moving
quickly**]{.underline} [to integrate]{.underline}
**[M]{.underline}**achine **[L]{.underline}**earning [and
**AI**]{.underline} [into **space-based**]{.underline} systems and
[technology]{.underline}. The intention is to of course accelerate
threat detection and get crucial information to decision-makers.

#### The plan [shares]{.underline} the [resource burden]{.underline} with NATO\-\--[solving]{.underline} tradeoff.

Additionally, [space capabilities]{.underline} [and
operations]{.underline} [are **expensive**]{.underline}. [A **clear
advantage**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} military space
[partnerships]{.underline} [is that they **generate
opportunities**]{.underline} [for **sharing**]{.underline} the
[financial **burden**]{.underline} [of operating in space]{.underline}.
As an example, the United States putting its security payloads on the
Norwegian satellite will reportedly generate up to \$900 million in
savings.17 [Hosting U.S. payloads]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [foreign
systems]{.underline}, like this example, [represents an **area** in
which]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could **leverage**]{.underline} allied and
[partner capabilities]{.underline} [more so than it **does
currently**]{.underline}. Hosted payloads offer affordable means to
expand protected communications satellites; position, navigation, and
timing satellites; and space situational awareness capabilities, among
other systems. Rather than host payloads, [partners can]{.underline}
also **[simply contribute]{.underline}** [to the cost]{.underline} of a
satellite system. For example, through multilateral agreements, Canada,
Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and New Zealand provided funding
for the U.S. Wideband Global SATCOM-9 satellite that launched in March
2017.18 Or the United States can use partners' satellites. For example,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[partners with **Japan**]{.underline} [and **Europe**]{.underline} [to
obtain]{.underline} weather [information]{.underline} [from
**space-based sensors**]{.underline}, [providing]{.underline}
**[accurate]{.underline}** weather [information to
warfighters]{.underline} around the world and **[avoiding]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} [need to field **additional**]{.underline} U.S.
[systems]{.underline}.19 And **[it is not just satellites]{.underline}**
[and payloads]{.underline}. [Partners have **terrestrial
infrastructure**]{.underline} [and user]{.underline}
[equipment]{.underline}, including for **[position]{.underline}**,
[navigation]{.underline}, [and **timing**]{.underline} and satellite
communications, [that can be used **collectively**]{.underline} [to
achieve needed capabilities]{.underline} [more
**efficiently**]{.underline}. Leveraging allied systems can offer
technological insights, system improvements, and capability expansions
at lower costs.

These days, [despite]{.underline} the **[hyper-partisan]{.underline}**
[atmosphere in **Washington**]{.underline}, [there]{.underline} still
[seem to be **two issues**]{.underline} [that both]{.underline}
**[Dem]{.underline}**ocrat**[s]{.underline}** and
**[Repub]{.underline}**lican**[s]{.underline}** can **[agree
on]{.underline}**. [One is the]{.underline} pervasive threat posed by
the **[P]{.underline}**eople's **[R]{.underline}**epublic of
**[C]{.underline}**hina. [The other is the]{.underline}
**[overarching]{.underline}** [importance of **space**]{.underline}.

[When]{.underline} Vice President [Kamala **Harris**]{.underline}

**[N]{.underline}**ational **[S]{.underline}**pace
**[P]{.underline}**olicy **[C]{.underline}**ouncil meeting last month,
[her **comments**]{.underline} --- along with the simultaneously
released U.S. Space Priorities Framework --- **[largely
echoed]{.underline}** the [space policy]{.underline} [**launched** by
the]{.underline} [Trump administration]{.underline}. That was not
necessarily a given, since a continuation of policy is never a guarantee
during presidential transitions. But the Biden administration's
acknowledgement is great news for the rekindling of America's space
program and strategy.

[The **emphasis** is **logical**]{.underline}. [Although]{.underline}
[news about space]{.underline} [is]{.underline} all **[too often
dominated]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} headlines of [the **latest**
Russian]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**nti-**[sat]{.underline}**ellite
[test]{.underline} or milestone in China's space program, [the domain
is]{.underline} already **[ubiquitous]{.underline}** --- [and

on space**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} our [financial
**transactions**]{.underline}, daily **[navigation]{.underline}**,
[weather]{.underline} [notifications]{.underline}, TV services, [and
**telecommunications**]{.underline}. Today, the global space economy is
estimated at \$450 billion annually --- a figure that has doubled over
the previous decade. This, however, is just the beginning. The economic
value of space is poised to soar, entering the trillions annually over
the course of the next two decades.
