#### Feminist scholars have been collecting data and working to over throw the current system

How has the way you understand the world changed over time, and what (or
who) prompted the most significant shifts in your thinking?

I have lived long enough and through enough epistemological shifts that
have chipped away at modernist understandings of the world to be wary of
progress narratives. That it appears the world is being revisited by the
ghosts of overt patriarchy, racism, and fascism and even the ghosts of
nuclearism just when it seemed that all kinds of human rights, gender
equality, humanitarian, and environmental protection norms were being
secured at the international level is, on one level, dizzying, but on
another level, not surprising. [It is not as if feminist scholars have
not been steadily documenting largely unabated levels of violence,
impoverishment, and disposability experienced by women and
feminized/racialized others throughout the world, but particularly in
the Global South, which belies simplistic "success" stories. It is also
not as if feminists have not been tracking the feminization of men's
labour and the self- and other- destruction associated with this. And it
is not as if feminists have not also been repeatedly raising concerns
about the enclosures and depoliticizations of feminism as it moves
through the halls of power within the (neo)liberal order that can
undermine it as an oppositional force and thus vulnerabilize it to
assaults, particularly from the religious and nationalist right that
have been going on for some time.]{.underline}

Knowing all of this, in recent work I have been doing with Marysia
Zalewski we ask why the (re)emergence of what we shorthand as
"Trump-time" has been met with such incredulity. We work with the
spectral to consider how ghosts of virulent masculinity and constrained
and constraining femininity are always with and haunting us, but also
how other, more oppositional spirits are always present as well. In
earlier work together (e.g.,[Taking Feminist Violence Seriously in
International
Relations](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14616742.2013.766102)),
[we raise the spectre of feminist violence, which seems to be an
oxymoron given the normalized association between women and peace and
the normative association between feminism and nonviolence. This brings
to the fore the continued excesses of feminist thought to do epistemic
violence to bounded and secured knowledge and attempts to bind and
secure feminism and even render it "post" or dead.]{.underline}

#### Even if liberal feminism was somewhat successful, it coopted the true issue 

Marysia **Zalewski**, 20**18** (Zalewshi, author and professor of
International Relations at Cardiff University. "Feminist Approaches to
International Relations Theory in the Post-Cold War Period" part of [The
Age of Perplexity: Rethinking the World We Knew]{.underline}
<https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/feminist-approaches-to-international-relations-theory-in-the-post-cold-war-period/>
/// MF)

How has liberal feminism fared in global politics? [There are many women
political leaders now, still a minority if perhaps a decreasing one.
Women serve in large numbers in militaries around the world and the bans
on women serving in close combat are disappearing almost
daily]{.underline}.5 [Gender as a concept has been mainstreamed in the
thinking and practice of many national governments and international
organisations.]{.underline} The United Nations is a key actor here, not
least since the ground-breaking Security Council Resolution 1325
introduced in 2000 which was the first formal and legal document from
the Security Council that required parties in a conflict to prevent
violations of women's rights, to support women's participation in peace
negotiations and in post-conflict reconstruction, and to protect women
and girls from sexual and gender-based violence.6 The two most recent
relevant Resolutions include SCR 2106&SCR 2122 both in 2013.7

[In many ways the success of liberal feminism seems clear. Though for
many feminist international relations scholars, this success is dubious.
It is the case that the majority of feminist scholars welcome inclusive
practices for women, rather the troubling issue relates to the tacit
acceptance of conventional (oftentimes articulated as 'malestream')
political and theoretical agendas and practices]{.underline}. Plus, the
acceptance of the standard of 'human', which is, by historical default,
most often elite, white and male. [As a corollary, liberal feminist work
tends to support the invisibility and lesser worth of women's
traditional lives, behaviours and work, be default ignoring the
imbalances and biases and discriminations this wreaks upon many women
globally. In the current geo-political order, liberal feminism has, many
argue, been co-opted in the service of neo-liberal agendas and
practices]{.underline}. I will return to this point.

#### UN actions are too narrow and don't really create any real change 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender and Global
Security, pg. 105 /// MF)

[Perhaps most problematic for disrupting the gendered division of
violence is that gender and especially sexual violence is repeatedly
reduced to violence against women in the WPS agenda, upholding the "sex
essentialism" that renders the idea that women can be perpetrators,
including rapists, unimaginable]{.underline} (Sjoberg 2016) and
misrepresenting much wartime rape as organized, and thus controllable by
international policy and punishments, rather than seeing it as part of
the disorganization of war itself which is not placed under indictment
(Baaz and Stern 2013). Indeed, as sexual violence and contraction of
HIV/AIDS in war have become securitized[, the agenda is simply to
"protect women" from these in wartime (not in peacetime), increasing the
power of already powerful states to punish others while regulating
rather than actually addressing the inequalities and injustices that
enable these violences]{.underline} (Jansson 2017). [Ultimately, the WPS
agenda reproduces very narrow constructions of gender and gender
violence that do not disturb and, in fact, reinforce the international
order that is productive of gender harms]{.underline} (Shepherd 2008).

#### Previous shifts are not enough, we need a full transition to overcome the mistakes of the past 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender and Global
Governance, pg 53/// MF)

[These points suggest how this shift in analysis, in turn, shifted
strategies]{.underline}: from "adding women" to formal power structures
to valorizing feminine traits in order to redefi ne politics from
"power-over" to "power-to" (also known as "power-with" or enabling
power) and change the standards of political behavior in favor of
interdependence and cooperation[. Still, this left intact a lingering
and limiting referent to "women" that did not de-homogenize the category
to recognize power diff erentials among women and the power some women
hold over some men. It also left intact the association of embodied
women with feminine values, which, on the one hand, led to essentialist
assumptions about women as cure-alls for social (and global) ills and,
on the other hand, positioned certain embodied men (largely non-Western,
non-white, and/or lower class) as the villains of the piece. In the
process, attention is defl ected from the complicity of both women and
men---particularly those with the most power and privilege---in
contributing to global ills. It also misrepresents feminist politics as
exclusively about women rather than about resisting gender and gendered
hierarchies and the ills they cause globally.]{.underline} This is not
to say that raising the status of women and other subjugated people---in
politics and other facets of life---is not necessary to increase formal
representation and better equalize voice, but to note that [it is
insuffi cient if there is no attendant ideological shift away from
politics as power-over to politics that enables resistance to and
transformation of global politics-as-usual, which the power of gender
sustains.]{.underline}

#### AI reinforces gendered hierarchies and ideas

analysis, BA in political science and international studies, women's
rights advocate and research fellow of the Catalyst Information Center.

Reinforces Gender Stereotypes (Trend Brief)" Catalyst. December 5, 2019.

AI is What We Design It to Be

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been heralded as a tool that can
enhance human capacities and improve
services,[1](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-23058) influence
the future of
work,[2](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-23058) create
jobs,[3](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-23058) and
serve as an equalizer by reducing bias in decisions by making
predictions with algorithms based on
data.[4](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-23058) Yet
[AI, ultimately, is what humans design it to be, learn, and do. This
means that AI, by definition, is not neutral. Rather, it reflects the
biases held by those who build it, reinforcing stereotypes based on
those
biases.]{.underline}[5](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-23058)

Stereotypes are widely held, oversimplified generalizations about a
group of
people.[6](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-23058) This
sort of "shorthand" categorization is based on the assumption that all
members of a particular group are the same. Whether explicitly or
implicitly, when stereotypes influence our perceptions and
decision-making, members of stereotyped groups can be disadvantaged, and
damage can be
done.[7](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-23058)

Women Take Care and Men Take Charge

[Gendered stereotypes result in sexism and can create structural
barriers that perpetuate workplace gender
inequality.]{.underline}[8](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-23058) [One
example of a gendered stereotype is that women are more nurturing than
men.]{.underline}[9](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-23058) Over
time, the societally pervasive stereotype that "women take care, men
take charge" can embed itself in organizational cultures and norms,
and---whether at home or in the workplace---women are viewed as more
likely to be caretakers, which often negatively impacts women's
careers.[10](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-23058)

A[s we interact with AI in our daily lives, AI has the power to
unintentionally reinforce gendered
stereotypes.]{.underline}[11](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-23058) Catalyst
research finds that women leaders perceived as nurturing or emotional
are liked but not considered competent. [This "double bind" can lead to
women's occupational segregation and lack of advancement
opportunities]{.underline}.[12](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-23058) [A
study on human-robot interactions found that AI reinforced the double
bind dilemma. Participants rated robots that were assigned an explicit
gender---either stereotypically male personality traits (confident and
assertive) or stereotypically female personality traits (agreeable and
warm). Participants rated the male-identified robot as more trustworthy,
reliable, and competent than the female robot; the female robot was
rated as more
likeable.]{.underline}[13](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-23058)

While users do not necessarily prefer robots of a certain gender, they
do prefer robots whose "occupations" and "personalities" match
stereotypical gender
roles.[14](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-23058) For
example, people respond better to healthcare service robots identified
as female and security service robots identified as
male.[15](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-23058)

[Digital voice assistants, such as Siri and Alexa, are often designed
with female names and gendered voices. Their role is to perform tasks
that have traditionally been assigned to women,]{.underline} such as
scheduling appointments and setting
reminders.[16](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-23058)[ Designing
these assistants consistently with a female voice can reinforce
traditional gender
roles[17](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-23058) and
may even lead to biased hiring of women in service or assistant-type
jobs.]{.underline}[18](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-23058)

Additionally, how we speak to our digital assistants can influence
societal norms. [Abusive, insulting, or sexual language can normalize
the way we speak to each other and particularly to women, while the
tolerant or passive responses by feminized digital assistants to this
language can reinforce stereotypes of the compliant and forgiving
woman.]{.underline}[19](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-19-23058)

AI Reinforces Gendered Roles and Occupations

[Word embedding is an example of how machine learning can reinforce
gender stereotypes. AI identifies words close to each other and uses
them as a frame of reference]{.underline}. Recently Apple's iOS
automatically offered an emoji of a businessman when users typed in the
word "CEO." When AI finds words like "CEO" near the word "man" multiple
times, it learns this association and links these words going
forward.[20](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-20-23058)

Princeton University found that AI's word associations can reinforce
stereotypes on everything from what internet search results we receive
to hiring decisions we make. [Princeton researchers measured AI's word
associations and found gender stereotypes in the word
choices.]{.underline}[21](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-21-23058) The
word "nurse," for instance, was highly associated with the words "women"
and "nurturing." Meanwhile, the word "doctor" was more often associated
with "men." AI learns these contextual associations through the data
provided to it by programmers who are predominantly white and male.
[It's possible that gender bias could occur if an AI recruiting system
begins to use these word associations to accept nurse candidates with
female names at a higher
rate.]{.underline} [22](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-22-23058)

[Even AI translation services reveal gender-occupation stereotypes when
translating languages without gender-specific pronouns, such as Chinese
and Turkish]{.underline}. In this example, researchers found that AI
also assumed "nurse," "nanny," and "teacher" all to be
women.[23](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-23-23058)

Machines taught by photo-based image-recognition software also quickly
learn gender bias. In a recent study at the University of Virginia,
images that depict activities such as cooking, shopping, and washing
were more likely to be linked to women while images of shooting or
coaching were more likely linked to men. [Researchers further tested the
data sets and discovered that the AI not only reflected the unconscious
stereotypes of its creators but
actually amplified them]{.underline}.[24](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-24-23058)

Where Do We Go from Here?

AI Industry Diversification: As of 2018, [women comprise only 22% of AI
professionals
globally]{.underline}.[25](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-25-23058) [The
lack of gender diversity in the AI field hinders the industry's ability
to catch gender bias and stereotyping during AI machine learning and
database
design]{.underline}.[26](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-26-23058)[ An
important first step to begin to mitigate the impact of AI-reinforced
bias and stereotypes is for the AI industry to increase representation
of women and other underrepresented groups in its
workforce.]{.underline}

Business Policies, Procedures, and Practices: The number of businesses
using AI increased by 60% between 2017 and 2018, but "only half of
businesses across the \[United States\] and Eope have policies and
procedures in place to identify and address ethical
considerations---either in the initial design of AI applications or in
their behavior after the system is
launched."[27](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-27-23058) While
providing clear benefits, AI is not a technological utopia. It is
important for organizations to develop policies and procedures to
address ethical concerns that arise from the application of AI in their
business models. It is equally important that businesses identify and
utilize tools to review for unwanted bias in their data sets and
machine-learning
models.[28](https://www.catalyst.org/research/ai-gender-stereotypes/#easy-footnote-bottom-28-23058)

### AT: binaries 

#### Binaries are simply constructed -- the k observes the social constructions around the ideas of gender, it doesn't reinforce the ideas of binaries 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pgs 6-7
/// MF)

[Finally, the specifi c meanings and values conferred on masculinity and
femininity have also changed over time as well as across
cultures.]{.underline} For example, Western ideals of "manliness" have
undergone historical shifts: from the early Greeks through the feudal
period, the emphasis of idealized masculinity was on military heroism
and political prowess through male bonding and risk-taking; whereas more
modern meanings of masculinity have stressed "competitive individualism,
reason, self-control or self-denial, combining respectability as
breadwinner and head of household with calculative rationality in public
life" (Hooper 1998: 33). [This does not mean, however, that older
meanings have gone away, as unbridled military toughness and financial
risk-taking can come once again to the fore in times of war and economic
restructuring.]{.underline} Moreover, not all cultures have associated
such conceptions of masculinity with leadership qualities: "queen
mothers" in Ghana and "clan mothers" in many Native American societies
have been accorded power and leadership roles in these matrilineal
contexts on the basis of the feminine quality of regeneration of the
people and the land (Okojo 1994: 286; Guerrero 1997: 215). [Furthermore,
there is some play in gender roles even within patrilineal or
patriarchal cultures, given that men are not exclusively leaders and
warriors and women are not exclusively in charge of maintaining the home
and caring for children. Cultures also vary in the play allowed to the
display of non-conforming gender behavior, such as that not associated
with a person's assigned sex;]{.underline} sometimes even "third
genders" are revered. Polities also vary in terms of acceptance of and
resources available to people who choose to change their assigned sex.
[Due to the variation in meanings attached to femininity and
masculinity, we know that expressions of gender are not "fi xed" or
predetermined; the particulars of gender are always shaped by
context.]{.underline}

Because models of appropriate gender behavior are diverse, [we know that
femininity and masculinity are not timeless or separable from the
contexts in which they are embodied, acted out, and observed. This
illustrates how gender rests not on biological sex differences but on
interpretations or constructions of behavior that are culturally
specific, that shift as contexts change, and that typically have little
to do with biological differences, which themselves are not fixed as
some bodies are born neither "male" nor "female" and gender and sex
assignments can be altered. In short, there are multiple genders and
gender orderings, but gender is always raced, classed, sexualized, and
nationalized, just as race, class, sexuality, and nationality are always
gendered. Hence, gender analysis must avoid stereotyping]{.underline}
(or reducing people to unfounded caricatures), essentializing (or
assuming "natural" and unchanging characteristics), [and singling out
any one identity as descriptive of a whole person. Instead, gender
analysis must adopt intersectional analyses to make sense of our
multiple, crosscutting, and differentially valorized
identities.]{.underline} However, these variations still rest on
concepts of gender differences and do not necessarily disrupt the power
of gender as an oppositional dichotomy and as a relation of inequality.

#### A gendered lens is a prereq to solving the existing dichotomies -- only the alt solves 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender(ed) Lenses on
Global Politics, pgs 39-40/// MF)

[This is what is meant by mutually reinforcing: the dichotomy of gender
gains its natural-ness by being grounded in the assumption of
essentialized sex diff erence; gendered orderings are normalized by
being reproduced throughout social life; dichotomies gain their
taken-for-granted and even desirable status]{.underline} by being
privileged in modernist thought and acquiring credibility through the
"reality" of pervasive gendered diff erentiation. [The mutually
reinforcing interplay of essentializing sex, dichotomizing gender, and
the binary logic of positivism generates the constellation of dimensions
of the meta-lens of the power of gender. Recog-nizing the power of these
coding and fi ltering devices is crucial for improving our ability to
see beyond essentialized identities and oppositional "wholes." Thus,
feminists argue that dichotomized thinking cannot be adequately
understood, critiqued, or eff ectively transformed without addressing
how sex-diff erentiated gender grounds, naturalizes, and reproduces
binary thinking.]{.underline}

### AT: essentialism 

#### A gendered lens for international relations avoids essentialism 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pg 8///
MF)

[Contemporary feminist scholars engage in intersectional analysis to
avoid the practice of "essentialism," or the assumption that, for
example, all women or all men or all those within a given race or class
share the same experiences and interests.]{.underline} Only by
recognizing how, for example, some women have benefi ted by the racial,
class, sexual, and national origin oppres-sion of other women, whereas
many men subordinated by these very characteristics still exercise
gender oppression, can we advance a more comprehensive notion of gender
equality that sees it as indivisible from racial, class, and sexual
equality and equality among nations. [Thus, a sole focus on gender
equality can fail to address other sources of inequality (such as race
and class discrimination) that disadvantage certain groups of women. At
the same time, when such eff orts blame only men, and mostly non-elite
men, for gender inequality and fail to address forms of discrimination
that subordinated men experience]{.underline} (based on class, race,
and/or sexuality), then subordinated men may withhold support for gender
equality. [A narrow focus on gender equality also maintains the power of
gender, even as the socio-economic positionings of some women and men
may be somewhat altered, as is addressed more in this
chapter.]{.underline}

#### A gendered lens avoids essentialism and universalism 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pgs 8-9
/// MF)

[Contemporary feminist scholars engage in intersectional analysis to
avoid the practice of "essentialism," or the assumption that, for
example, all women or all men or all those within a given race or class
share the same experiences and interests.]{.underline} Only by
recognizing how, for example, some women have benefi ted by the racial,
class, sexual, and national origin oppres-sion of other women, whereas

equality. [A narrow focus on gender equality also maintains the power of
gender, even as the socio-economic positionings of some women and men
may be somewhat altered, as is addressed more in this
chapter.]{.underline}

[Another reason to avoid essentialism is also to avoid "universalism,"
or universal prescriptions for how to achieve comprehensive gender
equality]{.underline}. Not only do women not share the same experiences
or interests as a result of their multiple identities derive from their
differing social locations in the world, but also the sociopolitical,
cultural, and historical con-texts in which women live vary
significantly, requiring varying strategies for social change[. These
complex realities have made many feminists skeptical of resorting to
"global" solutions just as they have recognized that "global" problems
take many and differing "local" forms to which agents of social change
must be attentive to create context-specific and context-sensitive
solutions that do not backfire]{.underline} (Grewal and Kaplan 1994).

#### Fem IR isn't rooted in essentialism -- rather its rooted in historical ways of thinking like activists 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender and Global
Security, pg 84/// MF)

[Feminist IR approaches to war and violence and peace and security, as
refl ected in FSS scholarship, have their roots especially in the
thinking of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century women peace
theorists and activists. Many of these early thinkers and activists
based their arguments against war on women's maternalist desires to
protect their children from the ravages of war, neither wanting their
sons to become cannon fodder nor their daughters to suff er from the
destruction of families and communities]{.underline} (Pierson 1987). For
those who were steeped in the biological determinism characteristic of
nineteenth- and early twentieth-century thought, these maternalist
desires were seen as innate, making women "natural" peace support-ers
and peacemakers. [Maternalist arguments continued through the Cold War,
when women's peace organizations sought to protect future generations
from the threat of nuclear war, and into the present day, but more
recent feminist peace researchers and activists have argued that
maternalism is not innate but rather the result of women being made
largely responsible for "maternalist practices" or caring work, whether
or not they have children]{.underline} (Ruddick 1984). [This makes them
more likely to have empathy for "others" and the world's children and to
be against war and its destructive power. Contemporary feminist IR
scholars examining mater-nalism in national and international
politics]{.underline} (Carreon and Moghadam 2015) [refer to this as
"political motherhood" and make a distinction between grassroots
motherhood politics, which seek to emancipate the nation from unjust
rule and/or to bring peace through increas-ing women's political voice
and agency, and state-led, patriarchal motherhood politics which
advocate keeping women in the home]{.underline} or expecting them to
uphold heteronormative patriarchal family values to serve as
conservative symbols of the nation.

#### Simply adding women into academia fails 

Anne **Runyan**, 20**19** (Runyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Interview -- Anne Sisson Runyan"

This year's campaign
theme [#BalanceforBetter](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/Theme) calls
for a gender-balanced world. What do you think is the biggest barrier to
achieving gender-balance in academia?

Of course, gender parity across all institutions is necessary as a
matter of fair representation and non-asymmetrical access to power and
resources that could potentially lead to reassessments of how power and
resources are used. [However, the appeal for gender balance does not
take into account hierarchical differences among those who identify as
women and those who identify as men (or neither) and it appears to
summon a notion of gender complementarity as opposed to equality, which
also appears to rest on essentialist notions of women and men. Moreover,
it seems to occlude questions of gender balance for what and under what
conditions.]{.underline}

[Thus, when we consider gender balance in academia, we need to consider
how it is being restructured as a site of more flexibilized and
casualized labor (long referred to as the "feminization" of labor) and
from which public resources are continually withdrawn.]{.underline} This
is happening just as women are outpacing men as undergraduates and
achieving parity with them in graduate and professional programs, with
the exception of most of the STEM fields, in much of the global North
and about half of the global South where women still outpace men as
illiterates (see, for example, [UN Women's Progress of the World's Women
2015-2016

[In the
US, [trends](https://www.aaup.org/NR/rdonlyres/08E023AB-E6D8-4DBD-99A0-24E5EB73A760/0/persistent_inequity.pdf) observed
almost a decade ago and that have continued and continue to worsen
include the rise of contingent faculty labour in academe, with
three-quarters of instructional faculty not in tenure track positions
and half working part-time, the majority of whom in both categories are
women. Women are also least represented in the upper echelons of the
professoriate, in university administration, and in professional
organizations and over-represented in teaching positions and service
work (vs. research-oriented jobs), the humanities (which have become
increasingly devalued), and the least prestigious institutions and
lowest level institutions, while pay gaps increase between women and men
the higher the level of the position.]{.underline} Thus, where some
level of parity is occurring it is at the lowest and most contingent
levels and under deteriorating labour conditions for women and men in
academe.

[For gender parity in representation and pay in academe to have any
meaning, there is a need to resist the feminization of labour in
academe, which is deeply connected to the withdrawal of public resources
for it and undermines career paths for the women who are now swelling
the ranks of undergraduate and graduate students and taking on the
greatest student debt in the process.]{.underline} This is also
occurring as gender studies in the academy is under major attack in the
context of the rise of illiberal democracies, with Hungary recently
banning it outright.

[In Chapter 1 , the concepts of a gender lens and more intersectional
gendered lenses were introduced and elaborated on in terms of the
immensity and complexity of power relations and structures we see in
global politics when we use them and why it is important to not only
attend to the masculine/feminine dichotomous and hierarchical dynamic at
work in global politics past and present, but also the way this is
enlarged upon and complicated by interre-lated dynamics of racial,
sexual, class, and nationality divisions and hierarchies.]{.underline}
In this chapter, background is provided on why and how gender and
gendered lenses emerged in the study of IR, how they challenge
conventional IR lenses, and what signifi cant understandings such
lenses, and the research they have generated, have revealed about how
the power of gender works in the study and practice of global politics.

[As argued in the introductory chapter, the power of gender is an
especially resilient and adaptive fi ltering and organizing mechanism, a
meta-lens that produces particular ways of seeing, thinking, and acting
in the world. Gender may feature in policymaking, women and men may be
repositioned, and ideal forms of masculinity may shift, but as long as
the power of gender as a meta-lens continues to operate, it will produce
and reproduce inequalities, injustices, and crises of global
proportion.]{.underline} Here the central case made is that feminist
lenses , and particularly intersectional ones, often in concert with
other lenses critical of conventional IR approaches, are necessary to
reveal the extent of the power of gender to produce and obscure
inequalities and the global crises that ensue from and sustain
inequalities.

#### Addressing the structural issues, specifically the language used in IR is key to progress

Global Politics, pgs 42-43/// MF)

Asking initially "Where are the women?" and subsequently "adding
women"---and com-paring their positions to those of men---were and
remain productive orientations. They make embodied women (and men)
visible in our picture of world politics, illuminate how women and men
are diff erently engaged with and aff ected by international politics,
and reveal women as agents and activists, as well as victims of
sociocultural, economic, and political oppres-sions. [But adding women
to existing paradigms also raised deeper questions by exposing how the
conceptual structures themselves presuppose masculine experience and
perspective. For example, women/femininity cannot simply be added to
constructions that are constituted as masculine: the public sphere,
rationality, political identity, objectivity, "economic man." Either
women as feminine cannot be added]{.underline} (e.g., women must become
like men) [or the con-structions themselves are transformed]{.underline}
(e.g., adding women as feminine alters the masculine premise of the
constructions and changes their meaning). [In this sense, the exclusions
of fem-ininity are not accidental or coincidental but rather are
required for the analytical consistency of reigning explanatory
frameworks.]{.underline}

[The lesson that emerges from these studies is that we cannot
systemically add women without rethinking gender---recognizing it not
only as an empirical category or variable but also as an analytical
category and governing code. Doing so requires acknowledging the
constitutive power of language,]{.underline} which is most eff ectively
addressed through a feminist poststructuralist (sometimes referred to as
postmodern) lens. [This redirects our attention from adding women and
deploying sex as a variable to analyzing gender as a category of mental
ordering that produces masculinity and femininity as hierarchical power
relations.]{.underline} In eff ect, examining "the woman question" leads
us to examine "the man question," which, as argued in this text, leads
us to examine questions of "race," "class," "sexuality," and
"nationality" as well. [Doing so requires acknowledging
intersectionality]{.underline}, derived from anti-racist and
postcolonial feminist thought, [as a necessary analytic]{.underline},
which is also further illuminated through poststructuralist lenses. As
used in this text, poststructuralist lenses in general reject
essentialized categories, unitary meanings, sovereign claims,
universalizing solutions, and presumptions of (foundational) objectivity
associated with positivist and modernist commit-ments. Moreover,
feminist poststructuralists criticize the residual essentialism that
haunts references to "women" and other "identity-based" groups,
rendering them homogeneous, undiff erentiated wholes and erasing
hierarchies within as well as across all groups.

#### Adding women reinforces essentialism and doesn't result in change 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender and Global
Security, pgs. 105-106 /// MF)

[On the other side of the coin, as Whitworth (2004) argues based on her
study of Canadian peacekeeping operations, the UN's new interest in
"adding women and stirring" simply grafts on (essentialist) gender
analysis, which assumes women will just ease and assist the already
predetermined business of peacekeeping and peace negotiations by
bringing information on women and "women's issues" into these
activities.]{.underline} This predetermined business disregards any
considerations of militarized masculinity as a major source of prolonged
confl ict or such sources of structural violence as neocolonial economic
and political relationships and neolib-eral economic restructuring that
may lie at the heart of the confl ict (Whitworth 2004: 133, 137).
Instead, this business focuses on "when the fi ghting broke out" and how
to control, if not cease, it (Whitworth 2004: 133). [Thus, rather than
causing a rethinking of peacekeeping and peace negotiations, "analyses
of women and of gender thus become part of the 'programmatic solutions'
that form the UN repertoire of responding to confl ict and insecurity
around the world, and, in this way, confi rm the appropriateness of the
repertoire"]{.underline} (Whitworth 2004: 137). [In this sense, like
gender equality that is subsumed under neoliberal governmentality,
gender perspectives on international peace and security are subsumed
under a kind of security governmentality.]{.underline} Nine out of 11
peace agreements by 2005 had involved some focus on including women and
providing for their security (mostly with respect to sexual violence),
although that dropped to six out of nine agreements by 2010 (Ellerby
2017: 36--37). [But the tenuous and minimalist nature of treating women
as add-ons to an overall approach to simply managing confl icts
underscores Whitworth's conclusion that the issue is not so much adding
more women to peacekeeping and peacemaking operations as it is
questioning the sole reli-ance on militaries to do the job of
peacekeeping and, by extension, on military leaders and civilian defense
elites to do the job of peacemaking]{.underline} (2004: 183).

#### Fem IR has a larger agenda to solve for a litany of risk but the state co-opts it 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender and Global
Security, pg. 88/// MF)

[The too easy devolution of security into continual justifi cations for
violence has also led to feminist wariness of new processes of
"securitization" associated with a widening security
agenda.]{.underline} On the one hand, the application of the term
security to an issue elevates it to a matter of "high politics," as
security (matters of war and peace) has traditionally held pride of
place in IR theory and practice. [Thus, relatively new conceptions of
human security and environmental security, and even more recently, food,
water, energy, and health security, have brought welcome international
attention to sources of structural violence that undermine the
well-being of people and the planet. On the other hand, there is also a
tendency to reduce these once again to state security matters to be
handled not through more collective and more non-violent means, but more
typically through war or some approximation of it. Resource wars, wars
on terror, wars on AIDS, wars on drugs, and so on all follow a similar
logic.]{.underline} As Zillah Eisenstein argues, the logic of war of any
kind is "opposition, diff erentiation, and the other-ing of peoples"
(2007: 25). [Thus, gendering, racialization, classing, and sexualizing
go on unabated]{.underline} (and become even more pronounced) [in order
to affi x blame and control, contain, and quarantine these "new"
threats.]{.underline} For example, racial profi ling becomes a weapon in
the "war on terror," targeting sexual minorities and sex workers becomes
the focus of the war on AIDS, and peasant farmers become casualties of
the war on drugs. [Still, some feminist IR scholars see value in
employing such concepts as human and environmental security through an
intersectional gender lens that reveals the interrelationships between a
range of insecuri-ties produced by and through state
security]{.underline} (Tripp, Ferree, and Ewig 2013; Detraz 2012, 2015).

Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

[As feminist IR lenses have shifted, combined, and recombined through a
greater multiplicity of theoretical voices and orientations---creating
their own productive tensions---subjects of feminist IR inquiry have
also shifted]{.underline}. Tickner (2006) expresses this in generational
terms: fi [rst-generation feminist IR scholars tended to focus on
deconstructing key concepts in IR---sovereignty, the state, security,
development, and the economy---exposing or unpacking their masculinist
bias and underpinnings]{.underline}. Through these openings that put
gender inquiry on the IR map, [second-generation scholars have applied
gender analysis---often in more intersectional ways---to a range of
global politics topics both familiar]{.underline} (alliance
constructions, state militaries, peacekeeping, peace agreements, trade
agreements, UN conventions) [and unfamiliar]{.underline} (sex tourism
and sex work, homework and domestic service, migration, social
movements, and even world art, popular culture, and the cruise
industry). 3 [In doing so, these scholars have not only greatly expanded
what global politics inquiry entails but also have rethought earlier
approaches to gender theorizing in IR.]{.underline}

[Coalition politics, however, do not have to entail the modernist
dictate of \"merging\" different interests and identities in pursuit of
a uni- fied politics for some \"higher\" goal. In fact, Christine
Sylvester strenu- ously warns of \"some dangers in merging feminist and
peace projects.\"]{.underline}84 [By invoking the identities,
experiences, and projects of women warriors, whether in service to the
state or the revolution, she seeks to disrupt the too comfortable fit
between Western pacifist femi- nist ideology and the humanist ideology
of peace that ultimately sub- sumes it.]{.underline} Although Sylvester
admits that \"armed women warriors,\" regardless of why they fight,
kill, and die, \"do not get their due after the smoke clears,\"85 [she
insists that if there are \"no nonpeaceful feminist identities to
inspire war on aspects of the humanist establishment which may deny
women power\" and \"no rebellious feminists creating dangerous,
disorderly, and somewhat irrational orders within the
order,\"]{.underline}86 [the disruptive nature of feminist strategies
will be under- mined and rendered impotent.]{.underline}

Where do you see the most exciting research/debates happening in your
field?

Since I have long worked at the intersection of International Relations
(IR) and Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, heading both women's
studies and politics departments, my sense of what is most exciting is
what cuts across those fields. [Just as we have seen the emergence and
growing centrality of queer, trans, and decolonial scholarship in
feminist studies, so too are inroads being made in IR by these modes of
inquiry, bringing with them a wider range of theoretical and
methodological approaches, accounting in part for the narrative,
affective, visual, and temporal turns in critical IR.]{.underline}

[These developments are, on the one hand, blurring binaries and
contesting coloniality in thought about gender and sexuality in feminist
IR and feminist studies more generally. On the other hand, they are
challenging the colonial, settler colonial, heterosexist,
heteronormative, and gender normative foundational narratives
underpinning IR more generally.]{.underline} [These trends have
emerged]{.underline} less out of debates (which suggests some measure of
legibility between parties and either/or choices), [but from an
insistence by invisibilized, silenced, and/or marginalized bodies and
perspectives to, not so much to be included within reigning orthodoxies,
but to transform what constitutes the study of gender and the study of
IR.]{.underline}

[My earliest and continuing work also cuts across what is now referred
to as feminist security studies and feminist international or global
political economy (GPE).]{.underline} As those specializations emerged,
they appeared to diverge, prompting recent work on how they can
(re)inform each other, including my own efforts in this direction in the
introduction to the second edition of [Gender and Global
Restructuring](https://www.routledge.com/Gender-and-Global-Restructuring-Sightings-Sites-and-Resistances-2nd/Marchand-Sisson-Runyan/p/book/9780415776806) I
co-edited with Marianne Marchand that put the war on terror in relation
to neoliberal restructuring. [This has also meant a better blending of
discursive and materialist analysis within and across these
subfields.]{.underline}

Again, such shifts are less the result of either/or debates, [but rather
a recognition that the politics of representation is never separate from
the politics of redistribution, even as at times poststructural or
materialist analysis has come more to the fore]{.underline} (with the
latter gaining more traction again in these times of massive economic
inequalities). The question of violence is particularly animating
feminist resistances to false divisions between security (as high
politics) and GPE studies (as low politics) that the discipline
continuously re-imposes. While the heuristic distinction between direct
and structural violence, with the former most often associated with
security studies and the latter with GPE studies[, feminists have been
particularly adept at exposing their interrelations, particularly at the
level of everyday bodily violence of all sorts, whether in times of
"war" or "peace."]{.underline}

#### Gendered lens that draws from intersectionality are key to solve 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

MF)

In this introductory chapter, an overview is presented of the
contemporary relationships between gender and global politics. It begins
with a conceptual discussion of gender as a dichotomous power relation
and normative ordering power, referred to as the power of gen-der , a
meta-lens that fosters dichotomization, stratification, and
depoliticization in thought and action through the processes of
masculinization and feminization , thereby sustaining global power
structures and crises that prevent, militate against, or reverse
meaningful advances in social equality and justice. It then addresses
[why adopting not only a gender lens , but more importantly a gendered
lens , informed by intersectional thinking, is important for
understanding how the gender interacts with other power relations, such
as race, class, sexuality, and nationality (including power relations
among nations as well as those based on national origin) to produce both
gender and gendered divisions of power , violence , and labor and
resources in global governance, global security, and global political
economy, the principal areas of inquiry in the study of International
Relations (IR). These divisions, in turn, keep in place and exacerbate
the crises of representation, insecurity, and sustainability in global
politics, which are also introduced.]{.underline}

In the remainder of this introductory chapter, how gender politics
became more salient in national and international policymaking in recent
decades is raised. [A host of international institutions have been
adopting some understandings produced by gender-centered research in IR
that make links between raising the status of women worldwide and
addressing global crises, including democratic deficits, armed conflict
and other violence, and poverty and environmental
degradation.]{.underline} However, as also raised, the deepening of such
crises has also led to a backlash not only against international
institutions, but also with respect to nascent attention to women's
rights with the recent rise of ethnic, economic, and belligerent
nationalisms in several parts of the world. This rise of such new
authoritarianisms associated with "strong man" politics, as also pointed
out, is also a feature of contemporary global gender politics. [Thus, a
gendered lens is required to better understand these conflicting
responses to global crises and the insufficiencies and problematics of
both to address them.]{.underline}

#### Taking intersectionality into account is key to stopping the stereotypes that come with traditional ir 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and

MF)

Because models of appropriate gender behavior are diverse, we know that
femininity and masculinity are not timeless or separable from the
contexts in which they are embodied, acted out, and observed. This
illustrates how gender rests not on biological sex differences but on
interpretations or constructions of behavior that are culturally
specific, that shift as contexts change, and that typically have little
to do with biological differences, which themselves are not fixed as
some bodies are born neither "male" nor "female" and gender and sex
assignments can be altered. In short, there are multiple genders and
gender orderings, but gender is always raced, classed, sexualized, and
nationalized, just as race, class, sexuality, and nationality are always
gendered. Hence, gender analysis must avoid stereotyping (or reducing
people to unfounded caricatures), essentializing (or assuming "natural"
and unchanging characteristics), and singling out any one identity as
descriptive of a whole person. Instead, gender analysis must adopt
intersectional analyses to make sense of our multiple, crosscutting, and
differentially valorized identities. However, these variations still
rest on concepts of gender differences and do not necessarily disrupt
the power of gender as an oppositional dichotomy and as a relation of
inequality.

#### Intersectionality takes into account more marginalized perspectives and considers the idea of hegemonic masculinity and hierarchies within hierarchies

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

/// MF)

[Contemporary gender studies that partake of intersectional analysis,
which holds that gender cannot be understood in isolation from other
identity categories and relations of inequality, recognize that there
are multiple genders, as well as sexes, in part because race/ethnicity,
class, sexuality, and other cultural variations shape gender identities
and performances.]{.underline} The concept of intersectional analysis
emerged from the work of black US feminist theorists in the 1980s and
beyond (Crenshaw 1991; Collins 1991) who recognized that the lives and
experiences of women of color were underrepresented in dominant Western
feminist theories about women's subordination that were based on the
experiences of largely white, Western, middle-class, and/or
working-class women.

[Because the particular characteristics associated with femininity and
masculinity vary signifi cantly across cultures, races, classes, and age
groups, there are no generic women and men, cis or trans. Our gender
identities, loyalties, interests, and opportunities are intersected and
crosscut by countless dimensions of "diff erence," especially those
associated with ethnicity/race, class, national, and sexual identities.
"Acting like a man"]{.underline} (or a "woman") [means diff er-ent
things to diff erent groups of people]{.underline} (e.g., trans people,
heterosexual Catholics, Native Americans, British colonials,
agriculturists versus corporate managers, athletes versus orchestra
conductors, combat soldiers versus military strategists) and to the same
group of people at diff erent points in time (e.g., nineteenth- versus
twentieth-century Europeans, col-onized versus postcolonial Africans,
pre-puberty versus elderly age sets, women during war versus women after
war). [Men may be characterized as feminine]{.underline} (e.g., Mahatma
Gandhi, "fl amboyant" gay men) [and women as "masculine"]{.underline}
(e.g., Margaret Thatcher, "butch" lesbians). [Gender is shaped by
race]{.underline} (models of masculinity and femininity vary among
Africans, Indians, Asians, Europeans), [and race is
gendered]{.underline} (gender stereotypes shape racial stereo-types of
Africans, Indians, Asians, whites). [Moreover, because masculinities and
femininities]{.underline} vary (by class, race/ethnicity, sexuality,
age), [some expressions of gender]{.underline} (Hispanic in the US,
Muslim in India, Turkana in Kenya) [are subordinated to dominant
constructions of ender]{.underline} (Anglo, Hindu, Kikuyu). [There are
thus multiple masculinities that not only vary across cultures but also
confer diff erent levels of power. What is referred to as "hegemonic
masculinity]{.underline}" (Connell 1987, 1995) [is the ideal form of
masculinity performed by men with the most power attributes, who not
incidentally populate most global power positions. These are typically
white, Western, upper-class, straight cismen who have conferred on them
the complete range of gender, race, class, national, and sexuality
privileges. "Subordinated masculinities" (]{.underline}Connell 1987,
1995) [are embodied by those who lack one, some, or all these privileges
and are consequently rendered feminized and thus
devalorized]{.underline} (a process explored more in this chapter) on
these scores. [Although all femininities are subordinated to all
mascu-linities, it is also the case that some femininities are
subordinated more than or diff erently from others]{.underline}. The
idealized image of Western femininity remains associated with Victorian
notions of womanhood that celebrated the gentility, passivity,
decorativeness, and asexuality imposed on white, middle- to upper-class
women, who were the only ones who could enact such standards.
Working-class women, women of color, and/or lesbians or trans women are
either denied the (dubious) status of feminine because they cannot meet
these standards or are feminized in other ways through processes of
racialization and/or sexualization . For example, since the times of
slavery and colonization, women of color have been labeled as naturally
oversexual, thereby not only being unworthy of (white) male protection
but also particularly open to (white) male sexual exploitation.

#### A gender lens fails to view the complexity of the world, only through the use of intersectionality can we view the world more fully 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender(ed) Lenses on
Global Politics, pgs 39-40/// MF)

These points are crucial to the arguments of this text because the
perpetuation of dichotomized thinking and its gendered normalizations
reproduces hierarchical divisions and, hence, antagonistic relations
between groups. [But the power of gender also operates to obscure
intersectionality, and, thus, the gendered power relations and divisions
discussed in Chapter 1 . When the power of gender focuses attention on
essentialized notions of gender---masculinity and femininity---we fail
to see these as constructed and crosscutting dimensions operating within
any particular group and across groups. This is among the problems with
the way in which gender has been taken up by international policymakers,
not as a matter of equality and social justice, but rather
instrumentalizing women's empowerment to try to "fi x" serial crises
without addressing deeper ones that arise from not only gender but also
gendered divisions. Similarly, when essentialized notions of group
identities erase the diff erentiations within them, we fail to see the
complexity of social orders and how inequalities are often sustained by
pitting subordinated groups against each other.]{.underline} We are
seeing this now in the rise of illiberal democracies resulting from the
cultivation of ethno-nationalist and masculin-ist political backlash,
associated with some (typically white, global North, working-class, and
heterosexual) men falling down the economic ladder and "strong man"
political rhetoric that places the blame for this on groups also in
increasing and often greater precarity. [Such blaming defl ects
attention from the global crises that are producing and are the result
of vast and intersecting inequalities, while undermining the equality
struggles of all subordinated groups.]{.underline} This militates
against the potential for coalitions and more comprehensive resistances
to unjust social and global political orders. [Deploying intersectional
analysis facilitates a more comprehensive notion of gender equality that
is indivisible from racial, class, and sex-ual equality and equality
among nations. It encourages contemporary feminist IR scholars to ask
not just "Where are the women?" but also "Which women?" and "Where are
the men and which men?"]{.underline}

### impact

#### Violence and exclusion of women is the most accurate way to predict which countries will deteriorate -- the more the violence, the more instability 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Global Politics, pg 46 /// MF)

Recent generations of feminist IR researchers (some of whom have worked
in or with international agencies) also engage in a signifi cant amount
of quantitative research to have a greater and more meaningful impact on
international policymaking (Den Boer 2016). Although feminist IR
scholars have long relied on governmental, non-governmental, and UN
gender-diff erentiated data produced during and continuously since the
UN Decade for Women (which are also used in this text), but knowing how
incomplete and insuffi cient this most often statistical information can
be, some are now producing extensive and continuously expanded and
updated databases, such as WomanStats (see Box 2.1 ). [Some have also
engaged in large-scale studies, drawing upon existing, and creating new,
databases, on the impact of international policymaking on women and the
relationship between women's status and global problems. For example, in
the last decade, such research has showed that women's literacy, access
to reproductive health services, and employment have increased in states
that have ratifi ed and observed CEDAW, most markedly in secular states
with eff ective legal systems]{.underline} (Simmons 2009), [and that the
higher the level of violence against women within a state, the higher
the likelihood it will engage in war, with violence against women rates
being more signifi cant than levels of democracy, religion, wealth, and
racial disparities as predictors of state peacefulness or
bellicosity]{.underline} (Hudson et al. 2008/9). Such research is
positivist to the degree that it treats gender (as well as race, class,
nationality, and so on) as a variable, operationalizing it often as
female sex and women's rights in relation to a host of other variables.
While this has yielded major fi ndings which tell us gender not only
matters, but centrally matters in global politics, fem-inist IR
researchers cannot control if and how policymakers make use of such fi
ndings, nor does it particularly challenge the preference for
positivist, quantitative measures in inter-national policymaking.

#### War is done to protect the state and ignores structural violence 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and

Security, pg. 86 /// MF)

[War---its causes and eff ects---animated and has long dominated the
study of IR]{.underline}. Since the Cold War period, war has been
studied in IR under the rubric of "security" studies. In (neo)realist
security studies, [the maintenance of security is understood as
controlling and contain-ing, but not eliminating, direct violence
between state militaries]{.underline} through balances of military power
and nuclear terror as well as collective security measures that rely on
sustaining both credible threats to use force and the actual use of
force[. Ironically and problematically, this ensures the continued
growth of militaries and the continuation of war to promote
security---but only the security of the state, not necessarily of people
within or across states, and certainly not of the planet.]{.underline}

The early post-Cold War period of the 1990s brought more interest within
the discipline in wider defi nitions of security, ranging from economic
to human, environmental, and even food security. These redefi nitions
occurred in the face of new "threats" to state security (such as
globalization and global warming, discussed in the next chapter[), but
also newly recognized notions of security arising from critical
perspectives (including feminist ones) entering the fi eld, which
pointed out that state security often compromised the welfare of people
and the planet. Nevertheless, conventional security studies enjoyed
somewhat of a resurgence in the post-9/11 period because decisions to
engage in interstate and intrastate confl ict and the globalized "war on
terror" once again spiked militarized violence. The resurgent interest
in direct violence has once again been at the expense of attending to
structural violence and the insecurities generated by structural
inequalities. We must be mindful that direct and indirect (structural)
violence are not separate but interdependent. The inequalities of the
latter shape the expression of the former.]{.underline} As dire as are
the eff ects of direct violence, indirect violence shapes the lives of
all of us all of the time---and especially injures women and other
subordi-nated and marginalized people.

#### Only looking at the relations between different things can solve for structural violence and war -- current lens creates violence 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Security, pgs. 86-87 /// MF)

Hence, [feminists argue that to understand violence and insecurities, we
must look not only within particular "levels" but also at the linkages
among them.]{.underline} According to Ann Tickner,

> Feminist perspectives on security would assume that violence, whether
> it be in the inter-national, national, or family realm, is
> interconnected. Family violence must be seen in the context of wider
> power relations; it occurs within a gendered society in which male
> power dominates at all levels . . .. [Any feminist defi nition of
> security must therefore include the elimination of all types of
> violence, including violence produced by gender relations of
> domination and subordination.]{.underline}
>
> (Tickner 1993: 58)

But as argued here, [gender violence must also be seen in combination
with racialized, sexual-ized, and class violence to reveal the
interconnections between relations of domination and subordination that
are present across all levels and constitute the conditions (structural
violence) and goads for war (direct violence) as well as the eff ects of
war or militarized confl ict. Unless these are taken seriously, even
rival notions of (non-disaggregated) human security to state security
will fail to recognize all the sources of insecurity (bred of the
injustices of structural violence) and their diff erential eff
ects.]{.underline}

At the same time, a more poststructural feminist view of security is
that it is always "elusive and partial" because the quest for [absolute
security is in itself productive of violence: it relies on the
eradication of all threats, real or imagined, and thus sets up a
never-ending]{.underline} [defensive and off ensive posture (Tickner
2001: 62). Such a posture is emblematic of the "sovereign man" (Ashley
1989), who, like the sovereign state that is fashioned upon this
construct of hegemonic masculinity,]{.underline} thwarts connection and
interdependence in fear of engagement with diff erence that might break
down walls between the sovereign "self " and the "other" on whom is
projected all that one denies in oneself (Eisenstein 2007: 13).

### Gendered lens alt

In my work with V. Spike Peterson over several editions of Global Gender
Issues between 1993 and 2014 and in my most recent [Global Gender
Politics](https://www.routledge.com/Global-Gender-Politics-5th-Edition/Runyan/p/book/9780813350851)[, I
came to make a distinction between a gender lens, which foregrounds
masculine and feminine dynamics through which hierarchical dichotomies
are naturalized and enforced in world politics, and a gendered lens,
which attends to the ways in which race, class, sexual, and national
power relations intersect with gender power relations to produce
multiple, differing, and shifting femininities and masculinities. A
gendered lens is necessary for seeing how gender combines in complex
ways with other structural power relations, such as colonialism,
imperialism, racism, and economic and environmental exploitation, to
normalize a range of social, political, and economic divisions,
inequalities, and injustices.]{.underline}

[A gendered lens also resists the reduction of gender to "adding women"
as is popular and problematic in policymaking circles. And it alerts us
to the work that gender does, especially when deployed in this fashion,
to cover up and smooth over what Spike and I termed global and systemic
crises of representation, insecurity, and sustainability.]{.underline}
An exemplar of how this works, which I address in the postscript of the
second edition of [Gender and Global
Restructuring](https://www.routledge.com/Gender-and-Global-Restructuring-Sightings-Sites-and-Resistances-2nd/Marchand-Sisson-Runyan/p/book/9780415776806),
is in the case of the immediate aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis,
when increasing the number of risk-averse women financial managers was
briefly trumpeted as a panacea for avoiding such crises in future,
relying on biologically determinist constructions of women saviors from
testosterone-fueled men. This discursive move (which did not result in
any serious material change in the gender make-up of financial services
personnel) served to sidestep critical analysis of the systemic nature
and costs of gendered financialization.

OPENING STATEMENT

All these theories yet the bodies keep piling up (Zalewski 1996).

It is quite an undertaking to discuss the range of feminist approaches
in relation to international politics over a 30-year period, not least
given the vast amount of feminist scholarship that has been done over
that time. But this opening statement or 'pause for thought', is less
about the commonplace challenge of academic distillation and review, but
rather specifically connected to the relentless consistency of
problematic assumptions made about this provocative body of thought
which can rob it of its primary worth. [As such, I start with the
statement that the work of feminist scholarship on global politics is
largely intended to be powerfully destabilising. This remains the case
even if destabilisation seems politically and educationally unpalatable.
Undeniably, a primary aim of this corpus of feminist scholarship is to
create a body of theory and practice with enough agency and traction to
make significant structural, epistemological, conceptual and political
changes both to the ways international politics is studied, as well as
fundamentally alter the violent ways in which much of global politics
continues to manifest itself. It might be considered that this scholarly
aim of feminist work sounds provocative and overly ambitious, not least
given the consistently assumed goal of feminism is typically understood
to be simply about including women into the varied realms of high
politics. An accompanying assumption is that this inclusion is merely in
the service of supporting the theoretical and political agendas of
conventional international politics. My claim is that this branch of
feminist scholarship has a exceedingly far-reaching aim, and indeed very
similar to the one that the discipline of international politics itself
was founded upon (and has manifestly failed to achieve), namely to
impose a significant halt to the egregious and relentless violence that
continues to blight the contemporary global political landscape.
Furthermore, the claim of feminist scholarship is that it has much
greater potential than the discipline of International Relations to
bring about this kind of change.]{.underline} I open with this somewhat
provocative statement as the serious intention and work of feminism can
so readily evaporate. I hope to seize reader's attention in this
important volume right from the start; the stakes are far too high to
not take the destabilizing work of feminism seriously.

#### Only a gendered lens solves -- takes into account the existence of other power dynamics and helps resolve the divisions that occur as a result 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pgs 10-11
/// MF)

[The power of gender produces a common sense of privileging the
masculine and devaluing the feminine that is culturally and collectively
internalized]{.underline} to such an extent that we are all variously
complicit in its reproduction. [It is also implicitly and explicitly
manipulated to reproduce inequalities as if they were natural and
inevitable, thus undercutting critique and resistance. In these ways,
devalorizing through feminizing produces even as it obscures vast
inequalities of power, authority, and resource
distribution.]{.underline}

Examples of how the power of gender, as an ordering system that
valorizes or privileges what is deemed masculine and devalorizes or
subordinates what is deemed feminine in order to naturalize inequalities
and power relations, extends beyond hierarchically dividing women and
men to hierarchically dividing peoples, places, cultures, practices,
institutions, and even ideas and concepts in the global system can be
seen in Table 1.1 . The processes of masculin-ization as valorization
and feminization as devalorization powerfully organize our thinking as
to what is valued and thus prioritized and what is not valued and thus
denigrated in the study (explored more in Chapter 2 ) and practice
(explored more in Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 ) of global politics. [To
better see how gender as a power relation combines in complex ways with
other structural power relations, such as colonialism, imperialism,
militarism, racism, and economic and environmental exploitation, to
normalize social, political, and economic divisions, inequalities, and
injustices, a gendered lens is necessary. The term "gendered" is used in
this text, unless otherwise specifi ed, as a shorthand to signal the
application of an intersectional analysis to examine interlocking
relations of inequality in global politics.]{.underline} The next
section provides an overview of [how hierarchical gender divisions that
foreground the normative masculine--feminine dynamic are intertwined
with gender ed hierarchical divi-sions that foreground how gender is
never separate from and powerfully informs hierarchical divisions based
on race, ethnicity, class, sexuality, nationality, age, ability, and so
on. Adopting a gendered lens also more fully reveals how these divisions
are productive of and reproduced by global crises, also introduced in
the following section.]{.underline}

#### Feminist scholarship demands attention 

Marysia **Zalewski**, 20**18** (Zalewshi, author and professor of
International Relations at Cardiff University. "Feminist Approaches to
International Relations Theory in the Post-Cold War Period" part of [The

<https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/feminist-approaches-to-international-relations-theory-in-the-post-cold-war-period/>
/// MF)

I opened with a somewhat provocative statement about the intent of
feminist scholarship. It might be perceived that I 'overstate' the case
to draw attention. [Yet I maintain that the feminist critique of the
underlying knowledge structures on which studies of international
politics relies,]{.underline} and which are drawn from long standing
philosophical, political and even mythical foundations, [poses a very
significant challenge. Beginning with the recognition that women and the
traditionally 'feminine' have been rendered absent or irrelevant in the
realm of international politics, it appears that the remedy is not
simply to 'add women in' -as if they were men. The challenge to the
study and practice of international politics demands much more rigorous
and effective work in both theory and]{.underline} practice. There have
been some notable changes on the global political landscape since 1989,
but just a cursory glance will confirm hardly a dent in the realm of
global violence, perhaps an increase. Of course, feminist scholarship
cannot resolve all these violences, [but the vast corpus of knowledge
produced since 1989, knowledge which stems for questions drawn from the
submerged work and activities of more than half the world's population,
bears much more serious and sustained attention.]{.underline}

#### The "top down" approach fails -- a gendered lens is key to examining the powers outside of the state level

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pgs 12-13
/// MF)

[Gender divisions of power, which equate being political, acting in the
public realm of reason, and exercising power-over with normative
masculinity and being apolitical, power-less, and sequestered in the
private realm of emotion and necessity with femininity, in combination
with gendered divisions of power, which feminize or devalorize
colonized, racialized, classed, and sexualized peoples in today's global
politics, are refl ective of and instrumental in producing a crisis of
representation . This entails still gross inequalities in political
representation, not only in formal power structures such as states and
intergovern-mental organizations (IGOs), but also in nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and social movements.]{.underline} While
problematic in terms of constraining the political agency and voice of
large swaths of people, even in "democracies," without a range of
perspectives from varying social locations, solutions proposed by the
few (and most privileged) more often benefi t them while causing harm to
those un- or under-represented. "Democracy" is strategically promoted
while its radical promise is undermined by fraudulent elections,
political machinations, imperial impositions, and gendered rule. As
addressed in greater detail in Chapter 3 , "global governance" sounds
good and is presumably desirable in some form, but its current form
obscures the predominantly nondemocratic and unaccountable forms of
international rule.

[In these senses, analyzing gendered divisions of power requires greater
attention to politi-cal, economic, and sociocultural forces below and
above the level of the state, thereby revealing the greater complexity
of global politics, which cannot be reduced to the actions of state
elites and their international organizations or the top-down
"problem-solving" orientation they advocate. Such a lens reveals
inequalities as a source of confl ict in global politics and illuminates
divisions within groups---as well as linkages among groups---not only
along national lines but also along gender, race, class, sexuality, and
culture lines. The corollary of this, addressed in the fi nal chapter,
is that many people are resisting global-politics-as-usual by fi nding
common cause with each other across national boundaries and "identity
politics" and thus creating a diff erent kind of international relations
from that of elite policymakers.]{.underline}

#### A gendered lens incorporates other perspectives and prevents quick fix band-aid solutions 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Introduction, pg 24///
MF)

[The gender(ed), or intersectional feminist, lenses that arise from
feminist in combination with other critical perspectives on global
politics are applied to the traditional categories of global politics
inquiry: global governance]{.underline} ( Chapter 3 ), [global
security]{.underline} ( Chapter 4 ), [and global political
economy]{.underline} ( Chapter 5 ). It is within these chapters that
historical and contemporary gender(ed) divisions of power, violence, and
labor and resources and the global crises of representation, insecurity,
and sustainability they spawn are fl eshed out empirically and
ana-lytically. [The employment of multiple feminist perspectives and the
empirical research they are generating foregrounds the substantial body
of work that now exists in feminist IR, 6which is contributing to, as
well as based on, data now being produced by IGOs and NGOs on the
gender(ed) eff ects of global political priorities, processes, and
institutions and attempts to ameliorate them. The diversity of feminist
IR thought and research also aff ords more com-plex and sometimes confl
icting gender or gendered analyses of global politics. The benefi ts of
this diversity are that it militates against resorts to "quick fi xes"
that can do more harm than good and ensures no single or hegemonic
analysis that forecloses debate and further investigation within
feminist inquiry.]{.underline} At the same time, weaknesses in feminist
inquiry and appropriations of gender analysis in policymaking are raised
when they fail to address the gendered power relations among women and
among men that forestall more comprehensive critiques and resistances to
processes that widen and deepen global and local inequalities.

#### The current system of a gender lens reinforces gender binaries and the idea of essentialism -- only a [gendered lens]{.underline} solves and overcomes these ideas

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Global Politics, pgs 38-40/// MF)

[On the other hand, feminists, queer, and trans critics of
heteronormativity and gender normativity have exposed the assumption of
binary sex diff erence as stunted]{.underline} (reducing "sex" to paired
opposites, precluding alternatives and commonalities),
[static]{.underline} (neglecting historical shifts in how "sex" is
"seen" and responded to), [simplistic]{.underline} (obscuring the
complexity of "sex" and its relationship to gender), [and politically
problematic]{.underline} (unrefl ectively essentializing what is
historically situated and socially constructed). [Feminist research has
additionally docu-mented the deeply sedimented normalization of
dichotomized gender (generated by essen-tializing sex as a binary) as a
governing code valorizing what is privileged as masculine at the expense
of what is stigmatized as feminine.]{.underline} Gendered socialization
and social control mechanisms amplify individual and collective
internalization of, and investments in, repro-ducing gendered orderings.
Here it is argued that more adequate analyses of power require attending
to and integrating the critical insights particularly of
poststructuralist, postcolonial, feminist, queer, and trans lenses. In
particular, to comprehend the resilience of hierarchical thinking and
its reproduction of divisions and inequalities requires making sense of
the power of gender as a hegemonic and pernicious but typically
unacknowledged worldview.

Stated simply and based on the discussion of the power of gender in
Chapter 1 , [the "naturalness" of sex difference becomes
indistinguishable from the "naturalness" of dichotomized and
hierarchical gender differentiation that we reproduce]{.underline},
consciously and unconsciously, as we act out gender in all areas of
social life[. Because of this interaction, gendered stereotypes have
political significance far beyond their role in male--female relations.
First, gender normalizes dichotomized thought as a deeply embedded
practice]{.underline} reproduced throughout social orders[. Second, the
gender dichotomy is so taken as given that it lends authority to the
binary logic that "naturally" divides terms and identity groups into
polarized opposites. The naturalness of dichotomized gender then becomes
indistinguishable from]{.underline}---and lends credibility and
authority to---[the naturalness of dichotomized thinking. Third, the
normaliza-tion of dichotomized thinking reproduces not only gender
hierarchy but also other relations of inequality as dichotomies are
taken for granted and eff ectively legitimate hierarchical
ordering.]{.underline}

At the same time and as argued earlier, the binary logic of positivist
orientations normal-izes and privileges thinking in dichotomies. [The
elevated status of this logic lends credibility and authority to the
practice of essentializing categories as paired opposites, valuing one
over the "other" term, and normalizing domination of whatever and
whoever is "othered."]{.underline} In this sense, [the normalization of
dichotomies in modernist thought lends credibility and authority to the
binary of sex and dichotomy of gender. Insofar as other familiar
dichotomies have gen-dered connotations]{.underline} (culture--nature,
reason--emotion, autonomy--dependency, public--private), [when they are
deployed in modernist thought]{.underline}, they buttress the
stereotypes of masculine and feminine.

[This is what is meant by mutually reinforcing: the dichotomy of gender
gains its natural-ness by being grounded in the assumption of
essentialized sex diff erence; gendered orderings are normalized by
being reproduced throughout social life; dichotomies gain their
taken-for-granted and even desirable status by being privileged in
modernist thought and acquiring credibility through the "reality" of
pervasive gendered diff erentiation. The mutually reinforcing interplay
of essentializing sex, dichotomizing gender, and the binary logic of
positivism generates the constellation of dimensions of the meta-lens of
the power of gender. Recog-nizing the power of these coding and fi
ltering devices is crucial for improving our ability to see beyond
essentialized identities and oppositional "wholes." Thus, feminists
argue that dichotomized thinking cannot be adequately understood,
critiqued, or eff ectively transformed without addressing how sex-diff
erentiated gender grounds, naturalizes, and reproduces binary
thinking.]{.underline}

These points are crucial to the arguments of this text because the
perpetuation of dichotomized thinking and its gendered normalizations
reproduces hierarchical divisions and, hence, antagonistic relations
between groups. [But the power of gender also operates to obscure
intersectionality, and, thus, the gendered power relations and divisions
discussed in Chapter 1 . When the power of gender focuses attention on
essentialized notions of gender---masculinity and femininity---we fail
to see these as constructed and crosscutting dimensions operating within
any particular group and across groups. This is among the problems with
the way in which gender has been taken up by international policymakers,
not as a matter of equality and social justice, but rather
instrumentalizing women's empowerment to try to "fi x" serial crises
without addressing deeper ones that arise from not only gender but also
gendered divisions. Similarly, when essentialized notions of group
identities erase the diff erentiations within them, we fail to see the
complexity of social orders and how inequalities are often sustained by
pitting subordinated groups against each other.]{.underline} We are
seeing this now in the rise of illiberal democracies resulting from the
cultivation of ethno-nationalist and masculin-ist political backlash,
associated with some (typically white, global North, working-class, and
heterosexual) men falling down the economic ladder and "strong man"
political rhetoric that places the blame for this on groups also in
increasing and often greater precarity. [Such blaming defl ects
attention from the global crises that are producing and are the result
of vast and intersecting inequalities, while undermining the equality
struggles of all subordinated groups.]{.underline} This militates
against the potential for coalitions and more comprehensive resistances
to unjust social and global political orders. [Deploying intersectional
analysis facilitates a more comprehensive notion of gender equality that
is indivisible from racial, class, and sex-ual equality and equality
among nations. It encourages contemporary feminist IR scholars to ask
not just "Where are the women?" but also "Which women?" and "Where are
the men and which men?"]{.underline}

### Fem lens -- general 

#### Feminist perspectives are needed in IR to reveal the issues in how power is viewed in traditional IR

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and

[In IR, as in political science generally, power is usually defi ned as
"power over," specifi -cally, the ability to get someone to do what you
want. It is usually measured by control of resources, especially those
supporting physical]{.underline} coercion. The appropriate analogy might
be power understood as tools: if you have them, you can use them to get
certain things done if and when you choose, and some have more of these
tools than others. [This defi nition assumes measurable capacities,
privileges instrumental rationality, and emphasizes separation and
competition: those who have power use it (or its threat) to keep others
from securing enough to threaten them]{.underline}. The emphasis on
material resources and coercive ability defl ects attention from the
fact that power reckoning is embedded in dominant conceptual orders,
value systems, disciplinary practices, and institutional dynamics.

[In IR, the concept of "political actor"---the legitimate wielder of
society's power---is derived from classical political theory. Common to
constructions of "political man"---from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes,
Locke, and Rousseau---is the privileging of "man's" capacity for reason.
Rationality ostensibly distinguishes man from other animals and explains
his pursuit of freedom---from nature and "necessity" as well as from
tyranny. Feminist scholarship has exposed how models of human nature
presupposed in constructions of political man are not in fact
gender-neutral but are androcentric , based on exclusively male
(especially elite male) experience and perspective. With reference to
gender divisions of power, "woman" is excluded conceptually from
political power by denying her the rationality that marks "man" as the
highest animal. Substantively, women have historically been excluded
from political power by states' limiting citizenship to those who
perform military duty and/or are property owners. Under these
conditions, most women are structurally excluded from formal
politics,]{.underline} even though individual women in exceptional
circumstances have wielded considerable political power. Women worldwide
have largely won the battle for the vote, though defi ni-tions of
citizenship continue to limit women's access to public power and women's
political power is circumscribed by a variety of indirect means
(discussed more in Chapter 3 ). [Most obvious are the continued eff ects
of the dichotomy of public--private that privileges men's productive and
"political" activities over women's reproductive and "personal/familial"
activities]{.underline}. For example, sovereign man and sovereign states
are defi ned not by connection or relationships but by (masculinist)
autonomy in decision-making and putative freedom from interdependence
and collective responsibilities. Although Aristotle acknowledged that
the public sphere depends upon the (re)production of life's necessities
in the private sphere, he denied the interdependence that this implies
in articulating political theory.

I[n IR, as in political science generally, power is usually defi ned as

[With reference to gender ed divisions of power, "political man" also
presupposed "civiliza-tional" status: early Greek texts excluded
"barbarians" and Persians; premodern European texts excluded
"primitives" and racialized "others" within Europe and outside it as
coloniza-tion proceeded. Indeed, racialization is historically
inextricable from the expansionary and colonizing practices of European
elites who deployed Enlightenment ideas]{.underline} ("reason,"
"science") [and new technologies]{.underline} (gunpowder, steam engine)
[to enhance their power over foreign populations,]{.underline} thus
enabling the extraction of resources and labor to fuel European
"modernization" and geopolitical dominance. "[Eurocentrism" is an
ideology of European superiority that arose from this conquest and is
often used interchangeably with "Western-centrism" in more recent times.
"Orientalism" (Said 1979) is one eff ect of Eurocentrism (or
"Occidentalism"), consigning the "non-West" to the status of cultural,
political, economic, and technological backwardness. Such backwardness
is assumed, in Eurocentric and Orien-talist thinking, to need
stimulation from the West to "develop" or "modernize" or "progress."
Thus, men and women of various colonized, racialized, and classed groups
have been excluded over time from political power by various means:
barred on the basis of property claims, denied leadership in their own
lands by colonial domination, displaced to other lands and denied power
through slavery and debt bondage, and more generally excluded from
citizenship rights based on criteria related to birth location,
"appropriate" documentation, or "economic" status.]{.underline} Although
after World War II resistance to direct colonial rule was largely
successful, more indirect "neocolonial" or "neoimperial" rule (sometimes
referred to as "recolonization"), in which former colonial or newer
superpowers control or seek to control the polities and economies of
formerly colonized nations, has continued. Such labels as "developed"
versus "developing" countries or the terms "First" and "Third" Worlds
attest to the maintenance colonial logics that construct the West (or
the North more broadly) as more advanced politically and economically
than the rest. Colonial logics also continue through sexualized as well
as racialized divisions of power, justifying the invasion or control of
"others" by coding the West as uniquely moral and "respectable," as well
as racially superior.

Today, most people have a "right" to political participation, but the
most powerful decision-makers in global politics are those occupying
positions of power in national and international governmental
institutions and transnational corporations. Occupants of these
positions now include elites from both the global North and the global
South, terms used in this text to avoid such problematic and inaccurate
references as developed vs. developing countries or First vs. Third
Worlds. [Such elites, regardless of their geographic origin, continue to
refl ect privileged statuses, especially of national and economic power,
which are derived from being members of the dominant ethnicity/race,
class, gender, and sexuality.]{.underline}

#### Feminist approaches to IR are key to overcome the resilience and effects of traditional ir

As argued in the introductory chapter, [the power of gender is an
especially resilient and adaptive fi ltering and organizing mechanism, a
meta-lens that produces particular ways of seeing, thinking, and acting
in the world. Gender may feature in policymaking, women and men may be
repositioned, and ideal forms of masculinity may shift, but as long as
the power of gender as a meta-lens continues to operate, it will produce
and reproduce inequalities, injustices, and crises of global
proportion]{.underline}. Here the central case made is that [feminist
lenses , and particularly intersectional ones,]{.underline} often in
concert with other lenses critical of conventional IR approaches, [are
necessary to reveal the extent of the power of gender to produce and
obscure inequalities and the global crises that ensue from and sustain
inequalities.]{.underline}

#### Fem ir accounts for power in a more broad sense thus challenging the assumptions that traditional IR was built upon

[Feminist IR scholars, emerging in the discipline by the 1980s,
generally do not subscribe to the conventional defi nition of IR as
being the power struggles between sovereign states in an anarchic world
in which there is no supranational government to control state behaviors
through the rule of law]{.underline}. Rather, these scholars favor an
alternative defi nition of IR: "the iden-tifi cation and explanation of
social stratifi cations and of inequality as structured at the level of
global relations" (Brown 1988: 461). In this sense, [feminist
perspectives on IR understand power in broader and more complex terms
than more conventional IR scholars do, and have sought to put the
relations of people, as agents and within social structures, back into
IR.]{.underline} To do so, these IR scholars have relied on feminist
sociopolitical theorizing in other disciplines, including the now
well-developed (inter)discipline of women's, gender, and sexuality
studies.

They have also relied on, and contributed to, an array of other IR
lenses, arising prior to and after the emergence of feminist IR, [that
critique conventional IR for such things as assuming reality is given
rather than socially constructed, centering the state and state elites
as the main actors in world aff airs to the exclusion of actors above
and below the state, and failing to see or center how global power
structures and relations immiserate the majority of the world's people
and the planet]{.underline}. What connects what are broadly referred to
here as critical lenses or perspectives on IR is the view that
conventional IR, as a result of its focus on political and economic
elites and state power, and its relative blindness to the deleterious
eff ects of dominant political, economic, and social arrangements upheld
by elites and states, is oriented to serving elites to maintain global
power structures. Thus, conventional IR is not value-free. Critical
perspectives, which maintain no knowledge is value-free and that
scholars should acknowledge their always present values or normative
commitments that invariably shape the questions they ask, are, in
contrast, oriented to producing more "emancipatory" knowledge, which
confronts global power structures and relations and their eff ects on
peoples and the planet. Critical perspectives, however, do diff er in
terms of which global power struc-tures and relations they highlight,
how those structures and relations are understood, and what to do about
them. [Feminist IR perspectives center gender as a global power relation
and structure.]{.underline} But as presented in Chapter 1 and expanded
upon in this chapter, [feminist intersec-tional analysis in IR goes
beyond a gender lens to encompass a gendered lens that highlights the
interconnections among global power relations and
structures]{.underline}.

This chapter begins with an account of how lenses work and why they
matter in a general sense. It then moves to a discussion of IR lenses.
Despite the proliferation of such lenses, certain conventional ones
still hold sway and take us down very narrow and problematic paths. Why
this is the case is particularly explored through a discussion of more
privileged positivist knowledge production in conventional IR versus
more marginalized postpositivist knowledge production in critical
approaches to IR of which feminist IR is a part. Feminist IR, and the
multiple perspectives in and approaches to it, is the subject of the
rest of the chapter. [This discussion includes how feminist IR in
particular challenges the power of gender that especially infuses
conventional IR lenses and makes them hegemonic or dominant in
unques-tioned ways, and produces research that is dedicated to revealing
and countering gender and gendered divisions of power, violence, labor,
and resources in global politics.]{.underline} Such research informs the
empirical fi ndings and analysis presented in Chapters 3 , 4 , and 5 ,
which examine gender and gendered divisions and their contributions to
global crises in the contexts of global governance, security, and
political economy.

#### Viewing IR through a new lens transforms how we view our understanding of who fills what roles in IR, instead of merely revealing the inequalities 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Global Politics, pg 33 /// MF)

[Gender inquiry in IR began with the question "Where are the women?" in
international aff airs, as they appeared absent in typical accounts of
the rise of great powers, their leaders, their weaponries, and their
wars, as well as in dominant theories about the nature of and
interactions among states and their economies.]{.underline} At fi rst
glance, activities associated with masculinity (e.g., competitive
sports, politics, militaries) appear simply as those in which men are
present and women are absent and only the men engaging in these
activities need be attended to. [Gender analysis, however, reveals how
women are in fact important to the picture]{.underline} (enabling men's
activities, such as providing reasons for men to fi ght), [even though
women and the roles they are expected to play are obscured when we focus
only on men. Through a gender lens, we see how constructions of
masculinity]{.underline} (agency, control, aggression) are not
independent of, [but rely upon, contrasting constructions of
femininity]{.underline} (dependence, vulner-ability, passivity). In an
important sense, the dominant presence of men and the overvaluing of
masculinity depend on the absence of women and the devaluing of
[femininity. Because of this interdependence, using gender analysis in
IR does not merely reveal heretofore-unseen conditions and roles of
women in global politics, but "transforms" what we know about men and
the activities they undertake in international aff airs. Hence, the
study of gender alters our understandings of the conventional foci of
IR---power politics, war, and economic control---by exposing what more
deeply underpins them and why they are given such prominence over other
ways of thinking about and acting in the world.]{.underline}

#### A feminist lens takes into other structures of power and inequalities into its evaluation of IR and it proves that simply using gender as a meta-lens has more widespread effects

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Global Politics, pgs 32-33 /// MF)

[Feminist IR lenses (see, for example, Tickner and Sjoberg 2011; Tickner
2014; Steans and Tepe-Belfrage 2016) focus on gender and its relation to
other inequalities, and the political nature and eff ects of masculinist
and other inequality-producing orders.]{.underline} As such, they are
highly infl uenced by (neo)Marxist, poststructural, and postcolonial
thinking in and outside of IR. More recently, queer and trans theorists
in IR (see, for example, Weber 2016; Peterson 2014; Sjoberg 2012), [many
of whom are feminist, have directed greater attention to the
implications of heteronormativity and gender conformity not only for
sexual and gender minorities, but also for the further disruption of
binaries in IR.]{.underline}

[In general, gender analysts in IR operate from feminist perspectives,
which, although varied]{.underline} (as discussed later in this
chapter[), share, minimally, a concern with the problem of gender
inequality as a motivation for research. They have found in their
examinations that individuals, institutions, and practices associated
with masculinity (men, states, war-making, wealth production) remain
highly valued]{.underline} (or valorized) [in political and world
political thought, whereas those individuals, institutions, and
practices associated with femininity]{.underline} (women, local or
international political formations, peacemaking, poverty reduction[)
have been more typically devalued]{.underline} (or devalorized) [and
even dismissed in such thinking until very recently. Again, this is key
to what is meant in this text by the power of gender --- the
perva-siveness of gender as a fi ltering category, or meta-lens, that
puts in motion the broad processes of masculinization and feminization.
That is, gender-sensitive research does more than docu-ment the pattern
of excluding or trivializing women and their experiences while infl
ating men's experiences and power. It documents how
gender---characterizations of masculinity and femininity---can infl
uence the very categories and frameworks within which scholars
work.]{.underline}

#### In practice, lenses become self-fulfilling prophecies that inevitably escalate conflict 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and

Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Global Politics, pgs 28-29 /// MF)

[In simple terms, lenses focus our attention selectively. Selective
attention is a necessary feature of making sense of any particular
subject, practice, paradox, or social order.]{.underline} Because it is
not physically possible for any human to see or comprehend everything at
once, we rely on conceptual fi lters---lenses---that enable us to see
some things in greater detail, with more accuracy, or in better relation
to certain other things. Lenses simplify our thinking by focusing our
attention on what seems most relevant. They "order" what we see and
provide direction for subsequent actions. [In this sense, lenses are
like maps: they frame our choices, expectations, and explorations,
enabling us to take advantage of knowledge already gained and,
presumably, to move more eff ectively toward our
objectives.]{.underline} Like maps, lenses enable us to make sense of
where we are, what to expect next, and how to proceed. [From the
conceptual ordering systems available to us, we choose the lens we
assume is most appropri-ate for a particular context---a lens that we
expect will enable us to make sense of and act appropriately in that
context.]{.underline}

Lenses are thus indispensable for ordering what we see and orienting our
responses. But their fi ltering function is also problematic. Because we
cannot focus on everything, any particular lens directs our attention to
some features of a context, which unavoidably renders other features out
of focus---fi ltered out---by that lens. [In short, lenses both include
and exclude, with important and often political
implications.]{.underline}

[By fi ltering our ways of thinking and ordering experience, the lenses
we rely on have concrete eff ects. We observe this readily in the case
of self-fulfi lling prophecies: if, for instance, we expect hostility,
our own behavior]{.underline} (acting superior, displaying power) [may
elicit responses]{.underline} (defensive posturing, aggression) [that we
then interpret as confi rming our expecta-tions. It is in this sense
that lenses and "realities" are interactive, interdependent, or mutually
constituted. Lenses shape who we are, what we think, and what actions we
take, thus shaping the world we live in.]{.underline} At the same time,
the world we live in ("reality") shapes which lenses are available to
us, what we see through them, and the likelihood of our using them---or
adjusting them---in particular contexts.

#### Current theorizing revealed that politics are defined in gendered ways, especially in international politics 

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in

Governance, pg 53/// MF)

[This was an important insight, but it still did not yield signifi cant
change in women's representation in political offi ce or signifi cantly
increase women's access to and participation in formal politics more
generally.]{.underline} Such a focus on "women worthies" also limited
feminist interventions to getting relatively few women into relatively
few positions of formal power. This led feminist political theorists to
question the very defi nition of politics and the standards by which
political behavior is judged. 1 That public-sphere, formal politics is
only one form of politics was revealed by showing how the private sphere
and everyday life are shot through with power relations and
negotia-tions ("the personal is political"). This also drew attention to
the ways in which women engaged in non-formal political action to turn
practices assumed to be natural and unchange-able (such as rape and
domestic violence) into "political" (and thus changeable) "issues."
[Feminist political theorizing also revealed that formal politics was
defi ned, and political behavior judged, on the basis of (hegemonic)
male norms that privileged notions of politics as winner-take-all aff
airs, eff ectively necessitating individualist and aggressive traits to
be successful in such politics. This problem is magnifi ed in the case
of international politics, which could be defi ned as hypermasculinist
when compared with masculinist domestic politics. Feminists have also
shown that domestic politics, as not only national but also local,
household, and interpersonal politics, is not separate from
international politics, arguing that "the personal is international"
(Enloe 1989).]{.underline}

#### Contemporary fem IR reveals and overcomes the mistakes -- like exclusion - made by traditional IR

Anne **Ruyan**, 20**18** (Ruyan, professor in the School of Public and
International Affairs, faculty affiliate of Women's, Gender and
Sexuality Studies at the University of Cincinnati and has a PhD in
International Relations. "Global Power Politics" Gender(ed) Lenses on
Global Politics, pgs 45-46/// MF)

In the contemporary period, feminist IR is characterized as consisting
of two major and interactive areas of inquiry---feminist security
studies (FSS) 4 and feminist international (or global) political economy
(F(I or G)PE) studies. 5 FSS scholars engage with and critique
conventional, state-centric understandings of war, peace, and security
that remain at the center of the discipline of IR and challenge the
everyday as well as international violence they leave in place. They
re-theorize such concepts as states, just war, the democratic peace, and
human security through a gender(ed) lens while emphasizing the role of
"subjectivities," human "agency," and "discourses" (or narratives) as
well as bodies and emotions in the production and experience of direct
violence, from the intimate to the global (Hudson 2018: 129). F(I or
G)PE scholars focus most on "economic insecurities" produced by
neo(colonial-ism), (capitalist) economic development, and globalization
and the gendered nature of these processes (Hudson 2018: 129). They
apply more materialist analyses to reveal how conven-tional accounts of
the global political economy and its global governance structures fail
to understand how the political economy of gender---from the sex,
domestic labor, and beauty trades to the reliance on women's unpaid
reproductive labor to make up for declining wages, public services, and
environmental protection standards under global (and fi nancial)
capitalism---underpins unjust global economic relations. As a result,
they are more focused on structural violence. However, FSS and F(I or
G)PE scholarship often intersect, such as in studies on the political
economy of peacekeeping in rural societies that disregards women's
economic roles in the gathering of food and fuel far away from homes and
refugee camps, making them most vulnerable to attacks, or in studies on
the privatization of security forces, either as subcontracted or
mercenary labor, which is implicated in greater direct (including
sexual) violence being perpetrated on local populations (particularly
women) with less accountability than state militaries (Hudson 2018:
135). Although FSS inquiry is highlighted in Chapter 4 and F(I or G)PE
inquiry is highlighted in Chapter 5 of this text, as is argued
throughout the book, there are strong connections made between direct
and structural violence and discursive and material forms of violence in
much current feminist IR scholarship. 6

As interrelated FSS and F(I or G)PE research has burgeoned, scholars
working in these areas have multiplied the methodologies used in IR
inquiry in order to get at the multiple ways in which global politics is
gendered. In contrast to conventional positivist IR research, feminist
IR scholars (and other transnational feminist scholars who engage with
and contribute to feminist IR thought) have often utilized such
qualitative approaches as ethnographic fi eldwork to learn about the
lives of the non-elite, social action research through participant
observation of social movements, and discourse analysis of classic IR
texts, world leaders' pronouncements, (inter)governmental policies and
documents, NGO campaigns, and local group articulations of social
problems. In doing so, they consider the role of emotion and bodily
experience in the production and reproduction of global political
actions and reactions. They thus participate in what is referred to as
the "aff ective" turn in IR inquiry, which destabilizes rational actor
claims in IR and takes seriously how global politics thought and
practice are embodied phenomenon. They also plumb cultural sources, such
as popular culture images on the airwaves and the Internet and even
literature, art, and poetry, to fi nd expressions over time and space of
resistance to global politics-as-usual in unusual places (Ackerly,
Stern, and True 2006). As a result, feminist scholarship, as well as,
increasingly, other critical scholarship, also engages in what has been
referred to as the "visual" or "aesthetic" turn in IR inquiry, which
examines such things as images, mediascapes, places, and cartographies
to better understand how global politics is embedded in, shaped by,
productive, and reproductive of cultural construction and processes.

Such practices seek to reveal the underside of global politics,
simultaneously exposing the gendered dynamics that underlie and infect
the thought, language, structures, and practices of it and privileging
dissident and alternative voices about how it might be rethought,
reartic-ulated, and rearranged. These practices also require refl
exivity about the power relations between the researcher and the
researched. In cases of "studying down"---such as working with non-elite
actors---feminist IR scholars aim to be cognizant of their privilege
and, thus, their responsibility to allow such actors to represent
themselves in their own ways so as not to impose
Eurocentric/Orientalist, heteronormative, gender normative, or classist
interpreta-tions on the motivations, nature, and outcomes of their
struggles. When "studying up"---or dealing with elite or more privileged
actors---feminist IR scholars aim to be cognizant of how such actors
limit access to researchers engaged in critical scholarship and mystify
their power through bureaucratic language. Discourse analysis is thus
especially productive when studying up because it enables reading
between the lines and catching how the powerful con-sistently represent
themselves and how they consistently represent "others" to justify their
policies and actions. In these ways, feminist IR scholarship itself
seeks to counter the crisis of representation both in the fi eld of IR,
in which the study of people and especially non-elite people has
historically been absent, and in global politics, which has historically
operated as if people and especially non-elite people did not matter.
Moreover, it has ignored how bodies, embodied experiences, and embodied
thought are integral to producing and understanding global political
phenomenon

Nevertheless, still other contemporary feminists have shown, most
recently quantitatively as noted in Chapters 1 and 2, that there is a
powerful and direct relationship between inter-national violence and
domestic violence, which gives women particular interests in resisting
warfare and war preparedness because it produces men who do not visit
violence only on the "enemy" but also on their own wives, partners, and
children. [But men, too, feminists have argued, can develop interests in
resisting war because of the harm it does to their bodies and psyches,
leading to the destruction of their loved ones and their own selves.
What keeps more men---particularly those in subordinate military
positions whose bodies are most on the line---from developing such
interests is the valorization of war as the penultimate masculine
activity through which men can prove they are "real men"]{.underline}
(Whitworth 2008). As pointed out in Chapters 1 and 2 , [heteronormative
masculinity is an elastic construct, but it is also an extraordinarily
fragile and unstable one. Men are never suffi ciently masculine simply
when they have the appropriate genitalia, and establishing masculinity
is never a done deal: males face relentless pressures to demonstrate
they are real men by exhibiting unequivocally mas-culine qualities and
distancing themselves from what is defi ned as feminine]{.underline}
(Kimmel 2008). Thus, masculinity is an identity that leaves men having
to prove repeatedly that they have "it[." They are put in constant fear
and anxiety that they will be dubbed less than "real men" and,
therefore, be demoted down the gender hierarchy and be subject to
greater violence by other, higher men.]{.underline}

#### Trying to be the "savior" especially if they believe they are vulnerable -- history proves and it ends up foreclosing the possibility of change within the system

On this point, Susan Faludi's The Terror Dream (2007) continues to be
quite instructive. Not only does this work document the resurgence in
the US of a state security discourse proff ered across the airwaves,
almost exclusively by military men (to the almost absolute exclusion of
female and particularly feminist voices representing alternative views),
in the fi rst few years of the post-9/11 period, but it also analyzes
the resurgence of older sexist and racist mythologies from America's
past called up to cover up the chink in the sovereign man's armor.
[Faludi asks us to consider the lionizing of male rescue workers at
"ground zero"]{.underline} (and the attendant silencing of female rescue
workers long discriminated against, as well as widows who questioned the
US military response, because neither conformed with adulating male
protection and security at any cost[), the ersatz "rescue" of US soldier
Jessica Lynch supposedly from rapacious Iraqi captors]{.underline} (who
turned out to be caring medical personnel), [or overblown]{.underline}
(and in most cases untrue) [claims about women opting out of the
workplace to return home to raise babies and become "security moms" in
support of war. She argues that these convenient "fi ctions" have roots
in earlier frontier stories, captivity narratives, and Cold War
hysterias. These get trotted out whenever there are fears of "masculine
insuffi ciency" because hegemonic masculinity cannot countenance
"vulnerability"]{.underline} (Faludi 2007: 280).

When we look more closely at the events behind these earlier narratives,
we fi nd that white male frontiersmen (such as Daniel Boone) were, in
fact, undistinguished as providers or protectors and more often relied
on the provisioning and protective skills of their wives, children, and
indigenous peoples to survive, and the majority of white women taken
captive by indigenous peoples either preferred to stay with their
newfound families into which they were adopted or won their release from
their captors on their own (Faludi 2007: 212, 256--262). Nevertheless,
Faludi argues, [insecure times in patriarchal cultures ratchet up the
need for elaborate mythologies that "measure national male strength by
female peril," requiring that "women be saved from more and more
gruesome violation to prove their saviors' valor]{.underline}" (2007:
262). In the US white patriarchal cultural imagination, that peril is
limited to con-cerns for white women and symbolized most by racialized
men, whether they be indigenous "captors" of old and newer Iraqi ones,
the "yellow" and "Hun" hordes of World War II, or the "red" communist
threat of the Cold War. In [each case, fears of "alien" invasion
required the "securing of American domesticity," which conjured images
of (white) women (re)confi ned to the home front, obsessions with
"women's sexual purity" supposedly at risk from racial-ized men, and a
summoning of "John Wayne and his avenging brethren"]{.underline} (Faludi
2007: 282--283, 286).

[Thus, in each case, we also see a "remasculinization of America" (Jeff
ords 1989). A number of periods of this have occurred since the
1980s.]{.underline} Seeking to put behind them the defeat in Vietnam
that led to a more chastened view about the value of military confl ict
to solve problems and secure geopolitical objectives, [Reagan-era
neoconservatives]{.underline}---through public discourse and policy and
even popular culture---rehabilitated the Rambo-esque masculinist and
militarist values of might makes right, unfettered by "feminine"
considerations about the costs and usefulness of war. [The post-9/11
remasculinization of America]{.underline} under yet another
neoconservative government was justifi ed with resort to the necessity
of war arising from some inevitable "clash of civilizations" in which
one ethnic and religious fundamentalism must combat another (the
West/Christianity against the East/Islam), but also with resort, at
least for a short time, to the claim that the war in Afghanistan was
about civilized men (in the West) saving women from barbaric men (the
Taliban). [Today, under a far-right regime that claimed the previous
more liberal one was "weak" on security (despite a record of massive
deportations and drone warfare in the midst of troop drawdowns in Iraq
and Afghanistan), has reignited obsessions with "homeland security" now
entwined with discourses of "America fi rst" that justify, for example,
wall-building on the basis of such specious arguments as keeping Mexican
"rapists" out.]{.underline}

In such times, Faludi reminds us that [the constant replaying of this
"security myth" and the remasculinization of leadership and civil
society it entails disables an alternative response. Such a response
"involves learning to live with insecurity, fi nding accommodation
with---even drawing strength from---an awareness of
vulnerability"]{.underline} (2007: 286) [in order not to create sacrifi
cial altars, but instead to create space for multiple and less vitriolic
voices and ways of acting and being.]{.underline}

When we look more closely at the events behind these earlier narratives,
we fi nd that white male frontiersmen (such as Daniel Boone) were, in
fact, undistinguished as providers or protectors and more often relied
on the provisioning and protective skills of their wives, children, and
indigenous peoples to survive, and the majority of white women taken
captive by indigenous peoples either preferred to stay with their
newfound families into which they were adopted or won their release from
their captors on their own (Faludi 2007: 212, 256--262). Nevertheless,
Faludi argues, [insecure times in patriarchal cultures ratchet up the
need for elaborate mythologies that "measure national male strength by
female peril," requiring that "women be saved from more and more
gruesome violation to prove their saviors' valor]{.underline}" (2007:
262). In the US white patriarchal cultural imagination, that peril is
limited to con-cerns for white women and symbolized most by racialized
men, whether they be indigenous "captors" of old and newer Iraqi ones,
the "yellow" and "Hun" hordes of World War II, or the "red" communist
threat of the Cold War. In [each case, fears of "alien" invasion
required the "securing of American domesticity," which conjured images
of (white) women (re)confi ned to the home front, obsessions with
"women's sexual purity" supposedly at risk from racial-ized men, and a
summoning of "John Wayne and his avenging brethren"]{.underline} (Faludi
2007: 282--283, 286).
