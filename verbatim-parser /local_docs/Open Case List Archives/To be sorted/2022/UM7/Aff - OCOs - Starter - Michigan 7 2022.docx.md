Missing Cyberwar: Russia's Hacking Succeeded in Ukraine---And Poses a
Threat Elsewhere, Too,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/myth-missing-cyberwar\]

After Russia invaded Ukraine, many observers initially expected
cyberattacks to steal the limelight as a major instrument in Russia's
arsenal. But after a month of fighting, a host of prominent scholars and
[[analysts]{.underline}]{.mark} of cyberconflict have reached the
opposite conclusion. [Russia's activities in cyberspace]{.underline},
they claim, [have been paltry or even nonexistent]{.underline}. They
[[have]{.mark} [dismissed]{.mark} the role of
[cyber]{.mark}-op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}, variously
[proposing that]{.underline} digital preparations for the invasion in
Ukraine never occurred, were haphazard or [lacked any real
impact]{.underline}, or were mere continuations of Russia's long-term
cyber-activity against Ukraine that fell below the threshold of outright
war.

**[[This is a dangerous misdiagnosis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. All
available evidence indicates that [Russia has employed a coordinated
cyber-campaign intended to provide its forces with an early
advantage]{.underline} during its war in Ukraine. The apparent
disconnect between these observed incidents, on the one hand, and the
public analysis that Russian cyber-operations have been minimal, on the
other, is jarring. Preconceived notions of the role of cyberattacks on
the battlefield have made it hard for analysts to see cyber-operations
in Ukraine for what they are and for the role they play within Russia's
military campaign. Leaning on these preconceptions will only lead to
future policy and intelligence failures. Cyberspace is still a nascent
domain of operations, and events in Ukraine will have outsized
implications not just for any appreciation of Russian cyberpower but for
an understanding of the nature of cyberconflict itself.

OPENING SALVO

The belief that cyber-operations have played no role in Ukraine does not
stem from a lack of real-world impact. To the contrary, the magnitude of
Moscow's pre-kinetic destructive cyber-operations was unprecedented. On
the day the invasion began, Russian cyber-units successfully deployed
more destructive malware---including against conventional military
targets such as civilian communications infrastructure and military
command and control centers---than the rest of the world's cyberpowers
combined typically use in a given year.

The cumulative effects of these attacks were striking. [In the hours
prior to invasion, [Russia hit a range of important targets in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [rendering the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[computer [systems of multiple government]{.mark}, military,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[critical infrastructure sectors
**inoperable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Forensic analysis by Microsoft, the
cybersecurity company Symantec, and the Slovak firm ESET has found that
these attacks affected numerous government agencies, military
institutions, civil emergency services, and a range of other critical
infrastructure sectors such as defense industrial base manufacturers,
information technology services, and energy companies directly relevant
to Ukraine's military capacity.

[Cyber-enabled sabotage also knocked offline the satellite Internet
provider]{.underline} KA-SAT, which Ukraine's military, intelligence,
and police units depend on. Victor Zhora, the deputy chief of Ukraine's
State Service of Special Communication and Information Protection, has
characterized the satellite outage as "a really huge loss in
communications in the very beginning of war." U.S. defensive cyberspace
operations prevented further Russian attacks from disrupting the railway
networks that were being used to transport military supplies and help
millions of Ukrainian citizens evacuate.

[[Russia continues to draw from its wartime arsenal of
**cybertools**]{.underline},]{.mark} [deploying additional destructive
malware on a weekly basis.]{.underline} Cities under siege from Russian
shelling, including Kharkiv and Kyiv, have experienced cyber-enabled
disruptions to Internet services. Ukraine's national cyber-authorities
continue to expose intrusion attempts by Russian and Belarussian
cyber-units. All of this has occurred against the backdrop of a series
of website defacements, denial-of-service attacks, and other
destabilizing cyber-operations intended to produce chaos and further
exhaust Ukraine's cyberdefenses.

If observers see this cyber-offensive as a series of isolated events,
its scale and strategic significance get lost in the conventional
violence unfolding in Ukraine. But a full accounting of the
cyber-operations reveals the proactive and persistent use of
cyberattacks to support Russian military objectives. The misperception
that Russia has been restrained or ineffective in the prosecution of its
cyberwar on Ukraine likely stems from the fact that Russia's
cyber-operations have not had the standalone, debilitating effects that
assessments before the war imagined they would have. But those
assessments pose an unrealistic test of strategic value. [No single
domain of operations has an independent, decisive effect on the course
of war.]{.underline} Nevertheless, the lack of overwhelming "shock and
awe" in cyberspace has led to the flawed presumption that Russia's
cyber-units are incapable, and even worse, that cyber-operations have
offered Russia no strategic value in its invasion of Ukraine.

THUNDER RUN

Analysts should assess the use of cyberpower in its proper context.
Evaluating Russia's cyber-operations in Ukraine is impossible without
accounting for the multiple tactical and strategic errors that have
bedeviled other aspects of Moscow's military campaign. Russian planners
expected a swift victory in Ukraine, but their strategy failed for
multiple reasons: inadequate coordination and preparation, the
underestimation of the strength and resilience of Ukraine's military,
and various intelligence lapses. Russia's missteps and struggles have
almost certainly hurt its ability to fully employ its cyber-program in
support of its conventional forces.

But even with those limitations, Russian cyber-units successfully
attacked a range of targets in accordance with Russia's war plans.
Russian cyberattacks on government and military command and control
centers, logistics, emergency services, and other critical services such
as border control stations were entirely consistent with a so-called
thunder run strategy intended to stoke chaos, confusion, and
uncertainty, and ultimately avoid a costly and protracted war in
Ukraine. Indeed, Russian cyber-units have demonstrated their ability to
succeed without a great deal of advance warning and direction, and
despite the overarching difficulties hampering Russia's military effort.

The reason for this relative success lies in the unique nature of
competition and conflict in cyberspace. Unlike troop buildups or other
forms of military mobilization that are infrequent and highly visible,
cyber-operations are the result of operational cycles that occur
covertly and continuously through peacetime and wartime[. The targeting
of sensitive networks during peacetime lets attackers lay the groundwork
for malware intended for wartime use. T]{.underline}he methods attackers
use to establish initial footholds for espionage activities are
indistinguishable from those that precede cyberattacks. For cyber-units,
war does not fundamentally change the way they prepare or start to
fight.

[Russia's cyberattacks prior to the invasion suggest **methodical
preparations**]{.underline}, with the attackers likely gaining access to
Ukrainian networks months ago. This stands in stark contrast to the
evident lack of preparation across Moscow's other military instruments,
including on the ground, in the air, and in its frequently used
influence operations through media and social media. Russian cyber-units
did not need direct military orders to prepare for the invasion or to
generate new capabilities for the war. The operational realities of
cyberspace required them to be ready well in advance. Russian
cyber-units will probably continue to be in a state of permanent
readiness and capable of supporting tactical and strategic objectives on
short notice, either in Ukraine or beyond, as the war persists.

The emerging consensus that claims Russian cyber-operations were
ineffective misses the bigger picture. Russia's strategy failed to
capitalize on the full capabilities and numerous operational successes
of its cyber-units. For instance, [Russian cyber-units have not yet shut
down electricity or Internet connectivity on a massive scale in Ukraine.
That does not mean Russia is incapable of such]{.underline} attacks, as
some observers have suggested, [but that it envisioned a swift victory
and did not see the need for such widespread]{.underline},
indiscriminate [disruptions]{.underline}. In all likelihood, Russian
military units were reliant on Ukrainian civil infrastructure for their
planned seizure of Kyiv and could not risk blowback to their own
operations. Russia is almost certainly capable of cyberattacks of
greater scale and consequence than events in Ukraine would have one
believe. [Moscow has significantly improved its ability to conduct
comprehensive cyber-operations in recent years and has actively invested
in its cyber-capabilities, developing new and harder-to-detect variants
of its more advanced malware]{.underline} and operational
infrastructure.

NO RESTRAINT

**[[The war in Ukraine is not over]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russia has
been forced to change its operational approach, and Western intelligence
points to Moscow shifting toward a strategy of attrition. [[With]{.mark}
the likelihood that the conflict will become [a protracted war, Russia
will probably not exercise restraint]{.mark} in its use of additional
**disruptive** and **destructive** cyber-actions]{.underline}. Russian
President Vladimir [[Putin is most likely to double down on early
cyber-successes and seek to]{.mark} **[further disrupt and
undermine]{.mark}** government, military, and civilian
[infrastructure]{.mark}, as well as defense industrial base
enterprises]{.underline}. Russia's recent attempts to strike the same
targets it hit on the day of the invasion with additional destructive
malware indicate this new phase of the conflict is well underway.

Although less visible than cyberattacks, **[cyber-enabled
espionage]{.underline}**---the theft of sensitive information, in this
case from Ukrainian networks---[is also likely to play a grisly role in
the Russian offensive.]{.underline} Russia's Federal Security Service
has allegedly used personal information stolen from Ukrainian federal
databases to draw up kill lists of people who could lead a Ukrainian
resistance movement in the event of a Russian victory. And as the war
carries on, Russia may be increasingly tempted to tap into the latent
strategic potential of hacking collectives aligned with the Kremlin that
specialize in ransomware and can unleash chaos at a moment's notice.

Western policymakers should also be prepared for cyber-operations to
spread beyond the confines of Ukraine. [[Several Russian
cyber-op]{.underline}]{.mark}eration[s]{.underline} since the invasion
[have already [had **spillover effects into NATO
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [affecting critical sectors and
civilian Internet connectivity across Europe. Russia knowingly accepted
the risk that its cyberattacks would cause collateral damage and has a
history of similar **reckless behavior.**]{.underline} The U.S. Office
of the Director of National Intelligence's Annual Threat Assessment
released in March judged that "[[Russia is]{.mark} particularly [focused
on **improving its ability to target**]{.mark} **[critical
infrastructure ... in the U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[as well as in allied and partner
countries]{.underline}**."]{.mark} [Active Russian preparations for
future cyber-operations indicate that this not an idle
threat.]{.underline}

Cyber-operations have been Russia's biggest military success to date in
the war in Ukraine. They will continue to provide Moscow a flexible tool
capable of hitting a range of targets in Ukraine and beyond.
Disregarding their unprecedented use will only leave policymakers and
analysts unprepared for what's next. **[[A clear]{.mark}-eyed [view
of]{.mark} the role [cyberwar]{.mark}fare]{.underline}** has
[[played]{.mark} so far [in Ukraine]{.mark} and a better]{.underline}
[understanding of its place in modern warfare [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[imperatives for NATO's collective security]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [for **[managing]{.mark} the risks of
[escalation]{.mark} looming in cyberspace**]{.underline}.

#### Multilateral responses are crucial to counter Russian attacks\-\--otherwise they'll [shut down the grid]{.underline}

**Aldanova '22** \[Dina; May 30; Master's Candidate at Georgetown
University's Eurasian, Russian, and East European Studies Program;
National Interest, "Will Russia Launch a New Cyber Attack on America?,"
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/techland-when-great-power-competition-meets-digital-world/will-russia-launch-new-cyber-attack>\]

International cooperation to this degree is not an asset that Russia
benefits from. [[With the support of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence's research and
development projects, expertise, and training, [[U.S. retaliation
to]{.mark} a potential]{.underline} [Russian cyber attack [could]{.mark}
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} not only detrimental but even **[[more profound
as a multilateral response]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Based on all this,
[[the fear of retaliation could]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [[prevent
Putin from engaging in **o**]{.underline}]{.mark}ffensive
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**yber
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**peration**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** against
the United States.

Finally, Putin has lost the upper hand in launching an attack by
surprise. For instance, Russia invaded Georgia during the Olympics Games
in Beijing in 2008, and Ukraine during the Sochi Winter Olympics in
2014. When Putin waged war on Ukraine in 2022---incidentally,
immediately following the Beijing Winter Olympic Games---the West
anticipated it. Putin invaded Ukraine anyway. He is unlikely to act
recklessly in this way again, considering the failures the Russian
military has experienced since the invasion. Furthermore, knowing that
the United States and European allies have shielded up, Putin has no
incentive to strike. Nevertheless, would Putin wait for a more favorable
moment? Or scale back a potential attack, for instance, by meddling in
the U.S. midterm elections in November?

[[It would be misleading]{.mark}, however, [to underestimate Russian
cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities [or Putin's mind games [and lose
vigilance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2020, despite denying its
involvement, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} evidently
[[hacked]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. software company
[[SolarWinds]{.mark}. By installing malware into the company's
updated]{.underline} Orion [software]{.underline} program, [the attack
affected]{.underline} thousands of customers, a hundred companies such
as Microsoft and Intel, and some [federal agencies]{.underline} like the
Treasury Department, the Pentagon, and the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency. Cyber experts acclaimed the code used as
phenomenal. More astonishingly, if not for a performance assessment and
proper investigation, the attack could have easily gone unnoticed. For
over six months, Moscow tracked emails and other traffic of sensitive
information. [Could there already be a similar malware in U.S.
networks]{.underline}?

Now, on the brink of a new Cold War, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[must
keep its guard up on cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
there are significant factors that challenge the probability of an
imminent Russian cyber-retaliation, [**[the U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [should not disregard]{.mark} the potential for
[malicious activity]{.mark} in the near future]{.underline}. It needs to
keep a sober view and not act hastily. Setting priorities for the long
run, [**[the U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [needs to continue
advancing cyber mech]{.mark}anisms that detect sensitive activity like
the Solar Winds hack]{.underline}, and invest more in training and
education about cyber hygiene for government agencies, private
companies, and the public. It should not neglect to regularly test
offline backups, run software updates, report incidents, use multifactor
authentication, block unusable domain IP addresses, and assess
third-party risks.

Although [[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} intentions are far from clear,
his [[decision to pursue a cyberattack on the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates'
[[critical infrastructure that **would instantly shut down
electricity**]{.mark} or disrupt clean water supply]{.underline}, the
offense [[might come unexpectedly, and soon]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[Cornered with sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and burdened by the
bitterness of defeat, Putin might act furiously]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** Western **[[allies need to be
vigilant]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and maintain strong lines of
communication about any malicious activity. **[With a strong
multilateral front in the West]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[Russia will
have fewer incentives]{.underline}]{.mark}** to engage in cyber warfare.

#### Extinction

**Weiss '19** \[Matthew and Martin; May 29; National Sales Director at
United Medical Instruments, UMI and Research assistant at the American
Jewish University; Neurosurgeon at UCLA-Olive View Medical Center;
Energy, Sustainability, and Society, "An assessment of threats to the
American power grid," vol. 9\]

In testimony before a Congressional Committee, it has been asserted that
[a [prolonged collapse of this]{.mark} nation's]{.underline}
[**electrical [grid]{.mark}**[---through]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**starvation**, **disease**, and]{.underline} **[societal
collapse]{.underline}**]{.mark}[---could [result in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[death]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} up to **[90% of [the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
American **[[population]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[1\].

There is no published model disclosing how these numbers were arrived
at, nor are we able to validate a primary source for this claim.
Testimony given by the Chairman of the Congressional EMP Commission,
while expressing similar concerns, gave no estimate of the deaths that
would accrue from a prolonged nationwide grid collapse \[2\].

[The power grid is]{.underline} posited to be [[vulnerable
to]{.underline}]{.mark} geomagnetic storms generated by solar activity,
electromagnetic pulses (EMP, also referred to as HEMP) produced by high
altitude nuclear detonations, [**[cyber]{.mark}**attack]{.underline},
and kinetic (physical) attack. Evidence for and against the validity of
each of these threats follows below. Much of the knowledge on these
matters is classified. The studies for and against EMP, other than for
limited testing of a few components of the infrastructure by the EMP
commission, are based not on physical demonstrations but mathematical
models and simulations. Moreover, the underlying physics and technology
involved---the electrical engineering and materials science---is likely
beyond the understanding of the reader, and certainly beyond that of
these writers. With these limitations in mind, we proceed.

The electrical grid

HV (high voltage) transformers---transmitting voltages of greater than
100 kV---are what make it possible to send electricity over great
distances to thousands of substations, where smaller transformers reduce
the voltage.

[**[HV]{.underline}** [transformers]{.underline}]{.mark} [are
the]{.underline} **[weak link]{.underline}** in the system,
[and]{.underline} the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
([FERC]{.underline}) [has identified]{.underline} **[30]{.underline}**
of these [as]{.underline} **[being]{.underline}** critical. [The
simultaneous [loss of **just 9**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in various
combinations, [could]{.underline} cripple the network and [[lead
to]{.mark} a]{.underline} [**[cascading]{.mark} failure**, resulting in
a]{.underline} **[["coast-to coast blackout"]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\[3\].

[[If]{.mark} the]{.underline} HV [transformers are]{.underline}
**[[irreparably damaged]{.underline}]{.mark}** [it is]{.underline}
**[problematic]{.underline}** [whether they can be]{.underline}
[**[replaced]{.mark}**. The]{.underline} **[great
majority]{.underline}** of these units [are]{.underline} [**custom
built**. The lead time between]{.underline} **[order and
delivery]{.underline}** for a domestically manufactured HV transformer
[is]{.underline} between 12 and **[24 months]{.underline}** \[4\], and
this is [under]{.underline} **[benign, low demand
conditions]{.underline}**.

The first practical application of the transformer was invented in the
USA by William Stanley, but largely as a consequence of American trade
policy ("It doesn't make any difference whether a country makes potato
chips or computer chips"- attributed to Michael Boskin, Chairman of
President George H W Bush's Council of Economic Advisors) \[5\] there is
little manufacturing capability remaining in the USA. Worldwide
production is less than 100 per year and serves the rapidly growing
markets of China and India. Only Germany and South Korea produce for
export.

[Ordered]{.underline} [**today**, delivery of a unit from]{.underline}
**[overseas]{.underline}** (responsible for 85% of current American
purchasing) [would [take]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly
**[[3 years]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[6\]. [The factory price for an HV
transformer can be in excess of \$10 million---too expensive to maintain
an]{.underline} **[inventory]{.underline}** [solely as
**spares**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} **[emergency]{.underline}**
replacement.

Potential mechanisms of collapse

Geomagnetic storms

Geomagnetic storms are due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs)---massive
eruptions of plasma expelled from the sun's corona. Plasma is the fourth
fundamental state of matter, consisting of free electrons and positively
charged ions. The sun, like all stars, is plasma.

Coronal mass ejections often occur with solar flares, but each can also
take place in the absence of the other. The latter emits radiation in
all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g., white light,
ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma rays) and unlike CMEs, affect
little more than radio communications.

CME's take several days to reach the Earth. The radiation generated by
solar flares on the other hand arrives in 8 min.

Coronal mass ejections carry an intense magnetic field. If a storm
enters the earth's magnetosphere, it causes rapid changes in the
configuration of the earth's magnetic field. Electric current is
generated in the magnetosphere and ionosphere, generating
electromagnetic fields at ground level. The movement of magnetic fields
around a conductor, i.e., a wire or pipe, induces an electric current.
The longer the wire, the greater the amplification. The current induced
is akin to DC (direct current), which the electrical system poorly
tolerates. Our grid is based on AC. The excess current can cause voltage
collapse, or worse, cause permanent damage to large transformers.

The current flowing through HV transformers during a geomagnetic
disturbance can be estimated using storm simulation and transmission
grid data \[7\]. From these results, transformer vulnerability to
internal heating can be assessed.

The largest recorded geomagnetic storm occurred Sept 1--2, 1859---the
Carrington event, named after the English amateur astronomer, Richard
Carrington. Auroras were seen as far south as the Caribbean. Campers in
the Rocky Mountains were awakened shortly after midnight by "an auroral
light so bright that one could easily read common print. Some of the
party insisted it was daylight and began preparation for breakfast"
\[8\]. Telegraph wires transmitted electric shocks to operators and
ignited fires.

In May 1921, there was another great geomagnetic disturbance (GMD), the
railroad storm. The National Academy of Sciences estimates that if that
storm occurred today, it could cause 1--2 trillion dollars damage and
full recovery could take 4--10 years \[9\].

The basis for this assertion is a presentation made by J Kappenman of
Metatech, the Goleta California engineering consulting firm, given as
part of the NAS Space weather workshop titled "Future Solutions,
Vulnerabilities and Risks", on May 23, 2008. The simulation asserts that
a 1921 intensity storm could damage or destroy over 300 transformers in
the US, and leave 130 million people without power \[10\]. Elsewhere,
Kappenman states that in a worst case situation, geomagnetic
disturbances could instantly create loss of over 70% of the nation's
electrical service \[11\].

In March 1989, a geomagnetic storm caused collapse of the power grid in
Quebec, leaving 6 million without power for 9 h. NERC (the North
American Electric Reliability Council), a self-regulated trade
organization formed by the electric utility industry, asserts that the
blackout was not due to overheating of transformers from geomagnetically
induced current, but to the near-simultaneous tripping of seven relays,
and this is correct \[12\]. The rapid voltage collapse (within 93 s)
likely prevented transformer thermal damage. The same storm, however,
destroyed a major transformer at the Salem nuclear plant in New Jersey
\[13\]. The 1989 Hydro-Quebec storm was 1/10th the intensity of the 1921
Railroad Storm \[14\].

A report for Lloyd's in 2013 states [[a Carrington]{.mark}-level extreme
**geomagnetic [storm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
almost **[[inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the
future]{.underline}. Using its own **[models]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[simulations]{.underline}**, it [puts the US
population at risk at]{.underline} between 20 and [**40 million**, with
the outages lasting]{.underline} up to 1--2 **[years]{.underline}**
\[15\].

Because of geography and ground conductivity, the risk of a transformer
sustaining damage is 1000 times greater in some US counties than in
others. The highest risk is to the counties along the corridor between
Washington DC and New York \[16\].

The first written account of a solar storm is possibly in the book of
Joshua. Written reports of aural sightings by Greeks and Romans begin in
371 BC.

A Carrington-level storm narrowly missed the earth in 2012 \[17\]. NASA
has produced a video on the CME \[18\]. Formerly considered a 1 in
100-year event, [the likelihood]{.underline} of a Carrington intensity
storm striking the earth [has]{.underline} most recently [been placed
at]{.underline} **[12% per decade]{.underline}** \[19\].

Mitigation

The EMP Commission, in its 2008 report, found that it is not practical
to try to protect the entire electrical power system or even all
high-value components. It called however for a plan designed to reduce
recovery and restoration times and minimize the net impact of an event
\[20\]. This would be accomplished by "hardening" the grid, i.e.,
actions to protect the nation's electrical system from disruption and
collapse, either natural or man-made \[21\]. The shielding is
accomplished through surge arrestors and similar devices \[22\]. The
cost to harden the grid, from our tabulation of Congressional EMP
figures, is \$3.8 billion.

[[There has been]{.underline} **[no hardening]{.underline}**]{.mark} of
the grid

The commission and organization that are responsible for public policy
on grid protection are FERC and NERC. FERC (The Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission) is an independent agency within the Department of
Energy. NERC, the self-regulatory agency formed by the electric utility
industry, was renamed the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation in 2006.

In June of 2007, FERC granted NERC the legal authority to enforce
reliability standards for the bulk power system in the USA. FERC cannot
mandate any standards. FERC only has the authority to ask NERC to
propose standards for protecting the grid.

**[NERC's]{.underline}** [position]{.underline} on GMD [is that the
threat is]{.underline} **[exaggerated]{.underline}**.

A report by NERC in 2012 asserts that geomagnetic storms will not cause
widespread destruction of transformers, but only a short-term
(temporary) grid instability \[23\]. The NERC report did not use a model
that was validated against past storms, and their work was not
peer-reviewed.

The NERC report has been criticized by members of the Congressional EMP
commission. Dr. Peter Pry asserts that [the final draft was "written in
**secret** by a]{.underline} **[small group]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} NERC **[employees]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
electric **[utility insiders]{.underline}**..... The report [relied on
meetings of]{.underline} **[industry employees]{.underline}** [in lieu
of data collection or event investigation]{.underline}" \[22\].

NERC, in turn, criticizes Kappenman's work. NERC states that the
Metatech work cannot be independently confirmed \[24\]. NERC reliability
manager Mark Lauby criticized the report for being based on proprietary
code \[24\]. Kappenman's report, however, received no negative comments
in peer review \[24\].

The NERC standards

The reliability standards and operational procedures established by
[NERC]{.underline}, and approved by FERC, are disputed \[25\]. Among the
points are these:

1\. The [standards against GMD do]{.underline} **[not
include]{.underline}** [Carrington storm class levels]{.underline}. The
NERC standards were arrived at studying only the storms of the immediate
prior 30 years, the largest of which was the Quebec storm. The GMD
"benchmark event", i.e., the strongest storm which the system is
expected to withstand, is set by NERC as 8 V/km \[26\]. NERC asserts
this figure defines the upper limit intensity of a 1 in 100-year storm
\[26\]. The Los Alamos National Laboratory, however, puts the intensity
of a Carrington-type event at a median of 13.6 V/km, ranging up to
16.6 V/km \[27\]. Another analysis finds the intensity of a 100-year
storm could be higher than 21 V/km \[28\].

2\. The 15--45 min warning time of a geomagnetic storm provided by space
satellites (ACE and DSCOVR) will be insufficient for operators to
confer, coordinate, and execute actions to prevent grid damage and
collapse.

Testimony of Edison Electric Institute official Scott Aaronson under
questioning by Senator Ron Johnson in a hearing before the Senate
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in 2016
encapsulates some of the issues. Video of the exchange is available on
the web \[29\]. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) is the trade
association that represents all US investor-owned electric companies.

Johnson: Mr. Aaronson, I just have to ask you -- the protocol of warning
15--30 min -- who is going to make that call? I mean, who is going to
make that for a massive geomagnetic disturbance, that nobody knows how
many of these transformers are going to be affected. Who is going to
make that call to shut them off line -- to take them off line -- so
those effects do not go through those wires and destroy those large
transformers that cannot be replaced?

Aaronson: So, the grid operators are tightly aligned. We talked about
the fact that there are 1900 entities that make up the bulk electric
system. There are transmission operators and so on...

Johnson (interrupting): Who makes the call? Who makes the call -- we are
going to shut them all down in 30 min, in 15 min?

Aaronson: It's not as simple as cutting the power. That's not how this
is going to work but there is again, there is this shared responsibility
among the sector.

Johnson: Who makes the call?

Aaronson: I do not know the answer to that question \[29\].

Mr. Aaronson's is Managing Director for Cyber and Infrastructure
Security at EEI.

Congressman Trent Franks, R Az introduced HR 2417, the SHEILD Act, on
6/18/2013. The bill would give FERC the authority to require owners and
operators of the bulk power system to take measures to protect the grid
from GMD or EMP attack. The costs would be recovered by raising
regulated rates.

Franks states he had been led to believe that his bill would be brought
to the House floor for a vote. But he states House Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman Fred Upton R, Mich., let it die in committee. He has
been unable to get an explanation from Upton \[30\].

Between 2011 and 2016, Mr. Upton has received \$1,180,000 in campaign
contributions from the electric utility industry \[31\].

The electric utility industry is heavily involved in campaign donations.
During the 2014 federal election cycle, the electric utility industry
made \$21.6 million in campaign contributions \[32\]. The electrical
utility industry is particularly involved in state politics. For
instance, in Florida, between 2004 and 2012 electric utility companies
donated \$18 million into legislative and state political campaigns. In
that state, the electric utilities employ one lobbyist for every two
legislators \[33\].

Electric utility revenue in 2015 was 391 billion dollars \[34\].

Electromagnetic pulse

Of the scenarios that might lead to electrical network collapse, EMP has
received the widest public attention. It has been the subject of
television series, films, and novels. HEMP (for high altitude) is the
more accurate acronym, but as media and the public use EMP, we will use
both interchangeably.

The issue has become highly politicized. The most prominent article in
the media against EMP as a threat is by Patrick Disney, "The Campaign to
Terrify You about EMP" published in the Atlantic in 2011. "From Newt
Gingrich to a Congressional 'EMP Caucus', some conservatives warn the
electronic frying blast could pose gravely underestimated dangers on the
U.S.....Ballistic missile defense seems to be the panacea for this
groups concern, though a generous dose of preemption and war on terror
are often prescribed as well" \[35\].

As of 2009, Mr. Disney was acting Policy Director for the National
Iranian American Council (NIAC). NIAC has been accused of acting as a
lobby for the Islamic Republic of Iran \[36\].

Mr. Disney is quoted as stating his strategy, in advancing an Iranian
interest, is to "create a media controversy" \[36\].

The campaign to discredit EMP has been largely successful. To a very
large part of the body politic EMP is identified as a cause limited to
the far right.

A high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (EMP) is produced when a nuclear
device is detonated above the atmosphere. No radiation, blast, or shock
wave is felt on the ground, nor are there any adverse health effects,
but electromagnetic fields reach the surface.

An EMP has three components, E1 through E3, defined by speed of the
pulse. Each has specific characteristics, and specific potential effects
on the grid. E1, the first and fastest component, affects primarily
microelectronics. E3, the later and slower component, affects devices
attached to long conductive wires and cables, especially high-voltage
transformers.

[A single]{.underline} **[nuclear blast]{.underline}** [will generate
an]{.underline} **[[EMP]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[encompassing]{.underline} **[half the continental USA]{.underline}**
\[37\]. **[Two]{.underline}** or three [explosions]{.underline}, over
different areas, [would [blanket the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[entire
[continent]{.mark}]{.underline}**al USA.

The potential impact of an EMP is determined by the altitude of the
nuclear detonation, the gamma yield of the device, the distance from the
detonation point, the strength and direction of the earth's magnetic
field at locations within the blast zone and the vulnerability of the
infrastructures exposed. The E1 gamma signal is greatest for bursts
between 50 and 100 km altitude. E3 signals are optimized at busts
between 130 and 500 km altitude, much greater heights than for E1
\[38\]. Higher altitude widens the area covered, but at the expense of
field levels. The 1963 atmospheric test ban has prevented further
testing.

E1 and its effects

The E1 pulse ("fast pulse") is due to gamma radiation (photons),
generated by a nuclear detonation at high altitude, colliding with atoms
in the upper atmosphere. The collisions cause electrons to be stripped
from the atoms, with the resultant flow of electrons traveling downward
to earth at near the speed of light. The interaction of the electrons
with the earth's magnetic field turns the flow into a transverse current
that radiates forward as an intense electromagnetic wave. The field
generates extremely high voltages and current in electrical conductors
that can exceed the voltage tolerance of many electronic devices. All
this occurs within a few tens of nanoseconds.

The Congressional EMP Commission postulated that E1 would have its
primary impact on microelectronics, especially SCADAs (Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition), DCSs (digital control systems), and PLCs
(programmable logic controllers). These are the small computers,
numbering now in the millions, that allow for the unmanned operation of
our infrastructure.

To assess the vulnerability of SCADAs to EMP, and therefore the
vulnerability of our infrastructure, [the EMP [Commission]{.mark}
funded]{.underline} a series of [**[test]{.mark}**s, exposing
**[SCADA]{.mark}** components to both radiated electric fields and
injected voltages on cables connected to the components]{.underline}.
The intent was to observe the response of the equipment, when in an
operational mode, to electromagnetic energy simulating an EMP. "The
bottom line observation at the end of the testing was that **[[every
system]{.mark} tested [failed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [when exposed to
the simulated EMP environment]{.underline}" \[6\].

E1 can generate voltages of 50,000 V. Normal operating voltages of
today's miniaturized electronics tend to be only a few (3-4) volts.
States the EMP Commission: "The large number and widespread reliance on
such systems by all the nation's critical infrastructures represent a
systemic threat to their continued operation following an EMP event"
\[39\]. A scenario seen in films is all automobiles and trucks being
rendered inoperable. This would not be the case. Modern automobiles have
as many as 100 microprocessors that control virtually all functions, but
the vulnerability has been reduced by the increased application of
electromagnetic compatibility standards. The EMP Commission found that
only minor damage occurred at an E1 field level of 50 kV/m, but there
were minor disruptions of normal operations at lower peak levels as well
\[40\].

There is a self-published post (J. Steinberger, Nobel laureate physics,
1988) disputing the potential effects of E1 \[41\]. This is an isolated
opinion.

Shielding against E1 could theoretically be accomplished through the
construction of a Faraday cage around specific components or an entire
facility. The cage is composed of conductive materials and an insulation
barrier that absorbs pulse energy and channels it directly into the
ground. The cage shields out the EM signals by "shorting out" the
electric field and reflecting it.

To be an effective Faraday cage, the conductive case must totally
enclose the system. Any aperture, even microscopic seams between metal
plates, can compromise the protection. To be useful, however, a device
must have some connection with the outside world and not be completely
isolated. Surge protective devices can be used on metallic cables to
prevent large currents from entering a device, or the metallic cables
can be replaced by fiber optic cables without any accompanying metal.
The US Military has taken extensive measures to protect ("harden") its
equipment against E1. "On the civilian side, the problem has not really
been addressed" \[42\].

E3 and its effects

E3 is caused by the motion of ionized bomb debris and atmosphere
relative to the geomagnetic field, resulting in a perturbation of that
field. This induces currents of thousands of amperes in long conductors
such as transmission lines that are several kilometers or greater in
length. Direct currents of hundreds to thousands of amperes will flow
into transformers. As the length of the conductor increases, the
amperage amplifies.

The physics of E3 are similar to that of a GMD, but not identical. GMD
comes from charged particles showering down from space creating current
flow in the ionosphere. These currents create magnetic fields on the
ground. A nuclear burst on the other hand generates particles which
create a magnetic bubble that pushes on the earth's magnetic field
producing a changing magnetic field at the Earth's surface. A
geomagnetic storm will have substorms that can move over the Earth for
more than 1 day, while the E3 HEMP occurs only immediately following a
nuclear burst.

There are three studies on the potential effects of a HEMP E3 on the
power grid.

The first study, published in 1991, found there would be little damage
\[43\]. Although supporting the utility industry's position, it has not
been subsequently cited by either NERC or the industry. The study is
criticized for expressing a smaller threat intensity \[44\]. The second,
published in 2010 by Metatech, calculated that [a nuclear
[detonation]{.mark} 170 km over the USA [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[collapse]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[entire]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[US power
[grid]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[45\]. The third study, by EPRI (an
organization funded by the electric utility industry) published in
February 2017, asserts that a single high-altitude burst over the
continental USA would damage only a few, widely scattered transformers
\[46\]. The study is disputed for underestimating threat levels and
using erroneous models \[44\].

These results are incompatible. One's interpretation of the studies on
E3 (and GMD) is based largely on the credibility one gives to the
underlying Commission or Institute, and not the published calculations.

FERC has decided not to proceed with a GMD standard that includes EMP
\[47\]. It will be recalled the GMD standard is 8 V/km. The EMP
Commission, utilizing unclassified measured data from the Soviet era
nuclear tests, found an expected peak level for E3 HEMP for a detonation
over the continental USA would be 85 V/km \[48\].

The position of the electric utility industry is that E3 from a nuclear
detonation is not a critical threat \[49\]. Others have come to a
different conclusion. Israel has hardened her grid \[50\]. She perceives
herself to face an existential threat, and it is not the Sun.

The electric utility industry states the cost of hardening the grid
against EMP is the government's responsibility, not the industry's
\[51\].

Cyberattack

[The [vulnerability from a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[cyberattack]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[exponentially
magnified]{.underline}**]{.mark} [by]{.underline} our [dependence
on]{.underline} **[SCADAs]{.underline}**.

In 2010, a computer worm attacking SCADA systems was detected. Although
widely spread, it was designed to only attack SCADA systems manufactured
by Siemens for P-1 centrifuges of the Iranian nuclear enrichment
program. The attack destroyed between 10 and 20% of Iranian centrifuges.
Iran's program was likely only briefly disrupted \[52\]. In December
2015, a cyberattack was directed against the Ukrainian power grid. It
caused little damage as the grid was not fully automated.

There is an argument that the cyber threat is exaggerated. Thomas
**[Rid]{.underline}** [states]{.underline} that [viruses and malware
cannot]{.underline} at present [collapse the]{.underline} electric
[grid. "(The world has) never seen a cyber- attack kill a single human
being]{.underline} or destroy a building" \[53\]. [The]{.underline}
electric [utility industry offers a similar perspective]{.underline}. In
testimony on cybersecurity before the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee, its representative states that "There
are a lot of threats to the grid.....from squirrels to nation states,
and frankly, there have been more blackouts as a result of squirrels
(gnawing wire insulation) then there are from nation states" \[54\].

[Others however express]{.underline} **[concern]{.underline}** \[55\].
Moreover, in a report by the Department of Defense in 2017, it is noted
that "[[the]{.underline} **[cyber threat]{.underline}** [to critical
US]{.underline}]{.mark} [[infrastructure is]{.underline} **[outpacing
efforts]{.underline}** [to reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} pervasive
[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}." \[56\] That report notes that
"due to our extreme dependence on vulnerable information systems,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
today [lives in a]{.underline} virtual **[glass house]{.underline}**"
\[57\].

On March 15, 2018, the Department of Homeland Security issued an alert
that the Russian government had engineered a series of cyberattacks
targeting American and European nuclear power plants and water and
electric systems \[58\]. It is reported these attacks could allow Russia
to sabotage or shut down power plants at will \[59\].

The ability to operate a system in the absence of computer-driven
actions is fast disappearing. The electric power industry spends over
\$1.4 billion dollars annually to replace electromechanical systems and
devices that involve manual operation with new SCADA equipment \[60\].
With modest increases in efficiency come exponential increases in
vulnerability. The extent to which reduced labor costs (and perhaps
reduced energy costs) are passed on to the public is uncertain.

#### They'll target NATO's undersea cables

<https://www.lawfareblog.com/cyberspace-and-war-ukraine-prepare-worse>\]

Some observers have noted the absence of major cyber incidents during
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The situation does not afford complacency,
however. [Despite the few breakdowns---so far---in
cyberspace]{.underline} beyond Ukraine, [their risk has
**increased**]{.underline} rather than diminished. [[The]{.mark}
apparent [lull in]{.mark} international [cyber]{.mark} activity related
to the war [is]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
**[[illusory]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [it **portends** a]{.underline}
deterioration in the security of computer systems and networks in Russia
and in the nations that sanctioned it or armed Ukraine. Below we explain
why.

The central premise of our argument is that Russia and NATO member
states will want to avoid a direct military clash at nearly all costs
(Putin's desire to protect his regime from imminent collapse might be an
exception). If anything, the tragedies of the war in Ukraine reveal the
enormous economic and human costs of conventional battles involving the
Russian military behemoth. Although the risk of an accidental or
unwanted war between Russia and NATO is always present and has
increased, both sides will want to reduce it. That is how to interpret
Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent allusion to nuclear war: He
rattled the atom in order not to have to use it. Similarly, President
Joe Biden's warning about the certainty of "World War 3" if Russia
attacked NATO was a rhetorical device to reduce its chances. Both sides
have signaled that they wish to avoid an epochal war among them; they
threaten it in order not to fight it. This is conventional deterrence
thinking at its finest. Familiar red lines are reinforced so that all
sides can see them plainly amid the crisis.

Far less clear are the lines of response to offensive cyber activity
within the realm of "unpeace": actions that are not physically violent
or fatal like war but whose harmful effects on national security are too
great to be considered normal peacetime competition. The line between
unpeace and war is clear because the boundary of war is easily
recognizable. The lower line between unpeace and peace, however, is
largely unclear; nations have not painted it, although many Western
states seem to assume that existing international laws and norms of
restraint apply to forms of conflict less than war.

War in Ukraine will present Western nations with response dilemmas in
cyberspace. One concern is [[the risk of breakdowns in
Western]{.underline}]{.mark} [[cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}: It [[has
risen **dramatically**]{.underline}]{.mark} owing to the intense
economic and diplomatic showdown with Moscow (as Lucas Kello warned in a
speech at U.S. Cyber Command on March 10). Our logic here is simple:
There is an implied symmetry between, on the one side, the effects of
economic and financial sanctions against the Russian economy and
financial sector and, on the other, the effects of cyberattacks against
economic and financial targets in the sanctioning nations.

[A large coalition of Western and Western-aligned]{.underline} states
(such as Japan and South Korea) [have levied economic and financial
sanctions against Russia. The country is now possibly the most heavily
sanctioned nation in the world]{.underline}---even more so than North
Korea under the reclusive Kim Jong Un's rule. The sanctions go far
beyond the targeted financial penalties that the U.S. Treasury
Department has applied to individuals and organizations such as the
Russian Internet Research Agency, which it deemed responsible for
previous hacking activities, or those imposed after the SolarWinds
incident. They far surpass, too, the scope and effects of the United
Kingdom's diplomatic and financial penalties in response to the Russian
Main Intelligence Directorate's (GRU) poisoning operation (with the
banned chemical agent novichok) against its former agent Sergei Skripal
in Salisbury in 2018. The current sanctions regime against Russia is
particularly potent because it has included an extraordinary freeze on
central bank assets and the expulsion of some of Russia's largest banks
from the global interbank payments system, SWIFT. Hundreds of
multinational and mostly Western companies have exited the Russian
market or suspended their operations there. The ruble has undergone
dramatic price drops not seen since the 1998 financial crisis, which has
inflicted economic pain on the general Russian population. The net
result of these economic dislocations is an expected drop in Russian
gross domestic product of 15 percent in 2022---a decline that would
reduce the Russian economy to its size in 2007 at current prices.

[[Against]{.mark} the backdrop of [Russia's economic meltdown, the
Kremlin's retaliatory options]{.mark} within the diplomatic and economic
realms [are]{.mark} [limited]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia has so far
responded, among other measures, with a ban on ruble loans to citizens
of "unfriendly" states, closed its domestic airspace to Western
airplanes and demanded payment for Russian gas in rubles. These punitive
instruments have not hit very hard---if only because Russia's strongest
measure, the closing of oil and gas exports to Europe and North America,
would severely curtail its remaining source of hard currency (hence why
Russia has avoided this measure). The United States, the United Kingdom,
the European Union and other Western players can wield the potent club
of economic sanctions because of their dominant position within the
global financial system (for example, the role of the dollar, the pound
and the euro as world reserve currencies). Russia does not enjoy such a
position of dominance; it will seek punitive options elsewhere.

**[[Cyberspace offers attractive]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[alternative]{.underline} **[[options]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Hackers
and security planners in Moscow must be assessing how to mirror some of
**the sanctions**]{.underline}]{.mark}' economic and financial [[effects
through **disruptions in Western cyberspace**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Scenarios are not hard to imagine]{.underline}. They include, for
example, an [interruption of computers that support stock trading at the
NASDAQ or the London Stock Exchange]{.underline} (the Moscow Exchange
index has lost almost 50 percent of its value since its February high);
the processing of payments at SWIFT (from which Russian banks were
recently ejected); or the data servers of JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank
and other banks that have dialed down their Russian operations.

Then there are the asymmetric options: acts of unpeace whose effects
transcend the economic realm without crossing the lines of war. Forensic
evidence shows that Russia has burrowed itself deeply within key U.S.
networks. The intelligence community's 2022 Annual Threat Assessment
cautioned that [[Russia was **honing** its ability to]{.mark} **[target
underwater cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} and industrial control systems.
[[Reports of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark} GRU
[[hackers penetrating the U.S. electrical grid are
**commonplace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Perhaps the clearest indication of
the growing risk of breakdowns in cyberspace was President Biden's
public warning on March 21 that the West should expect them.

But that is not all. Beyond the intentional effects of Russian
cyberattacks are their unintentional effects. [During a military
invasion that appears to be failing on many fronts]{.underline},
[[Russian cyber op]{.underline}]{.mark}eration[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[are likely to be]{.underline}]{.mark} at least **[[as
brazen]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and indiscriminate as in the]{.underline}
past. An illustrative case is the "NotPetya" wiper malware that the GRU
unleashed upon Ukrainian businesses in 2017 but whose cascading effects
disrupted commercial operations in many countries (notably interrupting
the activities of the global shipping giant Maersk). A more recent
example is [[the hack]{.underline}]{.mark} (likely by Russian state
agents) [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [Viasat]{.underline}, **[[a U.S.
satellite internet provider]{.underline}]{.mark}** [used by the
Ukrainian military and police.]{.underline} What is particularly
significant is that [[the operation's effects]{.underline}]{.mark}, like
NotPetya's, [spread far beyond Ukraine]{.underline}. It affected
thousands of wind turbines in Germany---which are still not fully
operational---and [[disconnected tens of thousands of European internet
users]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[There is also the case of [Finland and
Sweden]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Russia's invasion of Ukraine is
driving the two traditionally neutral states firmly toward NATO
membership. They will face a period of **critical
vulnerability**]{.underline} [spanning their formal request for
accession]{.underline} (which is expected in the coming months) and
their actual accession (which requires ratification among the alliance's
30 member states). [[Russia's motives to disrupt]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[the joiners' information]{.underline}]{.mark} [space [will
rise]{.mark} even as collective]{.underline} defense guarantees to
protect them are still being worked out.

If and when these scenarios (or their variants) materialize, the history
of cyber conflict suggests that the United States and its partners will
struggle to mount a forceful response. Although they often promised to
respond decisively, they traditionally failed to do so. Rather, Western
nations---in particular, the United States---have been risk averse in
their reactions. Officials are wary of responding in kind for fear of
engaging in escalating tit-for-tat cyber exchanges in a domain marked by
an inherent potential for collateral damage and blowback.

More broadly, officials struggle to interpret the legal vagaries of
unpeaceful conflict---where are its red or "pink" lines?---which delays
decision-making in the aftermath of major incidents. Hence they struggle
to figure out how to impose costs outside of cyberspace for actions
within it. In the current crisis, Western nations are fast running out
of those options. The sanctions box of penalties is almost exhausted. At
any rate, it is not clear that imposing them without communicating clear
criteria for their lifting is an effective punishment tool (as Daniel
Drezner argued). Moreover, levying sanctions for cyber activity while
simultaneously imposing them for military activity risks muddling the
signaling to Moscow. Where exactly, flustered Kremlin analysts might
wonder, are the response thresholds for different conflict domains?

Therefrom arises another policy dilemma: whether to relax the reluctance
to impose costs within Russian cyberspace. With the sanctions toolbox
emptying and the aversion to direct military measures prevailing, a
viable pathway to affect Russian interests---whether in response to
future cyberattacks or events on the ground---might be found in
cyberspace.

An intensification of conflict in cyberspace will likely require a
reduction of risk aversion in the response calculus. Western nations
should not reinforce the perception in Moscow that missile strikes in
Kyiv are unacceptable but the interruption of banking operations in
Manhattan or Frankfurt is tolerable---a perception that far predates the
Ukraine war and which has lived too long. And not just the hawks in
Moscow will be watching. Observers in other capitals such as Beijing or
Tehran will also bear witness. Western officials will want to teach them
that computer breakdowns back home will elicit unacceptable penalties.

More than ever before in the history of cyber conflict, **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
its partners]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[long reluctant cyber
warriors]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[might find cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}
operations a more [[attractive]{.underline}]{.mark} option for strategic
action abroad. Examples are not hard to conjure. Similar to past actions
by U.S. Cyber Command, the [[operations might involve takedowns of
servers of Russian info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation [[warfare
outfits]{.underline}]{.mark} and hacking units (like within the GRU) or
the disruption of criminal ransomware groups (which have recently
shifted their resources toward patriotic activities). More boldly,
**[[they might]{.underline}]{.mark}** entail the
**[[interrupt]{.underline}]{.mark}**ion of [[computer networks that
support Russian financial or commercial operations]{.underline}]{.mark}
that circumvent sanctions.

In sum, [[the absence of breakdowns in cyberspace]{.mark} likely [marks
a period of **false stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After Nazi Germany
invaded Poland in 1939, it took eight months---the "phony war"
period---for conflict to break out in earnest on the Western front.
Unlike 1939, the current prospect of direct war involving large nations
is low. But we expect that, like then, [[the conflict will **eventually
spread to other fronts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The common desire to
avoid a direct war on the ground has increased the risk of lesser but
still consequential conflict in cyberspace]{.underline} (although
unprecedented warnings and multiple CISA alerts, such as this one, about
sophisticated attack tools could already be having a deterring effect).
After the aggressor shifts its focus from immediate tactical objectives
to broader strategic gains, it may want to pursue them there. [The
Ukraine war will probably shape the next chapters in the annals of cyber
conflict]{.underline}. [Western security planners should be active
authors in the saga]{.underline}. **[[Beyond shoring up defenses, they
should prepare their responses now]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Nuclear war

**Clark '16** \[Bryan; 2016; Senior Fellow with the Center for Strategic
and Budgetary Assessments; Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, "Undersea
cables and the future of submarine competition," vol. 72\]

Given the likely economic and military impacts of cable breaks, the
ability to threaten or protect submarine cables and their shore landings
will be increasingly important in future conflicts. In a crisis, an
aggressor could use multiple coordinated attacks on cables to compel an
opponent to back down or employ them as part of an opening offensive to
cut off the defender's military forces from national commanders,
intelligence data, and sensor information. [[**Cable attacks**

Ukraine,"

[To say that the world is closer to the brink of nuclear war today than
at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 feels less
controversial by the day]{.underline}. United Nations Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres recently told media representatives that the "prospect
of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of
possibility."

Certainly, Russian President Vladimir [Putin has been signaling a
willingness to at least consider the nuclear optio]{.underline}n. In
late February, he raised the readiness level of Russia's nuclear
response force, stating that Western interference in the ongoing war in
Ukraine will result in "consequences greater than any you have faced in
history." And despite calming messaging from the Biden administration,
further Russian mobilizations---including the deployment of nuclear
missile launchers to Siberia and nuclear submarines to the Barents Sea
for supposed "drills"---have continued to stoke public fears over
nuclear weapons' use. Even Russia's recent pledge not to use nuclear
weapons in Ukraine has done little to calm fears about the potential use
of tactical nuclear devices, with many claiming the statement is nothing
more than an attempt to bolster Moscow's negotiating position.

[[Amid]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[rising nuclear
tensions]{.underline}, [there is]{.underline}]{.mark} [one dimension of
**[potential escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has not yet received
much public attention: that [[of]{.mark} [a cyber-enabled nuclear
event.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's time for policymakers to consider
whether cyber operations affecting elements of nuclear command, control
and communications, or NC3, systems could prompt nuclear escalation in
the current crisis.

[Experts across the West have been scrambling to place Putin's
threats]{.underline}, both tacit and explicit, in strategic and
political context in order to gauge the possibility of a nuclear
escalation leading to nuclear war. Others still have more narrowly---and
perhaps more realistically---focused their analysis on what strong
nuclear threats mean for fraught international engagement with Russia,
and on whether Putin is likely to authorize the use of any nuclear
weapons at all.

On the digital side of things, [experts on cyber conflict
have]{.underline} thus far **[narrowly]{.underline}**
[focused]{.underline} their [attention on the **non-nuclear**
aspects]{.underline} of tactics being employed in the war. Scholars
rightly predicted that the "cyber blitzkrieg" anticipated by many
pundits was unlikely, pointing out that, contrary to popular portrayals,
cyber instruments actually make for poor tools of coercion and
battlefield augmentation. By contrast, the entry of so many nonstate and
semi-state cyber forces into the conflict on both sides, including
nearly 300,000 volunteers coordinated by the Ukrainian government and a
pro-Russia equivalent calling itself "Killnet," was less expected.

Even given so much robust analysis of the ongoing war, [the **nuclear
tie-in** has remained curiously **underexamined**]{.underline}. This is
particularly concerning given the manner in which scholars have in
recent years suggested that the **[logic of [cyber]{.mark}
warfare]{.underline}** [[could undermine the]{.mark} logic of nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark} under highly specific circumstances.]{.underline}

Overall, experts are right to dismiss the threat of a so-called
"cyberwar," a fantastical scenario that contradicts what we know about
the strategic and operational functions of cyber instruments. But
[[could cyber operations affecting]{.mark}]{.underline} elements of
[**[NC3]{.underline}** [prompt **nuclear escalation in the current
crisis?**]{.underline}]{.mark} Perhaps.

The conflicting logics of cyber and nuclear warfare, when considered in
the context of the present crisis, suggest real reasons to be concerned
about the possibility of a cyber-enabled nuclear escalation.

Off the bat, it's important to remember that several elements involved
in that question could present themselves in a range of ways. Nuclear
escalation itself could take a number of forms, from additional
escalatory rhetoric or mobilization to the actual use of a nuclear
weapon.

Likewise, a cyber operation impacting NC3 systems---which essentially
comprise the networks of intelligence sensors, communications systems,
other early warning assets and arms control mechanisms that underlie a
country's nuclear deterrent forces---could be an actual attempt to
interfere with a nation's deterrent capability by means of disrupting or
taking over an element of its command system. That could be perceived by
the targeted party as a prelude to a preemptive strike. But it could
also be something as simple as an exploratory probe not intended to
subvert system functions. Significantly, these different attacks could
be hard to differentiate from the defensive perspective and so
misinterpretation is entirely possible.

While countries like Russia and the United States have historically
reacted with caution to nuclear provocations, uncertainties borne of the
current crisis might diminish that inclination. Such uncertainties could
also encourage Russian leaders to lend less weight to the cyber
attribution problem---that is, the difficulty inherent in identifying
the party responsible for a cyber-attack that, even under ordinary
circumstances, complicates efforts to organize an appropriate response.

Even more concerning than the uncertainties bound up in interpreting
certain cyber actions is the oft-cited and well-documented
vulnerabilities of most states' NC3 systems. Scholars have noted that
[[NC3 weaknesses are widespread and]{.underline}]{.mark}, at times,
quite glaring. There's little doubt that [American or Russian
[second-strike]{.mark} capabilities [could]{.mark} be made to [function
effectively in the event of a nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}. But both
sides' reliance on a blend of new and legacy technologies to coordinate
a complex detection, analysis and strike apparatus for nuclear weapons
virtually guarantees errors in how these systems function as a whole.
For example, in the past, American forces have lost contact with launch
systems for hours due to faulty circuitry. At other times, they have
detected false launches because legacy machinery was mishandled by
operators.

These base conditions are cause for at least minimal concern. Both the
probability of either side's NC3 systems being vulnerable to some form
of cyber compromise and the possibility that [[either side might]{.mark}
**mistakenly** [believe its NC3 is being targeted by hostile foreign
cyber operations]{.mark}]{.underline} clearly create the potential for a
cyber-enabled nuclear event where perceived cyber-preemption against NC3
leads directly to either coercive or real military escalation.

Admittedly, the stakes of nuclear weapons' use suggest that escalation
is not an especially likely outcome most of the time, even given these
known issues. But unique circumstances might change this calculus. In
particular, [[the conflicting logics of cyber and nuclear
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}, when considered in the context of the
present crisis, [[suggest real reasons to be
concerned.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Nuclear]{.underline} and cyber forces are polar opposites with regard
to their operational features. The former [relies on open signaling to
"warn"]{.underline} [adversaries]{.underline} about potential
consequences in order to generate a deterrent effect. The latter
typically banks on secrecy, exploiting the element of surprise to avoid
giving an opponent the opportunity to upgrade their defenses. The
combination of the two creates unusual commitment problems, where the
[coercive brinksmanship usually on display in nuclear contests might be
absent as one side tries to use cyber instruments to neutralize the
other's NC3. Importantly, with cyber in the mix, the side that detects
cyber activity targeting NC3 will likely also notice that the attempted
breach was done in secret, creating new uncertainties over how they
might respond to such an attack.]{.underline}

In addition to the potential weaknesses of NC3 systems, the [[unique
political dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark} currently on display [[in
Moscow, where Putin seems]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
be]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[isolated and dependent
on]{.underline}]{.mark} politicized [[intelligence that has]{.mark}
effectively]{.underline} [[undermined his decision-making, complicates
this]{.underline}]{.mark} game of nuclear chicken. Given the difficult
intelligence assessments and operational decisions that any government
trying to reconcile cyber and nuclear logics in real-time will be
required to make, this is worrisome to say the least.

And [[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} many obvious [[logistical
failures]{.mark} in launching its invasion [are cause for further
concern]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, [objectively assessing the
risks]{.underline} [of cyber-enabled nuclear interference requires
having the ability to locate potential NC3 compromises]{.underline} and
to mitigate any that are found. [This means robust]{.underline}
intra-service [communication and]{.underline} deployment of
[expertise]{.underline}, [neither of which has been on prominent display
in Moscow]{.underline} [when it comes to the invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline}

The range of [[cyber forces arrayed against Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}'s
government in the current crisis also represents a potential source of
further uncertainty that [[could produce cyber-prompted nuclear
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to Ukraine's cyber forces,
which are active against Russian targets of all stripes, Kyiv has
benefited from massive Western support for its operations in cyberspace,
including from hacktivist elements to hundreds of thousands of
volunteers that are being coordinated by Ukrainian state auspices.

Added to this is the fact that, in addition to military equipment, Kyiv
has been receiving non-battlefield aid from NATO member states,
particularly those that are most geographically proximate, including
Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. There is clearly a narrow
situation here in which [[Russian leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}, under
the current internal political conditions, [[may
see]{.underline}]{.mark} possible **[[Western intention in cyber events
involving NC3]{.underline}]{.mark}** or related systems.

#### Escalation is likely\-\--accidents, fog of war, and wargame simulations prove 

**Schneider '22** \[Jacquelyn; March 7; Hoover Fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University; Foreign Affairs, "The Biggest Cyber
Risk in Ukraine? How Russian Hacking Could Threaten Nuclear Stability,"
<https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-07/biggest-cyber-risk-ukraine>\]

Why the apparent restraint? It is almost impossible to know exactly why
(or if) the Russians have indeed held back. Perhaps cyber-operations
have been attempted and failed; perhaps Russian President Vladimir Putin
has held his cyber-capabilities in reserve, saving them for later. Or
maybe cyber-operations have taken place, but their effect---which is
often virtual and not clearly attributed---will take longer to
materialize.

What is known is that the conflict is far from over, and the next
question becomes whether cyber-operations could play a larger role as
the war turns more violent. It is likely that the next stage of conflict
will more than ever be defined by planes, tanks, artillery, and
soldiers. It seems unlikely, given the amount of indiscriminate damage
currently being inflicted by Russia, that cyber-operations will escalate
the violence of the campaign within Ukraine. That said, [[could
cyber-op]{.mark}eration[s lead to]{.mark} horizontal [escalation,
**drawing NATO in**]{.mark}**to the** fight]{.underline}, for example?
Or, given that the United States and Russia are the world's largest
nuclear powers, [[could cyber-op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [escalate
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the worst possible outcome---**[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**? [[Recent]{.mark} wargaming [research
suggests]{.mark} that [cyber-exploits into nuclear **c**]{.mark}**ommand
[and c]{.mark}ontrol**]{.underline} [[may]{.mark} be enticing for states
looking to [neutralize a **nuclear**]{.mark} **escalation
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the midst of a conventional war, [and
that [actors]{.mark} may [underestimate the danger of]{.mark}
these]{.underline} exploits and vulnerabilities [to **[nuclear
stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

GETTING PULLED IN

[One way cyber-operations could lead to escalation is by
pulling]{.underline} the United States or NATO into the conflict. Mark
Warner, the Democratic senator from Virginia, warned in late February
that potential Russian cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in
Ukraine could have accidental spillover effects on NATO countries---for
instance if a Russian cyberattack on Ukrainian energy infrastructure
caused an outage in a NATO neighbor like Poland. This could
inadvertently trip Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty, which states
that an armed attack against one member state will be considered an
attack against them all. This would be uncharted waters for NATO, which
only recently publicly stated that cyberattacks might invoke Article 5
and is still ambiguous about what types of cyberattack---which range
from virtual outages to data manipulations to physical damage (in
extremely rare circumstances)---might be serious enough for NATO to
respond with conventional retaliation.

The Biden administration has warned that the United States would respond
to cyberattacks on U.S. critical infrastructure, such as the country's
electrical grid or water supply (although officials stopped short of
saying how the United States would respond). So far, the United States
has answered previous cyberattacks with either sanctions, law
enforcement actions, or the confiscation of cryptoassets. None of these
options seem likely to deter Putin at this point, and so the Biden
administration may find itself in an unprecedented position of having
few credible options to threaten Russia. It is certainly possible that
Putin, facing a conventional war that he thinks he might lose, could
attack critical infrastructure in the United States or other NATO
countries in the hope that their citizens will push their governments to
abandon Ukraine. The financial sector, in particular, would seem to be a
logical target for Russian cyberattacks, given the damage that Western
economic actions have already done to the Russian economy.

It is difficult to create widespread and long-lasting effects with
cyberattacks, however, and the financial sector is the best equipped and
most advanced cyber-defender in the world. Plus, research I've conducted
with Sarah Kreps, director of the Cornell Tech Policy Lab, finds that
the American public views cyberattacks as qualitatively different from
conventional means of warfare---more akin to economic sanctions than
bombs. Thus, cyberattacks are unlikely to provoke the kind of
retaliation or emotional response that would pull the United States or
its NATO allies into a war with Russia. What's more, the United States
can probably withstand the short-term damage to critical infrastructure
that a Russian cyberattack might create, and such attacks might actually
increase resolve to support Ukraine. This means a deliberate choice by
Russia to use cyberattacks against the United States or NATO to
"escalate to dominate"---deliberately ratcheting up the pressure to
force Washington to back off---would likely fail.

[A]{.underline} more [troubling scenario involves **[accidental
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[from
cyber-]{.mark}op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}---that is, [when
critical infrastructure is unintentionally damaged by a cyberattack or
when a cyberattack is misattributed to Russia (or the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates). This is especially
dangerous for civilian infrastructure that also serves military or
security purposes---for example, harming a refugee train by using a
cyberattack targeting railroads also used to move troops and supplies to
the front. Plus, [[a jumble of actors has jumped into this space,
from]{.underline} **[criminal syndicates]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[cyber-militias]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
hacker collectives such as Anonymous. [[That increases the
chances]{.mark} that [one]{.mark} of these players will target civilian
infrastructure, and misattribution]{.underline} to either Russia or the
United States **[[could]{.mark} needlessly [trigger
retal]{.mark}iation]{.underline}**.

WHEN CYBER GOES NUCLEAR

[By far the most dangerous form of escalation is the possibility that a
cyber-operation increases the likelihood of **nuclear
war.**]{.underline} [How likely is such a scenario? No one may know if
Russia has a cyberweapon that can target nuclear weapons]{.underline}
(or, for that matter, whether the United States does[), but there are
theories and some data about how the cyber-realm might **affect nuclear
stability.**]{.underline}

American policymakers have generally recognized that [[attempting to
interfere with nuclear command, control, and comm]{.mark}unications
[could]{.mark} [lead]{.mark} to **dangerous incentives for
[states]{.mark} to [launch nuclear weapons
preemptively]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Threats to nuclear command and
control, for example, could leave states so fearful about their
second-strike capability]{.underline} (the ability to launch a nuclear
weapon in retaliation against an attacker) [that in the midst of a
conflict they would feel compelled to use nuclear weapons
**preemptively**]{.underline}. Some scholars have warned that
[[attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} against nuclear command-and-control
systems [could [make it **impossible to control nuclear war and keep it
limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[[leading to]{.mark}
inadvertent [nuclear Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Despite these
fears about the dangers of attacking nuclear command and control, there
was never an agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union
(and subsequently Russia) to not attack each other's nuclear command,
control, and communications.

**[[Would Russia]{.mark}, or even the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies, [[launch a cyberattack
against]{.mark} an [enemy]{.mark}'s nuclear
[command-and-control]{.mark}]{.underline} system if they could? And how
might that capability affect nuclear instability? Beginning in 2017,
[[my team at the Naval War College]{.mark} and the Hoover Institution
**[ran a wargame that explored this]{.mark}** very
question]{.underline}. It took place [[over three years]{.mark} and
included 580 players]{.underline} from across the world---predominantly
nuclear, cyber, and military experts ranging from former heads of state
to military officers to industry leaders. In our simulations, we found
that [[teams who were told they possessed
cyber-exploits]{.underline}]{.mark} against nuclear command-and-control
systems **[overwhelmingly [used them]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[Because
cyber-op]{.mark}eration[s can be denied and are covert]{.mark} and
virtual, [players appeared to believe that they]{.mark} [did not pose
too great a risk of escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The tools seemed
too valuable not to use, especially because they have a quick expiration
date, with vulnerabilities quickly patched once discovered.

#### Cyber-attacks trigger retaliation and false readings\-\--nuclear war. 

**Klare '19** \[Michael; November 19; Professor Emeritus of Peace and
World Security Studies at Hampshire College, Senior Visiting Fellow at
the Arms Control Association; Arms Control Today, "Cyber Battles,
Nuclear Outcomes? Dangerous New Pathways to Escalation"
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation>\]

Yet [another pathway to **[escalation]{.mark}** could [arise
from]{.mark} a **[cascading]{.mark} series** of
**[cyberstrikes]{.mark}**]{.underline} and counterstrikes
[[against]{.mark} vital **national
[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than on military targets.
[[All]{.mark} **major [powers]{.mark}**[, along with **Iran**
and]{.mark} **North [Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}, have developed and
[[deployed]{.mark} cyber[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} designed
[to]{.underline} disrupt and [destroy]{.underline} major elements of [an
adversary's]{.underline} key economic systems, such as [power
grids]{.underline}, financial systems, and transportation networks. As
noted, Russia has infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid, and it is widely
believed that the United States has done the same in
Russia.[12](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote12) The
Pentagon has also devised a plan known as "Nitro Zeus," intended to
immobilize the entire Iranian economy and so force it to capitulate to
U.S. demands or, if that approach failed, to pave the way for a
crippling air and missile
attack.[13](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote12)

[The danger]{.underline} here [is that **economic
[attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} of this sort, [if]{.underline}
undertaken [during a period of tension]{.underline} and crisis, [could
[lead to]{.mark} an **[escalating]{.mark}** series of
**[tit-for-tat]{.mark} attacks** [against]{.mark}]{.underline} ever
[more [vital]{.mark} elements of an adversary's **critical
[infrastructure]{.mark}**, producing widespread chaos]{.underline} and
harm [and]{.underline} eventually [[leading]{.mark} one side [to]{.mark}
initiate **[kinetic attacks]{.mark}** on critical military targets,
[risking]{.mark} the **slippery slope** to **[nuc]{.mark}lear
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [a **[Russian]{.mark}**
cyber[attack]{.mark} on the]{.underline} U.S. [power grid could trigger
**U.S. attacks** on Russian **energy**]{.underline} and financial
systems, causing widespread disorder in both countries and generating an
impulse for even more devastating attacks. At some point, such
[attacks]{.underline} "could [[lead to]{.mark} major conflict
and]{.underline} possibly [**[nuc]{.mark}lear
[war]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline}[14](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation#endnote14)

These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from the
offensive use of cyberweapons. [Others include]{.underline} efforts by
[third parties, such as **[proxy]{.mark} states** [or
**terrorist**]{.mark} organization**[s]{.mark}**, to [provoke a
**global**]{.mark} **nuclear [crisis]{.mark}** [by causing]{.mark}
**early-warning** systems to generate **[false
readings]{.mark}**]{.underline} ("spoofing") [[of missile]{.mark}
launche[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, they do provide a clear indication
of the severity of the threat. [As states' reliance on **cyberspace**
grows]{.underline} and cyberweapons become more powerful, [the [dangers
of]{.mark}]{.underline} unintended or **[[accident]{.mark}al
escalation]{.underline}** can only [[grow]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[severe]{.underline}.

#### Only US-Russia nuclear war causes extinction 

**Bostrom '2** \[Nick; Oxford philosophy professor; "Existential Risks:
Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards," nickbostrom
website\]

A [much greater existential risk emerged with the build-up of [nuclear
arsenals in the US and the USSR]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [An
all-out nuclear war was a possibility with both a substantial
probability and with consequences that might have been persistent enough
to qualify as global and terminal. There was a real worry]{.underline}
among those best acquainted with the information available at the time
[that a nuclear Armageddon would occur and that it [might annihilate our
species]{.mark} or permanently destroy human
civilization]{.underline}.\[4\] **[[Russia and the US retain large
nuclear arsenals]{.mark} that could be used in a future confrontation,
either accidentally or deliberately. Ther]{.underline}**e is also a risk
that other states may one day build up large nuclear arsenals. [Note
however that a [smaller nuclear exchange]{.mark}, between India and
Pakistan for instance, [is not an existential
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [since it would not
destroy]{.underline}]{.mark} [or thwart [humankind's potential
**permanently**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a war might however be a
local terminal risk for the cities most likely to be targeted.
Unfortunately, we shall see that nuclear Armageddon and comet or
asteroid strikes are mere preludes to the existential risks that we will
encounter in the 21st century.

#### Developing an integrated OCO doctrine among NATO allies solves cyberconflict 

**Lewis '15** \[James; October; Director and Senior Fellow, Strategic
Technologies Program, Center for Strategic and International Studies;
\"THE ROLE OF OFFENSIVE CYBER OPERATIONS IN NATO'S COLLECTIVE DEFENCE,"
Tallin Paper No. 8, A NATO CCDCOE Publication on Strategic Cyber
Security, https://www.ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf\]

[The central question for NATO's cyber doctrine is how the [lack
of]{.mark} an **[articulated]{.mark} offensive [cyber
capability]{.mark}** [affects]{.mark} its **[ability to deter]{.mark}**
or defend.]{.underline} Put another way, [can any military force
credibly claim to have advanced capabilities if it does not include
offensive cyber operations in its arsenal? Offensive capabilities,
unlike NATO's current defensive posture, involve deliberate intrusions
into opponent networks or systems with the intention of causing
disruption, damage or destruction.]{.underline} The question of NATO and
offensive cyber capabilities touches on a range of sensitive political
issues that militate against any change in policy in the near term.

[[The US has]{.mark} always [been **overly secretive**]{.mark} about its
offensive cyber capabilities, even after a flood of media leaks have
made the most sensitive doctrine publicly available. [This]{.mark}
**secrecy** [has carried over into **NATO**, and is **unhelpful** in
that it **increases**]{.mark} the [likelihood of]{.mark} opponents
**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulating as they consider the risks of using force or
coercion against NATO members or interests. A [lack of]{.mark} public
**[discourse]{.mark}** [on **o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** **[undercuts]{.mark}** the
[**legitimacy** of **NATO op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** by failing
to build public understanding, and leaves NATO open to charges of
sinister plots, since denial of offensive capabilities is not credible
when two NATO members are world leaders in cyber
operations.]{.underline}

Parallels between cyber operations and nuclear strategy are usually
misleading, but cannot always be dismissed. The parallel for NATO is
that [cyber attack is a "weapon"]{.underline} with both strategic and
tactical uses, [which only a few NATO members possess]{.underline}.
Unlike nuclear weapons, however, [the [procedures for integrating
**o**]{.mark}ffensive **[c]{.mark}**yber
**[o]{.mark}**peration**[s]{.mark}** [into **NATO's defensive actions**
are **not**]{.mark} at all **[obvious]{.mark}**, if they exist. [NATO
will **need to describe** how]{.mark} the **[cyber
capabilities]{.mark}** possessed by]{.underline} a few of [its members
[will **support NATO's defensive activities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
[NATO's credibility in defence **requires some public discussion** on
the use of **o**ffensive **c**yber **o**peration**s**.]{.underline}

There has been a confusing debate over the merits of cyber deterrence,
but one conclusion that we can draw from this discussion is that both
[the contribution of **[cyber op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** to
deterrence and the ability to deter cyber attack [work **best** when
**embedded** in]{.mark} [a larger military]{.mark} force
[structure]{.mark}. Adding offensive cyber capabilities to NATO's force
structure and response doctrine will increase its deterrent
capabilities]{.underline} -- by how much is unclear, but what is clear
is that [a failure to add cyber capabilities will erode a credible
deterrent as cyber operations are increasingly embedded into military
operations]{.underline}.5

Beyond deterrence, two other factors point to the need for additional
consideration of NATO's public posture on offensive cyber operations.
The first is that [**[cyber]{.mark}** technique**[s]{.mark}** are
[**essential** for]{.mark} the kinds of [combat]{.mark} operations that
NATO forces may carry out [in the future]{.mark}. No modern **air
force** would enter into combat without electronic warfare (EW)
capabilities]{.underline}; as cyber and EW merge into a single activity,
[air operations will require cyber support. The same is true for
**special** forces **op**eration**s**. **[Of]{.mark}**fensive
**[c]{.mark}**yber capabilities [will shape the battlefields of the
future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Second, [NATO's potential opponents will use cyber techniques in new
ways, in what some have called "hybrid warfare".]{.underline}6 [These
include]{.underline} countries traditionally of concern to NATO, but
[[cyber threats could]{.mark} also [come from new actors]{.mark}, such
as **Iran** or **North Korea**, [and proxy or non-state actors
such]{.mark} as the **Syrian Electronic Army**.]{.underline} These
nations and groups, using cyber techniques, now have new ways to strike
NATO countries.

[Military doctrine is changing as opponents seek to circumvent US
military power and use a blend of political action and "influence
operations", special forces, proxies and irregular units, unconventional
tactics and cyber techniques to apply force to gain their
ends.]{.underline} Cyber techniques for political action and "influence
operations" are not intended to destroy or disrupt, but [rather to put
coercive political pressure on targets. This [new]{.mark} style of
[warfare]{.mark} [will **challenge planning for mutual
defence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} For these reasons, the need for more
than defensive or technical cyber capabilities will increase.7

#### [NATO OCOs]{.underline} key to win cyberwar\-\--prevents nuclear meltdowns and financial collapse 

**Iftimie '20** \[Ion A.; May; PhD, Eisenhower PhD Candidate Fellow,
NATO Defense College, and Senior Advisor, European Union Research
Center, George Washington University School of Business; NDC Policy
Brief, "NATO\'s needed offensive cyber capabilities," no. 10\]

[Cyber as a hybrid threat to, and enabler of, military
operations]{.underline}

[**[All]{.mark} future [military confrontations]{.mark}** [are]{.mark}
expected [to be fought with **cyber weapons**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
These [**[offensive]{.mark} cyber [capabilities]{.mark}** [in the hands
of adversaries pose a]{.mark} **significant [threat]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the **[military forces]{.mark}** [and **critical
infrastructure** of NATO]{.mark} member states]{.underline}; and [the
Alliance **recognizes** that **cyber-attacks** (as hybrid threats) can
be **as damaging as conventional** ones]{.underline}. This is [because
malicious cyber activities against [computers that control physical
processes]{.mark} can be as dangerous as threats that are purely
physical]{.underline} in nature and [[could lead to]{.mark}
**explosions,** **[nuclear meltdowns]{.mark}**, **blackouts**, [or
**financial crises**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As put by NATO Secretary
General, ["[in]{.mark} just [**minutes**, a **single**]{.mark}
cyber**[attack]{.mark}** can inflict billions of dollars' worth of
damage to our economies, bring global companies to a
standstill]{.underline}, ~~paralyze~~ our critical infrastructure,
undermine our democracies and ~~cripple~~ our military capabilities".4

Over the past decade, [Allies have identified a steep increase in cyber
activities targeting the critical infrastructure sectors that NATO
military operations rely upon.]{.underline} Directly or indirectly,
[these malicious cyber activities [can]{.mark} also [disrupt]{.mark} the
Alliance's **[logistics]{.mark}** and **[forward
op]{.mark}**eration[**s**.]{.mark} **NATO's commitment** to]{.underline}
"operate and [**defend itself** "]{.underline}5 [in the **cyber**
domain]{.underline} as effectively as in the geographic domains
[came]{.underline}, thus, [as a **direct recognition** of cyber as a
hybrid threat to both the Allies and the Alliance.]{.underline}

Compared to the air, land and sea domains, the cyber domain is not
constrained by national borders (although certain physical aspects of it
might be located within them). This distinction between the cyber and
the geographic domains is important to note, because NATO was founded in
response to external military threats without the right to intervene in
internal security matters, where member states maintain the monopoly
over the use of force. In the cyber domain, the distinction between
internal and external security threats is harder to ascertain. When
integrating offensive cyber capabilities into its defence and deterrence
mandate, NATO would inevitably tackle certain aspects inherent to
internal security; and yet, not legally infringe on the sovereignty of
the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or intervention are not
employed against the physical systems residing in these nations.6
[[Operating]{.mark} in the cyber domain [requires]{.mark}]{.underline},
thus, [that [member states **better integrate**]{.mark} their
**[offensive cyber]{.mark}** [capabilities]{.mark} into NATO operations
not just to win future wars, but also [to **avoid**]{.mark} elements of
[**friction** between Allies]{.mark}, which may arise [from
**unilateral**]{.mark} cyber **[effects]{.mark}** to defend critical
infrastructure.]{.underline}

NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain

[Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats. [Within the
Alliance]{.mark}, however, [offensive cyber]{.mark} effects are [**not
yet part** of]{.mark} the **[mission planning]{.mark}** process and
**[integration]{.mark}** of national offensive cyber capabilities [into
**joint**]{.mark} NATO **[op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}** is
voluntary. [Integrating]{.mark} these national offensive cyber
capabilities into NATO operations, thus **[requires]{.mark}**, not only
a clear understanding of these capabilities, but also [**agreement** on
the]{.mark} cyber **[threat environment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
characterized by the intent and capabilities of NATO's current and/or
potential future adversaries.

[State adversaries]{.underline} in the cyber domain [include
[**Russia**, **China**]{.mark} and/or **[Iran]{.mark}**. These
[are]{.mark} countries known to be [building offensive cyber]{.mark}
capabilities specifically for the **purpose** of **using them [against
NATO]{.mark}** member states]{.underline}.7 In [Russia's]{.underline}
case, [cyber attacks were conducted]{.underline} against the critical
infrastructure of NATO member states and partner nations, as for example
[against US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear
powerplant]{.underline} near Burlington, Kansas)8 or against the Ukraine
power grid in December 2015. [[China has]{.mark} also [been
conducting]{.mark} **[persistent]{.mark}** cyber **[espionage]{.mark}**
using offensive cyber capabilities against core military and critical
infrastructure of NATO member states for years.]{.underline} For this
reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark T. Esper, remarked at the 2020
Munich Security Conference that [the **[5G Huawei
infrastructure]{.mark}** [is a **serious threat**]{.mark} to
NATO]{.underline}.9 Lastly, [**Iran's** offensive cyber capabilities
have also been observed during multiple attacks against the critical
infrastructure of NATO partner nations in the Middle East]{.underline}.

[NATO adversaries in the cyber domain also include non-state
actors]{.underline}, such as terrorist organizations. [The
US]{.underline} and the UK have [conducted]{.underline} several
successful **[o]{.underline}**ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yber
**[o]{.underline}**peration[s]{.underline} against those entities.
[These]{.underline} offensive cyber operations [had a significant force
multiplier effect]{.underline}, in conjunction with conventional actions
on the ground, at sea, in the air and from space, that contributed to
the defeat of Daesh in both Iraq and Syria.10 Today, most [Allies are
building offensive cyber capabilities needed to **deny adversaries the
freedom of maneuver**]{.underline} in the cyber domain.

The use of area denial weapon systems in the cyber domain

Anti-Access/Area Denial (**[A2/AD]{.underline}**) [weapon systems have
traditionally been used by NATO]{.underline} and its member states [to
prevent an adversary\'s freedom of maneuver on land, sea or
air]{.underline}. In the geographic domains, these capabilities include
land mines, missiles (cruise, ballistic, surface to air, anti-ship,
etc.), submarines, electronic warfare, and even Chemical, Biological,
Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) weapons. In the cyber
domain A2/AD is achieved through offensive cyber operations.

Those operations have already been used for the purpose of achieving
A2/AD by NATO member states in the cyber domain. This is the case of
**[the US-led]{.underline}** Operation Glowing Symphony
(**[OGS]{.underline}**), [where \"the United States Cyber Command
reportedly]{.underline} acquired administrator [passwords]{.underline}
to \[Daesh\] websites. The passwords enabled deletion of digital
content, including videos used for recruitment, from cyber
infrastructure located in at least five countries outside actively
hostile areas of Iraq and Syria. Similar digital content reportedly
resided on cyber infrastructure in as many as 30 other States. Changing
the passwords reportedly locked IS administrators out of the web-
sites\". OGS restricted Daesh\'s freedom of maneuver on networks
physically residing in Iraq and Syria (which were controlled by the
terrorist group), but also worldwide, where a NATO member state (the US)
achieved denial of service effects against Daesh.

[OGS disrupted Daesh propaganda]{.underline} through content removal
from servers residing in multiple countries and through restricting
access to physical infrastructure needed to store digital data.
[Combined with operational successes against ISIL on the ground, OGS
actions resulted in]{.underline} [propaganda efforts being significantly
reduced]{.underline} on several global social media plat-forms,
including Twitter. One particular offensive cyber operation acted, ipso
facto, as an A2/AD platform where a NATO member state restricted access
to physical networks critical for Daesh recruitment, training,
radicalization, fundraising, and command and control.

**[[Integrating offensive cyber]{.mark} capabilities into NATO\'s
mandate for cyber deterrence and defence]{.underline}**

Operationalizing warfighting capabilities in the cyber domain, beyond
the traditional geographic domains, requires a new way of fighting in
the 21st century, challenging the deterrence and defence mandate of the
Alliance.

Speaking at the Cyber Defence Pledge Conference in London in May 2019,
NATO Secretary General highlighted that for deterrence to have full
effect against state and non-state adversaries, NATO and its member
states must be ready to use the full range of capabilities at their
disposal, to include national offensive cyber capabilities. Deterrence
is the act of diminishing an adversary\'s intent by highlighting the
excessive costs for the said adversary if it proceeds with an undesired
action. In NATO\'s case, deterrence is achieved by highlighting to an
adversary the excessive costs delivered through military means in the
event of an attack against Allies. For deterrence to be successful, the
adversary must believe that NATO is ready and willing to impose these
excessive costs across all operational domains, to include the cyber ■UK

domain. This may call for Allies to develop offensive cyber capabilities
and integrate them with NATO operations in order to collectively impose
a high enough cost to deter adversaries from aggressive behaviour. To
avoid escalation to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of
war, Allies must also agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options
meant to allow for a gradual increase

of pressure in the cyber domain, and then hopefully limiting the scope
and intensity of conflict in this do-main. NATO Flexible Deterrent
[Options in the cyber domain could include]{.underline} (as presented in
Figure 1):

• [[Increasing NATO\'s readiness]{.mark} posture [through **cyber
education, training and exercises;**]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [Deploying NATO **Cyber Rapid Reaction teams** to conduct defensive
cyber operations and protecting critical infrastructure of NATO member
states and/or that NATO operations rely upon]{.underline};

• Increasing public awareness of malicious cyber activities and the
potential for conflict in the cy-ber domain;

• [[Taking steps to gain]{.mark} the [support]{.mark} of all NATO member
states [in response to the cyber threat]{.mark}]{.underline} and in
accordance with commitments of the 2016 Cyber Defence Pledge and the
2018 Brus-sels Summit;

• **[[Triggering Article 4]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Treaty to
enhance **[[info]{.mark}rmation-[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and
mutual assistance]{.underline}]{.mark} in the cyber domain;

• Making official statements addressing violations of international law
in the cyber domain;

• Alerting and **[[deploying offensive cyber opera-tions
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**;

• [Imposing cyber sanctions;]{.underline}

• **[[Conducting offensive cyber operations to achieve A2/AD
effects]{.mark} in the cyber domain]{.underline}**;

Offensive cyber operations have already been used for the purpose of
achieving A2/AD by NATO member states

• Triggering Article 5 of the Treaty; and

• [[Conducting offensive cyber operations]{.underline}]{.mark} in
com-bination with other maneuver forces across all operational domains.

12 Cyber sanctions are defined here as \"the actual or threatened
restriction of digital transactions to affect a behavioural change by a
NATO adversary through the introduction of psychological pressure
against its political leaders and populace\"; see A. Iftimie, \"Cyber
sanctions: weapo- nizing the embargo of flagged data in a fragmented
internet\", Journal of Information Warfare, Vol.19, No.1, 2020, p.52. 

[NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams are already equipped to conduct
defensive cyber operations]{.underline} in support of member states if
called upon. A mandate of cyber defence and security implies, however,
that NATO also starts to engage in active military measures to deny,
degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy an adversary\'s offensive cyber
capabilities. This requires the development of not only offensive cyber
A2/AD capabilities by Allies, but also the restructuring of the NATO
command structures, policies, processes

To avoid escalation to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of
war, Allies must also agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options

(procurement, intelligence, operations, etc.) and engagements needed to
integrate them by the Alliance. [**[NATO coordination]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline}]{.mark} [both national and regional entities charged
with [cyber **security**]{.mark} **aspects will**]{.underline}, in
particular, **[[need to be enhanced]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many
agreements already exist in the realm of defensive cyber at national and
regional levels (as seen with the 2016 NATO-EU Technical Arrangement on
Cyber Defence), but [politica]{.underline}l [consensus among Allies is
missing on whether they should be expanded to incorporate the collective
use of offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities.]{.underline}

Conclusion

**[[The lack of integrated offensive cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** A2/AD
**[capabilities]{.underline}** [[undermines]{.mark} both [the **unity of
the Alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and its mandate of defence]{.mark}
[and **deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the former, the lack of
coordination between Allies during unilateral cyber operations could
lead to friction when resulting effects infringe on Allied
cyber-physical infrastructures[. [It could also lead to **cyber
fratricide**]{.mark}, when **failure to properly attribute** Allied
digital personas occurs during these military operations]{.underline}.
On the latter, while most Allies are developing offensive cyber
capabilities, some remain unable to face the growing number of cyber
threats unilaterally.

[Successful defence and deterrence in the cyber domain calls, thus, [for
ready **collective offensive**]{.mark}]{.underline} cyber A2/AD
**[[capabilities that, when]{.mark} [integrated with NATO]{.mark}
operations]{.underline}**, [[would]{.mark} complement
national]{.underline} [and]{.underline}/ or [regional responses to
malicious cyber activities. If and when this integration
occurs,]{.underline} NATO Flexible Deterrence Options would also need to
be agreed upon in order to [[signal cyber
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} that Allies will re-spond with one
voice if attacked in the cyber domain. Ultimately, political consensus
within the Alliance would still need to be built on the type of needed
collective offensive cyber capabilities (such as for A2/ AD purposes)
and on how to integrate them into NATO\'s existing operations and
missions.

#### Nuclear meltdowns cause extinction

**Nadesan '14** \[Majia; September 13; professor of communication at
ASU, their interdisciplinary research examines the ethical implications
of societal governing logics and risk-management strategies; "The
Nuclear Energy Paradigm Collides with Earth Changes and Technospheric
Breakdown," The Millenium Report,
themillenniumreport.com/2014/09/will-fukushima-become-an-extinction-level-event\]

[**As Technospheric Breakdown Accelerates, [Nuclear]{.mark}** Power
Generation **[Mishaps will Increase and Intensify]{.mark}**]{.underline}

There is really no way around this eventuality. [As [all]{.mark} the
nuclear [power plants]{.mark} age, they will [succumb to]{.mark} the
**[micro-stresses]{.mark}** which **[inevitably]{.mark}** occur in such
**a**n ever-**deteriorating environment**. Most people are **unaware**
of the true depth and breadth of technospheric breakdown since it is a
concept **rarely taken up by academia** or the media]{.underline}. The
following excerpts provide a wider perspective of [this unavoidable
byproduct of the Industrial Revolution.]{.underline}

[Technospheric breakdown is something that occurs **everywhere** around
the globe, **24/7**, without interruption, and with tremendous
repercussions]{.underline}. Let's start with [anything that has been
manufactured in the factories of the modern world or built on the
surface of the Earth.]{.underline} Simply put, everything [is in the
constant state of breaking down, degeneration,
deterioration.]{.underline}

What does this really mean when we say that every bridge is slowly
breaking down, every road is in greater disrepair with each passing day,
every reservoir is gradually degrading, every office building, every
factory, every school, every home, etc. most of which adhered to very
low building standards in the first place?

What does it mean when [the infrastructure for every]{.underline} sewer
[system]{.underline}, municipal water division, electrical grid,
airport, railway station, etc. [is in a slow but sure process of
degrading and breaking down. So]{.underline}, unfortunately, [is **every
nuclear power plant across the planet**.]{.underline} (Cosmic
Convergence)

[What makes this ongoing process of physical degradation so insidious is
that it almost always occurs **subliminally**]{.underline}. Through a
gathering array of various forces throughout post-modern civilization,
there does exist a sort of conspiracy of circumstances which has greatly
magnified the effects of technospheric breakdown. The completed marriage
between the industrial base of the Western powers and the financial
class throughout the world has guaranteed that this slow motion collapse
will continue unabated. How so?

Because so many corporate decisions are made according to their impact
on the bottom line, [many inferior nuclear power plants have been
constructed around the globe.]{.underline} Likewise, because the
mega-banks and investment houses are now dictating to a
financially-strapped Nuclear Energy Industry, [**[substandard]{.mark}**
nuclear **[reactors]{.mark}** have been designed, engineered and
**[continue to be]{.mark}** put **[in]{.mark}**to **[operation]{.mark}**
across the planet.]{.underline} One only has to take a close look at the
websites dedicated to decommissioned nuclear reactors or cold shutdowns
or partially closed nuclear power plants or emergency actions taken at
various nuclear power generation sites to grasp just how precarious a
position the entire industry is currently in.

Unknown to even many of the nuclear engineers who address these issues
'in the office', or who fix the cascade of problems at nuke plants
themselves, is the notion of [slow motion, subclinical, pernicious
technospheric breakdown.]{.underline} It often [manifests in ways where
cause and effect cannot be easily established because of some of the
unseen forces produced by atomic fission.]{.underline} With that said,
it should be noted that a chapter could easily be dedicated to this
particular issue alone, so significant is it to the future of nuclear
power generation

Then there is the problem of **[[nuclear wastes]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and natural rights, yes?

No one has articulated this point better than Albert Bates in his
definitive essay entitled The Karma of Kerma: Nuclear Wastes and Natural
Rights (Bates, A.K., 1988)

This extremely lucid and illuminating, sober and sane treatment of [[the
**greatest**]{.mark} **ongoing [environmental disaster]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}of our times]{.underline} lays bare the most basic legal and
human rights issues which [converge around the production, treatment and
storage of nuclear wastes.]{.underline} Were the governments of the
world to read and take to heart its simple and straightforward thesis,
the current incarnation of nuclear energy production would have been
abandoned years ago:

[The disposal of radioactive substances in a manner that anticipates
their eventual partial release into the human environment imposes [a
**health burden**]{.mark} up[on]{.mark} [**future generations** that
**cannot be justified**]{.mark}]{.underline} by any moral or legal
rationale. Like an irresistible force meeting an immovable object, the
concept of the greater good for the many in the present generation runs
against the concept of the inalienable rights of each individual in
future eras. At present, in matters involving nuclear power, our
governmental agencies have taken the side of the irresistible force. But
when federal agencies venture to tread beyond of the scope of the
foundation principles with which the federal government was fashioned,
they endanger more than human lives. At risk in the nuclear waste debate
are long-held concepts of ordered liberty. (Bates A. K., 1988)

Fukushima has illustrated exactly why this elegantly stated legal
concept of human rights and moral imperative is so pertinent to the
public discourse. [When massive amounts of radioactive wastewater are
dumped into the Pacific Ocean, not only [**human life** will be
adversely affected]{.mark}. Marine life has been negatively impacted in
ways that will take decades to observe and comprehend.]{.underline} The
outright destruction of the environment in and around Fukushima and the
Pacific Ocean must also be considered in any meaningful assessment of
collateral damage.

Perhaps even more than Chernobyl, [Fukushima has allowed the global
community to view the whole event]{.underline} through the lens of legal
responsibility and ethical outcomes [so that new international standards
can be written and implemented]{.underline} regarding nuclear waste
conveyance and disposal. If nothing else, this discussion has raised
awareness about the most nagging issue concerning the NEP. Whereas the
human rights aspect confers the legal right to not be contaminated by
nuclear radiation has barely been addressed by those responsible for it
consequences, it now enjoys a prominent place throughout the worldwide
debate.

[Accidents and mishaps, manmade and natural disasters
happen.]{.underline} Things are fixed fairly quickly in this postmodern
age, and life goes on. Whether these events occur in a full-blown war
zone or in the wake of a hurricane, the affected population usually does
everything it can to rebuild and move on.

[However, when these events take place in or near nuclear power plants,
**life** doesn't just go on. It often **stops**]{.underline}. Depending
on the circumstances and seriousness of a nuclear event, [sometimes life
stops in that area for a long time.]{.underline}

[[Our **civilization** has]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[been
given]{.underline}]{.mark} three unmistakable **[[wakeup
calls]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the advent of the nuclear power
generation era. First there was [Three Mile Island]{.underline} in
Pennsylvania, then there was [Chernobyl]{.underline} in the Ukraine, and
lastly the world is still reeling from the specter of possibilities
which are presented by [Fukushima]{.underline}.

Surely [it is not by chance that these three flagrant examples of
nuclear Perfect Storms occurred around the globe affecting major nations
and populations centers]{.underline}. Each of these disasters has served
to wake up whole swaths of humanity to the dangers and risks which are
associated with the current Nuclear Energy Paradigm. To ignore, or deny,
or refute the obvious lessons which all three nuclear catastrophes have
given to humankind would be folly of the highest order.

[[The **global impact** of]{.mark} Fukushima, which has [disseminated
radionuclides]{.mark} (radioactive contaminants) by air and by way of
the largest of the seven seas, stands as dramatic testimony to all that
can go wrong]{.underline} --- seriously wrong --- with the current
nuclear energy business model and method of power generation. [**Can it
get any worse** than Fukushima? That we are compelled to even ask this
question speaks volumes about the true state of the affairs]{.underline}
on that 25 square mile patch of land and contiguous sea which surround
the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster site.

Given this inescapable testament of nuclear folly, it is now incumbent
upon the community of nations to rally around the obvious necessity of
terminating the current form of the Nuclear Energy Paradigm. Why?
Because when a "China Syndrome" occurs anywhere in the world, **[it
[will inevitably affect the entire planet]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
other words, an INES Level 7 (Wikipedia, International Nuclear Event
Scale) [nuclear catastrophe does not respect borders. Nor does it
discriminate between the young and old, healthy and sick, or those who
live close to ground zero from those who live far away.]{.underline}

Therefore, any nation that chooses to set up a nuclear energy-producing
operation from this point forward has an inviolable responsibility to
its neighbors, as it does to the rest of the world. Likewise, those
[[nations have]{.mark} a moral obligation [to]{.mark} proceed in a
manner that [guarantee]{.mark}s its [neighbors will not be exposed
to]{.mark} the consequences of its [nuclear accidents, even when]{.mark}
they are [caused by]{.mark} duel **[natural disaster]{.mark}** events as
we saw at Fukushima.]{.underline}

Just as Europe was contaminated with radiation from Chernobyl (Yablokov,
A.V., 2009), and North America has been contaminated from Fukushima, it
is understood that [once a nuclear catastrophe spirals out of control,
the genie of radioactive **contamination cannot be put back in the
bottle**.]{.underline} The entire Pacific Rim, in fact, has varying
degrees of exposure to the radioactive waste water being conveyed by the
ocean from Fukushima, as does the Western Hemisphere to seaborne
radioactive isotopes like Cesium-137 and airborne isotopes such as
Iodine-131(Center for Marine and Environmental Radiation).

Consequently, Japan is responsible for the damage wrought to the largest
ocean on Earth. Have they acknowledged this? Have they approached the
nations both near and far which have been affected by their cavalier and
irresponsible approach to siting reactors up and down their seismic
shorelines? Has the United Nations even addressed this extremely
important issue known as national accountability? Or territorial
sovereignty?

Conclusion

It doesn't get very much more weighty than the 'fallout from Fukushima'.
All of the affected nations have been curiously silent on this issue. It
is almost as though a conspiracy of silence has descended upon the
concerned countries because of how unpredictable and intractable the
nuclear containment problems have been at the Daiichi plant.

At the end of the day [the current race of **[humanity]{.mark}** will
look back on the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster as the **[defining
moment]{.mark}**]{.underline} for both the industry and the underlying
paradigm. If they haven't already, the [various stakeholders will be
forced to re-evaluate the integrity of their nuclear
enterprises]{.underline} around the globe. [[**Hopefully**, they
will]{.mark} begin to [take]{.mark} aggressive [**preemptive
measures**]{.mark} to address whatever needs to be addressed at every
nuclear site still in operation.]{.underline}

[[If a **decisive response** is not formulated]{.underline}]{.mark} and
implemented on a global scale, in light of the hard lessons learned from
Fukushima, [the current planetary [**civilization** will]{.mark} be
compelled to [face]{.mark} up to these [**fatal flaws**]{.mark} in most
unpleasant ways, which will continue to manifest with each major Earth
change.]{.underline} In a similar way, the inherent
[defects]{.underline} of the NEP [will only be accentuated as
technospheric breakdown accelerates.]{.underline} The profound and
fundamental shortcomings which pervade the entire nuclear energy
industry can no longer be hidden or ignored.

After all, it was the dangerous combination of willful blindness and
feigned ignorance which got the world into this position in the first
place.

"[Does anyone in their right mind believe that nuclear power plants can
ever be designed, engineered or constructed to withstand 9.0 earthquakes
followed by 15 meter high tsunamis?]{.underline} Sorry if we offend, but
such a display of so deadly a combination of ignorance and arrogance
must represent the very height of hubris. Particularly in view of the
inevitable consequences which have manifested at Fukushima, how is it
that so few saw this pre-ordained and disastrous outcome, except by
willful blindness?"

The potential [[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} associated with **[stolen or

also pose a threat to U.S. national security. The case study on
Pakistan, Syria and North Korea show how [**financial

will [[provide **terrorists**]{.mark}**' organizations** and **other
non-state groups**]{.underline}, who object to the current international
system or distribution of power, with [[opportunities to]{.mark} disrupt
global finance and]{.underline} perhaps [[weaken America's

states intent on increasing diversification of foreign currency

U.S. Army Cyber Command, Fort Belvoir, Va. (Source: U.S. Army Cyber
Command/Bill Roche)

In May 2008, the U.S. Department of Defense and the German Ministry of
Defence signed a memorandum of understanding concerning "Cooperation on
Information Assurance and Computer Network Defense." Computer network
defense (CND) refers to actions taken on computer networks to monitor
and protect those networks. It is not the only memorandum the U.S.
Department of Defense has signed with allies on cyber defense.

In late 2016, U.S. Cyber Command operators wiped Islamic State
propaganda material off a server located in Germany. The German
government was notified in some fashion but not asked for advance
consent, causing much frustration. While U.S. Cyber Command's reported
action may have violated Germany's sovereignty, it didn't explicitly
violate the memorandum. It wasn't an act of CND; it was a computer
network attack (CNA), seeking to disrupt, deny, degrade or destroy.

[This reveals an uneasy situation within cyber cooperation: [Allies do
not agree on]{.mark}]{.underline} the appropriate
[**[procedures]{.underline}** [and boundaries for **offensive cyber
operations**.]{.underline}]{.mark} More specifically, [[there is no
agreement on when military cyber organizations can gain access to
systems and networks in allied territory to disrupt adversarial
activity.]{.underline}]{.mark} As I have argued previously,
**[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** issue [[may end up causing **significant
loss in allies' trust and confidence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. My proposed
solution: [[NATO allies should establish **memoranda of understanding on
offensive cyber effects operations**]{.underline}]{.mark} in systems or
networks based in allied territory.

Objectives of Out-of-Network Operations in Allied Networks

Allied states may operate in each other's systems or networks in at
least three ways: as an observer, gathering intelligence on adversarial
activity in others' networks; as a passerby, transiting through allied
systems and networks to access a certain adversarial target; or as a
disrupter, seeking to cause friction for an adversary's operation within
an ally's network or system. The German case discussed above is the only
publicly known case of a state acting as a disrupter in an allied
network. But we can expect that more of these cases will be publicly
disclosed in the future.

It has now been widely discussed that the U.S. Cyber Command has
undergone a significant shift in strategic thinking away from deterrence
toward persistent engagement and defend forward. Following these recent
changes in strategic thinking, U.S. Cyber Command seeks to cause
friction "wherever the adversary maneuvers," operating "globally,
continuously and seamlessly." In a similar vein, NSA director and Cyber
Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone writes in an article for Joint Force
Quarterly: "We must ... maneuver seamlessly across the interconnected
battlespace, globally, as close as possible to adversaries and their
operations, and continuously shape the battlespace to create operational
advantage for us while denying the same to our adversaries."

While one may expect adversaries to maneuver in allied networks, [[the
U.S. is currently the only NATO state that makes causing friction in
allied networks a necessary and explicit component of its strategy.
Other military cyber organizations could follow]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the near future.

And we already see countries moving in this direction. On Aug. 1, the
Communications Security Establishment Act (CSE) came into force in
Canada. According to the Canadian government, "CSE could be authorized
to proactively stop or impede foreign cyber threats before they damage
Canadian systems or information holdings, and conduct online operations
to advance national objectives." The Canadian government does not
explicitly talk in its latest strategy about the need to operate
"globally, continuously and seamlessly" or to cause friction "wherever
the adversary maneuvers." In that regard, it needs to do more strategic
thinking---as other countries do---on the exact role of cyber operations
on allied networks in the military context.

But the proposed memorandum of understanding on cyber offense addresses
exactly this possibility.

The Goal of the Memorandum of Understanding

[[The goal]{.underline}]{.mark} of the proposed memorandum [**[is to
reduce discord among the allies]{.underline}**; [enhance trust,
transparency and confidence between]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}; **[[and improve the effectiveness of
disrupting]{.underline}]{.mark}** and deterring **[[adversaries'
operations in cyberspace.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The scope of the memorandum should include (a) [[developing a
common]{.underline}]{.mark} notification equity [[framework
for]{.underline} [out-of-network operations that seek to achieve cyber
effects]{.underline}]{.mark} in allied systems or networks; (b)
[[identifying]{.underline}]{.mark} [[procedures for communicating the
consideration and conduct of]{.underline}]{.mark} [[offensive cyber
effects operations between states]{.underline}]{.mark} against systems
or networks in allied territory; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (c)

In writing the memorandum, states first and foremost should agree on the
equities involved in permitting signatories to conduct cyber effect
operations in each other's networks---and the relative weight of those
equities. Equities that should be considered include (a) the ability of
an actor to take action to negate known threats on or to the other
parties' networks and systems; (b) the likelihood that an action will
negate known threats; (c) the imminence and scale of the threat; (d) the
risk of collateral damage; (e) whether the computer system or network is
government owned or privately owned; and (f) the certainty that the
system or network will be used to achieve strategic effects by the
adversary.

There are three open questions about the memorandum of understanding.

I. Should the Proposed Memorandum Be NATO-Wide or Bilateral?

[[There are benefits of negotiating a NATO-wide agreement, including
ensuring it contributes to the defense of all NATO members' networks and
**enhances resilience across the alliance**]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[It
could also guard against the potential that persistent
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** and defense forward **[[might be
exploited by adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as I argued previously:

[[Adversaries don't randomly choose which]{.underline}]{.mark}
intermediate [[nodes to direct their operations through. If
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [[has the choice to]{.underline}]{.mark} go
through a network that would [[raise]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[**[serious]{.underline}** [diplomatic friction between the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and a U.S. ally]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
operate through a network that would cause no diplomatic friction for
the U.S., what would it prefer? [[It would make
sense]{.underline}]{.mark} for adversaries to operate through the
networks of exactly those countries with which the U.S. has a strong
relationship but that do not want the U.S. to operate within their
networks causing any effects.

#### The plan reduces tensions between NATO allies with divergent cyber policy preference\-\--that enables cohesive cybersecurity policy

**Smeets '21** \[Max; Aug 6; senior researcher at the Center for
Security Studies (CSS) and Affiliate at Stanford University Center for
International Security and Cooperation and Research Associate at the
Centre for Technology and Global Affairs, University of Oxford; Hague
Center "NATO allies' offensive cyber policy: A growing divide?,"
https://hcss.nl/report/nato-allies-offensive-cyber-policy-a-growing-divide\]

NATO allies have made slow but steady progress when it comes to crafting
policy to deal with cyber security challenges. Yet this progress has not
always been made in a collaborative fashion. Especially [[when it comes
to]{.mark} the development and deployment of **[offensive
cyber]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline}, [NATO [allies are
increasingly **diverging** ]{.mark}**in policy**]{.underline}. [This is
a worrying development]{.underline} and deserves more attention than it
has so far received.

Steady progress

Member states agree on the critical need for a coherent cyber policy.
[Almost all NATO allies have developed both a cyber security strategy
and a cyber defense strategy]{.underline}.\[1\] [Some states have
published updated versions over the years to **reaffirm cyber security
as an issue of national security importance,**]{.underline} to tweak
institutional responsibilities, [or to articulate changes in the threat
landscape.]{.underline} In addition, since 2018, [most NATO allies have
established a military cyber organization]{.underline} (either a command
or unit) [with a mandate to conduct cyber effect operations
--]{.underline} that is, cyber operations intended to disrupt, deny,
degrade and/or destroy.\[2\] There is also shared recognition that
international law applies in cyberspace, although allies have yet to
spell out the legal procedures for operating in this new "domain of
warfare."

[These developments have been both reflected in, and aided by, policy
progress made at the inter-governmental level]{.underline}. At the
Prague Summit in 2002, NATO for the first time recognized that the
Alliance should "Strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber
attacks."\[3\] In 2008, at the Bucharest Summit, there was another
milestone development, when NATO adopted a "Policy on Cyber Defense,"
aiming to "protect key information systems in accordance with their
respective responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a
capability to assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber
attack."\[4\] In the same year, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence -- a NATO accredited international research institution --
was established in Tallinn, Estonia. In 2016, at the Warsaw Summit,
cyberspace was officially recognized as a "domain of operations" and
allies made a Cyber Defense Pledge to enhance their cyber defenses.\[5\]
The 2018 Brussels Summit and 2020 London Summit reiterated NATO's
commitment to implement the Cyber Defense Pledge and operationalize the
Cyber Operations Center, responsible for situational awareness and the
centralized planning of cyber operations and missions.\[6\] In January
2020, the Allied Joint Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations was published
"to plan, execute and assess cyberspace operations (CO) in the context
of allied joint operations."\[7\]

Steady divergence

Yet [[when it comes to]{.mark} the direction of [allies' cyber policy,
growing differences are apparent]{.mark}]{.underline} [--]{.mark}
[especially]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the development and deployment
**[o]{.mark}ffensive [c]{.mark}yber capabilities**]{.underline}. First,
even though most states now have -- or are in the process of --
establishing a cyber command, operational capabilities vastly differ
across states. [Whereas some governments are increasingly allocating
**significant resources**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [conduct cyber
operations]{.underline} -- and are now starting to benefit from these
investments -- the majority of allies still run their cyber commands on
a budget of a few million a year --an amount that is insufficient for
effective operations in the cyber domain.

Secondly, [until a few years ago, NATO members' strategic visions were
largely aligned]{.underline}. [National cyber strategies shared a common
threat focus on operations that could potentially cause major societal
havoc, such as taking down the **power grid**]{.underline}. [Allies'
national strategies were also largely unified in]{.underline} [their
vision to address this threat, discussing the need for deterrence,
resilience, and norms]{.underline}. However, this changed **[with
the]{.underline}** publication of the **[US Department of Defense's
strategy]{.underline}** on Defend Forward and US Cyber Command's vision
on Persistent Engagement.\[8\] [The United States emphasizes the need to
cause friction "wherever the adversary maneuvers,"
operating]{.underline} "globally, continuously and seamlessly"
(potentially) [below the threshold of armed attack]{.underline}. "We
must...maneuver seamlessly across the interconnected battlespace,
globally, as close as possible to adversaries and their operations, and
continuously shape the battlespace to create operational advantage for
us while denying the same to our adversaries," in the words of NSA
director and Cyber Command head Gen. Paul Nakasone.\[9\] Whereas
deterrence is about changing your adversary's cost-benefit calculus,
Persistent Engagement is about taking the opportunity away from the
adversary to act.\[10\]

Third, [NATO member positions on how **international law
applies**]{.underline} -- particularly the obligations of states
vis-a-vis sovereignty -- are [now more divergent than a decade
ago]{.underline}. [Whereas countries like the Netherlands and France are
located on the side of the "sovereignty as a rule" camp, the United
Kingdom has taken the position that a remote cyber operation by one
state into another's cyber systems or network does not]{.underline}
violate the latter's sovereignty.

Where to go from here?

The **[[divergence in cyber policy across NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
member [states [is problematic]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Allies disagree on
both the **goals**]{.underline} [of cyber policy and the ways and means
to achieve them. [This can cause tension between allies]{.mark},
especially when it comes to the necessity and legitimacy of operating on
each other's national systems and networks]{.underline}.

Some may argue that these differences result from differences in
maturity. Some states simply have not caught up with the latest
developments, goes the argument. [This assumes a single path to cyber
maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the same
direction]{.underline}. It suggests that -- even without major policy
coordination -- allies' cyber policies will converge over time. But a
more persuasive understanding of the current trend is that [even though
states can learn from each other's institutional progress, differences
do not merely stem from states "lagging behind." These [states are on a
**different policy path.**]{.mark} This means [it requires **dedicated
and sustained policy attention to**]{.mark}]{.underline}, at a minimum,
**[[coordinating the different policies of states]{.underline}]{.mark}**
-- [and potentially **bring them closer together.**]{.underline}

[[What can be done to ensure that]{.mark} this [**divergence** in
cyber]{.mark} policy [does not cause **further friction**]{.mark}
**[between allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}?\[11\]

I have previously proposed **[[a NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** Memorandum
of Understanding (**[[MoU]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[to]{.underline}
**[reduce discord among the allies]{.underline}**;]{.mark} the goal
**[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** be to [[enhance **trust**]{.mark},
**[transparency]{.mark}**, [**and confidence** between
allies]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} to **[improve the]{.mark}
[effectiveness of disrupting and deterring adversaries' operations in
cyberspace]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[12\] [[The main purpose of the MoU
would be to **reach an agreement** on the equities involved in
permitting signatories]{.mark} [to conduct]{.mark} cyber effect
[operations in **each other's networks**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and the
relative weight of those equities.

#### Russia will [exploit]{.underline} divisions between NATO members to instigate [nuclear crises]{.underline}\-\--extinction. 

**Kulesa '18** \[Lukasz; February 2018; Research Director at the
European Leadership Network; European Leadership Network, "Envisioning a
Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**, the "**fog of war**"
and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would **inevitably**
set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of any]{.underline}
predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and inter-[conflict
management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} military [theorists]{.mark}]{.underline} and
practitioners seem to **[[assume]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [a
[conflict]{.mark} with NATO [can be]{.mark} **managed** and
**[controlled]{.mark}** in a way that would bring it to a **swift end**
consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an [**EMP effect**. A "**false
flag**"]{.mark} attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly [complicate]{.mark}** NATO's
[responses]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a [conflict]{.mark} with
Russia [would]{.mark}]{.underline} probably [[have to be limited]{.mark}
in order [to avoid]{.mark} a **massive [nuclear exchang]{.mark}e**. Such
limitations]{.underline} would also involve restrictions on striking
back against targets on Russian territory. But too narrow an approach
[could put **too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian
**regime's stability** may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be
threatened]{.underline} in order [to **force the leadership** into
**terminating** the conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. [Both sides]{.mark} are capable of
**[underestimat]{.mark}ing** the **[resolve]{.mark}** of the other side
to prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's
**willingness** to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and
[endure the costs, especially once both]{.underline} sides [start
committing]{.underline} their [political capital]{.underline} and
resources and the casualties accumulate.

#### The plan restores faith in NATO's credibility across domains\-\--that spurs allied challenges to Chinese aggression in cyberspace

[Looking to the future, **NATO's success in establishing** transatlantic
**mechanisms for cyber**]{.underline} and outer space
**[safeguards]{.underline}** and consultation [will be **crucial** to
**allow NATO a key role in taking on the China** challenge in ways that
help **restore faith in NATO's** **credibility** as a **provider of
collective defense in all domains**]{.underline}. [It will also assist
NATO in straddling the chasm between member states prioritizing threats
from either China, Russia, the Middle East, or North Africa, since cyber
and space threats potentially stem from all of them]{.underline}, and
the effectiveness of cyber and space defense mechanisms do not
necessarily depend on geographical origin.

[Cyber and space would allow NATO a **key role in the China** challenge
without prioritizing China]{.underline}

Improved communication between NATO and the EU will be essential for
NATO to successfully address the military aspects of cyber and space
threats. The framework for permanent EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was
concluded in March 2003. It allows for the exchange of classified
information, the EU's use of NATO assets and capabilities for EU-led
crisis management operations, and the establishment of consultation
arrangements.31 Due to disagreements over responsibilities and
jurisdiction, however, meaningful coordination did not take place until
July 2016. On this occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration
stating their intention to work together on security and defense
responses to unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East
of the Euro-Atlantic area.32 During Biden's visit to Brussels in June
2021, NATO promised to strengthen cooperation with the EU on promoting
peace and stability including protecting critical infrastructure,
strengthening resilience, maintaining a technological edge, and
addressing challenges to a rules-based order.33 The EU-US summit
statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support for robust
NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the partnership.34 At the
level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO and EU
officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies and
tactics for countering China challenges.35

The EU-US summit statement's negligible mention of cooperation with NATO
indicates that the ball is in NATO's court if strengthening NATO-EU
coordination is to take place. French and German concerns about
entrapment are a major barrier to meaningful NATO-EU cooperation. The
area of cyber and space security may allow NATO to work around this
roadblock. In line with the EU's practice of supporting the efforts of
groups of member states to take the lead on issues where EU institutions
cannot trump sovereignty, in the area of cybersecurity the EU has
decentralized implementation to work around national resistance. This
has allowed the EU to respond collectively and effectively to
cyberattacks in Europe, primarily through bolstering capacities and law
enforcement cooperation.36 However, the EU is not yet a globally
influential and effective cyber-power because differences among member
states over issues such as whether to prioritize tech sovereignty or
Europe's global tech competitiveness prevent the EU from acting in
unison on the global stage.

The first US-EU TTC meeting held in September 2021 was an important step
in strengthening the EU's global position in cooperation with the United
States, and hence called into question whether NATO has a role to play
in cyber security.37 The next couple of years will demonstrate whether
the EU and the US are able to focus on becoming mutually supportive
global cyber security guardians by cooperating on strengthening
investment screening, export controls, and rebalance global supply
chains in semiconductors. The successful implementation on both sides of
the Atlantic of the recommendations of the TTC working groups will
determine if transatlantic cooperation positions the US and the EU as
global partners in guarding cyber space. In part, this will depend on
the EU's ability to forge common positions that meet the US halfway on
issues such as tech sovereignty and data privacy, points of contention
through which transatlantic relations have been marred by conflict.

The potential [convergence of transatlantic views on cybersecurity
leaves room for **NATO**]{.underline} [to play a significant role
because the EU is a civilian and economic, rather than military, set of
institutions]{.underline}. The NATO summit in Brussels in 2018 carved
out a role for NATO which the EU cannot fulfill, allowing NATO members
to integrate their sovereign cyber capabilities into NATO operations and
missions.38 However, compared to the EU's major role in cyber, NATO's
role is negligible. As EU civil-military cooperation ramps up in
enhancing Europe's autonomous defense profile while allowing US
companies a role in this effort, the union looks set to become an even
more dominant actor in transatlantic cyber defense. [Because NATO is a
military organization, it has the procedures and instruments to
**position** itself in a **key** **role**]{.underline} [in coordinating
and implementing]{.underline} **[the military aspects of cyber defense
between the US and Europe]{.underline}**. The multinational
cybersecurity effort which is confronting the global threat posed by
Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks involves NATO, the EU, Australia,
New Zealand, and Japan, and sets NATO off to a good start in enhancing
its profile in countering Chinese challenges to transatlantic
cybersecurity.39 However, it remains to be seen if it manages to deliver
mechanisms that succeed in integrating allied responses in the military
sector in a way that complements US and EU cyber defense initiatives.

In outer space, the EU is also increasingly active, recognizing the need
to deepen investments in areas such as satellite navigation, earth
observation, space situational awareness, and secure communications,
which are all central to enhanced space security. The EU has established
the EU Agency for the Space Programme, which has oversight over
everything the EU does in orbit as a bloc. Moreover, the EU uses the
European Space Agency (ESA) as technical advisor and industrial
procurement agent. This setup allows the EU to become more agile,
dynamic, and innovative in space as rapid industrialization is taking
place with US entrepreneurs and well-funded Chinese space programs in
leading roles.40 In the pipeline are a next generation of Europe's
satellite-navigation system, Galileo, and an extension of the scope and
capabilities of its Copernicus-Sentinel spacecraft, which monitors the
state of the planet. The EU focuses on ensuring that Europe has
independent space capabilities, but it does not develop instruments such
as space weapons systems.41

In the outer space realm, NATO has tremendous potential for playing a
key role in developing instruments in the military sector that involve
European and US space capabilities. NATO's decision to declare outer
space an operational domain at the London summit in 2019 is a first step
in allowing NATO an active role in addressing growing anti-satellite
threats from China and Russia.42 With the US as the leading power in
outer space and with the EU developing its space platforms to enhance
situational awareness and security, NATO has the tools to work out a
common transatlantic definition of the anti-satellite challenges that
need to be addressed. The establishment of [mechanisms that ensure
coordination across **military NATO commands**]{.underline} [regarding
intelligence gathering]{.underline} and the interface between cyber and
space defense, as well as civilian and military occurrences and
initiatives, [would potentially strengthen the ability of allies to
**counter anti-satellite threats considerably**]{.underline}. As with
cyber, NATO must first integrate the space issue into all its
organizational and operational structures, and secondly, develop
mechanisms that focus on coordination between US and European capacities
on the basis of a common understanding of the challenges to be
addressed.

NATO has the tools to work out a common transatlantic definition of
anti-satellite challenges

NATO's Role in the Global Commons

NATO can only be as effective as its member states allow it to be. NATO
reflects the state of transatlantic relations: are US and European
security outlooks sufficiently compatible such that the alliance is able
to address threats from China collectively? This question is reflected
in how well they manage to define common challenges and establish
mechanisms that allow them to address these challenges together. NATO
was a natural center of security focus for Washington when Europe was
the main arena for US-Soviet deterrence. Today, the Indo-Pacific
competes for US attention and resources as competition with China has
moved to the center stage of US security and defense priorities.

The strategic shift in US priorities does not mean that Europe cannot
continue to remain a significant influence on global security dynamics.
The EU has demonstrated its continued relevance in the security realm,
not merely by relying on its role as a major trade bloc, but also by
reforming the interplay between member states and EU institutions to
avoid being paralyzed by consensus requirements, which apply in most
areas outside the trade sector. This is done by providing platforms for
member states to start initiatives. If successful in attracting support
within the union, the initiatives are consolidated by supportive
mechanisms and programs.43

NATO is not the EU and hence should not duplicate its methods. The EU is
driven by the urge to secure the continued influence of its member
states on major global issues. NATO's raison d'être is to facilitate
transatlantic cooperation in the military sector to counter common
threats and challenges. Coordination is complex at a time when US and
European security outlooks are drifting apart in terms of threat
perceptions and priorities. At the same time, fears of entrapment stifle
NATO's efforts to update its relevance, principally because key members
such as France and Germany are not interested in NATO taking on China as
a threat.

Nevertheless, [NATO's agreement to define China as a challenge promises
opportunities for positioning the alliance in a key role in
transatlantic relations. Because cyber and space encompass threats from
other adversaries such as Russia and Iran, these domains
are]{.underline} a [good place to start taking on China as they do not
require that China be singled out as a threat. By taking on the
responsibility for]{.underline} **[coordinating US and European
definitions of cyber]{.underline}** and outer space **[threats in the
military sector]{.underline}**, **[integrating these
domains]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} all organizational and
operational **[NATO structures]{.underline}**, devising mechanisms for
the member states to address cyber and outer space threats,
[and]{.underline} by **[facilitating intelligence exchange and
management]{.underline}** of the vulnerabilities produced by
civil-military interaction and overlapping interfaces between the cyber
and space sectors, **[NATO can demonstrate its continued relevance for
transatlantic security in an era where threats are increasingly global
and transcend geographical boundaries]{.underline}**. There's no time
like the present.

silent on China]{.underline}. **[Now]{.underline}**, [that is
changing]{.underline}. [NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power]{.underline}. **[It's apparent]{.underline}** that
[[NATO can **no longer ignore the threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If the
alliance hopes [to **remain competitive**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [it
will need]{.underline}]{.mark} to develop [a **new strategy** for
dealing with Beijing]{.underline}.

First, [NATO needs [a **common assessment of China's hybrid
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[a mix of diplomatic, economic,
security, information, and technological actions [designed to]{.mark}
quietly **[undermine democratic]{.mark} states and
[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to Beijing's benefit while
avoiding a traditional conflict]{.underline}. While
[China's]{.underline} conventional military threat in the Indo-Pacific
is far from NATO's borders, its [hybrid activities are happening in the
alliance's own backyard]{.underline}.

**[[Cyber-espionage]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntellectual
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**roperty [**[theft]{.underline}**,
**[infiltration of critical infrastructure]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[debt manipulation]{.underline}**, [[and
**disinfor**]{.mark}**mation**]{.underline} [are prime
examples]{.underline}. [While these threats may **seem** to fall outside
of NATO's purview]{.underline}, [they pose serious security risks for
the alliance]{.underline}. For instance, [China's]{.underline} desire to
invest in Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may not look like a problem for NATO
on its surface. But its investments have worrying strings attached that
give China [operating control over]{.underline} the
[infrastructure]{.underline}. That control [could decrease **allies'
willingness to move military forces**]{.underline}---**[including
sensitive technologies]{.underline}**---through the port and its
surrounding networks. [This could]{.underline} lead to
[disrupt]{.underline}ed [planning and]{.underline} fewer [military
exercises]{.underline}, [decreasing NATO's ability to defend the Baltic
States during a crisis with Russia]{.underline}. [This could also open
the door for **pragmatic collaboration between China and Russia** to
undermine trans-Atlantic security.]{.underline}

[[Allies need]{.mark} to forge [a **shared understanding** of]{.mark}
these [risks through **info**]{.mark}**rmation-[sharing and
dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[no small feat for countries that do
not see eye to eye on China. Some are even willing to ignore such
vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or disenchantment with
trans-Atlantic institutions]{.underline}. [[The
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has
a **critical role**]{.mark} to play [in getting allies **on the same
page** and **setting common goals** for countering China]{.mark}'s
hybrid activities]{.underline}.

Second, NATO needs to focus on public diplomacy.
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[has]{.mark} an important role
[to]{.mark} play in the [battle against]{.mark} the CCP's global
[narratives]{.mark}, which [Beijing promulgates through]{.mark}
**[hybrid activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [To
defend]{.underline}]{.mark} the trans-Atlantic values on which the
alliance is built---freedom, **[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[rule of law]{.underline}**, [[and **human
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[NATO should clearly communicate China's
violations]{.underline} of these principles and its propaganda efforts
to cover them up. (These include, among others, human rights abuses
against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang and violations of the U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea in the South China Sea.) NATO should also enhance
its outreach to key partners in the Indo-Pacific, such as Australia,
Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, which can serve as important
counterweights to Chinese influence in the region. Effective public
messaging also means getting serious about attributing the blame for
attacks, as the European Commission recently did over Chinese
disinformation around COVID-19, to raise the pressure on Chinese
officials. [Trans-Atlantic countries have **struggled to shape China's
behavior** because they cannot prove malign intent or agree to call out
Beijing for its subversive efforts. [Allies should develop **clearer
guidelines**]{.mark}---**[what needs to be proved]{.mark}**, **by
whom**, **and to what degree**---[to enable **collective
attribution**]{.mark}. NATO is strongest when it speaks with one voice.
It should use that voice to demand transparency and change from
China.]{.underline}

Third, the alliance should step up its counteroffensive. [China's hybrid
actions intentionally **blur the lines** between what is **legally
permissible**]{.underline}, **[politically inappropriate]{.underline}**,
[and **downright escalatory**]{.underline}.

[This makes it difficult for leaders to determine **appropriate
responses**]{.underline}, [producing a reactionary approach]{.underline}
**[thus far]{.underline}**. [But an intensifying geostrategic
competition has already begun. To compete in this environment, the
trans-Atlantic community needs [a **more proactive
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than waiting for China to invest
in the next major European port, allies should coordinate legislation to
prevent the riskiest Chinese acquisitions. And rather than waiting for
more Chinese cyberintrusions, allies should collaborate on responsible,
targeted offensive cyberactions. Over time, this
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} help [**[dissuade China]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline}]{.mark} [manipulating investments in critical
infrastructure, [conducting]{.mark} cyber-espionage, and other [hybrid
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}. While adopting [a more offensive
posture]{.underline} remains controversial among certain allies, it [is
**gaining traction across Europe**]{.underline} and is **[strongly
supported in Washington]{.underline}**. [Although NATO]{.underline},
**[as a defensive alliance]{.underline}**, [should not
implement]{.underline} such [a counteroffensive]{.underline},
[policymakers should **leverage it** as the **primary forum** to
**coordinate actions among willing nations**]{.underline}.

Fourth, NATO needs to deepen its cooperation with other key players,
such as the European Union and the private sector. Where NATO lacks the
mandate and means, the EU and multinational businesses play critical
roles in developing, implementing, and enforcing the legislation and
financial incentives necessary to counter Chinese hybrid threats.
Complementary to that, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies [[can
focus on]{.mark} providing intelligence, [defending cyberspace]{.mark},
developing capability targets for new technologies, conducting exercises
and **[contingency planning]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [informing
resilience requirements for secure infrastructure, [and **bolstering
deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite the political obstacles that
impede more formal NATO-EU cooperation, allies should look to the
European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki
to bring together NATO and EU staff, national officials, and industry
voices in one place to align their counter-hybrid policies for China.

[The Chinese government's manipulative efforts around the coronavirus
have thrust China's hybrid activities to the center of trans-Atlantic
debates. Policymakers need to **seize the moment** and respond by
**"using NATO more politically,"**]{.underline} in Stoltenberg's words.
NATO is first and foremost about its nations. [In the fight against
China's hybrid threats, these nations bring much more to the table than
military power alone. They have access to a broad range of
tools---military, political, economic, technological, and
information---which the alliance can use to its collective geopolitical
advantage in the competition with China. What NATO needs now is [a
strategy to leverage]{.mark} those [tools in a coordinated
manner]{.mark}. That [will]{.mark} go a long way in [solv]{.mark}ing
[NATO's China problem]{.mark}.]{.underline}

https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/new-global-competitive-model-based-cyber-and-asymmetrical-hybrid-warfare\]

Over the past three decades, as the US military trained in conventional,
nuclear, and counterinsurgency warfare, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Chinese Communist Party (**[[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) engaged and
[[perfected]{.mark} over]{.underline} [forty methods of
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} intended [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
permanently [[destabilize]{.underline}]{.mark} and weaken [[the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[**economically** and
**militarily**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time, [China rapidly
grew its]{.underline} economy and [military without]{.underline} the
[required **time** or **investment** in innovation]{.underline}. The
result is that [[the US is hemorrhaging]{.underline}]{.mark} its
**[[economic strength]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and relevance at the rate
of \$5 trillion in lost total value each year, or one-third of the U.S.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP).]{.underline}

General (Ret.) Keith Alexander, former Director of the National Security
Agency (NSA) and Commander of US Cyber Command, referred to China's
theft of American innovation and intellectual property as "the greatest
transfer of wealth in history."

Over time, [[a weakened]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[economy **directly
reduces**]{.underline} [the strength and effectiveness of
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [US [military]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further,
when a country is manipulated by an adversary to lose one-third of the
value of its economy each year, it is at war. What does this mean for US
citizens? A cumulative and shocking permanent reduction in quality of
life to those organizations that \"don\'t know what they don\'t know.\"

Asymmetrical **[[Hybrid War]{.underline}]{.mark}**fare

**[[Clear and Present Existential Threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Over the past thirty years, the US government and private sector have
advanced their policy of full-cooperation, including substantial
financial and technological investment in China, under the belief that
they were moving towards a more democratic, free-market society while
China played intentional misdirection and deception. In 1986, month
number three, the Communist Party of China ([[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark})
officially declared Asymmetrical [[Hybrid War]{.mark}fare]{.underline}
(AHW) [[against the US]{.mark} [and its **western
allies**]{.mark}]{.underline} in its nation-state Program 863. This
strategy commits all of China with its strict Communist military rule to
engage in any and all methods to become on par with, surpass, and
dominate the West at any and all cost. China's ultimate objective is to
harvest and perpetuate the Chinese Dream through the extraction and
[[extinguish]{.underline}]{.mark}ing of the American Dream, the American
way of life and ending **[[Western dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
Chinese strategy is that a er 200 years of Western global dominance, it
is their destiny to reverse roles with the US and to relegate it to a
forced supplier with a much lower quality of life. To underscore this
strategy, China refers to the last century as "the century of great
humiliation." It must also be emphasized that AHW strategy is rooted in
Unrestricted Warfare or "war without rules."

Death by a Thousand Cuts

The Modern Battlefield is Everywhere

**[AHW]{.underline}** [has]{.underline} been established as the future
of modern warfare and business strategy across the globe. It is ultimate
warfare that has [many forms]{.underline}: **[economic
warfare]{.underline}**, **[transaction warfare]{.underline}**,
**[industrial warfare]{.underline}**, drug warfare, [and **propaganda
warfare**]{.underline}, [to name only a few]{.underline}. Each method is
characterized by the non-utilization of military or conventional warfare
that is typical of aircraft, ships, troops, and weapons. While China
continues to aggressively develop and expand its military, it does so
with the belief that if it must resort to the use of conventional or
nuclear warfare, it has ultimately failed at achieving the enemy's
capitulation through the combined methods of AHW. In the business
sector, AHW has become the "New Global Competitive Model" where the
"winner takes all." Soon, China will dictate transactions and pricing
based on its market dominance. As businesses rush to move to "digital
transformation" and "Big Data," each must perform a 180° cybersecurity
transformation based on sensitive data protection and adversarial
motives as a means to survive. Currently, [AHW is the **primary focus**
of our adversaries]{.underline}: [[China is]{.underline}]{.mark}, by
far, [**[the most successful]{.underline}** [at]{.underline}]{.mark}
methodically [[executing]{.mark} all [AHW]{.mark} methods]{.underline},
while Russia, North Korea, Iran, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} India engage
in relatively few methods at present. The strategy is to continuously
inflict damage or cuts to every facet of American society just below the
pain threshold where we choose not to act. We believe that [China [has
achieved]{.mark}]{.underline} an estimated **[[750 cuts towards "death
by a thousand cuts."]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Sun Tzu)

Definition

AHW is characterized as unconventional, non-military, multi-method
strategic warfare based on deception and void of any rules between
countries where economic and military power, strategy and tactics differ
significantly. The attacking country exploits inherent weaknesses
through numerous uneven and seemingly unrelated [AHW]{.underline}
methods that are designed to [destabilize]{.underline} the unwitting
target country [for]{.underline} ultimate and [complete economic and
military submission]{.underline}. Extensive use of misinformation and
plausible deniability are used to deceive and deflect suspicion of the
strategy or its methodical advancement. Hybrid warfare is a military
strategy that blends conventional warfare, asymmetric warfare, irregular
warfare, offset warfare, non-linear warfare, and cyber warfare. AHW is
rooted in unrestricted warfare (war without rules where "everything is
fair play") which is also described as "anything warfare." Source:

Culture Disparity as a Strategic Weapon

It is important to note the striking contrast between the two cultures
of the US and Communist China. It is this great divide that has
contributed to China's manipulation and acceleration of AHW against the
US. The CCP believes its "legalism" philosophy of supreme law and people
are superior to America's constitutional democracy underpinned by
justice, religion, a Creator, and "all men are created equal." Since
1949, the CCP have controlled all aspects of China's commerce, military,
and daily life where intellectual property is state-owned, all data is
controlled, and it is the national duty of all citizens to support the
regime, including all aspects of espionage. The Communist culture is
further defined not by "winning vs. losing"; rather, "living vs. dying."
It is this extreme belief that underscores China's support for AHW in
its conflict with the US. Another distinction is that the CCP controls
every business transaction with US companies. In many cases, the CCP
resembles a powerful organized crime faction, through its shell business
partnerships and facades. There is no distinction between China's
organized crime, military, or government. This places every US business
partnership or transaction with China at extreme risk.

Critical Role of Intelligence

[[China's]{.mark} uncompromising [commitment to AHW demonstrates a
**national objective** to destroy the **US and its**]{.mark} **Western
[allies]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[The **critical nucleus** that drives
the]{.mark} AHW [strat]{.mark}egy [is]{.mark} the]{.underline} [complete
dependence on **[stolen]{.mark} innovation**]{.underline}, intellectual
property (**[[IP]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [sensitive
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and military]{.mark}
secrets]{.underline} - **[namely [intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[For over thirty years]{.underline}, [[China]{.mark} has
[orchestrated]{.mark} the most impressive and sophisticated strategy
with [an **intricate global network of espionage and industrial
theft**]{.mark} to fuel AHW]{.underline}. In recent years, an emboldened
China has demanded the complete surrender of all intellectual property
during the process of contracting current international business
transactions. Conversely, intelligence plays a critical role for the US
to gauge the executional success of AHW, changes in strategy, and
individual and cumulative damages.

**[Cyber Warfare as the Key Accelerator]{.underline}**

[China]{.underline} has [successfully intertwined Cyber warfare as the
**key AHW accelerator**]{.underline} [due to its relatively minimal
investment and the **difficulty of attributing actions to a specific
actor**]{.underline}. [At the same time]{.underline}, [[cybersecurity
remains]{.underline}]{.mark} **[fundamentally
[broken]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in the]{.mark} US and the [West due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} failed cyber strategies, **[[lack of awareness
of AHW]{.underline}]{.mark}**, lack of accountability, overconfidence,
and over-dependence on inherently fallible cybersecurity products. This
is made clear by the "new normal" of the increased trend in number,
frequency, and resulting total damages from cyberattacks.

[Current estimates place global cyber losses at \$6 trillion by
2021]{.underline}, [with expectations that this will increase further in
the future]{.underline}, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. Cyber
warfare and cybersecurity have become a "whole of society" challenge
that requires a unified, elevated strategy and 180° approach to combat
the morphing threat. As we examine today's cybersecurity environment, we
are looking through the wrong end of the telescope. It is only in the
context of AHW that we can begin to fully understand cybersecurity's
critical role for successful defense, protection, and resolution. We
have learned to treat cybersecurity first and foremost as a human
problem and a senior leadership challenge, not solely an IT issue.

It is no longer hard to see that [the **rising power**]{.underline} and
the mounting pugnaciousness [of [the **P**]{.mark}]{.underline}eople's
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**epublic of **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
(PRC) [have become a]{.underline} comprehensive [**[challenge]{.mark}**
for the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. [China's **Machiavellian
policies**]{.underline} and actions [at home and abroad have turned
a]{.underline}n otherwise naturally complementary
[Sino-American]{.underline} economic [relationship into a]{.underline}
near **[zero-sum]{.underline}**, if not already a zero-sum, [competition
for]{.underline} market, jobs, technology, and financial
[**[primacy]{.mark}**. Beijing]{.underline} now [openly **flexes
its**]{.underline} new [**muscles** in its neighborhood]{.underline} and
beyond [[to]{.mark} resist]{.underline}, reduce[, and
**[replace]{.mark}** American **leadership**]{.underline} and presence
[everywhere possible, seeking to **undermine** [the]{.mark} U.S.-led
**[international]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic [[**order** and]{.mark}
American-anchored **collective [security]{.mark}**
arrangements]{.underline}. The PRC has been burning billions, for
example, hoping to replace the U.S. dollar with the over-printed Chinese
Renminbi (RMB). Extraordinarily heavy extraction of its own economy, the
world's second largest, and its enormous foreign currency reserve
resulting from the gross imbalance in U.S.-China trade have enabled the
PRC to massively expand its military. That military is already the
world's second largest; its navy, for example, is projected to soon
surpass the U.S. Navy in fleet tonnage. At the same time, massive but
opaque spending sprees has allowed the PRC to actively procure power and
proxies even inside the United States, positioning Beijing to reshape
international opinions and norms more easily than ever.

What is less known, perhaps, is that [the **rising
[PRC]{.mark}**]{.underline} state also [[seeks an **overhaul**
of]{.mark} the **very world order** that]{.underline} has [enabled the
**greatest advances** of human civilization]{.underline} over the past
few centuries -- [the Westphalian system of
**[nation-states]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This world order was codified
in the 17th century, expanded to a global scale in the 20th century, and
now is in its post-World War II and post-Cold War iteration --- [the
so-called **America-led L**]{.underline}iberal
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[O]{.underline}**rder (LIO). [The rise
of Chinese power, under the **autocracy** of the
**C**]{.underline}hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty (CCP), [is not just contesting]{.underline} U.S.
national security and [American global leadership but]{.underline} also
[the **existing world order**. Never since the heyday of the Cold War
has the world seen such a **full challenge** to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} to
[the Westphalian system]{.underline}.

[The CCP is leading]{.underline} the PRC [toward]{.underline} a Chinese
Dream of a world order in its own image, which I call [the **China
Order**]{.underline}. The China Order is a millennia-old political
tradition and ideology that mandates [a unitary,
authoritarian]{.underline} (often totalitarian), [omnipotent and
omnipresent government for the **whole**]{.underline} known
**[world]{.underline}**. This alternative world order has had a variety
of euphemisms in the long history of China: from tinaxia yitong
(unification of all under heaven) and shijie datong (world's grand
harmony) in the imperial past, to Mao Zedong's world solidarity for
Communist revolution only forty years ago, to now Xi Jinping's community
of common human destiny. The China Order has powerfully revived to guide
rising PRC power, under the banner of a Chinese version of
globalization, ingeniously taking advantage of the various calls in our
time for [global [governance]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[address]{.mark}
**transnational [issues]{.mark}** [such as **climate**]{.mark}
**change**, [**inequality**, **epidemics**, and
**terrorism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This [China]{.mark} Order [is]{.mark}]{.underline} normatively and
practically [[at]{.mark} **fundamental [odds]{.mark}** [with the
**LIO**]{.mark}]{.underline} version of the Westphalia system [that
enshrines]{.underline} comparison and competition among [nations
**coexisting** with equal sovereignty]{.underline}. The China Order has
been widely addictive to the powerful and ambitious in history, whether
they have been ethnically Han or not. It has been highly effective in
practice, in great part because it became deeply legitimized and
internalized in elite Chinese culture over many centuries. The China
Order is now the sole acceptable model of the world under the
authoritarianism known as the Qin-Han polity that the PRC now practices.
But under this world order, as documented by [[The China
Order]{.underline}]{.mark} (#ad), human civilization [[is]{.mark}
socio-economically very [**suboptimal** and]{.mark} **hopelessly
[stagnant]{.mark}**]{.underline}, inevitably shortchanging the lives of
just about everyone, especially nonelites, as the tragic and often
catastrophic history of Eastern Eurasia under the China Order before the
nineteenth century amply demonstrates.

Since 1949, when the PRC restored traditional Chinese autocracy under
the guise of imported Marxism-Leninism, [the CCP has been
**ceaselessly**]{.underline} and callously [fighting its **own people**
internally and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**American allies**]{.underline} externally [to preserve its monopoly
**over power**. Only **sheer exhaustion**]{.underline} and near collapse
[could force the CCP to **slow down** and **retreat**]{.underline}, at
home and abroad. External powers have influenced and facilitated the
rise of PRC power, but have so far failed to transform the Qin-Han
autocracy and its China Order ideal, thus remaining unable to change
Beijing's world views and global pursuits. Various, often false,
[rationalizations have justified]{.underline} the continuation of
[American]{.underline}/Western [engagement with the PRC,
which]{.underline} has greatly enriched and [**enabled** the CCP to
persist in its **[consolidation]{.mark} of power**. Beijing's push for
power [is]{.mark}]{.underline} nothing personal; it is [a brand of
authoritarianism]{.underline} just happens to be [[**anchored**
in]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkably persistent [[belief that
**failing**]{.mark} **to achieve control** over the whole]{.underline}
known [world [would spell]{.mark} the loss of the "mandate of heaven"
and **[political extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the CCP is
driven (or doomed) to methodically and opportunistically seek ever
greater influence.

[[The **rise of China**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or more precisely the
ever-greater power of the PRC state, [[represents a shift of]{.mark} the
distribution]{.underline} and concentration [of [power in the]{.mark}
international [system]{.mark}]{.underline} (conceptually known as power
transition) [and an effort to **reorder the units**]{.underline} in the
system [and change the system's **governing norms**. Chinese
leaders]{.underline} have already **[openly claimed]{.underline}** that
[they are]{.underline} now moving to [the center of the world stage,
leading a revolutionary change in]{.underline} the [world order,
[**upending** the **Peace of Westphalia**]{.mark}]{.underline}
established "four hundred years ago," in the words of PRC leaders [This
points to a systemic change of world politics]{.underline} and a choice
for all of us at the grandest possible scale: a scale [that could
reshape nations [and **redirect**]{.mark} **the path** of **human
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The PRC's challenge is therefore
greater than the struggle between the two European ideologies of
Capitalism and Communism. [The confrontation between the **U.S.-led
LIO** and the PRC-dreamed **China Order** transcends]{.underline} these
often vaguely defined [civilizational clashes]{.underline}.

If the PRC challenge, the rise of an unscrupulous, ever more resourceful
and determined PRC state, is not managed well and promptly, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[will]{.mark} have to [face]{.mark}]{.underline} a much worse choice in
the not too distant future between tragic capitulation and a
[**desperate [war]{.mark}** for its national security [and]{.mark}
**world leadership**]{.underline} and for the way in which humankind is
organized worldwide. [In the age of]{.underline} many kinds of
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction, this will be a harrowing
decision.

Of course, one may argue that the grandiose China Dream of a China Order
may be just another pretentious way for the CCP to invoke traditional,
nationalist, and populist ideals to justify its autocratic governance of
the Chinese people forever, similar to the splendid slogans and missions
fabricated by many other dictators. Perhaps the highly insecure CCP
leadership is fighting for its survival, not world domination. However,
words have consequences. Propaganda and dilution often greatly mesmerize
and mislead the pretenders themselves. More importantly, [the CCP has
been **steadily following**]{.underline} up [its words with
action]{.underline} and money for years (basically nonstop since 1949);
it has just pledged over 10 times the total sum of the Marshall Plan (in
today's dollars) for its Belt and Road Initiative alone, for instance.

As the logic of the China Order dictates, [[the]{.mark} rising Chinese
[power will **not stop**]{.mark} **short** [of **unseating** the]{.mark}
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and **reordering the
[world]{.mark}**[, unless]{.mark}]{.underline} Beijing's Qin-Han polity
is transformed and/or [the]{.underline} ever richer and more [powerful
PRC is [checked]{.mark}]{.underline}. The alternatives, [American
**capitulation** or **world war**, are]{.underline} horrific to
contemplate, but [not]{.underline} necessarily [impossible]{.underline}.
Unlike in Hollywood, the "good" guys do not always win necessarily in
the real world. A mighty autocracy that tightly controls one-fifth of
humankind, willfully spends a disproportionately larger portion of the
fruits of the world's second largest economy, and vows (even if only
hypocritically) to reform and reorder the world under its leadership, is
and will always be a mortal challenge to the national security of the
United States. [[America's **global position** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
way of life, **[[world peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the overall
world order [all [rest on]{.mark} how [the **PRC challenge**]{.mark} is
managed]{.underline}---soon.

[If the **liberal order is collapsing**, what new kind of global order

nationalism can be a reasonable guide for running the affairs of Russia,
but Russian nationalism has no plan for the rest of humanity. Unless, of
course, nationalism morphs into imperialism, and calls for one nation to
conquer and rule the entire world. A century ago, several nationalist
movements indeed harboured such imperialist fantasies. Today's
nationalists, whether in Russia, Turkey, Italy or China, so far refrain
from advocating global conquest.

In place of violently establishing a global empire, [some
nationalists]{.underline} such as Steve Bannon, Viktor Orban, the
Northern League in Italy and the British Brexiteers dream about a
peaceful "Nationalist International". They [argue]{.underline} that all
nations today face the same enemies. The bogeymen of globalism,
multiculturalism and immigration are threatening to destroy the
traditions and identities of all nations. Therefore nationalists across
the world should make common cause in opposing these global forces.
Hungarians, Italians, Turks and Israelis should build walls, erect
fences and slow down the movement of people, goods, money and ideas.

[The world will]{.underline} then [be divided into distinct
nation-states]{.underline}, each with its own sacred identity and
traditions. Based on mutual respect for these differing identities, all
nation-states could cooperate and trade peacefully with one another.
Hungary will be Hungarian, Turkey will be Turkish, Israel will be
Israeli, and everyone will know who they are and what is their proper
place in the world. It will be a world without immigration, without
universal values, without multiculturalism, and without a global
elite---but with peaceful international relations and some trade. In a
word, [the "Nationalist International" envisions the world as a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses]{.underline}.

Many people would think this is quite a reasonable vision. Why isn't it
a viable alternative to the liberal order? Two things should be noted
about it. First, it is still a comparatively liberal vision. It assumes
that no human group is superior to all others, that no nation should
dominate its peers, and that international cooperation is better than
conflict. In fact, liberalism and nationalism were originally closely
aligned with one another. The 19th century liberal nationalists, such as
Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini in Italy, and Adam Mickiewicz in
Poland, dreamt about precisely such an international liberal order of
peacefully-coexisting nations.

The second thing to note about [this vision of friendly
fortresses]{.underline} is that it **[has been
tried]{.underline}**---[and it **failed spectacularly**. **All
attempts** to divide the world into clear-cut nations have]{.underline}
so far **[[resulted in war]{.mark} and genocide]{.underline}**. When the
heirs of Garibaldi, Mazzini and Mickiewicz managed to overthrow the
multi-ethnic Habsburg Empire, it proved impossible to find a clear line
dividing Italians from Slovenes or Poles from Ukrainians.

This had set the stage for the second world war. The key problem with
the network of fortresses is that each national fortress wants a bit
more land, security and prosperity for itself at the expense of the
neighbors, and without the help of universal values and global
organisations, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules. Walled
fortresses are seldom friendly.

But if you happen to live inside a particularly strong fortress, such as
America or Russia, why should you care? Some nationalists indeed adopt a
more extreme isolationist position. They don't believe in either a
global empire or in a global network of fortresses. Instead, [they deny
the necessity of any global order whatsoever]{.underline}. "Our fortress
should just raise the drawbridges," they say, "and the rest of the world
can go to hell. We should refuse entry to foreign people, foreign ideas
and foreign goods, and as long as our walls are stout and the guards are
loyal, who cares what happens to the foreigners?"

Such extreme isolationism, however, is completely divorced from economic
realities. Without a global trade network, all existing national
economies will collapse---including that of North Korea. Many countries
will not be able even to feed themselves without imports, and prices of
almost all products will skyrocket. The made-in-China shirt I am wearing
cost me about \$5. If it had been produced by Israeli workers from
Israeli-grown cotton using Israeli-made machines powered by non-existing
Israeli oil, it may well have cost ten times as much. Nationalist
leaders from Donald Trump to Vladimir Putin may therefore heap abuse on
the global trade network, but none thinks seriously of taking their
country completely out of that network. And we cannot have a global
trade network without some global order that sets the rules of the game.

Even more importantly, whether people like it or not,
[[humankind]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[faces]{.underline}]{.mark}
three [common [problems]{.mark} that make a mockery of all national
borders]{.underline}, and [that can **[only]{.mark} be [solved
through]{.mark} global [cooperation]{.mark}**. These are **[nuclear war,
climate change and tech]{.mark}nological disruption**. You cannot build
a wall against nuclear winter or against global warming, and no nation
can regulate]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI) or
bioengineering single-handedly]{.underline}. It won't be enough if only
the European Union forbids producing killer robots or only America bans
genetically-engineering human babies. Due to the immense potential of
such disruptive technologies, if even one country decides to pursue
these high-risk high-gain paths, other countries will be forced to
follow its dangerous lead for fear of being left behind.

[[An **AI**]{.mark} **arms race** [or]{.mark} a
**[biotech]{.mark}nological [arms race]{.mark}**]{.underline} almost
[**[guarantees]{.mark} the worst outcome**. Whoever wins]{.underline}
the arms race, **[the loser will likely be [humanity]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. For in an arms race, [all regulations [will
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider, for example, conducting
genetic-engineering experiments on human babies. Every country will say:
"We don't want to conduct such experiments---we are the good guys. But
how do we know our rivals are not doing it? We cannot afford to remain
behind. So we must do it before them."

Similarly, [consider developing autonomous-weapon systems]{.underline},
that can decide for themselves whether to shoot and kill people. Again,
[every country will say: "This]{.underline} is a very dangerous
technology, and it [should be regulated]{.underline} carefully. [But we
don't trust our rivals to regulate it, so we must develop it
first]{.underline}".

[The **only thing** that can prevent]{.underline} such [destructive arms
races is **[greater trust]{.mark} between countries**. This [is
**not**]{.mark} **an [impossible]{.mark} mission**]{.underline}. If
today the Germans promise the French: "Trust us, we aren't developing
killer robots in a secret laboratory under the Bavarian Alps," the
French are likely to believe the Germans, despite the terrible history
of these two countries. [We need to build such trust
globally]{.underline}. We need to reach a point when Americans and
Chinese can trust one another like the French and Germans.

Similarly, we need to create a global safety-net to protect humans
against the economic shocks that AI is likely to cause. Automation will
create immense new wealth in high-tech hubs such as Silicon Valley,
while the worst effects will be felt in developing countries whose
economies depend on cheap manual labor. There will be more jobs to
software engineers in California, but fewer jobs to Mexican factory
workers and truck drivers. We now have a global economy, but politics is
still very national. [Unless we find solutions on a global level to the
disruptions caused by AI, entire countries might collapse, and the
resulting chaos]{.underline}, violence and waves of immigration [will
**destabilise the entire world**]{.underline}.

This is the proper perspective to look at recent developments such as
Brexit. In itself, Brexit isn't necessarily a bad idea. But is this what
Britain and the EU should be dealing with right now? How does Brexit
help prevent nuclear war? How does Brexit help prevent climate change?
How does Brexit help regulate artificial intelligence and
bioengineering? Instead of helping, Brexit makes it harder to solve all
of these problems. Every minute that Britain and the EU spend on Brexit
is one less minute they spend on preventing climate change and on
regulating AI.

In order **[[to survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and flourish [in the 21st
century, [humankind needs]{.mark} **effective global
[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and so far [[the **only**]{.mark}
**viable [blueprint]{.mark}** for such cooperation [is]{.mark} offered
by **[liberalism]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, governments all over the world
are undermining the foundations of the liberal order]{.underline}, and
the world is turning into a network of fortresses. [The first to feel
the impact are the weakest members of humanity]{.underline}, who find
themselves without any fortress willing to protect them: refugees,
illegal migrants, persecuted minorities. [But if the walls keep
rising]{.underline}, eventually [the **whole of humankind** will **feel
the squeeze**]{.underline}.

1\. Introduction

[Space is a **vital part**]{.underline} [of national and international
infrastructures. Since the launch of the first artificial
satellite]{.underline}, Sputnik 1, in 1957, humanity has used space for
the purposes of communication, monitoring the environment, collecting
intelligence, conducting vital scientific experiments, and providing
data for global positioning, navigation and time keeping. Countries are
increasingly dependent on global satellite capabilities for national and
international infrastructures, which include systems governing the
navigation of aircraft and ships, military manoeuvres, financial
transactions, the internet and telecommunications.

Strategic space capabilities are generally composed of three elements: a
space segment, a ground segment, and a user segment - also known as an
uplink, a downlink and a crosslink - that transmit telemetry data.
[Military commanders, staff and senior decision-making
cadres]{.underline} [within NATO receive mission-significant data
through products]{.underline} - e.g. space imagery and weather maps -
and services - e.g. satellite communications and position, navigation
and timing (PNT) data - [provided by member states with space
capabilities. Although emerging]{.underline} [technologies such
as]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline}) [and
the]{.underline} Internet of Things (IoT) could be force multipliers for
space capabilities, increased prevalence of cyber means may also
challenge the integrity of data carried through these technologies.

[Most countries either own satellites or have a stake in space-based
assets for meteorological purposes and communications. [The functioning
of **all satellites** is dependent on]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[cyber
tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nology, including software, hardware and
other digital components. Any threats that could impact a satellite\'s
controls, reliability, or bandwidth availability would pose a direct
challenge to national critical assets. If cyberthreats are not
effectively addressed, vulnerabilities in the strategic infrastructure
could result in severe consequences for international security. Cyber
vulnerabilities strike at the heart of the key technologies in strategic
doctrines and military planning. In the event of crisis escalation, such
as in Ukraine, the Middle East or in South Asia, the assumption is that
weapons systems will perform as planned. But this should not be taken
for granted. [It [is **mission-critical** for NATO to manage]{.mark},
preserve [and protect space capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, inter
alia, [by means of agreements and policies. Understanding space
vulnerabilities and ensuring that mitigation measures and redundancies
are in place]{.underline}, will help to protect [NATO\'s space
capabilities.]{.underline}

NATO\'s missions and operations are conducted in four areas: air, land,
cyber and sea. Space-based architecture is fundamental to the provision
of data and services to all domains. Therefore, any vulnerability in
space infrastructure will likely spread to other domains. The critical
interdependency between space and other domains increases the threat of
cyber risks, which disproportionately affect mission assurance.
Investing in mitigation measures and in the resilience of space systems
are key priorities in protecting all domains.

Since NATO relies on the space-based assets of its member states and
allies, any consideration of mitigation measures - such as systems
redundancy and increased technical resilience - would require the
consent and involvement of all parties.

There is an urgent need to study and address cyber-related challenges to
strategic assets within NATO and its key member countries, particularly
the cyberthreat to space-based command and control systems. It is
difficult to define what constitutes a country\'s strategic military
assets. Depending on where they are deployed, even short- to
medium-range ballistic missiles or tactical nuclear weapons may be
viewed as strategic assets.

There is an urgent need to study and address cyber-related challenges to
strategic

assets within NATO and its key member countries.

Strategic military systems depend heavily on space-based assets for
navigation and targeting, timing, positioning, command and control,
operational monitoring, intelligence gathering and reconnaissance, among
other functions. However, the increasing vulnerability of space-based
assets, ground stations, associated command and control systems, and the
personnel who manage the systems, has not yet received the attention it
deserves. This is particularly true in regard to the so-called \'New
Space\' revolution: the growing role of the private sector in space. For
example, during the Iraq war of 2003-11, there was a 560 per cent
increase in the US reliance on commercial satellites for military
purposes.

Policy influencers and policymakers are struggling to grasp the full
impact of cyber vulnerabilities in the context of both space-based
assets and strategic systems. Just as with physical attacks on
space-based assets - such as anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) strikes -
cyberattacks have the potential to wreak havoc on strategic weapons
systems and undermine deterrence by creating uncertainty and confusion.
Cyberthreats pose a significant and complex challenge due to the absence
of a warning and speed of an attack, the difficulty of attribution, and
the complexities associated with carrying out a proportionate response.
Given the progress made in the areas of strategic conventional weapon
systems - for example, the development of advanced cruise missiles and
hypersonic glide vehicles - it is essential for NATO and its allies to
be able to rely upon space-based systems for early observation and
detection; this may enable them to identify and attribute activities and
to launch effective, calibrated responses. Cyber technology and
innovation are accessible across much of the world, levelling the field
and creating opportunities for states outside the NATO alliance - such
as China, Russia and North Korea, for example - to instigate high-impact
attacks on allied-owned strategic assets.

This research paper will first introduce the cyber risks to strategic
systems, through an evaluation of threats, vulnerabilities and
consequences. The paper aims to frame the problem by analysing ongoing
incidents, and to conduct an analysis of threats and resilience measures
in order to offset the risks. Second, it will discuss cyber risks for
specific space-dependent strategic weapons systems. Third, it will
explore mitigation measures against such cyber risks, through examining
NATO\'s capability development approach, which is known as DOTMLPF-I
(doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, personnel,
facilities, and interoperability).

2\. Cyber Risks to Space-based Strategic Systems

Risk is a product of probability and consequence. However, since
estimating the probability of a cyberattack is unreliable at best, this
paper focuses on the qualitative nature of potential threats,
vulnerabilities and their impacts. Without knowing the actual likelihood
of an event happening, it is still possible to assess threats and likely
degree of exposure, which can identify potential resilience measures. In
essence, the priority of NATO and its allies should be the readiness of
their forces to identify potential threats and defend critical assets,
rather than the likelihood of cyberattacks on space-based strategic
systems. This approach minimizes risk by taking preparedness, resilience
and continuity into the equation. Furthermore, it does not require
detailed knowledge of an adversary\'s motivation and capability.

[[Cyberattacks are a different beast to traditional forms
of]{.underline}]{.mark} aggression. Whereas electronic attacks use
physical means (such as jamming or \'spoofing\') to interfere with the
transmissions of radio frequency signals and cause reversible damage,
cyberattacks employ digital manoeuvres to target data and access systems
in order to cause permanent damage. Electronic warfare methods can
physically cut out communication signals that go to satellites
(upstream) and come back from satellites (downstream). The attacker
could send fake signals (spoofing) and trick the system without the
knowledge of the receiver. In a cyberattack, however, an adversary would
be able to gain full access to satellites as well as data, enabling them
to cause permanent damage.

Spoofing information through cyber means is a more sophisticated form of
jamming. In times of conflict, global positioning system (GPS) digital
spoofing - which involves digital interception and manipulation -
permits the transmission of false information without the awareness of
either the transmitter or the receiver. This approach could be used to
disorient troops or even control their deployment. In order to mitigate
risks, military forces should have the means to validate information
integrity and detect spoofing and manipulation of data. One possible
approach would be to educate and train personnel in alternative
navigation methods as a minimum requirement for those working for NATO
and its allies.

Cyberthreats to strategic systems

Cyber research is a fast-moving and constantly evolving area of science,
and the scope of cyberthreats that countries face is on the rise as
malicious actors find new ways to infiltrate weapons systems.

The use of electronic warfare methods and cyberattacks in peacetime
illustrates the blurred lines of engagement between nations even in the
absence of conflict. According to Norwegian military and NATO officials,
Russia persistently jammed civilian GPS signals during NATO\'s 2018
Trident Juncture exercise in Europe\'s High North region, which
highlights the growing threat. In November

2018, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated that electronic
warfare and cyberattacks were increasingly being used in operations. It
was also reported that NATO officials believed Russia is testing this
capability through its large-scale exercises, such as Zapad 2017, which
was conducted jointly with Belarus in September 2017.

According to the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS),
the most common cyberthreats to the space segment, ground segment and
space-link communication segment include data corruption/modification;
ground system loss; interception of data; jamming; denial of service;
masquerade (spoofing); replay; software threats; and unauthorized
access. There is also crossover between offensive and defensive
activities in cyberspace and space, given that - technologically -
offence is easier and more cost-effective than defence. Furthermore,
space-related personnel are vulnerable to cyberthreats. Social
engineering is becoming an important tool when used by adversaries,
and - whether it occurs deliberately or unwittingly - the potential for
people to constitute the weakest link in cyber defence is an increasing
reality.

The nature of cyber activities must evolve from being purely defensive
to include active, persistent engagement, in order to disrupt attackers
of western critical space-based capabilities. Given the importance of
space-based systems to critical infrastructure that supports NATO
military capabilities, it would be prudent to assume that an adversary
is already active in these networks and focus on resilience measures.
This increases urgency for advanced techniques, such as AI and machine
learning (ML), to identify and respond to modern threats.

[Both [China and Russia prioritize]{.mark} electronic warfare,
[cyberattacks]{.mark} and superiority within the electromagnetic
battlespace [as part of a strategy to achieve victory]{.mark} in future
operations]{.underline}. [Available doctrine from these nations
highlights a key focus on preventing adversarial satellite-based
communication systems from impacting their operational effectiveness - a
focus shared in US military planning and policy.]{.underline}

[[Russian]{.mark} space capabilities and their [cybertechnologies pose
**particular threats to NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For its
navigational system, [[Russia relies on]{.underline}]{.mark} its own
satellite system [[GLONASS]{.underline}]{.mark} (Global Navigation
Satellite System[[), rather than]{.underline}]{.mark} the US-provided
[[GPS]{.underline}]{.mark} or the EU\'s Galileo system. As part of a
series of improvements to its communications technology and GLONASS,
[[Russia is designing new]{.underline}]{.mark} navigation
[[satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}, which are claimed to be highly
accurate and longer lasting. [[Russia has been testing its
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in a hybrid context in Syria and in
Ukraine, particularly relying on capabilities for [[jamming
GPS]{.underline}]{.mark} signals [[to ground]{.underline}]{.mark}
remotely piloted [[aircraft]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is reported to have
conducted denial-of-service attacks on radio and telephone equipment,
and to have attempted to steal encrypted military data.

It is likely that several countries - such as the US, Russia and
countries within

the EU - will in future possess working quantum communications
satellites.

China, too, is improving its space capabilities by investing in new
areas of research, such as quantum communications satellite technology,
which provides a new way to encrypt information transmitted between
satellites, increasing the difficulty of hacking information. In this
regard, China\'s Micius satellite, the first of its kind when it was
launched in 2016, may eventually be able to provide a quantum
cryptography service. Other countries are following suit and it is
likely that several countries - such as the US, Russia and countries
within the EU - will in future possess working quantum communications
satellites. The European Space Agency, for instance, signed a contract
with Luxembourg-based SES Techcom SA to develop a quantum cryptography
telecommunication system (to be known as QUARTZ). With this agreement,
quantum communications have opened a new dimension in cryptography.
Quantum capabilities are likely to make existing asymmetric-based,
traditional cryptographic-based protection obsolete. The EU, the UK and
the US are all investing heavily in a range of quantum technologies -
including communication devices, computers and imaging enhancers.

Vulnerabilities to strategic systems

When analysing risk, understanding system vulnerabilities is as
important as understanding the threat landscape. Threats alone would not
pose a risk if there were no known vulnerabilities for an adversary to
exploit. Similarly, system vulnerabilities would not always result in
risk, especially in peacetime, when there is no incentive to attack or
infiltrate.

[[In the military domain]{.mark}, some of the major system
vulnerabilities include the use of commercial companies for military
purposes]{.underline}; **[\'back-doors\' in encryption]{.underline}**;
[and **[the supply-chain security of satellites]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This list can also be extended to include physical, personnel and
procedural vulnerabilities. Risks also arise from the dual-use aspect of
most of the space-related technology - where the technology can be used
for both civilian and military purposes. For instance - whether fixed or
mobile units - [communications satellites and broadcasting satellite
services have both civilian and military utility.
Similarly]{.underline}, the utilization of satellite imagery capability
in the civilian sphere for earth observations, environmental monitoring,
and the provision of oceanographic and cartographic data, also extends
to the military domain. [[There is a]{.mark}n increasing [need to apply
**higher-grade military hardening** and **cyber protection**]{.mark}
specifications to civilian capabilities that have the potential to be
used in support of military applications.]{.underline}

These capabilities aside, [terminals]{.underline} located [in ground
stations constitute a critical vulnerability]{.underline}, as a terminal
is an access point to a satellite and is usually not protected by
authentication in order not to hinder operational actions. [Terminals
house software systems that can be compromised and require **patching**
and **upgrading**]{.underline}. Moreover,
**[[software]{.underline}]{.mark}** embedded [[in weapons
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} ([such as **precision-guided
munitions**]{.underline}) [**[could also be
compromised]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

At times, [[NATO allies]{.mark} procure equipment and software to be
integrated into their national defence architecture, which becomes part
of the overall NATO capability. The **commercial supply chain**
is]{.underline} [embedded in **nearly every aspect of military
equipment**]{.underline}. This may not necessarily be a particular
vulnerability, as long as commercial equipment is designed to military
standards and is secure. However, if military standards are not met,
items procured from commercial industry with design flaws may expose
NATO\'s systems to additional vulnerabilities.

[While the absence of data is easy to detect, the manipulation of data
or erosion of confidentiality at such an interface is potentially more
difficult to discern.]{.underline}

[[Civil satellites]{.underline}]{.mark}, operated by private companies,
[[may be used to fulfil specific missions in locations where NATO allies
do not have their own space equipment]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ground
stations constitute further elements that are relevant for the data
flow. [[From a cybersecurity point of view]{.underline},
**[each]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[interface could present a
vulnerability and could become a weakness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as an
interface typically requires manual processes to establish its
operation, and/or the administration of the components involved.
Adversaries infiltrating ground- or space-based systems could exploit
weak software implementation, or the incompatibility of network or data
transfer protocols in the chain. While the absence of data is easy to
detect, the manipulation of data or erosion of confidentiality at such
an interface is potentially more difficult to discern. Vulnerabilities
can stem from:

• A higher number of data exchange interfaces used between the military
and civil sectors;

• The fact that each actor has its own isolated view of its data
network, protected by its own security standard;

• The use of old and proprietary IT hardware and software; and

• The failure or inability to conduct regular software updates to remove
known vulnerabilities. In such an environment, it seems difficult to
ensure security of the information delivered.

Space-specific risks for the NATO alliance and for key NATO countries

Space systems, which include both satellites and ground stations, as
well as related space products and services, provide mission-critical
information both for NATO\'s member states and for the alliance as a
whole. NATO relies on space-based assets for almost all of its
operations and missions. Some of the critical missions that rely on
space assets include: defence of NATO\'s territory and the neighbouring
regions; peacekeeping missions; humanitarian assistance and disaster
relief; counterterrorism; and conflict prevention activities.

[NATO does not own satellites. It owns and operates a few terrestrial
elements, such as satellite]{.underline} [communications]{.underline}
(SATCOM) anchor stations and terminals. It requests access to products
and services but does not have direct access to satellites, leaving it
up to its allies to determine whether they provide access to their
satellite capabilities. [NATO has established memoranda of understanding
with allies for possible use of space products and
services.]{.underline}

Originally, in the US, space systems used by the military were separated
from commercial and civilian assets in terms of their development and
operation. One of the reasons for this separation was to protect the
military structure against physical and cyberthreats. Military space
system safety and security requirements were also higher and more
stringent than in the commercial sphere (for example, requirements to
invest in survivability enhancement mechanisms in order to resist
jamming, or special design approaches for military space architecture).
In recent years commercial methods, for instance the capture and
analysis of satellite imagery, have been shown to be as effective as
military means. As a result, NATO uses a mix of military, civilian,
commercial, and national/multinational assets to conduct its operations.
The joint use of these assets, however, comes with an acceptance of
inherent risk, not only to the countries that provide such capability
but also to the alliance as a whole. In response, the European Defence
Agency, through its Governmental Satellite Communications (GOVSATCOM)
development programme, decided to build an intermediary class of
satellites between commercial SATCOM and military SATCOM, with security
requirements able to address the needs of critical missions, including
crisis management.

There is increased dependence on space-based systems in modern military
engagement. During the US engagement in Iraq in 2003, 68 per cent of
munitions were guided utilizing space-based means (including laser-,
infrared- and satellite-guided munitions); this percentage had risen
sharply from 10 per cent in 1990-91, during the first Gulf war. In its
operations in Afghanistan in 2001, 60 per cent of the weapons used by
the US were precision-guided munitions: these included bombs, missiles,
and other weapons, many of which had the capability to correct their own
positioning to hit the target, using space-derived information.

**[[Cyber vulnerabilities undermine confidence in strategic
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**; they increase uncertainty in information
and analysis, which impacts the credibility of deterrence and strategic
stability. Loss of trust in technology also has implications for
attribution and strategic calculus in crisis decision-making and may
increase the risk of misperception.

This dependency on space-based technology has major implications for the
way NATO conducts warfare today, and how it will do so in the future.
For instance, in order to conduct precision strikes or earth observation
through the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs - such as military
drones), systems rely on so-called \'beyond-line-of-sight\' (BLOS)
communication via satellites - especially

in times of crisis and conflict, since ground-based line-of-sight
communications are vulnerable to physical attacks. Yet, cyberattacks on
space technology or on the UAVs may lead them to misinterpret commands,
or to lose contact with the command centre and fail in operation.

[[pressure could build for a **pre-emptive**]{.mark}
**[attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} against Chinese or Russian strategic
forces. Should a satellite be struck by a piece of space debris during a
crisis or a low-level terrestrial conflict, [leaders might]{.underline}
mistakenly [assume that a space war had begun]{.underline} and retaliate
before they knew what had actually happened. Such scenarios may seem
improbable, but they are no more implausible than the scenarios that are
used to justify the development and use of antisatellite weapons.
Reducing danger. One way to moderate the nuclear risks associated with
antisatellite weapons is to realistically assess arguments that
attacking satellites would be an easy way to achieve major military
advantages without creating unanticipated or uncontrollable
consequences. For example, unclassified analysis by Jaganath Sankaran, a
research scholar at the Center for International and Security Studies at
Maryland, suggests that the practical limitations of Chinese ballistic
missiles and launch facilities would make it much harder for China to
attack critical US satellites during a crisis than it would be for
Washington to respond in ways that denied Beijing any military advantage
from such an attack. As more such studies are conducted and given
serious consideration, policy makers will be less likely to invest
heavily in antisatellite capabilities or to take pre-emptive action
against purported antisatellite threats. [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}nother
important [[way to reduce risk]{.mark} [is to
strengthe]{.mark}]{.underline}[n]{.mark} both the [[norms and the legal
rules]{.mark}]{.underline} that protect satellites. [[The most
straightforward way]{.mark} to accomplish th[is]{.mark} would
b]{.underline}e to prohibit using anything, including other space
objects, to damage or destroy satellites that are not themselves being
used as space weapons; and **[[to prohibit any testing]{.mark} of
methods for damaging or destroying such satellites]{.underline}**.
Currently, the biggest threat to established norms and legal protections
comes from people who cite anticipatory self-defense---during a crisis
or at the outset of hostilities---as a justification for disabling or
destroying satellites, launch facilities, or ground stations. Almost as
dangerous are those who argue that, once war begins, anything in space
becomes fair game and therefore should be targeted. Although it might be
legal in the midst of a war to attack satellites used for command,
control, communications, and intelligence, it doesn\'t follow that
attacking satellites would be smart strategy.

Cyber Attribution Debates Tear Apart the NATO Alliance,"

[The United States still struggles to find effective policies for
deterring cyberattacks.]{.underline} Suggestions run the gamut from more
widespread use of indictments and economic sanctions, despite their
lackluster record of success, to less traditional but more risky
policies that emphasize the asymmetric advantage America has in
conventional military power. Most of the discussion of cyber deterrence
focuses on preventing [[a single]{.mark} catastrophic or cascading
[cyberattack]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[would threaten lives (like
disruptions to electricity]{.mark} transmission [or clean
water]{.mark})---or our way of life---[altering election outcomes or
grinding global finance to a halt]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet [**the
reality is that in the event of such an attack, [the]{.mark} [response
would]{.mark} likely not [come]{.mark} from the U.S. alone but
[from]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} alliance in concert.** NATO's
cyber-defense mandate has evolved over time to update its [collective
defense]{.mark} commitment]{.underline} under Article V of the North
Atlantic Treaty [for the era of cyberattacks.]{.underline} In the latest
effort to collectively impose costs on adversaries, [the 2018 NATO
Summit saw a commitment from heads of state and government "to integrate
sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily by Allies, into Alliance
operations and missions, in the framework of strong political
oversight]{.underline}." The newly updated White House National Cyber
Strategy likewise envisions working together with a "coalition of
like-minded states" to "ensure adversaries understand the consequences
of their malicious cyber behavior." Therein lies the rub. Both formal
alliances, such as **NATO**, and more ad hoc arrangements, such as what
the Cyber Deterrence Initiative imagines, [[will require members to
share intel]{.mark}ligence [and]{.mark} eventually, to the best of their
ability and perhaps in different domains, [contribute to joint
action]{.mark} against a presumably well-armed foreign
aggressor]{.underline}. [States]{.underline} including the United
States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, and Denmark [have
publicly declared their willingness to lend sovereign offensive cyber
effects to deter, defend against and counter the full spectrum of
threats.]{.underline} [Sharing intelligence and information is a key
element of NATO's core decision-making process enshrined in Article
4]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty. [**Political [consultations are
part of]{.mark} the [preventive diplomacy between member states]{.mark},
but [they are]{.mark} also [an]{.mark} [avenue to discuss concerns
related to]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} [threats]{.mark} member states
face. These [consultations can be a catalyst for reaching a
consensus]{.mark} on policies to be adopted or actions to be
taken---including those on the use of sovereign cyber effects to support
a NATO operation.** The alliance has a track record of collective action
and cooperative security measures.]{.underline} For example, Operation
Active Endeavour helped to deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist
activity in the Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, in solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the
Atlantic Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the
organizations privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the
Feb. 15--17 Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the
Atlantic Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious
Cyber Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on
the agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration,
the consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the
future of arms control. In the United States, the greatest failures of
response and deterrence to foreign aggression in cyberspace have not
been caused by a lack of intelligence, capability or imagination.
Rather, [[U.S. policy has]{.mark} been]{.underline} serviceable in
theory but [impotent in practice because of an [inability to
translate]{.mark} technical findings and [intel]{.mark}ligence [into
public support]{.mark} [for]{.mark} sufficiently tough
[responses]{.mark} ordered by elected political leaders]{.underline}.
[[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea's repeated [operations targeting
U.S.]{.mark} companies and critical [infrastructure have been met
with]{.mark} public [skepticism]{.mark} over their culpability, limiting
the strength of retaliatory options needed to deter further [events.
Chinese]{.mark} [cyber]{.mark} economic [espionage]{.mark} [continued
for years despite]{.mark} widespread [knowledge]{.mark} of China's
[activities]{.mark} because political leaders found it difficult to
confront Beijing without undermining U.S. companies in return. [Russian
info]{.mark}rmation [operations]{.mark} did not sow enough doubt to
mislead experts, but they succeeded in [exacerbating]{.mark} the
[partisan polarization]{.mark} of an already-divided electorate and its
leaders. That inability to translate the findings of cyber experts into
public]{.underline} [sentiment and therefore political action has
sidelined America's cyberwarriors]{.underline}, by far the most
technologically advanced and well-resourced in the world. Imagine the
political response of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response
to cyber aggression but is probably much closer to any resulting kinetic
fight than the United States. Now imagine the response of that ally when
it's being asked to take causus belli on faith: The United States is
presenting attribution for a cyberattack elsewhere in the world, but
perhaps is depending on the ally lacking critical details due to
classification, and is presenting that information alongside a request
for help that might well put the ally in the crosshairs of its own
cyberattack or lethal action. [How can allies with different
capabilities to collect, analyze and understand intelligence be part of
a consensus on using sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO
operation]{.underline}? [How can a commander achieve a common
operational picture to authorize the use of sovereign effects in a NATO
operation if all the allies are not on the same page with respect to
critical attribution and other technical information needed for a use of
effect in an operation?]{.underline} We all know what a tank looks like
on a shared satellite image, but if you ask three cyber experts to
interpret the attribution for a set of indicators, you are likely to get
at least four answers. [[For most U.S. allies]{.mark} in Europe and
elsewhere, [there is]{.mark} simply [a dearth of technical
know-how]{.mark} within the government when it comes [to cyber]{.mark}
attribution and [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is already a
challenge for the United States, with a massive defense budget, Silicon
Valley innovation and an educated workforce to pull into government
service. But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy public servants will have
long fled for the private sector, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
and academia before reaching ministerial positions. To its credit, the
U.S. National Cyber Strategy does propose capacity-building measures to
support allies. This means building up law enforcement, intelligence,
and military operational and investigative capability. But even with
successful capacity-building programs, many nations could, in a crisis,
end up in the same place the United States is---with good options stuck
on the shelf while political leaders and their electorates lack a
critical mass of informed voters to trust, understand and act on expert
findings. [For countries weighing whether to risk their own blood and
treasure in support of an ally's cyber attribution findings, [this
hurdle could]{.mark} well [prove]{.mark} [insurmountable]{.mark} if not
addressed well before a crisis emerges]{.underline}. Many such countries
will no doubt recall being burned when placing too much confidence in
U.S. technical and human sources without an ability to evaluate the
evidence for themselves, as with the Iraq weapons of mass destruction
findings. The private sector will probably play a crucial role in
providing intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks,
especially as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer
competitors and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence. More important, private-sector analysts
are accustomed to writing for impact with both their technical
counterparts, like chief information security officers (CISOs) and
threat hunters, and nontechnical stakeholders such as boards of
directors, CEOs and other persons controlling the purse strings. In this
sense, unclassified, private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat
intelligence can become the lingua franca of discussions. Relying on
commercial reporting generated by international teams, rather than
declassified government-generated reports, both broadens the audience
enough to make alliance discussions feasible and mitigates against
disparities in terminology across national lines---the tendency of even
closely integrated allies to describe cyber "attack," "information
operations," and attribution findings with different implicit
assumptions or implications. Long-Term Thinking In the long run, though,
**[[the U.S.]{.mark} and its more technologically advanced
allies]{.underline}**---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia, Canada,
New Zealand and the U.K.), France and Japan---**[[will have]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} make important policy changes in the interests of
[further]{.mark}ing [alliance cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in
cyberspace: [a willingness to sometimes risk]{.mark} sensitive sources
and methods in order [to get cyber]{.mark} threat [intel]{.mark}ligence
in[to]{.mark} the hands of [other countries]{.mark} better [positioned
to take]{.mark} policy [action]{.mark}, an end to classifying public
information like IP addresses solely because of their acquisition via
classified means, and greater transparency on their own
decision-making.]{.underline} Government cyber leaders within the
alliance should consider taking another page out of the private-sector
playbook as well: running cyber-crisis exercises that involve more than
the IT department. In the commercial world, the more successful practice
runs involve leaders at both the CISO level and some presence from
nontechnical teams that would weigh in during a crisis, such as
communications and legal. The best exercises involve executives, too,
who despite their busy schedules must see for themselves how their
companies would survive and respond during a potentially ruinous
cyberattack, and work through the minutiae of leading a response
themselves. The experience and confidence is invaluable if ever called
on during a real-life crisis, and the organizational introspection by
involving decision-makers at all levels is irreplaceable.
[**[Military-to-military cyber training]{.mark}** as part of
cross-country force standardization and joint operational planning could
pull in more senior national leadership, beyond battlefield commanders,
and be coupled with increased funding for foreign affairs-led training
for nontechnical leaders.]{.underline} The private sector could also
meaningfully contribute during NATO consultations when developing Allied
Joint Publications to make sure that definitions and requirements for
threat intelligence incorporate the best practices of NATO member
countries' private sectors. [If a U.S. diplomat reaches out to his or
her counterpart in an allied country to ask for assistance responding to
malware that's damaging critical infrastructure, and that counterpart
has to ask what malware is, the response isn't going to
happen.]{.underline} \*\*\* [NATO's essential and enduring purpose is to
safeguard the freedom and security of all its members by political and
military means]{.underline}. **[[Tolerating
cyberattacks]{.mark},]{.underline}** especially those deliberately
targeting civilians and the political legitimacy of
governments---**[[without the alliance having the capability to jointly
discuss attribution]{.mark} and have the confidence to act and assist
one another---[undermines]{.mark} this core purpose of the
alliance]{.underline}**. Likewise, pursuing only deterrence and response
without an active role for the alliance in reaching peaceful diplomatic
agreements with potential adversaries abrogates member responsibilities
to their citizens but is impossible without a common language and
operational picture to discuss enforcement of such agreements. **[[The
U.S. is stronger with allies]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} with attention to
these issues [its cybersecurity can be too]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Expanding authority for DOD security cooperation with NATO over OCO's both enables effective US cyberposture and restores NATO cohesion

**Hansen '21** \[Dave and Morgan Musser; March 11; career US Army

pilot serving on Joint Special Operations Air Component; Foreign Area
Senior Noncommissioned Officer serving as a regional planner in
Stuttgart, Germany; The Civil Affairs Association, "The Rhetoric vs the
Reality: Understanding NATO's Capacity to Address Russian Gray-zone
Conflict," Eunomia Journal\]

Despite these challenges, the NATO toolbox does include a variety of
instruments, such as the imposition of sanctions. And while the Alliance
has made clear it neither limits punishment to similar cyber-attacks nor
excludes them, it keeps the option open to use the full range of Allied
capabilities to deter and counter gray-zone actions. At the 2018
Brussels Summit, [Allies expressed their determination "to employ the
full range of capabilities, including cyber]{.underline}, to deter,
defend against, and [to counter the full spectrum of cyber
threats]{.underline}, including those conducted as part of a hybrid
campaign."\[33\] Thus, [NATO could retaliate in a proportional manner,
but it does not necessarily have to do so by granting the authority to
mirror Russian activity]{.underline}, [especially considering Russia
employs tactics that violate the norms of the liberal international
order]{.underline}. Corruption, illicit finance, elections in­terference,
debt traps, the restriction of free speech, spreading false narratives,
territorial aggression, and ex­tra-legal operations are all areas NATO
may rightfully choose to not engage.

From a technical standpoint, [should an adversary proliferate computer
viruses to shut down power grids,]{.underline} [countering with a
cyber-attack may not stop]{.underline}/prevent [the attacker's imminent
capacity to reengage.]{.underline} Despite an open-ended potential for
graduated response options, [[NATO policy on gray-zone activities,
particularly in cyber]{.mark} and information [remain]{.mark} wholly
constructed around a **[defensive]{.mark} posture**]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, [defensive actions do not adequately address either the
safeguarding of personal data that Russian or other malign actors might
use in cyber-enabled information warfare or the economic incentives that
drive users toward such behavior.]{.underline}

**[Considering US cyber capacity]{.underline}**, **[DoD's]{.underline}**
stepped-up [current posture of "persistent engagement" bodes
well]{.underline} [for active cyber defense]{.underline}.\[34\] However,
questions remain as to whether it effectively enables operations to be
deployed fast enough to address the ever-changing threat profiles and to
manage escalation potential. Moreover, [the approach requires the tight
coupling of strategic ends]{.underline}---typically identified in an
interagency policy process---[and operational effects]{.underline}. It
remains unclear if the current NATO collective defense strategy is able
to deliver that coupling for US capabilities, which can create risks of
unintended escalation or self-defeating effects not understood by
well-meaning policymakers. Finally, significant gaps remain in
intelligence and warning for cyber incidents across NATO, as well as
normative frameworks to guide responsible use.\[35\]

Some efforts to resolve gray-zone conflict remain in their infancy. For
example, in 2016, Finland instituted the European Centre of Excellence
for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki with participation open to EU
member states and NATO.\[36\] However, the Hybrid CoE provides only an
analytical framework for the assessment of current and future hybrid
warfare situations and their practical implication. The development of
the Hybrid CoE is a model that could be applied in other regions for
building capacity, and interoperability, and its existence is an
important step forward for EU and NATO members to informally address
vulnerabilities. However, this effort holds no authority or capacity to
engage a response.

Holistically, despite a number of declarations, increased force presence
in Eastern Europe, and newly formed information-sharing centers, NATO's
actions remain pursuant to conventional forms of military deterrence or
research. None specifically counter gray-zone activity or prevent Russia
from targeting weaker nations. From a military deterrence standpoint,
there clearly appears to be a functional mismatch between NATO's
traditional hard deterrence and the hybrid actions it wishes to remedy.
Integrating multiple elements of national security remains unaddressed.

Authorities

[[One of the key challenges]{.mark} often [plaguing US and NATO response
to gray-zone conflict is "authorities]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}
This problem is two-fold. The first are the challenges [[internal to the
US]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding perceived inadequate or dispersed
authorities to effectuate coherent activity. The second are insufficient
authorities inside the NATO Alliance -- partly a function of the
political bureaucracy within NATO itself, arguably slow to elicit timely
and relevant responses. Much of the literature on countering gray-zone
activity recognizes the need for an interdependent system.\[37\] Critics
have additionally pointed to several issues which include the lack of a
holistic methodology for dealing with Russia's gray-zone behavior.\[38\]
But without a formalized methodology for defining and assigning policy
priorities and actions, effective long-term strategies for deterring,
competing against, and responding to competitors' use of
state-controlled forces will likely be limited.

Limitations precluding a real-time, multi-agency approach to address
adversarial actions are especially salient in the information and cyber
domains. Within the US government, responsibilities and authorities are
spread across numerous entities, to include DoD, DoS, and Treasury.
There is no unity of effort and no specific organization has lead for
synchronizing the employment of all instruments of national power.\[39\]
Within DoD, most of the capabilities reside inside the force structure
of geographic and functional combatant commands (CCMD) and are tasked
through unified combatant command (COCOM) au­thority. Authorities quickly
cut across both functional and geographic lines. This may slow defining
roles and responsibilities. Also, several offensive capabilities are
either compartmentalized due to the technology behind them or,
considering their effect, may yield undesirable strategic impact.
Therefore, authorities for their use -- specifically in the information
and cyber domains are often retained at the SECDEFs level (or above).
This can dramatically impact the speed of response. To fix this, some
authorities (and associated risk acceptance) might be delegated down to
Ambassador level, such that in a steady-state environment, permission
might be granted to create effects in the information environment, while
retaining country-team level and multi-agency awareness.

[Additional [challenges with authority are a result of ambiguity in US
law. Both Title 10 and]{.mark} Title [22 authorities grant DoD]{.mark}
and DoS [authorities to support, train, and partner with
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, with legal checks and controls on human
rights and ac­countability measures. However, **[[there is no clear
de­lineation over whether building]{.mark}/countering [US local partners
should be under Title 10 or]{.mark} Title [50]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Central Intelligence Agency) authorities. As a result, the question of
who owns long-term proxy strategy and operational development remains
unanswered in the US interagency.\[40\] [This "authorities dilemma" is
even more **convoluted** within the **NATO**]{.underline}
[alliance]{.underline}. The United States' aspirational model for
countering Russia's gray-zone activity via whole-of-government approach,
is not well-suited for a multinational security-based alliance.

Opportunities and Recommendations

There are several observably difficult challenges in how the US and NATO
approach gray-zone competition, as a military, as individual nations,
and as Allies. Such challenges do come with opportunities. The
Department of Defense cannot abruptly restructure itself to engage in
all gray-zone activities, nor should it necessarily want to. What the
Alliance does have however, includes asymmetric advantages of
transparency through its rule of law. [The system of alliances and
partners can work to extend]{.underline} democratic principles,
acknowledge humanitarian concerns, [prevent violent conflict, identify
and stymie political and economic ex­ploitation]{.underline}, and support
free and fair media outlets.\[41\] Thus, developing methods that
directly compete in the gray-zone can exist outside the development of
like-capabilities. Likewise, NATO cannot immediately establish a
multi-agency organization, built to compete across a spectrum of
gray-zone activities, empowered to lead, synchronize, and coordinate
diverse capabilities across the conflict continuum.\[42\] Authorities
still must be reconfigured down and across to appropriate levels to
enable proportionality, when directed.

[The good news for US DoD is that it may not have to embark on a
complicated restructuring in order to counter Russia's malign
actions]{.underline}. [[DoD's current approach places war-fighting
authorities under CCMDs]{.underline}.]{.mark} There are certainly
numerous challenges in synchronizing prior­ities, resources, and actions
to leverage a broad toolset and eliminate the stovepipes. Indeed,
[[specific capabilities such as information]{.mark} warfare, or
**[offensive cyber]{.mark}**, are **neither** geographically nor
functionally lim­ited]{.underline}.\[43\] Yet while true, just because
some gray-zone actions cross geographical and functional lines, this
does not inherently mean the response is hindered. While broad oversight
may be an enabler, lack of it is not an inhibitor and it does not mean
that a Combatant Command is disabled.

In fact, [Russia's activities [are]{.mark} often geographically
focused]{.underline} --- making them [[ripe for
inclusion]{.underline}]{.mark} into CCMD Campaign Plans. Under the
current structure, the geographic [Combatant Commands are]{.underline}
arguably [best postured to compete against Russia's gray-zone
activities, taking full]{.underline} [advantage of supporting the
coordinated activities of USCYBERCOM as well as the expertise of US
SOCOM.]{.underline} **[[Specific authorities could be
granted]{.underline}]{.mark}** now for implementation **[[by US forces
in support of NATO objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}** to reduce Russia's
information position, [[as well as **granting authorities** for the
**leveraging of the information environment to the benefit of both US
and NATO strategic interests**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

While a US whole-of-government approach with a singular lead
organization is a lofty ideal, this is simply not practical in the short
term. [There are actions that can be taken to establish a unified
purpose, and to ensure that reform priorities for competing in the
gray-zone are formed around making the most of available US strengths by
mitigating current gaps in the ability to execute national
interest-based strategy via campaign plans. If [NATO]{.mark} is to deal
effectively with such competition, then it too [must refocus]{.mark} its
own military strategy and forces [to give gray-zone and hybrid
conflicts]{.mark} at least equal standing with traditional
deterrence.]{.underline} At present, NATO has only recognized cyberspace
as a domain of operations since 2016. While an important first step in
combating gray-zone activities in the information domain, the
information centers standing up are limited to situational awareness,
along with some planning and coordination tools.\[44\][The Alliance has
yet to refocus its security strategy to address the impact of gray-zone
activity across global, regional, and national levels.]{.underline}

[Delegated [authorities]{.mark} and packaged measures [will need to be
**tailored**]{.mark} and based on a better understanding of the
strategic intent behind the use of gray-zone tools. This can help the
military better engage in the debate and develop capabilities to support
Allies in **countering non-military threats**]{.underline}, such as
using special operations, information, and psychological operations. A
focused approach with delegated authority would vastly improve NATO's
efficiency in influencing the cost-benefit analysis of potential
aggressors in what has now become the modern theatre of operations. In
short[, if opponents increasingly act in the gray area, NATO must be
efficiently enabled to defend, attribute, and respond]{.underline}. The
initial structure is in place, but the operationalization of strategy
and authority for appropriate comprehensive tools lags.

Defeating Russia's sophisticated strategy requires strategic competence
and a concerted effort to restore confidence in democratic principles,
institutions, and processes, along with remediating the vulnerabilities
Russia exploits. To compete properly, NATO must articulate clear
guidance for its threshold warfare deterrence posture, with options that
realistically allow forces to respond to Russian gray-zone behavior.
[Management of these threats must be an ongoing endeavor, [requiring a
change in mindset]{.mark} from the deliberate sequential planning
processes associated with classic forms of conflict to a more dynamic
approach of continuously updated situational awareness, driving
political discussion, option development, decision-making, and measured
response under political control.]{.underline}

To do this effectively, [**[NATO]{.underline}** [will have to progress
from crisis-response operations]{.underline}]{.mark} [to reinvigorate
both its military strategy and forces and ensure gray-zone and hybrid
conflicts are prioritized along with higher levels of
warfare]{.underline}. This may include refocusing its current security
strategy to address the overall impact of Russian civil competition at
all levels by fully integrating its military, political, and economic
strategies and operations. How much of (and when) technological capacity
should be delegated down must ultimately be considered and reviewed,
along with how NATO integrates response capabilities into the
multi-national environment. These gaps must be bridged to enable
multinational teaming. Without them, NATO's plans for deterrence,
defense, and dialogue run the risk of becoming reactive, or even
outmaneuvered.

Many gray-zone operations will not require the actual use of military
force. Some will be entirely civil or economic -- using non-military
means to achieve strategic or tactical objectives. This will inevitably
require 'whole-of-government' capacity within NATO structures in a way
that NATO is presently not organized or enabled to perform. [If NATO
members agree that the trend of cyberspace is the most active
battlefield, then it is crucial the Alliance has a threat preparation
and mitigation plan that is continuously monitored, assessed, and
adjusted, with deterrence mechanisms built-in.]{.underline} Presently
they are not. The significance to NATO is clear. **[NATO must overhaul
its deterrence strategy]{.underline}**, to include options far more
nuanced than tactical overmatch, by re-evaluating the role of its
military as a deterrent, through increased sub-Article 5 capacities.
This might even include support from the private sector and
international organizations, with emphasis on a comprehensive approach.

Conclusion

Since its inception, **[NATO]{.underline}** [has been more than just a
military alliance. It has embraced a political role, unifying Allies
behind a common strategic vision]{.underline}. Future uncertainties
demand NATO must continue to adapt. Given the significant changes in the
security environment since Russia's incursion into Georgia and Crimea,
this presents an opportunity to determine the character of the
Alliance's military capabilities vis-à-vis gray-zone warfare. Future
decades will certainly be different than the world the Alliance
inhabited during the Cold War. [**[NATO's cohesion]{.underline}**
[resides in the ability]{.underline}]{.mark} [and will [to act]{.mark}
collectively [against shared threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[This is
the lifeblood that ensures the]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[vitality,
[credibility, and durability of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It becomes
increasingly important in a sharpened competitive environment requiring
collaboration and effective networks. Therefore, the distinctive
capabilities required to counter gray-zone warfare must be seriously
contemplated.

#### Only CBMs over OCO's can mitigate tensions from inevitable cyber policy divergences

Offensive Cyber Policy's Challenges of Harmonizing Deterrence and
Decision-making,"
https://www.aprascpo.org/post/the-looming-nato-offensive-cyber-policy-s-challenges-of-harmonizing-deterrence-and-decision-making\]

The purpose of policy in NATO offers a broad directive multilaterally
agreed by all allied states which guides the Alliance in their
coordination, action, strategy, amongst other aspects. While NATO's
conventional capabilities such as nuclear weapons, are traditionally
instructed by its policies, they themselves have evolved and been
adapted to better suit the circumstances of contemporary challenges.
Similarly, in confronting new challenges with emerging technologies and
an ever-change landscape of different domains of warfare, the Alliance,
starting from its first recognition of the need to bolster cybersecurity
and cyber defence at the Prague Summit in 2002, has made continuous
efforts in shaping and reshaping its policy in cyberspace (Davis, 1).

However, [unlike]{.underline} other [capabilities in the conventional
sense, **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[has yet to announce and
adopt]{.underline} [a [cyber]{.mark} offensive
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [its current cyber policy [is
based]{.mark} mainly [on]{.mark} cyber [defence]{.mark} and **cyber
deterrence**.]{.underline} In the meantime, [not only have allied states
suffered substantial cyberattacks by Russia with]{.underline} [the
wake-up call conflict that is the 2007 cyberwar on Estonia]{.underline},
**[other NATO adversaries]{.underline}** [and select allies have also
been developing increasingly **sophisticated cyber offensive
capabilities**]{.underline}, in short [starting an **arms race** to gain
superiority in this domain.]{.underline}

**[[For the Alliance to remain credible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[it
needs to achieve and maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} the two-pronged
aspects of [the allies' political commitment to **collective
defence**]{.underline}, **[as well as its [military
capability]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which is the insurance to the former
(Jonson 2). [[Its cred]{.mark}ibility [in
cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline} is currently maintained by a number of
allied states each with their own national cybersecurity capabilities
and some with cyber offensive policies. Yet, for NATO to adopt similar
cyber capabilities and coordinate them across its allies, it [[would
require an]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[institution-wide
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** to guide it. But [is an offensive cyber
policy for NATO politically feasible?]{.underline}

The present paper examines this question by first 1.) explaining NATO's
institutional lenience towards allied offensive cyber capabilities in
recent times despite its policy only in the defensive arena, and
addressing areas of strength and deficiency in the Alliance's
comprehension and coordination without an offensive policy. Secondly,
2.) areas of allied rift and agreement are identified by discussing
issues surrounding cyber offensive policies with previous research into
the Alliance's deterrence purpose and its decision-making and strategic
challenges. Finally, it will conclude by 3.) proposing general
recommendations for NATO's approach in considering an offensive cyber
policy.

Offensive Capabilities under a Defensive Policy

Like NATO's many conventional assets, in terms of offensive cyber tools,
[it is precisely because its allies have agreed to not conduct offensive
cyber operations as NATO that it relies on the contribution of such
capabilities from allies who possess them to volunteer them to the
Alliance]{.underline} (NATO Cyber Defence Factsheet). ​[The strictly
defensive policy does not stop allies' decision to conduct offensive
cyber operations individually or with each other, and as long as these
possibilities are willingly offered by allies, [NATO can play a
**coordination role**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in aligning the offensive
operation]{.underline}]{.mark} from allied state(s) with the Alliance's
collective defence ones (Freedberg). With the decision to integrate
offensive capabilities into a defensive policy, NATO has already
signalled its interest in strengthening its own offensive capabilities
by building its cyber command with the ability to conduct its own cyber
attacks (Emmott). [From a capability standpoint, this command will have
**coordination** and capacity-building functions for NATO allies to
develop offensive capabilities on an institutional level
together]{.underline} rather than relying on the United States' command.

[The benefits of having **o**ffensive **c**yber capabilities have also
been widely studied]{.underline}; and it is generally considered that
[cyberspace is more offensive-focused]{.underline} and [those superior
offensive capabilities including]{.underline} [demonstrating strategic,
operational, and tactical versatility and precision]{.underline} to
paralyze the adversary [gives one the upper hand]{.underline} (Saltzman
42-44). [[Developing a certain capability does not necessarily mean that
the]{.underline}]{.mark} Alliance's [[cyber policy will definitively
**expand**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to include offensive operations, but it
[will increase the Alliance's **credibility** in deterring possible
cyber risks from adversaries.]{.mark}]{.underline} On one hand, NATO's
cyber defence policy is in line with its founding identity as a
collective defence alliance; on the other hand, in other domains where
capabilities are matched with their respective policies and doctrines,
NATO allies receive clear guidance across the board on the conditions of
proliferation or nonproliferation of these capabilities whether the
response takes place on land, in the sea, or air. It may be then
advantageous for NATO to provide a clear direction to allies on its
cyber policy involving both its defensive and offensive capabilities
upon the refinement of the latter.

Another key consideration is the ascension of cyber to being on the same
level as other operational domains at the Wales Summit in 2014,
insinuating that a cyberattack could trigger Article 5 (Oolup 28).
Considering the event of NATO's response to entail kinetic measures,
cyberattacks successfully operated to a targeted and effective extent
may not cause physical destruction but other types of large-scale
damage, such as information loss or political undermining (Roggeveen).
[For NATO to]{.underline} thus [engage adversaries]{.underline} in such
an event, **[multiple levels of cyber aggression]{.underline}** [need to
be addressed separately to provide **proportional** and **appropriate
offensive responses**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [contrary to claims
which often point out an engagement in cyberwar can escalate a conflict
to other domains]{.underline}, scholars have also found that although
[[offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} are not particularly
effective in deterring military action of an adversary unless the threat
of proliferation comes from credible actors, they **[[are useful in
compellence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[while the **secrecy** of their
**operation**]{.underline} [can]{.underline}]{.mark} [potentially
**[de-escalate a conflict by saving the adversary
face]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Smeets & Lin 55). [[Given the strategic
value and]{.mark} the [complexity of]{.mark} [possessing cyber offensive
capabilities,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[a NATO-level multilateral
policy]{.underline}** [would **distribute**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**the
[knowledge]{.mark}** of such [advantages and **disseminate strategic
bargaining power**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[amongst
allies]{.underline}**]{.mark} in a way that does not clash with
collective defence goals.

[One may speculate that **NATO**'s **integration**]{.underline} [of
allied offensive capabilities is beneficial until the performance of
natively-researched and developed tools reach a highly advanced and
well-funded level to supplement and even match its defensive
capabilities]{.underline}, because strategically speaking, the supremacy
of defence capabilities should precede offensive ones in anticipation of
adversary attack. According to research in the theory of cyber
offence-defence balance, the race to develop effective offensive
capabilities globally may contribute to the destabilization of the
international security system, especially when these actors do not
possess adequate defensive ones (Shaheen 77). This guiding theory
informs the historical reluctance of NATO towards an offensive cyber
policy, although the offence-defence balance also suffers from an
interpretation of traditional warfare's narrative of escalation and
destabilization. Therefore, [[for NATO to]{.underline} [better
coordinate allies\' offensive cyber operations, a guiding policy may aid
crucial posturing and strategy]{.underline} [of its engagements in both
low-intensity and high-intensity contexts]{.underline}, [instead of for
NATO to coordinate]{.underline} [each operation
individually]{.underline}]{.mark}. By extension of this forecast based
on NATO's current stance on cybersecurity, a multilateral offensive
policy may be on the horizon with time and political will but its
negotiation and agreement face significant issues politically,
technically, and strategically. The following summary will provide an
overview of popular political and strategic challenges connecting to the
consensus-based direction and deterrence-based foundation of the
Alliance in the formulation of a NATO-level cyber offence policy.

Reforming the Deterrence Doctrine

The Alliance seeks to contribute its overall defence and deterrence
posture using cyber capabilities, and offensive cyber capabilities
announced by a guiding policy may signal clearly to the adversaries of
NATO's posture and credibility. The integration of cyber offensive
capabilities and policy with other domains of warfare may provide
strategic benefits to the Alliance by upping its credible firepower.
Though without integration into physical force in this coercive sense,
deterrence-by-punishment posturing in cyberspace through retaliatory
measures may also legitimize offensive cyber operations' use and may
present risks towards collective cooperative security amongst allies and
even potentially undermining political policies (Burton, 8).

[The preference for deterrence-by-denial as a result of the
consideration for these important risks is additionally
problematic]{.underline}, as the passive strategy runs counter to some
allied states' political will to establish a more proactive policy
(Ibid.). Out of the number of NATO allies who have volunteered their
offensive capabilities to the Alliance, **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom [expresses the most obvious intent in using
its capabilities for both deterrence and operational means]{.underline}
as stated in its National Cyber Security Strategy (HM Government 25).
Evidence of the UK's political will for a more proactive policy and
posture can be seen in the policy prioritization of its national
investment into cyber offensive capabilities and its demonstration of
offensive operations in Russia and the Middle East. It is explicit in
its national policy in identifying exactly the deterrence aims that UK
is aiming to accomplish with its offensive operations, while the US also
takes a preemptive approach in using offensive capabilities in
deterrence and in gaining other types of advantages across domains to
ensure US superiority (Oolup 40).

Comparatively, **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[allies seem to favour the more passive policy]{.underline} as it
suffers similar coordination and policymaking problems like NATO. That
being said, the European Parliament welcomed the European Commission's
cyber package, in which reinforcements to European offensive and
defensive capabilities at both civilian and military levels are
recommended to be implemented due to the EU's fragmentation in joint
defence strategies and member states' lag in exchanging knowledge and
warnings about cyber attacks (European Parliament). This need for a
joint policy and the approval of an EU-wide cyber package including
offensive capabilities may signal more political will for an
interoperable NATO policy as well as bolster collective deterrence and
security. As the allies of differentiated capabilities debate on the
value of offensive cyber deterrence in their national policies with
discretion for the inapplicability of nuclear-era deterrence theory to
cyberspace, the decision-making and organizational fashion of NATO
inflame internal political complexities and may discourage consensus.

Testing Alliance Consensus and Decision-making

The Alliance's decision-making principle of consensus further
complicates the negotiations and agreement of a NATO offensive cyber
policy. The above-mentioned nuclear example almost exclusively concerns
kinetic and state-level physical destruction of massive proportions. The
dire consequences of the extremity of possible nuclear proliferation are
enough to establish credibility, deterrence, and is a comparatively
simpler way in getting its 30 member states on board, especially in the
context of Cold War bipolarity.

Cyberspace as a domain of war contains a myriad of vested technical
issues including the difficulty of attributing attacks to specific
adversaries. Even though this is one the most prominent difficulties
according to a variety of research in cybersecurity, more recent
analyses published by NATO\'s Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence have suggested that the attribution gap is gradually
decreasing in size due to heavy research and development investment into
web tracing and identification designs largely spearheaded by the US
(Burton 11). A dynamic understanding of deterrence in cyberspace as
formerly suggested by taking into consideration social and historical
context will also alleviate the traditionally 'impossible' problem of
attribution. While such technical capabilities play a crucial role in
swaying the allies' considerations and decisions, the political and
strategic issues of simply conceptualizing an offensive cyber policy are
examined in closer detail here.

Trust and Transparency

The transparency and capability-sharing quality of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} may give way for disagreement amongst
allies. Although the Alliance's communication on a strategic and policy
level is transparent, it still possesses enough opaque room to maneuver
on an operational and tactical level. Furthermore, the problem of
[[American supremacy in cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} capabilities and
NATO's reliance on its critical perspective [[may]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[displease]{.underline}]{.mark} EU member [[states]{.underline}]{.mark}
like France in their pursuit of strategic autonomy aside from its
prevailing aversion to today\'s American leadership. A new demand for
cross-alliance intelligence-sharing on offensive cyber capabilities can
also exacerbate internal trust issues with the US. The global
surveillance disclosures from 2013 onwards revealed allied surveillance
and spying activities which damaged confidence in NATO (Smeets; 2018).
Discussion of further integrated intelligence-sharing strategy under an
offensive cyber policy can create tension between Five Eyes states
(Canada, the US, and the UK) and other NATO allies.

Doctrine Diversity

[[Another overarching aspect with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential
to **determine allies' reception**]{.underline}]{.mark} and leniency
towards an offensive cyber strategy is the diversity of threat
perception among NATO allies. The diversity across allied standards in
defining the parameters of cyberattacks and the lack of overarching
offensive cyber policy could result in strategic ambiguity and
discourage retaliation (Arts 2). These differences stem from varied
threat perceptions and cyber norms. Nationally, both threat perception
and cyber norms are influenced by the state's experience with malicious
cyberattacks and its media and public opinion; and externally, the
state's engagement in bilateral and multilateral engagements are the
most effective ways in which threat perception and cyber norms are
shaped (Lewis 575). This hints at the political interest of near-Russia
states like Estonia and Finland to possess well-rounded cyber norms and
threat perception. Conversely, policy engagements on offensive
capabilities would also shape NATO allies' understanding as a whole.
Without multilateral definitions, allies like Luxembourg and Iceland who
have not experienced similar events do not benefit from harmonized
knowledge and may not find justification to prioritize the strengthening
of cyber capabilities when allocating funds from the common NATO budget.
Not to mention the financial commitment issue affects trust in the
Alliance overall as well.

Recommendations and Conclusion

The present memo provided an overview of the most pressing issues
related to a possible NATO offensive cyber policy with a particular
focus on the Alliance's fundamental deterrence purpose and its
policymaking structure. Since supporting volunteered cyber offensive
operations on a case-to-case basis does not provide overarching guidance
to NATO allies on cyber threats and norms even though offensive
capabilities can conceivably function as a credible and powerful
deterrent, [[allies have different]{.underline}]{.mark} [[understanding
of NATO's evolving]{.underline}]{.mark} offensive cyber leniency's
specific rules of engagement, aim, intended effects etc. But the
Alliance's decision-making structure and cyberspace's technical
complexity offers a wide range of challenges to allies as identified
previously.

Going forward, [[NATO allies need to]{.underline}]{.mark} first
**[[revise]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[cyber
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** approach **[[to modernize
its]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**ffensive
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**yber capabilities
[[framework]{.underline}]{.mark}. Then, it needs to draw on the new
cyber deterrence framework to work with specialized allies such as
Estonia and the UK to examine the wide range of existing threat
perceptions and cyber norms in the Alliance. Lastly,
**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**onfidence-**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**uilding
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**easure**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[between
the US and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**NATO** need to be **strengthened**
upon commencing extended intel]{.underline}]{.mark}ligence-[[sharing
schemes.]{.underline}]{.mark} The achievement of these goals will give a
clearer image of the allies' political will, renew commitments for
harmonization and interoperability of the Alliance's offensive
capabilities, and by extension boost its security cooperation.

**[[Liberal]{.mark} rules-based [order and security
architecture]{.mark}]{.underline}** [with its own]{.underline}
**[Beijing-centric order]{.underline}**. China has been hostile to NATO

**[C]{.underline}**ommunist **[P]{.underline}**arty's [goal is to
separate the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [from NATO
and NATO states from one another]{.underline}. There is one major
difference between the Russian and Chinese approach to subverting NATO.
China still wants access to the EU's economies, whereas Russia's view is
dominated by an environment of total great-power conflict.

[Chinese [attempts to subvert Europe include **divide-and-rule**]{.mark}
**tactics**]{.underline} with Southern and Central European countries.
China has negotiated bilateral deals with several EU countries,
including the 17+1 group of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria,
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} Slovenia. Eleven of these countries are EU
member states and four others are candidates. Taking a page from
Russia's attempt to undermine NATO's southern flank, in 2017, China
stated it was ready to discuss Turkey's membership in the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization (SCO), whose members are China, Russia, India,
Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan and Uzebekistan.

As well, Greece and Italy have fallen into [the big money-big debt trap
of China's Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}. Chinese Shipping
giant, COSCO, has taken the controlling share of the Greek port of
Piraeus and it is said that [China wants to]{.underline} build a
high-speed rail link between Belgrade and Budapest and then onward to
the western part of the continent. The Port of Piraeus is the main sea
port of Athens, the largest port in Greece and one of the largest in
Europe. In the past decade, Chinese companies have acquired
[[controlling]{.underline}]{.mark} shares in 13 [[ports in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}, including in Greece, Spain and Belgium.
Together, these facilities handle about 10 per cent of Europe's
shipping-container capacity. In fact, China has gained access to
Europe's three largest ports: respectively Euromax in Rotterdam, of
which it owns 35 per cent; Antwerp in Belgium, of which it holds a
20-per-cent stake; and Hamburg, Germany, where it is to build a new
terminal. China's People's Liberation Army (Navy) warships have already
paid a friendly port visit to Piraeus in Greece. Gary Roughead, a former
U.S. chief of naval operations, warned that "[Chinese port operators
will be able to monitor U.S. ship movements closely, be aware of
maintenance activities, have access to equipment moving to and from
repair sites and interact freely with our crews over protracted
periods."]{.underline}

[China is leveraging tensions in the Western alliance over U.S. economic
policies]{.underline}, including U.S. sanctions on European countries
and Washington's trade war with China, [climate change]{.underline},
[multilateralism]{.underline} [and the Iran nuclear deal]{.underline}.
[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[builds networks]{.mark} among
European politicians, businesses, media, think-tanks and universities
[to create]{.mark} layers of [**active support** for Chinese]{.mark}
policies and [interests]{.mark} as well as a means to shut down and
silence commentary from critics and dissidents]{.underline}.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[targeted specific]{.mark}
European]{.underline} [[countries' vulnerabilities]{.mark} to increase
its economic presence]{.underline}, including Greece's economic crisis
and disenchantment among the countries that represent the poor cousins
of the EU, those discontented with European Union conditions for
investment, such as Serbia, and the United Kingdom post-Brexit. [All the
while, [China]{.mark} is using its investment and new presence to
[acquire]{.mark} foreign [tech]{.mark}nology through legal and illegal
means, [with the **objective**]{.mark} **[of dominating]{.mark} the
[innovation industries of the future]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S.
Department of Defense has warned that [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[sought to acquire]{.underline}]{.mark}, legally and illegally,
[[Western tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} in order [[to **modernize its
economy**]{.underline} [and build weapons to **rival the strength of
Western militaries**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by striking further, harder
and faster.]{.underline} [Chinese espionage and cyber espionage to gain
access to foreign military and industrial secrets is well
known]{.underline}. The Chinese government continues its partnership
with Russia in Europe, where the two countries have similar strategic
objectives and can work together to weaken and degrade U.S. and NATO
interests.

### NC3 Entanglement\-\--2AC

#### Yes NC3 entanglement\-\--ensures nuclear escalation

War and Nuclear Peace," 61:4, p. 45-62\]

[Warfare against computer networks]{.underline}, not unlike nuclear
warfare[, tends to be **'offence-dominant'**]{.underline} in that [the
efforts, resources and time it takes to defend or restore networks
generally surpass what it takes to corrupt or crash them]{.underline}.
After all, networks are generally meant to be accessible to facilitate
the sharing of information and collaborative work. The growing
importance of computer networks, both civilian and military, has given
rise to sophisticated efforts to hack into them. Given the pay-offs,
[cyber-war capabilities are rapidly being developed, diffused and
used]{.underline}. This does not necessarily portend a threat to NC3
networks, which are singularly hard to penetrate. Yet [the consequences
of infected NC3 are dire enough to warrant concern.]{.underline}

At the behest of those who sponsor them, [hackers can upset stability by
working to induce, prevent or delay the launch of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}12 [Directly inducing nuclear launch is extremely
difficult]{.underline} and improbable, mainly because launch orders go
through human authorities. Moreover, it would take a character from Dr.
Strangelove to see the advantage of launching a nuclear weapon without
authority.13 Somewhat [less difficult]{.underline} and improbable [is to
create false info]{.underline}rmation [that persuades authorities to
launch weapons]{.underline}, particularly **[in the heat of a
crisis]{.underline}**. We know that indications-and- [warning
assets]{.underline}, such as satellites and over-the-horizon radar,
[have mistaken test alerts for real ones]{.underline}.14

Preventing launch or detonation could obviously have huge advantages for
the side on which those weapons would otherwise fall. This is some-what
more likely than inducing launch, but still very difficult because cyber
attacks generally cannot disable weapons by issuing bad instructions
unless the weapons are already capable of disabling themselves based on
bad instructions. Delaying nuclear launch may be the least unlikely
outcome: early-warning systems could be compromised or launch operations
delayed by confusion; commands necessary to launch weapons could be
tampered with; and false messages could be inserted to override true
messages or persuade operators to distrust true messages. Delaying enemy
missile-launch could expose retaliatory forces to destruction or cause
the enemy to consider a truce.

[While a wide variety of non-state actors engage in cyber
war]{.underline}, [states remain the most proficient
actors]{.underline}. Few of them would have the ability to interfere
with NC3 in the ways just described. However, the [world's three leading
cyber powers are]{.underline}, not coincidentally, the same as **[the
leading nuclear powers]{.underline}**. [Cyber war is being used
for]{.underline} a variety of **[geopolitical purposes by
Russia]{.underline}**, and it is being integrated into warfare
capabilities and operations by the United States and China. (All three
powers engage in cyber espionage, but that's a different matter.) This
state of affairs presses us to ask whether the mutual deterrence that
underpins strategic-nuclear stability among the Big Three could be
weakened by the offensive cyber-war potential of those same powers.

Again, [nuclear stability depends on fear of retal]{.underline}iation
devastating enough to overwhelm any justification for a first strike. Of
interest here is whether cyber warfare directed against an enemy's NC3
could allay that fear by reducing the certainty or efficacy of
retaliation. The answer to that question depends on which of the big
nuclear powers one considers. Because it has the most survivable
retaliatory forces, and because neither Russia nor China has BMD or the
equivalent of global conventional strike, the United States has the
least reason to worry about the strength of its strategic deterrent.

Nevertheless, [any cyber attack on its **NC3** would be cause for grave
concern]{.underline}. The diversity of the US deterrent elements
mitigates the risks of Russian or Chinese cyber attack on US NC3. At the
same time, because it functions as the central nervous system of the US
nuclear infrastructure, loss of NC3 could undermine US deterrence.
Consequently, **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[would react strongly to any trace of Russian or Chinese interference
with its ability to control and operate its nuclear
systems]{.underline}. In fact, the US 2018 Nuclear Posture Review
indicates that attacks on its NC3 systems could result in nuclear
retaliation.15

[A US cyber threat to Russia's NC3 could be an **even greater danger to
nuclear peace**]{.underline}. Context matters in this regard. Even in
the absence of such a threat, the Russians worry more than the United
States does -- even more than they should -- about the survivability and
credibility of their strategic nuclear deterrent. Since the early 2000s,
when the United States withdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, the Russians have dismissed American assurances, however valid,
that US BMD is aimed at the likes of North Korea and Iran. US technical
briefings and political pledges have not mollified the concerns of
Russians consumed by the belief that BMD would expand and improve to the
point that a large percentage of Russia's retaliatory force could be
intercepted. When combined with their fear that a highly accurate US
nuclear first strike could destroy much of Russia's predominantly
land-based deterrent force on the ground, including missiles in silos,
the Russians have long seen American BMD as a threat to strategic
equilibrium.

Moreover, as noted, [the Russians are fearful of US capabilities to
decimate their nuclear deterrent]{.underline} with non-nuclear strike
forces. Lastly, US anti-satellite capabilities could potentially take
out Russian warning systems and space-based communications. [Russia's
lack of such capabilities, as well as effective BMD and global
precision-strike, has **compounded its fears**]{.underline} -- not so
much that the United States would launch a disarming first strike as
that it could use this advantage as leverage in a crisis or even
peacetime.

The Russians' view of US anti-deterrent capabilities and intentions may
be exaggerated. But it is a strongly held one, as evidenced by Russia's
modernisation programmes for strategic-offensive forces. Despite a
struggling economy, declining state revenues and competing demands on
the defence budget, Russia is investing in at least two
strategic-nuclear delivery systems that are expressly intended to
penetrate US BMD: a transoceanic nuclear torpedo aimed at US coastal
cities; and a hypersonic, manoeuvrable 'glide' vehicle. [The alarm that
these have caused in some US circles overlooks the fact that they are
inherently second-strike weapons developed in response to US
BMD.]{.underline}

In addition to deploying new second-strike systems, however, [Russia
could resort to nuclear launch-on-warning]{.underline}. [This
doctrine,]{.underline} inherited from Soviet days, [calls for launch of
a retaliatory attack when an incoming strike is observed by warning
sensors]{.underline}. It is unclear whether launch-on-warning is
stabilising or destabilising: it could be the former if it makes a
surprise disarming first strike virtually impossible; it could be the
latter insofar as it compresses decision time to a few minutes. In any
case, [US interference with Russia's NC3 could be interpreted in Moscow
as a precursor to nuclear or non-nuclear attack on its deterrent,
augmented by BMD and anti-satellite operations.]{.underline} In this
context, [cyber war could disturb strategic equilibrium and even
threaten nuclear peace]{.underline}.

### Undersea Cables\-\--2AC

#### Russia will [slash cables]{.underline}. 

**Sunak '17** \[Rishi; 2017; Member of Parliament for Richmond
(Yorkshire); Policy Exchange, "No Shortcut to a European Deterrent,"

[The prospect of a **[Russia]{.mark}n intelligence ship** lurking near
American waters -- armed with submersibles capable of **cutting undersea
cables**]{.underline} - might seem more at home in a Tom Clancy novel
than the pages of The New York Times. [Yet in late 2015]{.underline},
[American military and intelligence officials spoke openly of a
sustained pattern of Russian submarines and vessels "**aggressively
[operating]{.mark}**[" near cables]{.mark}, highlighting that the
**vital [lines]{.mark}** [of **comm**]{.mark}**unication** [are
vulnerable to **attack** by]{.mark} **Russian [naval
forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It was reported that US offic[ials were
"monitoring **significantly [increased]{.mark}** []{.mark}**Russian
[activity]{.mark}** along the known routes of cables]{.underline}"

.55 This specific incident sits against a backdrop of Russian maritime
activity which [[a **senior**]{.mark} **European [diplomat]{.mark}** has
[described as]{.mark} "comparable to the **[Cold
War]{.mark}**".]{.underline}56 Indeed, on the other side of the
Atlantic, Norway has asked for the aid of NATO allies in locating
Russian submarines near its coasts. [Media]{.underline} in countries
including Finland and Poland57 [have]{.underline} also [covered what is
recognised to be [a real threat to **NATO**]{.mark} countries from
Russian [interference]{.mark} with their **under[sea]{.mark}
[comm]{.mark}unications** infrastructure.]{.underline}

In summary, it is clear that: [[Russia is]{.mark} investing and
enhancing its maritime capabilities]{.underline}, it is [**increasingly
[willing]{.mark}** [to be **aggressive**]{.mark} in [deploying]{.mark}
that **[capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} in various theatres and means,
and [it [has]{.mark} a **specific [interest]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**track [record]{.mark}** (Crimea) in **[disrupting]{.mark}
communications** infrastructure as an asymmetric method of aggression
[to **offset**]{.mark} any relative **[weakness]{.mark}** in hard
assets]{.underline}.

Russia is investing in its naval capacity

The collapse of the Soviet Union inevitably led to a decline in the
military capabilities of its successor state, the Russian Federation.
Investment in modernisation and research were lacking, meaning that the
Russian military fell behind the expanding technological capabilities of
the West. In 2000, the once formidable Russian Northern Fleet was
described as "I'm worried every day about what the Russions may be

dangerous for its decaying nuclear power sources than its combat
ability.61 Concurrently, the military-industrial complex lacked the
capacity to mass produce state-of-the-art capabilities like Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles, and many vessels fell into disrepair.

This, however, began to change following the election of Vladimir Putin
in 2000. Since this time, [the military has undergone an extensive
programme of rearmament.]{.underline}63 Furthermore, [despite the
unfavourable economic context, [the **Russian Government**
continues]{.mark} to give spending **high priority** to the military,
and in particular its **maritime assets**. I]{.underline}ndeed, the
State Armament Plan 2007-15 set out the explicit aim of constructing
"the world's second largest \[navy\] by 2027". Moreover, [the
modernization of the military is not only increasing its capability but
is also [reorienting]{.mark} it [toward an **offensive**]{.mark} rather
than defensive **military [force]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Some aspects of the rearmament plan have proved far too ambitious to
realise. A project to commission six aircraft carriers by 2020 is still
yet to commence, and delivery of new vessels is behind schedule due to
economic realities. Yet one area in which the Russian navy must be taken
very seriously is in its subsurface capabilities.

Submarine capabilities are of particular importance because this is one
area where the West's advantage is not overwhelming64 -- Russian
submarines are becoming more advanced as new, modern and quieter vessels
begin to narrow the gap between Russian and NATO undersea forces.
Several modern classes of new submarine vessels have begun entering
service, further increasing Russia's maritime capability. At the same
time, the West's ability to engage in anti-submarine warfare has eroded
since the end of the Cold War.

65 Russia's auxiliary submarines, often referred to as deep sea
underwater stations, are also a threat. Military analysts believe that
these craft are Year 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Billion Roubles

**[NATO members are in the midst of a crisis]{.underline}**. With Russia
massing troops along its border with Ukraine and moving additional
forces to Belarus ostensibly to conduct joint military exercises,
policymakers fear that Russia is on the precipice of invading Ukraine
and taking additional territory by force---similar to Russia's
annexation of Crimea in 2014. But, even if Russian President Vladimir
Putin ultimately chooses not to launch a direct, conventional invasion
of Ukraine, it is highly likely that he will continue to pursue Russian
strategic objectives in the gray zone short of war. [The crisis over
Ukraine underscores the challenges NATO faces in competing with Russia
in the gray zone---especially in **cyberspace**.]{.underline}

[Russia has **no such limitations in the gray zone**]{.underline}. In
addition to traditional forms of irregular warfare, such as the use of
plausibly deniable proxy forces (Putin's "little green men"), [Russia
has long relied on cyber]{.underline} operations **[to
subvert]{.underline}** [and undermine rival governments
while]{.underline} [avoiding actions that would cross a threshold
prompting]{.underline} an overwhelming [retaliation]{.underline}.
Indeed, in tandem with Russia's conventional military buildup, Ukrainian
government agencies were struck with a spate of website defacements.
Microsoft also revealed that it had discovered destructive malware in
some Ukrainian government systems, which Ukrainian officials have linked
to the Belarusian group GhostWriter. Belarus has close ties to Russia,
and observers have speculated that Belarus may have been operating in
cyberspace on Russia's behalf.

While Ukraine is not a NATO member, the current situation underscores
the enduring strategic challenge the alliance faces in addressing the
cyber threat posed by Russia and other actors. In particular, [because
cost imposition is an integral part of any deterrence
strategy]{.underline} (and has been part of NATO's conventional
deterrence strategy), [the alliance has begun to explore how it could
incorporate **o**]{.underline}ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yber
**[o]{.underline}**peration**[s]{.underline}** as a component of its
cyber deterrence posture. But, [while NATO took important steps to
address cyber defense, it took **nearly a decade** after
Russia's]{.underline} 2007 [cyberattack against Estonia to begin
to]{.underline} seriously [address]{.underline} the issue of
[offensive]{.underline} cyber [operations]{.underline}. Moreover[, NATO
cyber policy has traditionally focused on cyber operations in a
warfighting context]{.underline}---[a focus that comes at the **expense
of considering cyber operations below the level of
warfare**]{.underline}. As the recent cyberattacks against Ukraine
illustrate, the gray zone just beneath the threshold of armed conflict
is where NATO faces its most significant cyber threats. With NATO in the
middle of conducting a comprehensive initiative, NATO 2030, to
strengthen the alliance, it should incorporate an assessment of the role
of cyber operations in routine competition.

Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO Strategy Above and Below the Level of
Warfare

Historically, [NATO's cyber posture has largely focused on defense and
resilience]{.underline}---and **[this continues to form the bulk of
NATO's approach]{.underline}**. The alliance maintains that its "main
focus in cyber defence is to protect its own networks (including
operations and missions) and enhance resilience." At the 2014 Wales
summit, NATO endorsed the Enhanced Cyber Defence Policy, which affirmed
that cyber defense is part of collective defense and that the alliance
would incorporate cyber defense into its planning and operations. In
2016, NATO members pledged to improve their cyber defenses through
training, education, exercises, and information sharing.

But the [seeds were also planted in 2016 for NATO to consider a
potential role for offensive cyber operations]{.underline}. That year,
the alliance recognized cyberspace as a domain of military operations,
comparable to land, sea, and air. At the 2018 Brussels summit, NATO
began to more seriously consider offensive cyber operations.
Specifically, NATO created the Cyberspace Operations Centre to
coordinate requests for member states to provide offensive cyber effects
through the Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies
process. Following the 2018 summit, then-Secretary of Defense James
Mattis stated in a press conference that five states---the United
States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Estonia---were
contributing cyber forces to "help NATO fight in this important domain."
More recently, in June 2021, NATO convened in Brussels and committed to
a Comprehensive Cyber Defence Policy. A key feature of the new policy is
the prominent role of offensive cyber operations. In Brussels, member
states committed to "employ the full range of capabilities at all times
to actively deter, defend against, and counter the full spectrum of
cyber threats."

**[NATO's shift to incorporating offensive cyber
ope]{.underline}**ration**[s]{.underline}** into existing strategy and
policy [has focused on integrating offensive effects into conventional
military plans]{.underline} and operations in the context of a conflict.
While NATO's updated strategy is a positive development, **[its limited
focus on conflict]{.underline}** scenarios for employing cyber power
[fails to accurately account for the **cyber threat environment NATO
faces**]{.underline}---particularly the mismatch between the alliance's
clear distinction between wartime and peacetime and the approach of
adversaries like Russia, who adopt a competition-conflict continuum.
Additionally, the [focus on employing offensive cyber during a high-end
conventional fight is also not consistent with how several NATO members
are already engaged in gray zone offensive cyber
operations.]{.underline}

**[The primary threat to NATO]{.underline}** allies [in the cyber domain
is not from high-end]{.underline}, decisive
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}**. Instead, cyber threats more frequently
and effectively manifest as gray zone tactics designed to have a
corrosive effect without rising to the level of warfare. There are
numerous examples of this type of threat. For instance, in July 2021,
NATO publicly condemned a range of malicious cyber behavior, including
the Microsoft Exchange hack (which NATO attributed to China) and
ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Russia has
leveraged cyber and disinformation operations to interfere in democratic
elections in the United States in 2016, 2018, and 2020; France in 2017;
and Germany in 2017 and 2021---to name just a few examples. Russia also
conducted distributed denial-of-service cyberattacks against government
websites in Montenegro during the lead-up to, and following,
Montenegro's ascension to NATO in 2017. And when NATO forces were
positioned in the Baltics beginning in 2017 as part of NATO's enhanced
forward presence, two threat actors, GhostWriter and Secondary
Infektion, conducted a range of disinformation campaigns.

Additionally, the reality is that several [NATO members are **already
speaking publicly about offensive cyber operations below the level of
warfare**]{.underline} [and their statements and actions have an effect
on the entire alliance]{.underline}. In particular, [NATO member nations
have not reached a political consensus about the role of offensive cyber
operations.]{.underline} In 2018, [the US Department of Defense and US
Cyber Command issued new strategy and policy documents that articulated
a role for the military]{.underline} in conducting offensive cyber
operations below the level of armed conflict outside of US-controlled
cyberspace (part of the "defend forward" strategy), and there has been
some reporting about US offensive cyber operations. For instance, in
2018 the United States disrupted the Russian-linked Internet Research
Agency from interfering in the midterm elections. And, more recently, in
December 2021 General Paul Nakasone, commander of US Cyber Command,
publicly acknowledged that the military played a role in disrupting
ransomware groups targeting critical infrastructure. [**The U**nited
States has also worked with other NATO allies]{.underline}, such as
Estonia and Montenegro, [to conduct "hunt forward" cyber operations on
allied and partner networks to uncover and disrupt malicious cyber
activity.]{.underline}

[Other NATO allies have also been more transparent about offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}. In 2020, the United Kingdom announced a
significant investment in its National Cyber Force, its organizational
arm for offensive cyber operations, and its 2022 National Cyber Strategy
emphasized the role of offensive cyber operations. In November 2021,
General Nakasone and the director of Government Communications
Headquarters---the UK government's principal signals intelligence
agency---stated jointly that the two governments were collaborating to
"impose consequences" in cyberspace to disrupt adversary operations. The
Netherlands has also publicly alluded to conducting offensive cyber
operations.

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

Given the threat environment facing NATO, as well as the activities of
several NATO members, **[the alliance should
deliberately]{.underline}**---but purposefully---[consider incorporating
**offensive cyber operations**]{.underline} [below the level of armed
conflict **into its deterrence strategy**]{.underline}. Any effort to
explore a role for offensive cyber operations should also consider the
challenges and risks that may come with doing so. A central challenge is
that, at the political level, [NATO allies lack consensus on the
appropriate application of offensive cyber
power]{.underline}---[especially below the level of armed conflict.
**Addressing these disagreements** among member states is
**essential**]{.underline} [because conducting offensive cyber
operations often]{.underline} [requires maneuvering through or operating
on networks controlled by an ally or allies. Right now, NATO members do
not collectively agree on the **protocols and processes** for **partner
actions in allied networks**]{.underline}---and [they also disagree on
how to define sovereignty in cyberspace, or]{.underline} [when an
offensive cyber operation would rise to the level of an **armed
attack**.]{.underline}

**[O]{.underline}**ffensive **[c]{.underline}**yber
**[o]{.underline}**peration**[s]{.underline}** **[for
NATO]{.underline}** also **[present real interoperability
challenges]{.underline}**. [The role of intelligence in cyber operations
is likely to complicate NATO planning processes. Even **close allies**
are likely to be **wary** about **sharing sensitive
intelligence**]{.underline} for a number of reasons. For instance, they
may be averse to sharing information gleaned from signals intelligence
collection or because a member state may be using the same exploits for
both offensive action and their own espionage---including intelligence
collection against allies. Or, [allies may simply be worried that
sensitive information may become exposed]{.underline}. On top of this,
[it's challenging to adjudicate intelligence requirements among allies
and to deconflict intelligence and military priorities. It is also not
clear whether the alliance has established consensus thresholds that
specify the conditions and timeline under which a state would have to
notify others of its activities on their networks---if at
all]{.underline}.

[The **alliance** should account for, and address, these issues as NATO
explores the prospect of incorporating offensive cyber operations below
the level of armed conflict into existing NATO simulations and exercises
that span the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. A number of
important questions about how to coordinate offensive cyber
operations]{.underline} and define roles and responsibilities remain
unanswered. For instance, [how could allies **improve intelligence
sharing**]{.underline} to conduct more rapid attribution, enabling one
state or the alliance [to respond to adversary cyber
activity]{.underline}? What are the conditions under which allies should
consider dividing responsibilities for cyber campaign planning and
developing accesses and capabilities against strategic targets in, for
example, Russia? If some allies are responsible for offensive cyber
operations against certain targets, what are the information-sharing and
notification requirements?

#### Cyber capacity-building key to effective defense

Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of Excellence (CCDCOE)in Tallinn;
German Marshall Fund of the United States; "NATO's Role in Global Cyber
Security," https://www.gmfus.org/news/natos-role-global-cyber-security\]

[Another course of action for NATO in cyber security is to increase its
**cyber capacity-building efforts** for partner countries of strategic
importance, reinforcing NATO's commitment to partners and **projecting
stability** in NATO's neighborhood. This kind of **cyber
capacity-building** could include various types of support, ranging from
**strategic advice** and **cyber institution-building** in defense
sectors to education and training or advice and assistance in cyber
defense]{.underline}. [The objective should to be to enable
**capacity-building activities for military actors**,]{.underline}
[along with the provision of training, equipment, and infrastructure for
security purposes.]{.underline} [This would allow NATO to improve the
capacities of partners to **address crises**]{.underline}, prevent
conflicts, and cater for their own security and stability by themselves,
to the benefit of their population.

As one example, [NATO could fill a gap in capacity-building for partner
countries by bringing together military]{.underline} Computer Emergency
Response Teams (**[CERTs]{.underline}**) **[to share
information]{.underline}** [on incident management dynamics, a key
factor in modern cyber defense]{.underline}. [While partner countries
can receive support from donors in establishing mechanisms and processes
to exchange information between civilian CERTs, such cooperation and
communication channels are **much less developed in the military domain
due in large part to the high sensitivity of the
info**]{.underline}rmation. [There is a need to extend the
information-sharing practices used in civilian circles]{.underline} to
partner countries' military CERTs. [Building cyber-security capacity
should focus on partners' ability to respond to and recover from cyber
incidents]{.underline}.

The arguments presented in this article should not be read as a
statement of ingenuous optimism. Negotiating an ICWC will be fraught
with difficulty given the diverse interests at stake, and the task will
not be accomplished overnight. Nonetheless, I argue, most [[standard
**objections** to]{.mark} embarking on a process of [international
negotiation]{.mark}]{.underline} (including difficulties of verifying
compliance and problems of rapid technological change) [**[fail on
closer inspection]{.mark}**. In the end, the [main barrier to]{.mark} an
[international agreement]{.mark} on governing cyberconflict may be
[opposition by]{.mark} powerful]{.underline} (mainly) [[western states,
who]{.mark}se desire to exploit]{.underline} current [strategic
advantages in the cyber-domain leads them to [reject a treaty]{.mark}.
For example,]{.underline} many observers judge that
[[America's]{.underline}]{.mark} enduring [[hostility]{.mark} towards
binding international rules for cyberspace [is
driven]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[by]{.mark} its [technological
superiority]{.mark}]{.underline} in the realm of tactical electronic
warfare[, which provides a strong incentive to maintain maximum freedom
of action]{.underline} in this domain (see Baruah 2013; Clarke and Knake
2010; Sanger 2015; Lindsay 2015, 46, 61--62; Sanger 2015; Goldsmith
2011). Not only would America be reluctant to bargain away its ability
to exploit current tactical advantages, but as the world's strongest
cyber power, American decision-makers may fear that by accepting binding
international constraints on the conduct of cyber warfare, they would be
trying their own hands while allowing other nations to rapidly catch up
(see Singer and Friedman 2014). Such [reservations are too
shortsighted]{.underline}. Given the current global rush to invest in
offensive cyber power, America's unrivaled position in the cyber domain
may well be temporary. For now, however, [[America's leading position
provides a **unique opportunity** to shape **international**]{.mark}
**rules and [norms for cyber]{.mark}** conflict. [By assuming a global
leadership role,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Washington might]{.mark} succeed
in **[encourag]{.mark}ing [other states]{.mark}** [to accept
constraints]{.mark}]{.underline} on the use of cyber offensive power
before these states acquire significant offensive capabilities of their
own.39 [During the 1950s and 1960s, American leaders were sufficiently
foresighted to]{.underline} see that they could exploit US superiority
in the realm of nuclear technology to [shape international rules
regarding nuclear arms control]{.underline}. By promising self-restraint
and by offering to share civilian nuclear technology, [Washington
succeeded in persuading other states to accept the norm of an
**international nuclear hierarchy** and]{.underline} thereby [prevented
an uncontrolled **global nuclear arms race**. A similar opportunity is
currently spurned in the cyber domain]{.underline}. [The arguments
presented in this article suggest it is time US policy-makers change
course and give their support to]{.underline} negotiating [an
ICWC.]{.underline}

But [[under i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}]{.underline}, does
[[President]{.underline}]{.mark} Barack Obama have the legal right to
retaliate?

Schmitt of the Naval War College maintains that Obama
[[\"**unambiguously**\" does have the right to respond]{.mark}, but
Schmitt would not use the term \"**retaliate**.\"]{.underline}

[\"In **international law**, [we don\'t do **tit for

what is called \-- and [[this is]{.mark} a [legal]{.mark} term \--
**[\'counter measures.\']{.mark}** \"]{.underline}

Counter-measures are operations that would otherwise be unlawful but can
be used if the purpose is to stop another state from violating the law.

So the US could hack back against the Russians? The answer is yes,
Schmitt said, as long as Washington reasonably believes Moscow is going
to continue to hack it.

[[Counter-measures don\'t have to be]{.mark}
**cyber-[related]{.mark}**[. The US]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example,
[[could prevent]{.mark} Russian [ships from transiting]{.mark} **its

2\. [NATO's position in Cyber Defence]{.underline}

[[I]{.mark}nternational [law is]{.mark} created **[by]{.mark} and for
[states]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According NATO's Cyber Defence Pledge,
[the [Alliance's]{.mark}]{.underline} mandate has always been
**[essentially [defensive]{.mark}]{.underline}**, relying on its Allies'
cyber capabilities to execute operations. (Legal) protection of critical
infrastructure and related offensive strategies always remained a
sovereign national prerogative, while [[NATO's]{.mark} cornerstone was
to build **a resilient cooperation**]{.underline}, founded on
information-sharing, education, and risk management, [[to
counter]{.mark} **any negative [consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[resulting from cyber attacks]{.underline}. To date, NATO's priority
lies with improving its own institutional infrastructure and computer
networks, whilst supporting and bolstering resilience and defence
capabilities through multinational projects.\[vii\] Nonetheless,
[**future NATO [policies]{.mark}** [should take a stance
regarding]{.mark} **the [behaviour]{.mark} of Allies** [when]{.mark}
being [attacked]{.mark} by **an aggressor state**]{.underline}, and NATO
has to reconcile its own agenda with the approaches of its
members.\[viii\]

NATO has proven to be concerned with the rapid evolution of cyber space
and cyber threats thanks to its many endeavours during the last years.
[The [inclusion of cyber attacks in **Article 5**, the embodiment of
**NATO**]{.mark}**'s collective self-defence**, incited]{.underline}
further [action in the cyber field]{.underline}. For instance, NATO
provides adequate resources to its Allies through institutions such as
the NATO Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, the NATO Cyber Rapid
Reaction Teams, the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability, and
cooperation with national CERT (Computer Emergency Response Teams). The
resilience strategy of NATO's cyber defence strategy is reflected in the
outcomes of the Warsaw Summit and the Brussels Summit. Moreover, NATO
has fostered cyber interoperability with the EU, the UN, the OSCE, and
industrial stakeholders as well as sponsored national cyber initiatives.

Current Challenges

The preamble of the North Atlantic Treaty emphasizes NATO's guiding
purposes and principles: freedom, civilisation, democracy, individual
liberty, the rule of law, and the preservation of peace and security. In
light of the emergence of Russia and China as possible adversaries in a
future cyber conflict, the importance of these fundamental principles
when engaging in cyber warfare was questioned during the Munich Security
Conference in February 2019.\[ix\] On the one hand, cyber policy
strategies concerning critical infrastructure are a national
prerogative. On the other, these national strategies do not necessarily
coincide with other states, nor are they governed by one institution;
therefore, they remain very much unregulated on the international
scale.\[x\] Despite states' dominant role in cyber defence, two newly
emerging infrastructure networks are nonetheless worth addressing on the
NATO level: Chinese 5G networks and GPS networks mainly threatened by
Russia.

2\. Critical Infrastructural Challenges

Chinese 5G Networks

Huawei's innovative 5G network will provoke a major evolution in global
economics, (cyber) security, and policy-making.\[xi\] Among other
benefits, 5G networks promise faster data speed, enhanced artificial
intelligence and machine learning in the global market, and will thus
conquer a major position in all corners of the 'internet of things'
across the globe. Huawei, holding the world's largest market share, has
completely surpassed other '5G pioneers' such as Ericsson, Nokia, and
ZTE.\[xii\] Huawei's dominance, acquired through government support,
investment in education and technological innovation, attractive selling
prices, large-scale contracting, and unrivalled competition, have aided
Chinese economic and governance models in penetrating Western,
democratic societies.\[xiii\]

Western economic powers and alliances fear China's prevalence in the
global market. Even though a 5G-breakthrough is an enormous (economic)
goal rather than merely a security risk, several NATO Allies\[xiv\] have
attempted to diminish China's influence on their national networks,
including completely banning Huawei's services. This measure is based on
a multitude of legitimate concerns.

Firstly, exclusively relying on one vendor, in this case a society
driven by national interest instead of individual human rights, might
facilitate China's illegal meddling in Western societies' data. China is
known for its cyber espionage and mass surveillance practices\[xv\] and
does not refrain from publicly identifying itself as an adversary of
Western democracies.\[xvi\] Even more so, China signed a deal with
Russian's telecom giant MTS to launch 5G-generation in 2019--2020. This
bilateral agreement further distances China from any democratic
cooperation with Western democracies and solidifies its economic
position against the 'rest of the globe'. Likewise, by co-opting Russia,
China might pose a greater military threat to the heart of the Alliance.

Secondly, Huawei has refrained from divulging any information regarding
its internal functioning or its relationship with the government,
Chinese military, or intelligence service. In spite of many public
allegations, Huawei has brushed these off by stating it is the most
audited technology company in the world.\[xvii\] This lack of disclosure
renders any transparency impossible between democratic states and
Chinese companies.

Thirdly, smart technology paves the way for potential surveillance over
the entire planet. States with a weaker human rights protection, such as
Serbia, Turkey, and Russia, have been subjected to mass surveillance
through the purchase of Huawei's cameras with facial recognition
software, thereby endangering its citizens' human rights and subjecting
its own government to political meddling.\[xviii\]

The purchase of 5G networks by some NATO Allies illustrates a dual
approach towards external cyber powers: states benefit from the
advantages of global trade, on the one side, and avoid a possible
adversary in future cyber conflict, on the other.\[xix\] These
differences in policy-making might cause fractures within the Alliance
and renew debates concerning fundamental Western values.\[xx\] National
policies, financial and technological resources are strongly nuanced and
differ amongst each other,\[xxi\] and there is no consistency between
national policies on the threat Huawei poses. The UK, not lacking
resources for cyber defence, established the "UK Huawei Cyber Security
Evaluation Centre". This centre, with newly erected centres in Germany
and Belgium to follow, is a rigorous supervision mechanism overseeing
Huawei's operation in the national context and aims at holding Huawei
accountable for any breaches in national cyber space. Two-thirds of
NATO's allies, nonetheless, lack the necessary resources to establish
such oversight mechanisms and are dependent on richer third countries,
such as the UK.\[xxii\] Concerns regarding sensitive information sharing
between NATO and Allies might raise tensions and obstruct (bilateral)
agreements.

Apart from its Allies, NATO itself might suffer damages. NATO depends on
the critical infrastructure of its Allies to execute national operations
and missions. Therefore, any threat to critical national infrastructure
affects NATO by extension. Even more so, any threat to its Allies is a
threat to NATO's founding values. NATO must ensure (military) safety
outweighs economic benefits.

GPS networks

Space-based assets should be awarded a major position in future debates
about the protection of critical infrastructure of NATO Allies. To some
extent, data stemming from other critical infrastructure is highly
dependent on terrestrial networks, such as the reliance of
telecommunications on GPS satellites. This interoperability might lead
to a cascading effect, where not only the attacked server suffers
damages but all linked networks representing different aspects of
society.\[xxiii\] Therefore, a cyber strategy proportional to the scale
and gravity of the cyber threat should be in place.

Space-based assets encompass cyber elements that depend on navigation
and (geo)location in which the global position system (GPS) is the most
important---and hackable---tool, because its data flows through
satellites, ground stations, and land pipes.\[xxiv\] Even though
critical terrestrial infrastructure goes far and beyond GPS satellites,
this article will remain limited to illegitimate interference in GPS
systems as this might pose an equal threat to NATO and its Allies.

GPS systems not only transmit data between terrestrial satellites but
operate through ground stations, connecting landlines and user
terminals. All these tools may be endangered by cyber threats. Apart
from the multitude of possible targets, cyber threats themselves are
multifaceted. Cyber threats to GPS systems might range from causing
rather minor disturbances in the satellite's network, such as monitoring
data patterns, to severe cyber attacks, such as inserting corrupted
data, loss of data, widespread disruptions, or permanent loss of a
satellite. On top of that, military and commercial assets cannot
strictly be distinguished. For example, military GPS signals are often
deployed in commercial aviation. Accordingly, cyber threats to military
targets might cause (collateral) damage to civilians, as well. This
peculiar predicament is especially concerning for NATO, as the
organization relies on Allies' military GPS infrastructure. Considering
society's equal reliance on military and commercial infrastructure, a
nation-state lacking considerable resilient GPS networks exposes not
only its government and military to cyber threats but also its citizens.
An undemocratic foreign power's, such as Russia's or China's, dominance
over civil aviation might threaten the individual human rights of the
buyer nation's own citizens, no matter its economic advantages.\[xxv\]

Like China, Russia is known for its unlawful interferences in Western
democracies' cyber space and being the aggressor of cyber attacks on
(military) institutions, companies responsible for vital national
infrastructure, and citizens. Russia claims to dispose of assets that
are capable of disrupting cyber space or that might deny space-based
assets to adversaries in future warfare as a form of military boycott.

Another reason to prioritize cyber defence for GPS networks is their
inherent two-fold vulnerability. Firstly, several supply chain elements
of GPS networks in commercial use are barely traceable. In combination
with the lack of a coherent global supervision mechanism, data leaks,
breaches, or weaknesses in the supply chain are often not addressed nor
can military security standards be enforced.\[xxvi\] Secondly, NATO
expressed its desire to include space as a domain of warfare during the
London Summit end 2019. Even though many applaud the inclusion of space
into modern warfare categories, the principles of international
humanitarian law will have to be reshaped to be pragmatically useful for
space warfare. For instance, scholars will have to investigate how the
principle of distinction can govern an attack on a satellite with dual
(civilian-commercial and military) use.

Moreover, the threat to national cyber space reflects a threat to NATO
as an organization. NATO has no satellites of its own, with the
exception of stationary ground satellite communications.\[xxvii\] When
it wants to conduct a military operation, NATO is obliged to solicit its
member states or GPS equipment and software. In brief, NATO remains
highly reliant on its allies for all space-sourced data, information,
and services, and the present security of space capabilities is
ultimately in the hands of states. Consequently, a cyber attack on a
national satellite might equally affect cyber space in a member state
and in NATO itself.

3\. [**Conclusions** and **Recommendations**]{.underline}

The Brussels Summit of 2018 and the Cyber Command Structure of 2023

During the Brussels Summit in 2018, [NATO recognised **the complex** and
**rapidly changing nature** of cyber space]{.underline} and ventured in
the direction of developing an 'overarching space policy', which was
finally approved on 27 June 2019. NATO Secretary General Jens
[Stoltenberg emphasized **the defensive nature** of NATO's
operations]{.underline} in which NATO needs to be a forum to share
information, support allies, and increase interoperability. Apart from
solely addressing 'space' as a vulnerable factor, the outcome of the
Brussels Summit introduced a New Cyber Operations Centre in Belgium that
will serve to strengthen the cooperation between NATO and its Allies by
assimilating NATO's resources within the needs of Allies'
operations.\[xxviii\] This newly founded centre will operationalise the
new Cyber Command Strategy starting from 2023.

Recognising the rising cyber threat from non-democratic countries in an
enhanced, economically dependent and interconnected globe, NATO wishes
to integrate member states' cyber capabilities into NATO operations.
These operations will be coordinated by the Cyber Command Centre in
Belgium and will remain under one general, unified command of the
Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). The Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR), thus enabled by a crafted and pragmatic
operations' toolbox, will offer an immediate and 'real-time' response to
cyber threats, much like the pre-existing agreements on air defence and
ballistic missiles. The purpose is to go beyond pure protection and
prevention of attacks on Allies' and NATO infrastructure and to acquire
a full understanding of NATO's cyber space, in particular its
vulnerabilities. This will be a reliable tool for commanders and to
deter possible future adversaries from attacking.

[[NATO's]{.mark} **newfound ability** to **[interfere]{.mark} directly**
[with]{.mark} **adversaries'
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, manipulate infrastructure
through malware, shut off power networks, [[and stop]{.mark} an attack
**[before it happens]{.mark}** will affect]{.underline} the calculations
of hostile actors, particularly whether or not the potential cost of the
attack outweighs [strategic gains]{.underline}.\[xxix\] In brief, this
command structure implies a major policy shift from NATO's past, purely
defensive mandate to granting NATO the capacity to launch offensive
attacks.

However, while applauding NATO's awareness of the emerging threats and
its recognition of a swift, unified response, a multitude of challenges
must be overcome in order to render the command structure operational.
To date, [[NATO lacks]{.mark} **cyber warfare
[principles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby [[lacking]{.mark} **any
[legal ground]{.mark}** [to derive]{.mark} **hands-on [rules]{.mark}**
regulating NATO]{.underline}'s offensive attacks [and diminishing its
'**immediate reaction**' capacity]{.underline}.\[xxx\] Besides lacking
cyber warfare principles, [[NATO's]{.mark} general [policies are]{.mark}
absolutely **[a conditio sine qua non]{.mark}** that determines how to
respond offensively]{.underline}. So far NATO remains dependent on US
policy and steers its operations on a case-by-case analysis, which will
not be effective under a general command structure. Therefore, a
formalized general command is absolutely vital to offer top-down
guidance to Allies.\[xxxi\]

As cyber threats penetrate all layers of society, a holistic command
structure should go beyond unifying purely military responses and
enlarge its scope to the private sector, because the private sector's
strong online presence, for instance, might contribute to combating
misinformation.\[xxxii\]

Conclusions and recommendations

Even though NATO recognizes the absolute necessity of a unified, formal,
immediate, and holistic command, the enforcement of this command
structure remains rather utopian. Following the formation of such a
command, [NATO will have to develop **a general policy
plan**]{.underline} to carry out its new command structure mandate. This
section will, while concluding the previous sections, reflect on a few
policy recommendations that should be taken into account before 2023.

[[NATO]{.mark} now [recognizes]{.mark} **a [serious

[puts]{.mark} the [emphasis on]{.mark} **a [defensive posture]{.mark}
only**]{.underline}. As such, [[the Alliance fails to recognize cyber as
**a force multiplier**]{.mark} that could be [of importance to]{.mark}
the [defense]{.mark} of NATO nations]{.underline}. Russia for instance
considers offensive cyber capabilities to be an integral part of its
military power and especially as a way to make up for its relative lack
of conventional forces compared to NATO. The rise in connectivity,
smartphone proliferation, cloud computing, growth of application
development, and other technological advances open new avenues to
attackers and force defenders to cover an ever-increasing number of
fields. [In **the long run**, NATO's [**defensive approach** is **not

NATO could center this debate on projecting offensive cyber warfare
capabilities as a means of deterrence, similar to the perceived value of
nuclear weapons to deter attacks against NATO.

[**Offensive security** will allow the Alliance to]{.underline} better
[control **the virtual battlefield**]{.underline}. There are valuable
cyber capabilities worth attaining, including the ability to conduct
reconnaissance and surveillance, intercept communications, or deny
resources and access. [[NATO **may find increasing support to have a

**Schneider & Herr 18** \-- Jacquelyn Schneider, Cyber Conflict Studies
Professor at the U.S. Naval War College. Trey Herr, visiting fellow at
the Hoover Institution. \[Sharing is Caring: The United States' New
Cyber Commitment for NATO, 10-10-20,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/sharing-caring-united-states-new-cyber-commitment-nato\]

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development. The Associated
Press reports that the U.S. Defense Department will announce a [[**new
commitment** to use]{.mark} **offensive and defensive
[cyber]{.mark}security [capabilities]{.mark}** [on behalf of]{.mark}
**NATO [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**The new commitment** [is **notable**]{.mark}]{.underline} given how
cybersecurity has long been treated as an exceptional domain of
operations, and cyber capabilities reserved as strategic national assets
to be shared with only the closest of allies. With this announcement,
the Pentagon is suggesting that cyber capabilities might be used
alongside conventional weapons with allies and indeed, equal weight
appears to be given to offensive and defensive operations. Perhaps most
significantly, the announcement moves NATO partners closer to what has
been a tight coterie of U.S.-favored signals intelligence partners such
as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

The DoD announcement is a sign of the continued, if nascent,
normalization of cybersecurity under the current administration and in
Europe. Even where offensive cyber operations may not rise to the level
of war, they provide decision-makers with options to influence the
geopolitical environment. This aligns with recent trends in the U.S.
military to integrate cyber capabilities into maneuver units and large
exercises, and reflects the shift towards more risk acceptant and
offensive measures to counter cyberattacks found in the 2018 DoD Cyber
Strategy.

Moving cyber capabilities into the same strategic frame as conventional
weapons, especially with NATO, reflects a shift in institutional cyber
arrangements within the United States and the growing power of the
military relative to the intelligence community. For the United States,
cyber capabilities have always had a complicated relationship with the
intelligence community, in particular the National Security Agency
(NSA). When Cyber Command stood up in 2010 as a sub-unified combatant
command within the Department of Defense, it moved into the NSA's
headquarters, staffed its management ranks with longtime NSA employees,
borrowed networks and technical capabilities, and to this day shares a
dual-hatted commander. In the immediate years after the command was
created, it was logical that the structure of partnerships with allies
looked more like the special signals intelligence relationships formed
around the NSA rather than traditional alliance networks in NATO and
Asia. The recent announcement aligns cyber operations more closely with
Department of Defense missions, which are more likely to posture
capabilities for deterrent effects, than intelligence missions, which
view capabilities as assets to be carefully husbanded.

Treating cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional arms and less
like national assets also helps drive the integration of cyber
operations into the planning and execution of a broader array of
conventional military missions. Early cyber operations were largely
conventional espionage and surveillance activities supercharged by the
spread of computing and the internet. In the United States, this led to
the creation of large and complex software tools, carefully guarded by
the intelligence community as national assets (sometimes
unsuccessfully). The DoD's announcement indicates a move towards
treating at least some of these capabilities, along with their
supporting infrastructure, more like conventional armaments and making
them available for broader use; a model closer to Central or Special
Operations Command and less like the National Security Agency.

[The Pentagon's **new [commitment]{.mark}**]{.underline} also [[reflects
changes in how Europe **talks** about cyber]{.mark}security [and]{.mark}
[characterizes]{.mark} the [Russian threat]{.mark}. **The last [two
years]{.mark}**]{.underline} have seen a [[trend to]{.mark}ward **more
[open discussion]{.mark}**]{.underline} of offensive cyber operations
and the possibility [[of]{.mark} the alliance [adopting]{.mark} [**more
assertive postures** to counter **cyber**]{.mark}
**[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} its
[members]{.mark}]{.underline}. After years of devastating ransomware
attacks and cyber-enabled information attacks, [NATO
[members]{.mark}]{.underline} are more willing to [[explore **cyber
triggers to Article 5**]{.mark}. They have]{.underline} also
[been]{.underline} more [[willing to articulate **the**]{.mark} **cyber
[threat]{.mark}** [against the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition to last week's denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities,
Russian state actors are widely suggested to be responsible for an
increasingly brazen series of operations, including targeting German
government ministries, French and British TV stations, and more.

[Many commentators worry that, whatever their immediate destructiveness,
cyber attacks remain especially dangerous because they are hard to
**track**.]{.underline} The Internet is an immensely complex web of
connections. Messages are routed automatically through available
channels in this dense network. They may go halfway around the world
before they are delivered to a neighboring state or a neighboring
country. A sender who wants to disguise the origins can take control of
a computer in a distant country and make it appear that this was the
source of the hack. It is very difficult to respond when there is doubt
about the source of an attack. [Analysts call this
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} ["**[attribution]{.underline}**
[problem]{.underline}]{.mark}." Even sober officials are concerned that
attribution may interfere with the normal incentives behind deterrence.
General Michael Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency,
warned in a 2011 essay that, "casually applying concepts from physical
space like deterrence, where attribution is assumed, to cyberspace,
where attribution is frequently the problem, is a recipe for failure."26
A more recent study, Cybersecurity and Cyberwar, asserts that among
"dimensions that make the cyber arena so challenging to secure . . . the
most difficult problem is that of attribution."27 The trouble with cyber
intrusions is that they are spectral. We often can't tell where they
have come from. We often don't know where they may go next. Cyber
attacks may not be inherently more destructive than conventional
weapons. But they are harder to identify. For alarmists, the attribution
problem makes cyber warfare especially tempting for reckless governments
or for terrorists. In Clarke's scenario, the president considers whether
to retaliate for the cascade of horrors falling on American cities by
ordering cyber command to "turn out the lights in Moscow" or "hit
Beijing." But the president is paralyzed because it is not clear whether
Russia or China is actually the power responsible for all of those
attacks.28 [There is some ground for this concern.]{.underline} Cyber
attacks can be routed through a chain of computers in different
countries.29 Tracing the proximate source of an attack does not always
indicate where it was actually planned, directed, or launched. Computers
in the chain may be redirected, without the collaboration or even the
awareness of their own operators. They can be made to perform certain
commands in robotic fashion, working as "botnets." Determining who
should finally be blamed for a cyber attack can prove a considerable
technical challenge. In the episodes mentioned previously, such as the
disruption of Estonian government websites, the Stuxnet disruption of
Iran's nuclear program, the disruption of computers at Saudi Aramco, and
the vandalism at Sony Pictures, no government officially acknowledged
responsibility.30 [When no attacker claims credit for a cyber attack,
its attribution may be disputed. Residual uncertainties, however,
**[need not prove an obstacle to deterrence]{.mark}**. As
in]{.underline} **[clandestine]{.underline}** [operations, [non-avowal
is not]{.mark}]{.underline} always [[about confusing
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [**intended [target]{.mark}**[. Israel's spy
agency]{.mark}, Mossad, has [tracked enemies to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[foreign capitals]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [**killed
them**. [It **rarely acknowledges responsibility**. Deniability gives
**diplomatic cover**]{.mark}]{.underline} to host nations, which can
claim to be "concerned" without having to strain their own relations
with Israel. It may also make the intended targets and their
organizations less certain about their safety and freedom to operate.
[The [possibility of obscuring]{.mark} responsibility for lethal attacks
[has not emboldened]{.mark} governments to use [assassination]{.mark}
regularly around the world. [Past a certain point]{.mark}, other [states
will]{.mark} insist on]{.underline} **[[tear]{.mark}ing [off the
pretense that they have "no idea" who may be
responsible]{.mark}]{.underline}**.31 [As with kinetic attacks using
bombs and bullets, [attribution in the cyber realm is
**not**]{.mark}]{.underline} an **[[all or
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}** enterprise. [[Analysts can]{.mark}
assemble information]{.underline} [that can [identify]{.mark} the source
of an attack [with]{.mark} a fair degree of]{.underline}
[**[probability]{.mark}**. They can compare characteristics of one
attack with those of other attacks known to be associated with
particular countries. Government agencies can [assemble
**evidence**]{.mark} from other sources]{.underline} (regarding the
capacities and intentions of foreign powers) [to [compare
with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[assessments by]{.mark} cyber
[specialists]{.mark}]{.underline}**.32 [[A state]{.mark} that is
**[suspected]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of involvement [can
be]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[pressed to cooperate]{.underline}**]{.mark}
with the investigation [and much may be learned from how it responds, or
how it does not.]{.underline}33 [Concern over the attribution problem
also ignores the **purpose** of the inquiry. Attribution is not for
etiological analysis in a medical sense, let alone for adjudication of
criminal guilt. If an attack causes enough damage, [an
**investigation**]{.mark} **for national security purposes [can
proceed]{.mark}** under the standard of a "preponderance of the
evidence" or reasonableness, rather than the criminal justice system's
"beyond a reasonable doubt."]{.underline} Furthermore, the United States
can hold nations liable for cyber attacks that originate on their
territory. Just as they do with terror networks or militia groups,
governments sometimes protect or work through hacker gangs, which commit
cyber mischief to extort payments, perpetrate scams, or steal valuable
information. [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and other nations have [long maintained the
right to use force to stop attacks emanating from foreign countries, and
to hold accountable the governments that refuse to stop them. In the
wake of the 9/11 attacks, for example, the U.N.]{.underline} Security
Council [authorized an invasion of Afghanistan, even though the Taliban
leadership was not accused of plotting the attacks. In the]{.underline}
[**cybersphere**, the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could]{.underline} reasonably **[extend this
claim]{.underline}** [to countries whose territory serves as
a]{.underline} **[base]{.underline}** [for cyber attacks, which the host
government will not help to control]{.underline}.34 [The supposedly
severe problem of attribution **has not made cyber weapons
attractive**]{.underline} to the very actors most often desirous of
secrecy. Terrorists groups depend on their ability to conceal their
attacks and disguise their operations as normal civilian activity.
Judging from experience to date, terrorists have not carried out
destructive cyber attacks. A study by political scientists tracked
"cyber incidents" between 2001 and 2011.35 Almost all occupied the low
end of the spectrum of destructive impact. Whether it was the "Cyber
Gaza" group attacking websites in Israel or the "Syrian Electronic Army"
(loyal to Assad) attacking websites in the U.S., the damage involved
resembled vandalism more than serious injury.36 And in the twenty
interstate conflicts where cyber incidents occurred, traditional terror
attacks (involving on-the-ground violence aimed at killing or wounding
human beings) were almost 600 times more frequent than these cyber
incidents.37 "Terrorists" rely on "violence that instills a sense of
fear and horror," writes a defense analyst. "To that end, terrorist
attacks tend to be extremely violent, bloody, and photogenic. They want
to hurt or kill their victims in a way that disturbs as many people as
possible and is seen by as many people as possible."38 Cyber attacks do
not lend themselves to this strategy. Nor have terrorist groups been
able or willing to invest the considerable resources required to execute
the most fearful sorts of cyber attacks.39

Policy and NATO: Exit and Voice," vol. 45, p. 516-517\]

Institutional effects

Three specific [institutional effects associated with NATO
illustrate]{.underline} more precisely [why **voice** is **preferred**
to exit]{.underline}. In this section we survey these as trends over
time as they affect the US. We then turn to the policy of the Trump
administration to show how the proclivity for voice has persisted.

Institutional pull

[The first]{.underline} of these effects [is **[institutional
pull]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the enduring attractiveness of NATO to the
US. We have already alluded to NATO's [institutional
qualities]{.underline}, but of note here is how these [[have been
**bent** to **American design**]{.mark}. That **advantage** is
**[a]{.mark}**n enduring [consequence of]{.mark} the **[asymmetry of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has characterised the Alliance since
its formation in 1949. NATO's functioning in the Cold War, Robert Osgood
argued, was [premised on the fact that 'no group of allies' was capable
of acquiring 'independently of the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [an adequate military basis for
protecting]{.underline} its vital interests'. 39 That state of affairs
has persisted. The end of the Cold War resulted in a significant
drawdown of US forces in Europe, but as of September 2018 there were
still approximately sixty-four thousand active US service personnel on
the continent. In fact, with the end of US combat missions in Iraq and
Afghanistan, a Cold War pattern has reasserted itself: US troops are
again concentrated in East Asia and Europe (Japan, Germany, South Korea,
and Italy being the top four locations of US forces overseas). 40

[NATO operations]{.underline} -- both in and beyond Europe --
[have]{.underline} also [**reflected** America's military
**weight**]{.underline}. Interventions in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Libya
would simply not have been possible if run by European allies. NATO's
reaction to the 2014 Ukraine crisis prompted an upscaling of European
effort but European forces have remained constrained by years of
under-investment. One recent study has suggested that 'the major
European allies would be hard-pressed to provide one combat-capable
brigade at short notice', whereas the US even in Europe 'is set to have
three combat brigades ... present at all times'. 41 [[France, the UK,
Germany, and some other allies may have developed]{.underline}]{.mark}
niche [[capabilities in cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}, special operations,
and drones, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} in these regards also [[none can
match the US in the scale]{.underline}]{.mark} and sophistication of
military effort. [NATO]{.underline}, in effect, [has been the
**institutional means** by which these **differences** have been
**accommodated**]{.underline}. Allied defence planning has been one long
exercise aimed at obtaining European interoperability with America's
quantitative and qualitative military advantages. That NATO's Supreme
Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) has always been an American (the post
being double-hatted with that of the Commander-in-Chief of US forces in
Europe) is further evidence of European deference to American military
power and priorities.

NATO is attractive to the US not simply because it is [[a **collection**
of **supplicant allies**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but because [[it
**harnesses**]{.mark} those [allies in a **predictable**]{.mark} and
**sophisticated** **[manner]{.mark}**. NATO is the mechanism that
ensures]{.underline} military **[interoperability]{.underline}** of
European and Canadian forces with those of the US, embeds a
sophisticated command and planning structure that favours US oversight
of the European theatre of operations, [[and **shapes the**]{.mark}
**national security [priorities]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} its [members
**consistent with American**]{.mark} **strategic
[objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Recognising these virtues, the US
has an interest in NATO's sustainment. It has, therefore, pursued
policies that, while attuned to US interests, are also designed to add
credibility to NATO itself. For instance, NATO nuclear sharing is an
arrangement less to do with 'the deterrence of adversaries' and more
with 'catalyz\[ing\] agreements about broader strategy' among allies. 42
In Afghanistan, NATO-ISAF was eventually folded into a US-led command
structure and so the alliance and American fortunes were conjoined in
the anti-Taliban campaign. 43 The US military response to the 2014
Crimea crisis was similarly framed by a NATO position aimed at deterring
further Russian aggression.

In light of this, [the fundamental challenge for NATO in its Russia

**[hardware issues]{.mark}**: budget numbers, force structures, fill
rates, reaction times, command posts]{.underline} and so on. [These
issues]{.underline} matter, but their [importance ultimately [**pales in
comparison** with]{.mark} the detente challenge and the question of
[what NATO hopes]{.mark} to achieve **[politically]{.mark}** with its
hardware. [**The best thing** NATO]{.mark} allies [could do]{.mark} is
to recognise the magnitude of this challenge and decide to proceed with
[internal dialogue]{.mark} and close consultation.]{.underline}
Inversely, [[the **worst thing**]{.mark} NATO allies could do is
[ignore]{.mark} the need for internal [alignment]{.mark}, allow internal
consultations to wither, and instead channel energies into a punishing
debate on burden-sharing numbers that Europe is bound to lose, leaving

Ultimately, [the state of [NATO]{.mark}'s strategic affairs, and the
effectiveness of its policies and plans, will [depend on]{.mark} the
allies' sense of [unity]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Solidarity and
[cohesion]{.mark} are at [the heart of]{.mark} any [strong
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, and, indeed, [NATO did act cohesively and
with remarkable solidarity in response to the Ukraine crisis. This has
been the case from Wales to Warsaw. However, the story continues, and
NATO must now take its deterrence policy to the next level,]{.underline}
where considerable difficulties await. [We have examined these in terms
of follow-on forces, command-structure review and the purpose of
detente. We have argued that **[doctrinal approaches]{.mark}** to these
difficulties **[define a likely road to ruin]{.mark}**, and that **[the
path forward must involve]{.mark}** a combination of adequate force and
**[clarified political ambition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Three factors
will ultimately determine the likelihood and quality of this
combination: the strength of US leadership; Europe's ability and
willingness to take responsibility for the health of the Atlantic
partnership; and Russia's approach to Europe.

[The Atlantic Alliance was always at its best when the United States
accepted the burden of leadership and provided strategic
direction]{.underline}. For this reason, [there are no allies in Europe
calling for US disengagement or a retreat to an offshore position.
[**The real concern in Europe**]{.mark} is that the United States will
remain engaged but heavily focused on burden-sharing]{.underline}, while
simultaneously pursuing bilateral great-power diplomacy with Russia.
[This would see the European **[allies]{.mark}** punished economically
and [**kept in the dark on the big political issues**. The
extent]{.mark} to which [the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is
motivated to]{.mark} maintain processes of political
[consult]{.mark}ation within [NATO]{.mark} as a foundation for military
cooperation and common missions remains
**[unclear]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Certainly, such consultations appear
to be low on the Trump White House's list of priorities. However, [[to
solve the **intricate problems**]{.mark} of reforming NATO's force and
command structures and developing its detente policy, [there is **no way
around sustained** ]{.mark}**and [in-depth
consultations]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### European allies fear Russian hybrid threats\-\--clarifying decision-making increases assurance

scientist, RAND, \"European Relations with Russia: Threat Perceptions,
Responses, and Strategies in the Wake of the Ukrainian Crisis\", RAND,

[While [**Russia's neighbors**]{.mark} see Russia as capable of and
potentially willing to carry out [a conventional attack]{.mark} against
them, they do [not]{.mark} necessarily see such an attack [as
likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. Officials and analysts interviewed tend to
describe Russia's behavior---such as its stationing of nuclear capable
missiles in Kaliningrad and overflying Polish airspace---as "bullying,"
"intimidation," or "posturing" rather than an indication of an imminent
invasion. [[A **more immediate fear**]{.mark} is that Russia could
employ **[hybrid war]{.mark}**fare---defined as a combination of various
types of operations, from conventional to irregular or psychological
warfare, to influence the domestic politics of potential target
countries]{.underline}. Our Polish and Swedish interlocutors, for
instance, were concerned about Russian propaganda in Estonia or Latvia
and that Russia's attempt to influence and mobilize Russian minorities
in Estonia and Latvia could exacerbate tensions in the Baltic region.
With an eye on this threat, Estonia and Latvia are training their forces
to respond rapidly to any provocation from Russia. While they have more
effective internal security services and border guards than Ukraine had,
they are also aware that Russian capabilities relative to the Baltic
countries give it a time-space advantage that it could exploit in any
number of scenarios.

**[[European countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly eastern NATO
members, [[are **concerned**]{.mark} that [the Alliance is **ill
equipped to respond**]{.mark} to the current crisis with
Russia.]{.underline} French and Polish officials interviewed pointed out
that [NATO's current **[decisionmaking]{.mark}** mechanism [would be
**inadequate**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [**[if Russia were
to test Article 5 "from underneath,"]{.mark}** i.e., with actions under
the threshold of conventional war or that can be "plausibly denied" by
Moscow]{.underline}. While the NATO International Staff interviewed
maintained that NATO was on a path to strengthen its capability to deter
Russia's ability to threaten the security of NATO members, the [[current
efforts]{.mark} may **[not]{.mark}** be [**sufficient**]{.mark} to bring
the Alliance to the necessary level of [**preparedness** in the face of
the new Russian threat]{.mark}.]{.underline} U.S. and European officials
interviewed emphasized the critical importance of U.S. leadership in
NATO and recognized the importance of U.S. military presence for
maintaining security in Europe. Yet, the appreciation for the U.S. role
in Europe does not come without reservations, with generally positive
perceptions of the United States being complicated by a legacy view of
the United States as imperialist by some segments of society in several
countries, such as Germany and Sweden.

### AT: Article 5 Key\-\--2AC

#### Ambiguity is [better]{.underline} in the cyber domain -- adversaries [test redlines]{.underline} and [undermine alliances]{.underline} by circumventing escalation thresholds

Postures.\"

[**[NATO]{.underline}** [needs to be careful]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[about **defining**]{.mark} and **signaling its
[redlines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Making]{.mark} these [boundaries
**too specific**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[could]{.underline} **[embolden
adversaries]{.underline}** [to intensify]{.underline}]{.mark} [their
[actions below]{.mark} NATO's [declared **threshold of
response**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Being]{.underline} **[deliberately
ambiguous]{.underline}** [and raising]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[fear
of retribution]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may be]{.underline} **[more
useful]{.underline}** [for encouraging adversaries']{.underline}]{.mark}
self-**[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

At the same time, [NATO should aim to deter specific types of
particularly threatening unconventional activities]{.underline}. These
include major and sophisticated cyber attacks against allies' military
forces and critical military and civilian infrastructure, proxy military
and special forces operations, and state-sponsored terrorism. NATO could
declare that such activities may lead it to invoke Article 5 and respond
in various ways, including asymmetrically (for example, the response to
a cyber attack may not involve only cyber capabilities).

The alliance must be able to identify early whether and when
unconventional and hybrid gray-zone actions have become a more
substantial and coordinated campaign. In such a case, NATO should aim to
deter the adversary from escalating further. This requires increasing
the alliance's capacity to share early-warning intelligence and pool
national intelligence-gathering, investigation, and attribution
capabilities. NATO should not shy away from attributing ongoing
operations to state adversaries, relying on national data as needed. The
alliance and its members should be prepared to use direct channels of
communication and other means to deliver immediate deterrence signaling
in specific cases.

[On the Southern flank, [**NATO** faces]{.mark} state]{.underline}
[actors that use [unconventional **tactics**]{.mark} and]{.underline}
**[proxy forces]{.underline}** (for example, Iran and Syria); [state
collapse and the emergence of ungoverned spaces in
**Libya**]{.underline}, **[Yemen]{.underline}**, [and parts of the
Sahel]{.underline}; and the activities of a range of nonstate actors,
[from loose groups to **terrorist** and criminal networks]{.underline}
to highly organized quasi-state structures like Hezbollah.
**[[Coop]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [with regional partners in
addressing these threats [will be **vital**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[NATO's]{.mark} primary]{.underline} [[task]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
elsewhere, [[should be to **deter**]{.mark} **states** in the region
from]{.underline} [using **[unconventional]{.mark}
[tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against **NATO** and its
allies]{.underline}, [[using **signaling**]{.mark} and **attribution**
tools]{.underline}. When possible, the alliance should aim to affect the
calculus of nonstate actors to prevent them from harming alliance
interests. This may not work with jihadist groups but may be possible
with actors motivated by political or economic interests.

#### Effective OCOs [solve war]{.underline} but [clarifying]{.underline} Article 5 greenlights aggression.

**Bigelow \'19** \[Brad; June 2019; Principal advisor to Assistant Chief
of Staff for Communications, Information Services and Cyber Defence for

\"What are Military Cyberspace Operations Other Than War?"
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_10_What-Are-Military-Cyberspace-OperationsOther-Than-War.pdf\]

[[Establishing]{.mark} a **military [capability]{.mark}** [to conduct
OCO]{.mark} below the level of conflict may be]{.underline} one [[key to
**realizing**]{.mark} the **unique [benefits]{.mark}** [of
**cyber**]{.mark}**space** as an **operational domain**]{.underline}.
Gregory Rattray and Jason Healey have argued that: "It may be that [the
future of cyber conflict is **not equivalent** to larger,
**theatre-level warfare** but only to **select covert attacks** which
could **range** across a **wide set** of **goals** and
**targets**]{.underline}." In part, this argument draws upon the
substantial base of experience showing that [offensive operations
between nations using **conventional forces** are **relatively rare**
and **usually condemned** by other states]{.underline} (Rattray &
Healey, 2010). But [conventional offensive operations are]{.underline}
also [quite visible, are easy to attribute, and raise higher risks of
escalation,]{.underline} which is why they have traditionally been seen
as "a last resort and a temporary state" (Maurer, 2012).

[[OCO]{.mark} below the level of conflict]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [[demonstrates]{.mark} the potential for states to exploit "[grey
zones]{.mark}"]{.underline}---areas where "international law principles
and rules that are poorly demarcated or are subject to competing
interpretations" (Schmitt, 2017). The willingness to operate in this
"grey zone" is clearly demonstrated in the 2018 DOD Cyber Strategy,
which states that [in [the U.S.]{.mark} "the Department [seeks to
**pre-empt**, **defeat**, or **deter**]{.mark} malicious **[cyber
activity]{.mark}** targeting U.S. critical infrastructure that could
cause a significant cyber incident [**regardless** of whether]{.mark}
that [incident would impact]{.mark} DoD's [warfighting]{.mark} readiness
or capability."]{.underline} In the United Kingdom, Defence Minister Sir
Michael Fallon called for "new doctrine to clarify our response within
NATO to anonymous cyber activity which often takes place now in that
grey zone below the previously understood threshold of war" (Fallon,
2017). A similar appetite is demonstrated in the Netherlands' Defence
Cyber Strategy 2018, which states an intent to focus Defence support for
civil authorities "on the vital infrastructure through closer
collaboration with the responsible security partners" such as the
National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) (Netherlands Ministry of Defence,
2018). And [in Germany, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen has stated
that the Bundeswehr's **cybersecurity forces** are permitted to
"**offensively defend**" their networks]{.underline} if attacked
(Somaskanda, 2018).

[[NATO]{.mark} heads of state and governments have also
[recognized]{.mark} the [value in]{.mark} leaving some amount of
"[greyness" in the "grey zone]{.mark},"]{.underline} as Jonatan Vseviov,
the permanent secretary of the Estonian Ministry of Defence, explained
in an interview: "[[there is]{.mark} a [good]{.mark} level
of]{.underline} what I would call '[[**constructive ambiguity**' built
into]{.mark} the wording of the **Washington Treaty** and also
**[Article 5]{.mark}**]{.underline}.... [[We don't want to]{.mark} give
anybody a **[list]{.mark}** of [attacks that]{.mark} would **[trigger
Article 5]{.mark}** because that would obviously mean that [we]{.mark}
**automatically** [also]{.mark} **create a [list]{.mark}** of
**potential [attacks]{.mark}** [that would **not**]{.mark} **trigger
Article 5**]{.underline}" (Mehta, 2018). [The willingness of nations to
consider use of OCO capabilities below the level of conflict
is]{.underline} also [a recognition that]{.underline}, as Michele
Flournoy and Michael Sulmeyer have written, "[for all the increasingly
vehement warnings about a **cyber Pearl Harbor**, states have shown
**little appetite** for using cyberattacks for large-scale
destruction]{.underline}. [The immediate threat is more corrosive than
explosive]{.underline}" (Flournoy & Sulmeyer, 2018). [All of which
suggests that [OCO can]{.mark} fulfil the vision proposed]{.underline}
by Bernard Brodie [at the dawn of the nuclear age: "Thus far the **chief
purpose** of our **military establishment** has been to **[win
wars]{.mark}**. From now on its chief purpose must be]{.underline} to
**[avert them]{.underline}**" (Brodie, 1946).

[[From]{.mark} a [doctrinal standpoint]{.mark},]{.underline} however,
[the importance of recognizing [OCO]{.mark} as a type of military
operation that can be carried out not only in
"war"]{.underline}---large-scale armed conflicts---[but below the level
of crisis, in the context of **jus ad bellum**, is that such
capabilities **[cannot be employed]{.mark}** in any context **[unless
they are ready]{.mark}** at the [time of need. For conventional forces
to be ready to act on short notice, they have to exist. They have to be
equipped, armed, trained, sustained]{.mark}]{.underline}, able to move,
[informed about their potential adversaries, positioned to able to
engage]{.underline} within their required readiness timelines---even
though they may never need to move past that point of readiness and
actually engage in battle. [The same is true for cyberspace
forces.]{.underline}

#### Focusing on delineating Article V activation is [worse]{.underline} by promoting a [reactive]{.underline} and [defensive]{.underline} approach 

**Lewis 15** -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of
the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, "The Role of Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO's
Collective Defence," 2015,
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf

New military technologies are destabilising. Computers used for attack
are one such technology. [NATO has made considerable progress in its
efforts to integrate cybersecurity into its planning processes,
but]{.underline} while it may have gone as far as the political
environment allows, [it needs to do more]{.underline}. NATO's September
2014 summit established that cyber defence is part of the Alliance's
core tasks of collective defence, crisis management, and cooperative
security. Consistent with its long history as a defensive organisation,
the policy emphasised "prevention, detection, resilience, recovery."2

[[Cyber defence has become a]{.mark} central [component of NATO
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}, given the success of Russia and others in
compromising NATO networks. US intelligence sources assess that any
unclassified NATO network that is directly connected to the internet
should be considered potentially compromised and that cyber espionage is
the principle threat to NATO systems over the next three years. They
also assess that Russia, given its record of effective cyber collection,
poses the greatest espionage threat to NATO computer networks.3 [The
vulnerable state of many NATO members' national networks makes
[defence]{.mark} a priority, but **it [cannot be the only
priority]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Discussion]{.mark} within NATO [has
focused on]{.mark}]{.underline} a defensive role and on the issue of
[**[when]{.mark} a [cyber]{.mark} incident [could trigger]{.mark} the
collective defence provision of [Article 5]{.mark}** of the North
Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}. NATO's Computer Incident Response
Capability (NCIRC), co-located with Allied Command Operations (ACO), is
responsible for defending NATO networks. [NATO is improving its cyber
defence]{.underline} and helping member states improve their own cyber
defences through information sharing, training, and if necessary, the
deployment of rapid reaction cyber defence teams. [These
topics]{.underline} are essential for planning purposes, but **[[leave
NATO in a reactive mode when it comes to cyber]{.mark}
warfare]{.underline}**.4

[The central question for NATO's cyber doctrine is how [the **lack of
an**]{.mark} **articulated [offensive cyber capability]{.mark}**
[affects its ability to deter]{.mark} or defend]{.underline}. Put
another way, [can any military force credibly claim to have advanced
capabilities if it does not include offensive cyber operations in its
arsenal?]{.underline} Offensive capabilities, unlike NATO's current
defensive posture, involve deliberate intrusions into opponent networks
or systems with the intention of causing disruption, damage or
destruction. The question of NATO and offensive cyber capabilities
touches on a range of sensitive political issues that militate against
any change in policy in the near term.

The US has always been overly secretive about its offensive cyber
capabilities, even after a flood of media leaks have made the most
sensitive doctrine publicly available. This secrecy has carried over
into NATO, and is unhelpful in that it increases the likelihood of
opponents miscalculating as they consider the risks of using force or
coercion against NATO members or interests. A lack of public discourse
on offensive cyber operations undercuts the legitimacy of NATO
operations by failing to build public understanding, and leaves NATO
open to charges of sinister plots, since denial of offensive
capabilities is not credible when two NATO members are world leaders in
cyber operations.

Parallels between cyber operations and nuclear strategy are usually
misleading, but cannot always be dismissed. The parallel for NATO is
that cyber attack is a "weapon" with both strategic and tactical uses,
which only a few NATO members possess. Unlike nuclear weapons, however,
the procedures for integrating offensive cyber operations into NATO's
defensive actions are not at all obvious, if they exist. NATO will need
to describe how the cyber capabilities possessed by a few of its members
will support NATO's defensive activities, and [[NATO's
credibility]{.mark} in defence [requires]{.mark} some public discussion
on the use of [offensive cyber operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There has been a confusing debate over the merits of cyber deterrence,
but one conclusion that we can draw from this discussion is that both
[the contribution of cyber operations to deterrence and the ability to
deter cyber attack work best when embedded in a larger military force
structure. **[Adding offensive c]{.mark}yber [capabilities to
NATO]{.mark}'s force structure** and response doctrine [will **increase
its deterrent capabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- by how much is
unclear, but what is clear is that [a [failure]{.mark} to add cyber
capabilities [will **erode a credible deterrent**]{.mark}]{.underline}
as cyber operations are increasingly embedded into military operations.5

#### The [combination]{.underline} of ambiguity and increased offensive coordination is key

**Brantly 16** -- Aaron Brantly, assistant professor of political
science at Virginia Tech, "Ambiguous Deterrence," 1/23/16,
https://cyberdefensereview.army.mil/CDR-Content/Articles/Article-View/Article/1136127/ambiguous-deterrence/

The ratification of a pledge for joint defense in case of a major
cyber-attack at the 2014 NATO Summit is a major step forward. Under this
pledge [a significant cyberattack on any NATO nation would be
constitutive of an attack on all of them.]{.underline} While it is hoped
that [the [vague framing and uncertain capabilities]{.mark} of each NATO
member [will facilitate **deterrence through
ambiguity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, it should be noted that [[deterrence
only works when]{.mark} that ambiguity is [backed up by a]{.mark}
command [structure capable of]{.mark} a timely and **[organized
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As President Obama and other NATO leaders are redefining and
reinvigorating strategy for the alliance it should be noted that [[the
problem lies **less** in]{.mark} an ability to pledge for [mutual
defense than]{.mark} it does in [the ability to organize]{.mark} and
provide for that same defense]{.underline}. As recently as February 2013
the Government Accountability Office released a report on National
Strategy, Roles, and Responsibilities and found that many of the major
problems faced with regards to cybersecurity for the United States have
less to do with capabilities and more to do with responsibilities.
Large-scale cyberattacks such as Estonia 2007 or Georgia 2008 cross
civil-military/private-public boundaries. Although policy-makers, think
tanks, and academics have been working furiously to establish policy and
write strategy documents, the fact remains that the United States
remains woefully unable to respond to a significant cyberattack largely
due to a failure to assign responsibilities and jurisdiction.

The ramifications associated with failure to assign responsibilities and
jurisdictions are public knowledge and have been demonstrated in a wide
variety of simulations. The Bipartisan Policy Center conducted a major
cyber incident simulation in 2010 called Cyber Shockwave. Two of
categories of findings in their follow up report dealt with significant
problems associated with governmental organization and legal authorities
and the third was international policy coordination. A 2011 report by
DHS following Cyber Storm III, a simulation designed to test the
effectiveness of the National Cyber Incident Response Plan, noted in one
of its key findings: "Although public--private interaction around cyber
response is continually evolving and improving, it can be complicated by
the lack of timely and meaningful shared situational awareness;
uncertainties regarding roles and responsibilities; and legal, customer,
and/or security concerns." As the United States and NATO pledge mutual
defense, they are further expanding the problem of responsibilities and
jurisdiction to an international institution with its own organizational
and jurisdictional shortcomings.

[[The claim]{.underline}]{.mark} made by statesmen including NATO
Secretary General Anders Rasmussen, [[that ambiguity]{.mark} of response
[facilitates deterrence is **accurate**]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly when examining the use of nuclear weapons. However,
[[that]{.mark} ambiguity [falls back upon a]{.mark}]{.underline} rigid
[[**command and control system** that enables a rapid response]{.mark}
to hostile actions]{.underline}. If nuclear command and control
functioned as it does for our cyber forces and nuclear warheads were
headed across the Atlantic or Pacific towards major U.S. cities, our
ability (or lack there of) to respond would make the concept of mutually
assured destruction laughable. Our ability to adequately respond to an
attack would be measured not in minutes or hours, but in days, weeks,
and likely even months. At present, only long after the United States
and her allies are left smoldering in the wake of a major cyberattack
are we capable of even deciding who had the responsibility to respond.

[[Pledging mutual security]{.mark} in the face of an increasingly
serious threat [is admirable]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet [[it is]{.mark}
equally [important to provide the **structural aspects that
underpin**]{.mark} **that [security]{.mark}** both at the national and
international level for all NATO members]{.underline}. Currently the
United States and her NATO allies lack a well-developed understanding of
who has responsibility for what, when at the national and international
level. And until those responsibilities and jurisdictional boundaries
are formally defined the notion of ambiguity fostering cyber deterrence
is largely an empty threat. It is imperative that Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg, who took office on October 1, 2014, facilitate policy
discussions between NATO member states in the coming years that consider
those aspects that facilitate meaningful deterrence in cyberspace.

#### Offensive buildup has to be accompanied by some level of [underlying ambiguity]{.underline} for threats to be credible

**Lupovici 11** -- Amir Lupovici, lecturer in the Department of
Political Science at Tel Aviv University, "Cyber Warfare and Deterrence:
Trends and Challenges in Research," *Military and Strategic Affairs*,
Volume 3, Number 3, December 2011, pp. 49-62

Similarly, the concept of [ambiguity should be studied]{.underline}.
This concept may serve as a framework for practical thinking in
confronting the dilemma inherent in the need for revealing capabilities
on the one hand,40 balanced against the concern that the enemy will be
able to exploit this exposure to increase its own strength and immunity
to attack. Using insights developed in different contexts may provide an
interesting foundation for developing ideas on cyberspace ambiguity, not
only with regard to intention and willingness to make good on threats
but generally with regard to the existence of capabilities. In this
respect, it is possible, for example, to analyze the different efforts
made by several nations in recent years in the field of cyber warfare.
[[Not only are the means]{.mark} developed by nations [likely to
strengthen]{.mark} their strategy of [deterrence]{.mark} against these
threats, [but the **very prominence of**]{.mark} **these
[efforts]{.mark}** [may]{.mark} also [serve as a deterrent]{.mark}
tool]{.underline}. The same is true of the American [[establishment of
a]{.mark} strategic [command to manage cyber]{.mark}
warfare]{.underline}:41 it has a range of objectives and functions, but
its very reference and prominence [allow not just improvements in
capabilities but also [demonstrate US willingness]{.mark} to invest
resources in reducing threats and damag]{.underline}e. It may be that
[stressing the desire to invest in measures of this sort and
**[revealing the scope of the]{.mark}**]{.underline} budgets,
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and ~~manpower~~ dedicated to the
subject -- even absent a detailed breakdown of the measures acquired and
their capabilities -- [[can help **increase**]{.mark} **the
[credibility]{.mark}** of the deterrent message [against]{.mark} threats
in [cyber]{.mark}space]{.underline}, especially with regard to threats
involving high levels of violence on the part of other nations. In other
words, [a [partial revelation]{.mark} of capabilities [while
**maintaining ambiguity about their essence** allows for a reduction
of]{.mark} the [harmful effects]{.mark} described above [but]{.mark}
also [transmits a forceful message]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same
time, one may expect that the low entry threshold for operating in
cyberspace, especially in cases of asymmetrical confrontations, will
continue to present a challenge to establishment of a strategy of
deterrence seeking to prevent threats in this realm.

#### The status quo Article 5 doctrine is [stabilizing]{.underline}, by making clear the costs of cyber operations -- increasing OCOs can only [enhance]{.underline} stability, not decrease it

**Lewis 15** -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of
the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, "The Role of Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO's
Collective Defence," 2015,
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf

Dissimulation is an essential part of hybrid warfare, and Europe and the
US face a propaganda barrage that is much more sophisticated than the
clumsy Soviet efforts of the Cold War. Despite this clumsiness, a good
portion of the Western public has found it persuasive. Similarly, those
critical of NATO will find new complaints about aggression and
militarisation credible. [[Russia has]{.mark} already [complained that
NATO's defensive cyber doctrine is]{.mark} destabilising
[warmongering]{.mark}]{.underline} and part of a larger conspiracy to
advance western hegemony.11 The Snowden revelations have lent a powerful
impetus to Russian propaganda.

[Behind the rhetoric lies both a desire to conceal their own use of
cyber operations and a real fear that Russia's decline leaves it
vulnerable to new military technologies]{.underline}. The intent is to
hamper and complicate any Western response to Russian efforts to regain
control in Crimea and the "near abroad". [The Russian position is that
NATO's new cyber doctrine is destabilising as it threatens to use
conventional or even nuclear responses]{.underline} (in the Russian
description of the new policy towards low-level cyber attacks).

[Any announcement by [NATO]{.mark} relating to [offensive]{.mark} cyber
[capabilities would be greeted with alarm]{.mark} and vitriol in
Moscow]{.underline}. However, [[the effect on stability would]{.mark}
likely [be **less pronounced**]{.mark}. NATO-Russia relations are
already in steep decline]{.underline}. It is possible that any NATO
announcement would accelerate this, but it is also possible that
[[Russia could **recalculate the risk of**]{.mark} **further
[adventures]{.mark}** [if]{.mark} it were [faced with a stronger
defence]{.mark}]{.underline}. In terms of opponent attitudes, there is
probably little effect. Russia, along with NATO's other potential
military opponents, is likely to overestimate both capabilities and
coordination among NATO member states and underestimate NATO's will to
defend. This is an unhappy combination as it makes aggression against
NATO seem less risky.

[[NATO's decision on]{.mark} how cyber attacks could trigger [Article 5,
while greeted with complaints, **had a stabilising effect**. It made
clear]{.mark} to potential opponents that [cyber attacks are not
risk-free]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, [[a **clear enunciation**
of]{.mark} how NATO would use **[offensive]{.mark} cyber
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} as part of any defensive operation
[[would]{.mark} also [change opponents']{.mark} risk
[calculations]{.mark}]{.underline} in ways that would force them to
consider how offensive actions, even if intended to be covert, are not
free of risk or cost.

In Part I3 of this article, we acknowledged that the increasing use of
the MOU formula could trigger a quite stimulating debate among
practitioners and academia. On the other hand, we also learned that
international institutions, in the exercise of their legal personality,
have fostered, by means of their implied powers, intra and
inter-institutional practices that use MOUs as a protuberant instrument.
These practices take place not only inter-States, but also intra and
inter-institutions of international character -- international
organisations. In this vein, we have also seen in the previous Part,
that [MOUs]{.underline} have their place in international law and
international relations, and that they [are a clear
contribution]{.underline}, inter alia, [to international institutional
law development]{.underline}.

On this note, the functionality of MOUs rest on the principle of good
faith, which per definition creates legitimate expectations among
participants. On the other hand, these legitimate expectations trigger a
sort of duty that, if breached may consequently lead to potential legal
effects, that are different from the legal obligations that emanate from
the breach of treaty provisions. This is why [even if [MOUs are]{.mark}
generally considered nonbinding instruments, the principle of good faith
presents them as [a **conduit to interpret**]{.mark}]{.underline},
inform, **[[implement]{.mark} or supplement other]{.underline}** - and
superior - **[[binding legal rules]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

This provides the nucleus for MOUs' characterisation, which permits
seeing them -- with certain flexibility -- as normative standards among
MOU participants. These participants, as members of a partner-specific
community, could claim within that restricted community the legal
effects of the agreed provisions.

Yet in the MOU realm, there is self-restriction to address the potential
judicial consequences, if there are ever any, of breaching the
provisions of an MOU and eventually the legitimate expectations created
by the MOU. An MOU may not be the direct object of the dispute, however,
courts will have little choice but to take a comprehensive approach
towards the facts, and the agreements and arrangements among
participants, in order to produce a judgment structured in space and
time.

In the next sections we will discuss both the characterisation of MOUs
and how national or international courts view them. Moreover, we will
dedicate the last section to assist practitioners by developing a
commented MOU structure.

MOUs Characterisation

The **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** Legal Deskbook briefly
[[characterises MOUs as]{.mark} follows]{.underline}:

"[The form of MOU is]{.underline} frequently [[used]{.underline}]{.mark}
to record informal arrangements between States on matters which are
inappropriate for inclusion in treaties or [[where the form is more
convenient]{.mark} than a treaty (e.g. **[for
confidentiality]{.mark}**]{.underline}). They may be drawn up as a
single document using non-treaty terms, signed on behalf of two or more
governments, or consist of an exchange of notes or letters recording an
understanding reached between two governments, or a government and an
international organization. [MOUs]{.underline} usually **[do not require
ratification]{.underline}**. However depending on the content and the
agreement between the Parties on the nature of the document, MOUs can be
subject of a certain level of domestic
ratification...[NATO]{.underline}, in general, [concludes MOUs in
numerous occasions]{.underline}. [[MOUs are a]{.mark} very
[flexible]{.mark} and adaptable [instrument]{.mark}]{.underline} to
record the will of entities with legal personality to achieve practical
results that do not amount to treaty obligations."4

How are MOUs practiced? There are several 'schools' of practice that
nations and international organisations have developed, with different
references to this practice in the British-law influential area5,
continental European states and the United States.6 Aust highlights that
in all of these areas, MOUs are considered 'agreements without
legally-binding force' and refers to the European Commission document
PESC/SEC 899 of 9 August 1996 to support his argument. Aust also admits
that in certain circumstances nonbinding becomes binding.7 However,
practice shows that states have different approaches depending on their
political approach to the topic or topics addressed in specific MOUs.8

At this point, it is relevant to note the process for creating MOUs at
NATO, a 'classic' international organisation practicing
intergovernmentalism. At NATO, during the decision making process,
members may reaffirm their sovereignty9, several times, by supporting or
opposing the existence of an MOU in their collective realm. One wonders
if in the process of creating MOU organisations or simple MOU
initiatives there is any other international organisation in the world
that gives its members so many opportunities to express their
'super-will'10 with respect to scope and purpose, as well as to [the
provisions of [MOUs]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [are intended to
**[implement]{.mark} the [obligations under the foundational
treaty]{.mark}**. These treaty [obligations are updated by an
established practice that operates through]{.mark} the decisions
taken]{.underline}, in general [per the practice of [consensus]{.mark},
by its highest decision making bodies]{.underline}. It is necessary to
note that [this consensual commitment does not only have a collective
nature]{.underline}, as [consensus reflects]{.underline} ineludibly [the
individual commitment of each of the NATO members on any specific
decision]{.underline} taken by the Council [for creating a concept
supported by an MOU]{.underline}. In the Council's decision, states do
not particularly address the non-binding status of the MOUs. In fact,
the non-binding status discussion rarely happens before the MOU text
negotiations start and, normally, ends at national level exclusively
mandated by political approaches or national legislation. This acts as
almost pro-forma language applied dependent on a states' individual
practice and perspective, irrespective of the actual points negotiated
in the MOU.

Consequently, are MOUs non-binding documents by default? How valid is
the written commitment of the participants? Could the 'bindingness' 11
created in a non-binding environment lead to legal effects? This battery
of 'tricky' questions, partially addressed ut supra, takes us outward to
square one and convinces us that the law of parsimony fed by anterior
facts and posterior behaviour surrounding the life of an MOU has to be
taken into account seriously when determining its legal effects.

In this regard, [MOUs are chosen for cross-border relations because
there has been a previous political commitment or the basic principles
of framework treaties have been implemented. The form of negotiations
does not vary from that of a treaty]{.underline}, and in general,
although there is a tendency to use lax or soft wording vis-à-vis
treaties, the treaty negotiation strategies are clearly displayed. MOU
texts, contrary to popular belief, have little flexibility for review
once agreed upon. As such, MOU drafters incorporate predictable 'mobile'
elements through annexes to MOUs, which negotiators assume can be opened
by lower level managers, though it always requires a 'political' mandate
either directly or indirectly.12 MOU practice shows that it is not
common to incorporate reservations (statements of interpretation).
However, these have recently found their way into MOUs carrying heavy
and long-term financial commitments within their provisions.

Compared to treaties, MOUs have, in general, shorter internal
coordination processes for approval, and few states pass them through
parliament or their commissions. Moreover, since most MOUs have some
financial clauses related to budget and taxes, many negotiators
regularly announce that their parliaments or specialised commissions
need to give their approval before the state in question can consider
the text of the MOU agreed upon.

Another example of how [MOUs trigger complicated internal coordination
processes]{.underline} is seen in the Host Nation Support Arrangements13
negotiated with states not party to the North Atlantic Treaty and other
NATO treaties. The fact of not counting on those treaties initiates a
parallel process of negotiations for concluding treaties14 on status of
forces and international military headquarters. [These treaties commonly
address an array of matters]{.underline} that range from entering and
staying in foreign territory, taxes and customs, wearing uniforms,
holding weapons, policing compounds, claim waivers, freedom of movement,
concurrent jurisdiction, etc. In addition, [another significant factor
is that [**due to confidentiality**, MOUs are published only]{.mark} at
the level of **[for official use only]{.mark}**, as [most]{.mark} of
them [are **classified**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Deterrence: Effectiveness and Limitations of Conventional and Nuclear

THE WHO

On NATO's Eastern flank, the focus is on Russia. Moscow seeks to achieve
its strategic aims---a sphere of influence in the neighborhood and the
prevention of NATO's expansion---without a war but seems ready to engage
in brinkmanship and is working on creating favorable conditions to
prevail in a conflict. This makes it necessary for the allies to develop
a credible deterrence strategy.

However, NATO also has to deter the threats from states and nonstate
entities in the Middle East and North Africa. The effects of conflicts
in the region are already being felt on NATO territory, and governments
in the most affected member states are asking how they can prevent
further spillover of existing and potential crises. The discussions have
been light on specifics, though not for lack of options. The allies are
already fielding missile defenses in Turkey to defend against missile
attacks from Syria; deterring conventional attacks on NATO territory
could be the next step, depending on developments in Syria itself. Other
actors of concern include Iran, with its growing missile arsenal, and
nonstate groups operating in Lebanon, Libya, and Syria.

Farther afield, given the U.S. and other allies' engagement in the Asia
Pacific and NATO's close links with Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and
South Korea, the alliance may have to consider the feasibility of
deterring China and North Korea from threatening or harming member
states. This would be a new task with significant resource implications
and should not be undertaken lightly.

THE WHAT

[**[Internally]{.underline}**, [NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[members]{.mark} [need]{.mark} [to be **clear**]{.mark} [about]{.mark}
**specific [actions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[they can]{.mark}
**reasonably [expect the alliance to deter]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Clearly, an armed attack---from whatever direction---is one course of
action to be deterred, but other actions are not so simple.1

[In the case of Russia]{.underline} (and other state actors), [the focus
is also on deterring **coercion**]{.underline}: the act of adversaries
imposing their will on NATO allies [through a combination of military
threats and nonmilitary means.]{.underline} [For now, the thinking at
NATO has emphasized deterrence of a territorial grab or blockade in the
Baltic region. However, the characteristics of the Russian **approach to
warfare**]{.underline} [mean that the alliance has to look **beyond the
Baltic Sea**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[beyond the physical
domain,]{.underline}** [mainly to the **cyber realm**]{.underline}.2
More and more of the critical systems running hospitals, carrying
electricity, or patrolling the skies are now connected to the internet
and therefore vulnerable. NATO's adversaries can, in theory, block
allied governments from coming to each other's aid by threatening
devastating cyber attacks that will cause populations to panic and
cripple economies.

[NATO]{.underline} has already declared that a cyber attack could lead
the alliance to invoke its Article 5 collective defense clause, a
statement that aims to have a deterrent effect---though there is little
evidence that it has stopped adversaries from trying.3 This is mainly
because most cyber attacks are designed to stay below the level that
would trigger a response of the whole alliance. The allies need a
clearer policy on what to do if the line is crossed one day. That policy
must also address the thorny issue of credible attribution and should be
rehearsed rigorously.

THE HOW

NATO does not need to mirror the activities of its adversaries to deter
effectively. The idea is to signal that the alliance will not be
intimidated or coerced, but that can be done in multiple ways.

With regard to Russia and the threat of a land incursion, NATO has
decided to rely on limited forward deployments along its Eastern flank
and on the ability to reinforce quickly those small contingents in times
of crisis. The shortcoming of this posture is that if Russia overwhelms
the first line of defense, it may be able to use the strength of its
conventional forces, as well as the threat of nuclear weapon use, to
thwart allied reinforcement.

NATO, as a whole, is adapting its posture to respond, and the United
States is strengthening its military presence in Europe to address these
potential weak points. The mix of U.S. troops and stored equipment and
supplies in Europe is being expanded, including in Poland. And NATO has
taken steps to improve its ability to deploy units from North America
and move them around Europe by creating a Joint Force Command for the
Atlantic and a Joint Support and Enabling Command. Other means of
strengthening deterrence include implicit or explicit threats of
political or economic sanctions or threats of countermeasures in
cyberspace.

Regarding the South, the exact form of deterrence has to match the
threat that NATO chooses to deter. With regard to potential state
adversaries, NATO's existing deterrence tools and military capabilities
can be utilized against threats from that direction. The creation of the
Strategic Direction South Hub---a consultation and coordination body for
allies and partners---at the NATO command in Naples, Italy, also
contributes to the deterrence mission. However, these measures alone
will not deter the main challenge in the South: terrorist groups, with
the potential to strike in Europe, operate in lawless spaces.

RECOMMENDATIONS

NATO may be back to its traditional mission of deterrence, but
deterrence itself has evolved. [A **new approach** must be **adapted**
to **today's environment**]{.underline}, in which a number of deterrence
challenges need to be tackled simultaneously and sophisticated
nonconventional means can be used jointly with traditional military
tools to test the alliance.

**[MAINTAIN ALLIANCE COHESION]{.underline}**

While the allies' initial response to deterrence challenges has been
impressive, in the long run, **[deterrence fatigue]{.underline}** [may
present problems]{.underline}. [NATO needs to **keep all allies
committed**]{.underline} to the deterrence mission and continue to
secure sufficient contributions of committed forces, capabilities, and
resources. [The [risk]{.mark} is that [allies' **unity** and
**cohesion**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the]{.underline} indispensable
**[foundations]{.underline}** [of
NATO]{.underline}---[[will]{.underline} **[weaken]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} memories of the Islamic State's caliphate and
of Russia's aggression against Ukraine fade.
[[Adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} will do their part to
**[sow]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[[exploit]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[divisions]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[or]{.underline} **[doubts]{.underline}** about the strength of
solidarity among alliance members.

[To keep cohesion from fraying, **[NATO's
leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[should]{.underline}]{.mark}
continuously **[[engage]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[every ally in
**dialogue**]{.underline} [about]{.underline}]{.mark} the rationale for
the **[[posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the **[threat
assessment]{.underline}**, and members' views on, and concerns over, the
implementation of the deterrence mission. National governments have the
same essential responsibility toward their parliaments and publics. NATO
must also make sure that discussions do not focus only on one strategic
direction but rather address both defense and crisis-management tasks.

Engagement with partners should include a dedicated dialogue on
deterrence issues. In some cases, based on mutual consent, NATO should
be ready to explore coordinated deterrence signaling or mutually
reinforced deterrence activities, such as joint statements, deployments,
or exercises.

Engagement with adversaries must be seen as an inseparable companion to
deterrence. Dialogue and multiple contact channels remain crucial to
convey and receive deterrence signals, avoid accidental or inadvertent
escalation, and explore risk-reduction and arms control opportunities.

DETER RUSSIA'S ADVENTURISM

In the foreseeable future, specific [challenges connected with deterring
Russia will continue to **dominate** the practical agenda]{.underline}.
As a priority, the allies should fully implement the 2018 decisions to
adapt NATO's command and force structure.4 The military credibility of
the current deterrence posture depends, to a large extent, on the
alliance's ability to speedily augment its forward-deployed units with
follow-on forces.

Th[e [allies]{.mark} [should]{.mark} look for new ways of
**stimulating** the **[develop]{.mark}ment** of **[necessary
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[interoperability]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[A **more transparent
discussion**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **major
[gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in **allied capabilities** [could]{.mark}
help **[exert pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on]{.mark} [members to
make **relevant investments**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The NATO Military
Committee should play a more active role in the alliance's adaptation by
more visibly highlighting the military requirements for credible
deterrence to civilian authorities and---via individual military
leaders---to NATO populations.

**SOI = security of information**

Concerns about the impact of [NATO\'s security of
information]{.underline} (SOI) [requirements]{.underline} are justified.
Although NATO\'s policy **[remains inaccessible]{.underline}**, its
broad outlines can be deduced. It is a conservative policy, largely
crafted at a time when the western powers were faced with overwhelming
military threats and non-state actors played a much smaller role in the
process of governance. Archival records show that the original
signatories went through a similar process of policy rationalization and
articulated concerns comparable to those being expressed by critics
today. In fact, [NATO\'s SOI policy continues to play an important
role]{.underline} in **[frustrating the work of transparency
advocates]{.underline}** in Western Europe and North America, some of
who may be unaware of the role that is played by NATO and other similar
SOI agreements.

European nations are caught in an increasingly dense web of multilateral
commitments on the handling of information, based largely on the
conservative policy crafted by the North Atlantic Treaty countries in
the early years of the Cold War. There is good reason to think that the
same may be said of countries in other parts of the globe. This may give
us reason to be cautious in assuming that global integration is
favorable to increased transparency. Advocates of transparency will also
find that domestic policy on matters of state secrecy is increasingly
constrained by this thickening web of agreements on security of
information.

WHAT DOES NATO REQUIRE?

Governments throughout Central and Eastern Europe have said that their
legislation is tailored to suit NATO requirements.11 However, observers
have asked whether governments in the region are using the process of
NATO expansion as a pretext for adopting unnecessarily broad laws, or
whether NATO\'s SOI policy is itself unduly tilted against transparency.
These are reasonable questions, but [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has done
little to provide answers. Its [[SOI policy is not publicly
accessible]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [available evidence does
suggest]{.underline} that [the [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}, crafted in
the early years of the Cold War, [[is **excessively tilted toward
secrecy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For most of NATO\'s history, [its SOI policy]{.underline} was contained
in a document known as CM( 55)15(Final), Security within the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. This document had three components. The
first and oldest component was a Security Agreement adopted by parties
to the North Atlantic Treaty at the third meeting of the North Atlantic
Council in January 1950, as one of the basic components of NATO\'s
\"master Defense Plan.\"12 This became Enclosure \"A\" of
C-M(55)15(Final). A second component, first adopted in 1950 but
substantially revised over the next five years, [outlined **detailed
security procedures** for the protection of NATO classified
information]{.underline}. This became Enclosure \"C\" of
C-M(55)15(Final). A third component, adopted for the first time in 1955,
had a broader reach. It outlined \"basic principles and minimum
standards\" that were to govern the overall design of national security
systems. This affected the handling of all sensitive information,
whether produced by NATO or not. This became Enclosure \"B\" of CM(
55)15(Final) (See Table 2).

\[TABLE 2 OMITTED\]

A document which compiled these three components was approved by the
North Atlantic Council in March 1955, and given the designation
C-M(55)15(Final). The SOI policy was substantially revised in later
years, although it retained this designation. Enclosure \"D,\" providing
guidance on information given to defense contractors, was added in 1958.
A Confidential Supplement was added in 1961 that provided additional
guidance on methods of personnel screening. Enclosure \"E,\" which
addressed anti-terrorism efforts, was added in the early 1980s, and
apparently revised in early 2002.

The [strictness of NATO\'s SOI policy may be illustrated by its
treatment of the policy itself]{.underline}. The fact that NATO had
adopted a SOI agreement was not acknowledged in the final communiqué of
the January 1950 meeting of the Council.13 Although C-M(55)15(Final) was
for many years an unclassified document, [NATO refused for decades to
make it publicly available]{.underline}.14 A narrow glimpse of NATO
policy may have been provided in 1998, when a revised version of the
Security Agreement (which apparently still constitutes Enclosure A of
the policy) was made publicly available by some NATO member states.15
Versions of C-M(55)15(Final) adopted before 1964 have also been made
available in the NATO Archives.

Nevertheless, the complete and current version of C-M(55)15(Final)
always remained inaccessible. [The policy reminded national governments
that **doc**ument**s**]{.underline} such as CM( 55)15(Final) [**are the
property of NATO**, and may not be given to any other individual or
organization without NATO\'s consent]{.underline}. As a consequence,
several governments recently refused requests made under national right
to information laws for copies of the policy.16 NATO\'s Security Office,
responding to one of these requests, explained in February 2002 that

NATO unclassified information . . . can only be used for official
purposes. Only individuals, bodies or organizations that require it for
official NATO purposes may have access to it . . . NATO information
marked in this manner is subject to release via agreement from its
originators and subject to recognized storage procedures for its
protection.17

NATO began an overhaul of C-M(55)15(Final) in the late 1990s. The
review, guided by an Ad-Hoc Working Group for the Fundamental Review for
NATO Security Policy, was completed in early 2002. A revised SOI policy,
now known as C-M(2002)49, was adopted by NATO on June 17, 2002. The
Working Group completed its work in secrecy, and the new policy remains
inaccessible to the public18, although its broad outlines may be
reconstructed from other sources (Table 2).

NATO\'s reticence means that an assessment of its SOI policy must be
largely speculative. Nevertheless it is possible to describe the policy
in broad terms, drawing on NATO\'s archival documents19 and other
sources, such as the language of the CEE\'s new state secrecy laws.

Another of these sources is the SOI policy of a related collective
security pact, the Western European Union (WEU). Established by the
Brussels Treaty of March 1948, the WEU actually served as the foundation
for the broader alliance established by the North Atlantic Treaty in
April 1949.20 There is good reason to believe that the two pacts
maintained comparable security policies. Policymakers within NATO
acknowledged that the first drafts of its security policy were based on
the WEU\'s policy.21 All ten of the nations that are currently members
of WEU are also members of NATO; in addition, there is a NATO-WEU SOI
agreement, signed in 1992. An early version of NATO policy recognized
that NATO and WEU materials might be \"co-mingled\" in the same
administrative processes.22

Fortunately, the WEU\'s security policy is publicly accessible. The
government of Sweden signed the WEU security agreement, and became
responsible for complying with its security regulations, as a
precondition for entering into cooperation on certain issues with the
WEU in 1992. The Swedish government released the WEU security agreement
and the 1996 version of the WEU security regulations in February 2002 in
response to a request under Sweden\'s Freedom of the Press Act.23

Another view of NATO policy may be provided by bilateral agreements that
are publicly accessible. The Council of the European Union recently
released correspondence in 2001 between its Secretary General, Javier
Solana, and NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson, which outlined an
interim security agreement that serves as a foundation for closer
cooperation between the two organizations.24 The Council of the European
Union subsequently adopted security regulations that must be presumed to
conform to NATO requirements.25

From all this, what can be said about [NATO\'s [SOI
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}? That it has five basic features, each of
which has been adopted with the aim of ensuring a high level of security
for information. The cumulative effect of the rules is to [[put]{.mark}
an [**extraordinary emphasis** on control of
**info**]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.

Breadth. The first of these elements might be called the principle of
breadth, although this term is not used in NATO documents. It implies
that the rules that a member state adopts regarding security of
information should govern all kinds of sensitive information, in all
parts of government. It eschews narrower approaches, perhaps limited to
information received through NATO, or information held within military
or intelligence institutions. Laws adopted by several CEE countries have
this comprehensive quality. The principle is expressed in the 1964
edition of C-M(55)15(Final), which articulates standards for information
security that apply to all sectors of government, on the grounds that
member states must be assured that each country gives \"a common
standard of protection . . . to the secrets in which all have a common
interest.\"26

Depth. The next principle underpinning NATO policy is that of depth of
coverage, although again the rule is not expressed in this way in NATO
documents. The policy errs on the side of caution when determining what
information should be covered by an SOI policy. This is evident in the
NATO classification policy, whose lowest category, RESTRICTED, applies
to information whose relevance to security is negligible. Information
may be classified at this level if its disclosure would be \"undesirable
to the interest of NATO.\"27 Several CEE countries have adopted equally
broad classifications for the whole of government. Under Czech law, for
example, information is classified as RESTRICTED if disclosure would be
unfavorable to the Republic;28 in Slovenia, information is RESTRICTED if
disclosure could harm the activity or performance of tasks of an
agency.29

Centralization. A third principle of NATO policy is that of
centralization. This has a national and intergovernmental aspect. At the
national level, [centralization of responsibility and strong
coordination are regarded as \"the foundations of sound national
security]{.underline}.\"30 [Member [states]{.mark}]{.underline} are
expected to [[establish a]{.mark} \"national security
organization]{.underline}\" (**[[NSO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) that is
[[responsible for]{.mark} the [security of NATO **info**]{.mark}rmation
and screening of personnel]{.underline}; for \"the collection and
recording of intelligence regarding espionage, sabotage and
subversion\"; and for advice to government on threats to security and
appropriate responses.31 Presumably the NSO is also responsible for
leading the \"high-level\" system of inter-departmental coordination
that is required to ensure tight integration of departmental policies
and procedures.32 The NSO must also have the authority needed to conduct
inspections of security arrangements for the protection of NATO
information within other departments and agencies, and to investigate
and respond to breaches of security.33

[This structure is roughly replicated at the intergovernmental
level]{.underline}. In 1955 the North Atlantic Council gave its Security
Bureau the responsibility for \"overall coordination\" of security in
NATO. The Bureau, now renamed as the NATO Office of Security, advises
national authorities on the application of principles and standards, and
carries out surveillance of national systems to ensure that NATO
information is adequately protected.34 National authorities have an
obligation to report possible breaches of security to the NATO office,
which in turn must \"coordinate with national authorities\" in
investigations.35

Controlled distribution. The [NATO security [policy
invokes]{.mark}]{.underline} two rules that are intended to strictly
control the distribution of information. The first of these is \"[[the
**NEED TO KNOW principle**]{.underline}]{.mark}\": that [individuals
should have access to classified information only when they need the
information for their work]{.underline}, and access should never be
authorized \"merely because a person occupies a particular position,
however senior.\"36 This is regarded as a \"fundamental principle\" of
security. [[Judgments about]{.mark} whether an individual has a \"[need
to know\" are made by the originator]{.mark} of the
document]{.underline}, or by one of the addressees identified by the
originator.37

The second rule that restricts the distribution of information might be
called [the principle of **originator control**]{.underline}. The
principle [acknowledges the right of [member
states]{.mark}]{.underline}, and NATO itself, [to [set **firm limits
on**]{.mark} **the [distribution of info]{.mark}rmation**]{.underline}
that is [circulated among member states]{.underline}. The principle was
central to the agreement signed by NATO members in January 1950, which
stipulated that:

The parties to the North Atlantic Treaty . . . will make every effort to
ensure that they will maintain the security classifications established
by any party with respect to the information of that party\'s origin;
will safeguard accordingly such information; . . . and will not disclose
such information to another nation without the consent of the
originator.38

The principle of originator control trumps the \"need-to-know\"
principle, since originators may impose a high level of classification
that restricts the number of individuals to whom the document might be
referred by an addressee. [Nor may a document be downgraded or
declassified without the consent of its originator]{.underline}.39 [The
principle is **even stricter** with regard to [distribution]{.mark} of
documents [outside]{.mark} the community of [NATO]{.mark}
governments]{.underline}. In this case, [distribution [is **absolutely
prohibited**]{.mark} without consent]{.underline}, even if the
information is graded as UNCLASSIFIED. In these circumstances, the
information is regarded as \"the property of the originator,\" which
retains absolute control over its distribution.40

Personnel controls. The fifth and final element of the NATO security
policy comprises strict rules regarding the selection of individuals who
are entitled to view classified information. The precise requirements
for [personnel screening]{.underline} are not easy to discern. Some of
the exact criteria adopted during the Cold War are probably no longer
applicable; and some of the criteria used in NATO\'s early years were
still withheld in late 2002.41

The policy [relies on]{.underline} a system of \"[positive
vetting]{.underline},\" in which [[individuals who handle]{.mark}
sensitive [info]{.mark}rmation are subjected to active background
investigation before receiving clearance]{.underline}.42 NATO\'s early
policy made clear that decisions could be based on assessments of
character and lifestyle, and that the evidentiary threshold for denying
clearances was low. [Individuals]{.underline} were expected to
[[demonstrate \"**unquestioned loyalty**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[and\]
such character, habits, associates and discretion as to cast no doubt
upon their trustworthiness.\"43

Evidence that these rigorous standards are still applied can be found in
CEE countries. Slovakia\'s new security agency recently stated that it
will review political and religious affiliations, as well as
lifestyles---including extramarital affairs---that are thought to create
a danger of blackmail.44 The Associated Press reported that Romania
intends to deny clearances to security staff with \"anti-western
attitudes.\"45 A constitutional challenge to Poland\'s Classified
Information Act by Polish judges was also motivated by their concern
about intrusive investigations to determine whether their lifestyles
could make them \"susceptible to . . . pressure.\"46

[Other controls are imposed to control personnel after a clearance has
been provided]{.underline}. The 1964 edition of C-M(55)15(Final)
stipulated that supervisors had a duty \"of recording and reporting any
incidents, associations or habits likely to have a bearing on
security.\" Evidence that created a \"reasonable doubt\" about loyalty
or trustworthiness required the removal of a security clearance.47
Finally, there was an expectation that \"disciplinary action\" would be
taken against individuals who are responsible for the unauthorized
disclosure of information.48 Additionally, as demonstrated later in this
article, there appeared to be an expectation that [member
states]{.underline} would [establish clear criminal penalties for
unauthorized disclosure]{.underline}.

#### US lead over cybersecurity in NATO [fosters]{.underline} alliance cohesion -- bolsters mutual defense against an array of threats

Raimundas **Karoblis '19**, Lithuania's national defense minister,
"Lithuania's defense minister: Wavering US commitments? Think again.",
DefenseNews, 12/2/19,

Lately, **[Europe has been positively spurred to action by the
relentlessness of the U.S]{.underline}**. [The continent is clearly on a
positive trajectory as evidenced by the growing defense budgets and the
sheer amount of newly launched defense initiatives]{.underline}. It is
essential that this increased attention to security and defense in
Europe maintains a clear focus on capability building and compatibility
with NATO. Lithuania itself is making great strides in strengthening its
defense. Thanks to the public support and determined political
leadership, a historic sprint in defense spending to reach 2 percent of
gross domestic product has been achieved, making a truly powerful impact
on the ground. We are undergoing a major breakthrough in modernizing our
Armed Forces and in rapidly enhancing military infrastructure. Less
visibly but no less importantly, Lithuania is improving resilience of
the society as well as developing cutting-edge cyber capabilities, which
has already placed Lithuania among the top five in the world in the
field of cybersecurity. **[U.S. support and cooperation have been a
critical ingredient in almost all of our recent
successes]{.underline}**. [Defense capability development is benefiting
immensely from the synergy created by the U.S. security cooperation
programs complementing]{.underline} Lithuania's [national
efforts]{.underline}. Each dollar that the U.S. invests in supporting
the Lithuanian military is matched several times over by Lithuania's
acquisitions of U.S. defense articles. Most recently, Lithuania has
signed a long-term contract to purchase at least 200 Oshkosh Joint Light
Tactical Vehicles, and commenced talks to acquire a fleet of Black Hawk
helicopters that would replace our last remaining military platform from
the Soviet era. **[Bilateral cooperation with the United States has also
led to the launch of the Regional Cyber Security Center. It will focus
on research and development of next-generation cyber capabilities,
training with partners and allies, as well as conducting analysis on
cyberthreats.]{.underline}** Speaking of challenges ahead, air defense
will remain a key vulnerability in the Baltic region for the foreseeable
future. [Our national investments in this area can only provide limited
response to the potential threat stemming from Russia**. Solutions,
therefore, will have to come through NATO and through bilateral
cooperation with the United States**]{.underline}. Conceptual work has
already started within the alliance, while recent U.S. exercises
involving deployment of the Patriot missiles and F-35 aircraft indicate
the way ahead to address this complex, yet highly important issue. We
also noted that the U.S. Congress has proposed \$400 million worth of
support to boost air defense of the three Baltic states in its latest
appropriations bill. If endorsed, it could signal a major step toward
solving this conundrum and would help to patch a substantial hole in
NATO's capabilities. **[All these important developments seem to tell
one simple story: The trans-Atlantic bond, which held the alliance
strong and secure for the past 70 years, is still very much alive, while
the U.S. commitment to European defense remains as strong as
ever.]{.underline}**

### OCOs Solve\-\--Deterrence\-\--2AC

#### Deterrence in cyberspace is [possible]{.underline} and [sufficient]{.underline} to avoid conflict, but NATO having [offensive]{.underline} capabilities is necessary to prevent Russian malfeasance

**Maldre 16** -- Patrik Maldre, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for
European Policy Analysis, "Moving Toward NATO Deterrence for the Cyber
Domain," May 2016, https://cepa.ecms.pl/files/?id_plik=2446

[Cyber deterrence]{.underline} clearly [warrants more discussion among
NATO members than ever]{.underline}, given the threats they now
face---particularly from the East. Yet the Cyber Defence Committee
doesn't really cover it, nor will a full-fledged cyber deterrence
concept be announced at the upcoming NATO summit in Warsaw. The main
debate in Brussels and in national capitals centers on whether
cyberspace should even be considered a domain of warfare, as many member
states have already decide; the fuzzy concept of active cyber defense is
only tentatively mentioned. [However, senior NATO leaders have espoused
deterrence as a potential future direction for the
alliance]{.underline}. Importantly, several member states, including the
United States, Britain and Estonia, are also publicly exploring such a
strategy.20 The moment is not yet right for an alliance-wide declaration
on this topic, but with concerted effort at all levels, NATO can and
should continue to move toward deterrence for the cyber domain.

Deterrence aims to discourage an adversary from taking offensive action.
Traditionally, its two pillars have been deterrence-by-denial and
deterrence-by-punishment. The first refers to measures that reduce or
eliminate the benefits of a certain aggressive move, while the second
seeks to impose additional costs for performing it. [[NATO's]{.mark}
traditional [mandate of defending its]{.mark} own [systems fits]{.mark}
comfortably [into]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[deterrence-by-denial]{.underline}]{.mark}** part of this framework.
Deterrence-by-punishment, however, is far more controversial because of
the problem of attribution---which refers to the difficulty of
identifying the perpetrators of operations. Finally, both concepts also
rely on intent, capability and credibility. As it stands, a palpable
lack of trust among member states hinders collective action on both
fronts. Progress in the denial category will be easier and more visible,
but countermeasures should be considered as well.

[NATO has come a long way in terms of working together to shore up
technical defenses in cyberspace]{.underline}. The main barrier to
further cooperation, however, is the difference in technical and
administrative capacities as well as human and financial resources among
member states. This, along with differing national views, remains the
main barrier to further integration. The alliance is only as strong as
its weakest member. When it comes to deterrence-by-denial, therefore,
all member states must have the basics in place: computer security laws,
national cyber strategies, a police focus on cybercrime, national CERTs,
public-private partnerships and capable intelligence agencies. From
there, members should enact effective, actionable information-sharing
programs. After that, the next step is to develop joint situational
awareness. Typically, adversary espionage campaigns target multiple NATO
and memberstate organizations simultaneously. Early warning and shared
situational awareness can prevent multiple entities in different
countries from being breached by the same operation. The end goal for
the denial part of the deterrence strategy is, of course, resilience. If
NATO and its members can effectively work together to prevent, detect,
respond and recover from cyber attacks, this would significantly
decrease the benefits and increase the costs for an adversary. NATO
collective action should continue in this direction, and joint efforts
can help to promote trust and confidence---a key ingredient in further
cooperation in deterrence-by-denial, but even more crucial when it comes
to deterrence-by-punishment.

Preventing adversaries from benefitting from offensive actions, or at
least limiting their gains, can help discourage them from conducting
such attacks in the first place. Punishing them after the fact is
another. While the term has an aggressive connotation, this part of the
strategy is defensive and retaliatory in nature. It can refer to a broad
spectrum of actions---from naming-and-shaming to nuclear strikes. In the
cyber domain, the problem of attribution hinders the goal of effective
deterrence. For this reason, [[NATO]{.mark} and its member states
[should]{.mark} invest heavily [in]{.mark} the **[technological and
analytical capabilities]{.mark}** necessary [to discern signs of
a]{.mark} particular [adversary]{.mark}, including in cooperation with
the private sector]{.underline}.

[[As]{.mark} numerous [cases of attribution to Russia]{.mark}n cyber
threat actors [demonstrate, this is **already taking
place**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, member states should
complement technical attribution with political and diplomatic
attribution. Currently, months and even years pass before politicians
and leaders feel comfortable about ascribing blame. For deterrence to
work, however, governments must carry out both high-level and private
attribution in conjunction with media and private companies as soon as
they have conclusive evidence. Calling out threat actors and their state
sponsors in diplomatic forums, public discussions and private meetings
can motivate them to conduct less aggressive operations.

[[NATO]{.mark} and its member states [should]{.mark} also [adopt joint
approaches to]{.mark} developing and **employing [offensive
capabilitie]{.mark}s for collective defense purposes**]{.underline}.
Laudably, [many individual allies]{.underline} have already declared
that they [possess such capabilities]{.underline} and the doctrines for
using them. However, considerable mistrust persists among the allies,
creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and doubt---which weakens
deterrence as a whole. To overcome this hurdle, [allies can begin by
making political statements about potentially **using these capabilities
in case of attack**]{.underline}, and in accordance with international
law as part of a collective defense response. Ultimately, [[NATO should
move toward **sharing these capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, perhaps
by using existing models based on nuclear doctrine. [Transparency and
[straightforwardness]{.mark} in this arena [could]{.mark} contribute
substantively to **[deter]{.mark}ring
[adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline} and reinforce collective defense
among NATO members.

[Intent and credibility will play into adversaries' calculations for any
type of countermeasure]{.underline}. For this reason, policy innovations
and capability development need to be complemented by effective
strategic communication. You cannot achieve deterrence if your adversary
doubts that you'll do what you say--- and even less so if it doesn't
think you can do what you say. From this perspective, demonstrations
such as the Aurora test in 2007 can be quite useful.21 Other, more
subtle means include presentations by top officials at security
conferences. Operations against third-party adversaries other than the
intended target of deterrence can also deter attacks; few doubt that
**[[Russia paid close attention to]{.mark} the [Stuxnet]{.mark}
case]{.underline}**, or that NATO drew conclusions from the Ukraine grid
attack. In sum, effective strategic communication--- both public and
private---can be a key component or complement of a
deterrence-by-punishment strategy.

#### The US is [more]{.underline} than prepared to engage in long-term intel battles with OCOs -- key to deterring large-scale cyberattacks and no risk of escalation

Joshua **Rovner '20**, is associate professor in the School of
International Service at American University, "The Intelligence Contest
in Cyberspace", Lawfare, 3/16/20,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/intelligence-contest-cyberspace

[Deterrence is different]{.underline}. It is difficult to deter states
from activities below the line of armed conflict because retaliatory
threats inherently lack credibility. [No one is likely to believe that
states will use violence to stop espionage]{.underline}, for instance,
[which probably explains why small states have spied on large ones for
centuries]{.underline}. More importantly, **[victims are surprisingly
tolerant of cyber operations]{.underline}**. Research suggests that
**[individuals are less willing to retaliate against cyber blows than
physical violence]{.underline}**. If this is correct, then strategies
based on punishment are likely to fail. Deterrence by denial is also
likely to disappoint, because the barriers to entry for espionage and
harassment are relatively low. States will continue to conduct cyber
intrusions even if previous efforts were unsuccessful. There are
important exceptions to this rule. **[Deterring major attacks against
critical infrastructure is possible]{.underline}**, for instance,
**[because these attacks threaten significant harm to
civilians]{.underline}**. **[Deterring this kind of cyberspace operation
makes sense because anyone considering such an attack would risk a
ferocious response]{.underline}**. Executing large-scale attacks on
infrastructure probably also requires a lot of time, money and
organization. **[Adversaries would surely think twice about that
investment, especially if the United States issues clear deterrent
threats]{.underline}**. But deterrence is mostly irrelevant in
cyberspace, because most activities fall well short of threats to
infrastructure. Understanding the present problem in terms of deterrence
theory is not particularly helpful. At best[, a well-fought intelligence
contest can slowly convince adversaries that certain targets and methods
are beyond the pale]{.underline}. During the Cold War, Soviet and U.S.
intelligence professionals came to observe some rules of the game.
Aggressive counterintelligence methods were expected, for example, but
not against family members. Neither side could deter intelligence
efforts, but they could structure the contest in order to reduce the
risk. What does the future hold for the intelligence contest in
cyberspace? **[The good news is that the United States is exceptionally
well positioned to compete]{.underline}**. [It possesses extraordinary
technical and human resources, in both the public and private
sectors]{.underline}. **[Its intelligence agencies are the largest and
richest in the world]{.underline}**. [It also benefits from decades of
experience competing against capable rivals. This is not the first time
the U.S. intelligence community has dealt with committed and
occasionally ruthless intelligence foes]{.underline}.

### OCOs Solve\-\--Deterrence\-\--1AR

From the U.S. standpoint, [[the **optimal outcome** is a

**cyberspace**]{.mark} along with a more **stable
cyberspace**]{.underline}. Indeed, from the U.S. standpoint, [the former
will lead to the latter. A more stable cyberspace will involve **norms**
of **acceptable behavior**, **less conflict** and so on]{.underline}.

[[One path towards this]{.underline}]{.mark} rosy [outcome [is that the

**significant [friction]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and makes
it]{.underline} **[hard]{.underline}** [for adversaries to

[**[advantage]{.underline}** [from the beginning]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Offensive capabilities allow iterative training that increases coordination

**Lewis 15** -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of
the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, "The Role of Offensive Cyber Operations in NATO's
Collective Defence," 2015,
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf

It could be argued, given NATO's defensive orientation ( pace Russian
fears of diabolic plots), that a purely defensive and technical focus
for cyber operations is appropriate. [[The
question]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is whether NATO can field a
credible]{.mark} military [force]{.mark} without some **public linkage
to [an offensive cyber capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Here again, the nuclear precedent offers some suggestions for a way
forward. In the NATO phonetic alphabet, "whiskey" ("W") and "romeo"
("R") were used by NATO's command structure in conflict to "warn"
capitals that with a deteriorating situation on the ground it would be
sending a request to release nuclear weapons for NATO use. Romeo was the
actual request for release of nuclear weapons to NATO control. This
terminology prepared nuclear capitals to make the decision on release.

Just as nuclear weapons remain under national control but senior NATO
commanders can request their release, [[the US and UK could
retain]{.mark} control of [offensive]{.mark} cyber [capabilities
but]{.mark} be prepared to **[make them available to NATO]{.mark}
commanders** upon request]{.underline}. In practice, [[national teams
could be assigned to]{.mark} support [NATO commanders]{.mark} in theatre
or could carry out some operations against targets selected by NATO
commanders]{.underline} form their national duty station.

[[Such]{.mark} an arrangement]{.underline} needs more than ad hoc
coordination. It [[requires an identified structure]{.mark} for request
and release [that is regularly practised]{.mark}]{.underline}. It
demands offensive cyber operations used for defence purposes to be
included in planning and exercises. It would also be beneficial for
NATO's defence mission if the exercise of systems for the use of
offensive cyber capabilities in support of defensive operations was made
public.

[Cyber operations necessitate advance planning and
practice]{.underline}, particularly for multinational operations that
are already inherently complex in their coordination and de-confliction
requirements. Offensive cyber operations create conflicts between goals
and missions for the use of cyber techniques. The fundamental decision
is whether to collect intelligence or to engage in military operations.
This creates an immediate problem for NATO, because decisions on
intelligence collection will be taken at the national level whereas
military operations are in the purview of the NATO military command
structure. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} consideration would necessarily
be part of the decision process in national capitals, which
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[be an **iterative process** to
allow]{.mark} for additional [input]{.mark} from the theatre of
operations]{.underline}.

### OCOs Solve\-\--Warfighting\-\--2AC

#### Out-of-network OCOs are the [foundation]{.underline} of US intel gathering 

Joshua **Rovner '20**, is associate professor in the School of
International Service at American University, "The Intelligence Contest
in Cyberspace", Lawfare, 3/16/20,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/intelligence-contest-cyberspace

[The ongoing competition in cyberspace is largely an intelligence
contest]{.underline}. [Although the tech]{.underline}nology [is
different, the underlying contest exhibits all the characteristics of
traditional spy-versus-spy battles]{.underline}. [An intelligence
contest is an effort to steal secrets and exploit them for relative
advantage]{.underline}. Great powers today are using cyberspace with
vigor, seeking to steal communications in transit and data at rest.
[China's effort to steal intellectual property via cyberspace was
famously described as the "most significant transfer of wealth in
history."]{.underline} China has attempted to exploit this effort to
improve its military capabilities, with mixed results. [Russia has also
become more active in cyberspace espionage, targeting the United States
and its partners abroad]{.underline}. [Intelligence contests also
include sabotage]{.underline}. [All bureaucracies suffer from some
amount of friction: the inevitable daily hiccups that slow down
operations and make organizations less efficient]{.underline}.
**[Sabotage in cyberspace weaponizes friction to undermine rival
capabilities and morale]{.underline}**. **[Offensive cyberspace
operations are well suited for this task because they offer a range of
tools for the saboteur]{.underline}**. [States can opt for cheap and
easy harassment campaigns like denial of service attacks, or they can
engineer sophisticated operations against specific
facilities]{.underline}. In either case, the benefits to the saboteur
are both practical and psychological. Practical results include harm to
networks, data, and infrastructure, all of which forces the target to
spend time and money on recovery. Psychological results are equally
important. [It may not be necessary to cause physical damage if
personnel in target organizations fall victim to frustration and finger
pointing]{.underline}. [Finally, intelligence contests involve efforts
to pre-position espionage assets that may be useful in war]{.underline}.
[Military organizations increasingly rely on cyberspace for organizing
and directing conventional campaigns]{.underline}. Intelligence agencies
have an obvious interest in monitoring their efforts. **[Gaining access
to adversary networks makes it possible to reduce the fog of war in the
case of a conflict]{.underline}**. [It also suggests the ability to
confuse enemies by inhibiting their communications or flooding the zone
with disinformation]{.underline}.

#### Sustained, preemptive offense against the [initial cyber threat]{.underline} is necessary against armed attack and armed force.

\"What are Military Cyberspace Operations Other Than War?"
https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2019/06/Art_10_What-Are-Military-Cyberspace-OperationsOther-Than-War.pdf\]

In recent testimony before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee,
Michael Sulmeyer proposed "[two [necessary conditions]{.mark} of
posture" [for]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. military [[cyber]{.mark} mission
[forces]{.mark}]{.underline} to be better prepared to defend the U.S.
against foreign attempts to interfere with elections. First,
"[[Our]{.mark} cyber [mission]{.mark} forces [should be **constantly
conducting reconnaissance**]{.mark}]{.underline} missions abroad [[to
discover]{.mark} election-related [threats]{.mark} to the **U**nited
**S**tates [and **provide indicators**]{.mark} and warnings [to]{.mark}
our [forces]{.mark} and **decision-makers**]{.underline}." Second,
"[[Our cyber mission]{.mark} forces [must be]{.mark} sufficiently
**[ready to strike]{.mark}** against **targets abroad**
identified]{.underline} by reconnaissance as threats to our election"
(Sulmeyer, 2018).

Although Sulmeyer's proposal was in the specific context of reactions to
Russian meddling in U.S. elections in 2016, [[at a]{.mark} more [general
level these]{.mark} two [conditions apply to **any**]{.mark}
**application** of military [OCO]{.mark} capabilities: first, [they
are]{.mark} **highly [dependent]{.mark}** [upon **sustained
reconnaissance** of]{.mark} **potential [adversaries]{.mark}** and their
[**systems**; and]{.mark} second, [they **need to be maintained**
at]{.mark} a **[high]{.mark} level** of **[readiness]{.mark}** because
[there may]{.mark} be [little or no warning before they need to be
engaged. If a nation intends to use **o**]{.mark}ffensive
**[c]{.mark}**yberspace **[c]{.mark}**apabilities [to **precede** or
**pre-empt**]{.mark} kinetic operations, then **[operational
prep]{.mark}aration** of the cyber battlefield [must become **"as
routine as recon**]{.mark}**naissance** or surveillance [of]{.mark}
potential [adversary activity]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Kehler, Lin &
Sulmeyer, 2017). [[What does]{.mark} "operational [preparation]{.mark}
of the cyber battlefield" [involve?]{.mark}]{.underline} Robert Chesney
spells it out clearly in his analysis of the 2018 DOD Cyber Strategy:
"[[**Intrusions** into]{.mark} the systems of **potential
[adversaries]{.mark}** in order [to **secure access**]{.mark} of a kind
[that can]{.mark} be [**exploited** for]{.mark} **disruptive** or
[**destructive** effect **if and when**]{.mark} the **[need]{.mark}**
later **[arises]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Chesney, 2018).

#### Offensive capabilities are necessary to adapt to changing adversary capabilities -- the aff just establishes a cyber [Maginot Line]{.underline} that is begging to be pushed back

**Lewis 15** -- James A. Lewis, senior vice president and director of
the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and

https://ccdcoe.org/uploads/2018/10/TP_08_2015_0.pdf

[The nature of [warfare is changing]{.mark}]{.underline} as opponents
seek to circumvent Western military power by using a blend of political
action, special forces, proxies and irregular units, unconventional
tactics and cyber techniques to find a different way of applying force
to gain their ends. [What Russia sometimes call "[hybrid warfare" will
challenge NATO]{.mark} defence [planning. A **cyber defensive
orientation**]{.mark} is]{.underline}, however, [the equivalent of a
static defence, defending fixed positions rather than manoeuvring, and
**[conced]{.mark}ing [initiative to opponents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The next public iteration of NATO cyber [policy]{.underline} [should
describe how [NATO members with **offensive cyber capabilities**
would]{.mark}]{.underline} retain national control, but [[make
these]{.mark} capabilities [available to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the event of aggression. [NATO should be more explicit in how offensive
cyber operations fit into its defensive and deterrent
strategy.]{.underline} Finally, it needs to identify and describe a
regular coordinating process to be established (similar to the Nuclear
Planning Group) in NATO's Cyber Defence Committee (CDC).

NATO would never refrain from using fighter aircraft because they can
serve offensive purposes, and say it would rely solely on air defence
missiles and damage control to deal with the threat of air attack. Nor
would NATO renounce armoured vehicles and rely only on static defence.
[[A defensive approach]{.mark} that forsakes the possibility of
offensive action [is]{.mark} essentially [a **cyber Maginot Line**.
This]{.mark}]{.underline} defensive orientation [[serves no
on]{.mark}e's interest [except]{.mark} that [of our
**opponents**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Offensive cyber operations are
similarly a part of warfare that advanced militaries cannot ignore. The
mechanisms for incorporating offensive cyber into NATO will be
complicated by national sensitivities, and public presentation will need
to be carefully crafted to reinforce a deterrent message; but [the next
step]{.underline}, however politically difficult, for NATO
transformation [is to publicly embrace offensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline} in planning and exercises.

Warfare is evolving as technological and political developments change
the requirements for effective operations. [[Military innovations create
a new dynamic for]{.mark} calculating [risk]{.mark} among potential
adversaries]{.underline}. Forces and concepts that once seemed adequate
for stability are called into question. It will be neither easy nor
quick for NATO to discuss publicly the role of offensive cyber
operations, but it is ultimately unavoidable.

[[Some]{.mark} have [argue]{.mark}d]{.underline} that
[**[military]{.mark} operations** in **[cyber]{.mark}space** outside the
context of **armed conflict** [should be **limited** to]{.mark} the
[protection]{.mark} of military networks and information
systems]{.underline}. Miriam Dunn Cavelty has flatly stated that
"Militaries cannot defend the cyberspace of their country -- it is no
space where troops and tanks can be deployed because the logic of
national boundaries does not apply" (Dunn Cavelty, 2012). Stephen J.
Anderson agrees, writing that traditional concepts of national defense
cannot be applied in cyberspace: "The US Navy defends the littoral
territorial boundaries; air defenses, either through missile defense
initiatives or alert aircraft, define airspace boundaries. Those lines
are not readily identifiable in cyberspace" (Anderson, 2016). Some go
even further, arguing that an active military role in peacetime cyber
security undermines investment in alternative mechanisms. In a 2013 post
for the Lowy Institute, Ian Wallace wrote that such efforts
disincentivized "other longer-term and more sustainable efforts to
address the new challenges that cyber brings to security systems"
(Wallace, 2013).

[Yet this debate has **evolved** significantly]{.underline} in recent
years, [in large part thanks to increasing evidence of **state-sponsored
attacks** on civilian cyberspace infrastructure]{.underline}. In a
recent paper entitled Rethinking Cyber Security, James Lewis has stated
that "[[The primary]{.mark} source of **[risk]{.mark}** in
**cybersecurity** [comes from]{.mark} conflict between
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Lewis, 2018). This assessment is echoed
by the Netherlands' National Cyber Security Centrum, which concluded in
its 2018 assessment that "[The most **significant threats** are
[**sabotage** and **disruption**]{.mark} by nation-states]{.underline}"
(National Cyber Security Centrum, 2018). [As consensus on the state
actor threat in cyberspace has grown, so have calls for the military to
take a more active role]{.underline} in the defense of cyberspace.

In the 2017 U.S. Senate deliberations on increasing the Secretary of
Defense's authority to conduct clandestine military cyberspace
operations, Senator John McCain asserted that the need for a strong
military role in peacetime was self-explanatory: "It's the Department of
Defense's job to defend this nation: that's why it's called the
Department of Defense" (Pomerleau, 2017). This [[more **active**]{.mark}
**role**]{.underline}--- [sometimes referred to as **[defending
forward]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[is reflected in recent updates to
military cyber strategies]{.underline}. The 2018 U.S. Defense Department
Cyber Strategy, for example, states explicitly: "[We are engaged
[in]{.mark} a long-term [**strategic competition** with **China** and
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}" and declares that [this [requires (and
justifies)]{.mark} "action in [cyber]{.mark}space [during **day-to-day
competition** to preserve]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S. [**[military]{.mark}
advantages** and to defend]{.underline} U.S.
[[interests]{.underline}]{.mark}" (U.S. Department of Defense, 2018).
Similarly, the Netherlands' Defence Cyber Strategy 2018, subtitled
Investing in cyber striking power for the Netherlands, concludes that
[the current security environment demonstrates that "a [more active
contribution]{.mark} from Defence within the existing structures [is
required]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Netherlands Ministry of Defence, 2018).
Jan Kallberg and Thomas S. Cook have gone even further, stating that
[[nations should]{.mark} be prepared not only to [use **military
cybers**]{.mark}**pace [forces]{.mark}** [in **peacetime**]{.mark} but
to **actively** foster these capabilities as an alternative to armed
conflict: ["Cyber is]{.mark} no longer a mere enabler of joint
operations, but instead [a **viable strategic option** for **confronting
adversarial societies**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Kallberg & Cook, 2017).

#### Balance of tech favors offensively disarming adversaries.

27\. [[Although]{.mark} **cyber security** and [**defence capabilities**
continue to **improve**]{.mark}, most **[experts]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[argue]{.mark} that the **[offence has the
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in cyber space [and]{.mark} that [this
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[unlikely to change]{.underline}**]{.mark}
soon. [Given sufficient **time**, **skills**, and **resources**,
attackers could **easily** perpetrate]{.underline} [a cyber attack,
finding the targeted system's vulnerabilities, gaining access, and
delivering their payload. This is a]{.underline} **[key
reason]{.underline}** [why [the Alliance must complement dissuasion
with]{.mark} strategies of **[deterrence by
punishment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In other words, [they must]{.mark}
try "to **[prevent an attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}
**[threatening]{.underline}** [unacceptable damage
so]{.underline}]{.mark} [that in the attacker's cost-benefit
calculations [the **best choice** is **not to
attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Morgan, 2009; italicised in original).
It should be noted some experts would argue that the offence is not as
dominant. For example, the more sophisticated cyber weapons are, the
more opportunities the defender has to stop an attacker and the more
errors the attacker is likely to make. Additionally, continued
organisational deficiencies could be a key reason why the attackers have
had the advantage thus far (Slayton, 2017).

### AT: Defense Solves/Resilience\-\--2AC

#### Playing [pure]{.underline} defense undermines cybersecurity -- only [offensive]{.underline} operations ensure safety of networks

Michael **Sulmeyer '18**, Former Director of the Cyber Security Project,
"How the U.S. Can Play Cyber-Offense", Harvard Kennedy School Belfer
Center, 3/22/18,
<https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/how-us-can-play-cyber-offense-0>
**\*edited for ableist language**

[The United States has been the victim of repeated cyberattacks by
foreign powers, and it seems to have little power to stop
them]{.underline}. During the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, [Russian
hackers broke into the Democratic National Committee's e-mail
server]{.underline}s and made more general efforts to influence the
election's outcome, as detailed in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's
indictment of 13 Russians and three Russian entities. In February, U.S.
intelligence and law enforcement officials warned that the Russian
government would again try to use cyber-operations to interfere with
midterm elections in November. That same month, the White House publicly
blamed Russia for "the most destructive and costly cyberattack in
history," [the 2017 NotPetya malware campaign]{.underline}, which
~~crippled~~ \[[undermined]{.underline}\] [the government of Ukraine
before spreading to multinational corporations such as FedEx and Maersk,
causing billions in damage]{.underline}. The Russians are not the only
ones hacking at the United States' expense. [Chinese hacking groups have
stolen U.S. intellectual property from industrial manufacturers and
military contractors]{.underline}. In 2015, China weaponized its "Great
Firewall" and conducted distributed denial of service attacks against
U.S. websites, including GitHub, which Beijing wished to punish for
hosting content that the Chinese leadership found undesirable. [In 2014,
North Korean hackers attacked the U.S. film studio Sony Pictures to
block the release of a movie]{.underline}, The Interview, that depicted
the attempted assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The
attack erased the content of thousands of computers, released
embarrassing internal e-mails, and intimidated Sony into canceling the
movie's theatrical release. [Iran too has lashed out in cyberspace,
attacking U.S. financial institutions and a dam in New York. **These
threats have led to renewed calls for cyber-deterrence measures that
would impose greater costs on would-be hackers while denying them
benefits**]{.underline}. The administration of President Donald Trump,
for instance, has elevated U.S. Cyber Command to a unified combatant
command, which it believes will signal greater capability and resolve.
Deterrence is also likely behind the Trump administration's broad
declaratory policy in its Nuclear Posture Review, which contemplates the
use of nuclear weapons to deter non-nuclear threats. Former President
Barack Obama prioritized cyber-deterrence as well, including in his
administration's 2015 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy and in his
Justice Department's efforts to indict Chinese and Iranian hackers.
**[In cyberwarfare, Washington should recognize that the best defense is
a good offense. This focus on cyber-deterrence is understandable but
misplaced]{.underline}**. Deterrence aims to change the calculations of
adversaries by persuading them that the risks of an attack outweigh the
rewards or that they will be denied the benefits they seek. **[But in
seeking merely to deter enemies, the United States finds itself
constantly on the back foot]{.underline}**. Instead, **[the United
States should be pursuing a more active cyberpolicy, one aimed not at
deterring enemies but at disrupting their capabilities]{.underline}**.
In cyberwarfare, Washington should recognize that the best defense is a
good offense. THE [PROBLEMS WITH DETERRENCE]{.underline} There are three
main problems with U.S. efforts at cyber-deterrence. [The first is that
Washington is trying to use a cold war strategy to address a
twenty-first-century problem]{.underline}. History teaches that
deterrence kept the Cold War cold: the United States and the Soviet
Union were each vulnerable to the other's thousands of nuclear weapons.
[When it comes to cyberspace, however, the United States has more to
lose than its adversaries because it has gone further in embracing
innovation and connectivity without security]{.underline}. **[But
although the societies and infrastructure of Washington's adversaries
are less connected and vulnerable than those of the United States, their
methods of hacking can still be disrupted]{.underline}**. [Second, it is
difficult to convince foreign leaders]{.underline} ([and]{.underline}
foreign [hackers]{.underline}) [that the costs of hacking really do
outweigh the benefits]{.underline}. Deterrence is all about perception:
does an actor believe that the threat of punishment is real enough to
prevent him from acting? This is as much a question of psychology as one
of national security strategy. [Many U.S. adversaries are less
vulnerable in cyberspace than the United States is, so meaningful
punishment would require discerning their priorities]{.underline} (for
instance, money or public reputation) [and threatening concerted action
against them. Yet gaining clarity about foreign leaders'
priorities]{.underline}---[and credibly threatening
them]{.underline}---[is easier said than done]{.underline}: during the
Cold War, Soviet leaders often misunderstood signals from their U.S.
counterparts, as when they interpreted the NATO military exercise Able
Archer 83 as a prelude to war. Not much has changed---National Security
Agency Director Admiral Michael Rogers acknowledged during a recent
hearing that the Russians "haven't paid a price . . . that's sufficient
to get them to change their behavior." [Third, it is virtually
impossible to know if deterrence is working. The goal is to prevent
attacks. But if no attacks occur, it is hard to determine
why]{.underline}---perhaps the would-be attacker was deterred by the
threat of punishment; perhaps the attack failed for some other reason.
Washington should not base its national cyberpolicy on a strategy whose
success, almost by definition, cannot be evaluated, especially if there
are good alternatives available. **[Today's fight in cyberspace occurs
in the gray zone between war and peace. If the United States hopes to
win, it should spend less time trying to persuade its competitors that
it is not worth hacking and more time preempting them and degrading
their ability to do so]{.underline}**. It is time to target
capabilities, not calculations. **[HACK THE HACKER]{.underline}** How
could the United States begin degrading its opponents' ability to hack?
[Washington's actions need not always be aggressive or
destructive]{.underline}. In [countries where technology companies are
willing to cooperate with the U.S. government]{.underline} (or with
requests from their own government), [a phone call to the right cloud
provider or]{.underline} Internet service provider ([ISP]{.underline})
[could result in getting bad actors kicked off the
Internet]{.underline}. **[This is not a permanent solution, but it will
force adversaries to rebuild, which often prompts unforced errors,
making them more vulnerable to U.S. surveillance and
disruption]{.underline}**. If subtle measures prove insufficient, **[the
United States should be ready to take more offensive
action]{.underline}**. **[In situations where the defense of the nation
is on the line, U.S. hackers could pursue a campaign of erasing
computers at scale, disabling accounts and credentials used by hackers
to attack, and cutting off access to services so it is harder to
compromise innocent systems to conduct their attacks]{.underline}**.
Such a campaign would aim to make every aspect of hacking much harder:
because hackers often reuse computers, accounts, and infrastructure,
targeting these would sabotage their capabilities or render them
otherwise useless. [Such actions need not send a message that hacking
the United States doesn't pay.]{.underline} Instead, they should support
a more limited but more achievable objective: stop adversaries from
hacking the United States. Whether or not foreign leaders perceive that
cyberattacks on the United States are worth conducting, Washington can
prevent them from doing so in the first place. Offensive
cyber-operations should not be undertaken lightly---the United States
must bear in mind its commitments under international law and its
relationships with its allies. But excessive caution cannot prevent
Washington from defending itself: with the United States' enemies
already attacking it online, the country will need to be more proactive
than it has been thus far. **[The U.S. government has already undertaken
a few asymmetric, or non-cyber, approaches to degrading its adversaries'
abilities to hack targets in the United States]{.underline}**. [It has
sanctioned foreign individuals and companies to limit their access to
capital and resources]{.underline}. It has also indicted some hackers
from China, Iran, and Russia in the hope that public exposure will make
it more difficult for them to hack. [These are efforts worth pursuing,
but not because they deter. Rather, like offensive cyber-operations,
they can degrade attackers' capabilities, although only in indirect ways
because they rely on the cooperation of foreign
governments]{.underline}.

[At]{.underline} [the 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, [**cyberspace** was

also [as a weapon]{.underline} in its own right [and]{.underline} as a

the next two decades, NATO will **look for new ways** to
integrate]{.mark} cyber weapons (or **[offensive cyber]{.mark}**

[The **[lack of integrated offensive cyber A2/AD]{.mark}** capabilities
[undermines]{.mark} both the [**unity of the Alliance** and]{.mark} its

"[We will conduct cyberspace operations to collect intelligence and
prepare military cyber capabilities to be used in the event of a crisis
or conflict,"]{.underline} the new strategy states, adding that [the
U.S. is prepared to use cyberwarfare along with other military weapons
against its enemies when needed,]{.underline} including to counter
malicious cyber activities targeting the country.

The document adds that **[the Pentagon will "work to strengthen the
capacity" of allies and partners]{.underline}**.

[NATO has moved cautiously on offensive cyber capabilities]{.underline}.
At the Warsaw Summit in 2016, allies recognized cyberspace as a
warfighting domain. It has said that a computer-based attack on an ally
would trigger NATO's commitment to defend its members. And last year the
alliance agreed to create a new cyber operations center. But the focus
has always been on defending NATO networks and those of its members, not
offensive cyberwar.

NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday that the defense
ministers will have a working session this week to address cyber and
other risks, and how allies can cooperate to counter such threats. He
did not provide details.

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation

[[One]{.mark} of the]{.underline} greatest [**[reservation]{.mark}**s
against communicating a willingness to take punitive actions
[concerns]{.mark} the [risk of **escalation**]{.mark} and increased
tension due to a more assertive]{.underline} or offensive [posture.
[Yet]{.mark} when looking into possible responses -- retaliation [in
**cyber**]{.mark}space, for example -- a number of [**"self-dampening"
mechanisms** appear]{.mark} to be **[in place]{.mark}** that may be
**applicable** to many types of responses]{.underline}.30 [[One]{.mark}
example [is]{.mark} the requirement to establish]{.underline} some level
of **[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of aggression on which to base
a response. As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible,
[it can be a time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a
high-stakes scenario the **time** taken]{.underline} to get attribution
as right as possible [means [there will be **plenty of time** to **think
twice**]{.mark} about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to **[lean
on diplomatic measures]{.mark}** in **parallel**. [An example]{.mark} of
a self-dampening mechanism [related to]{.mark} the **[cyber]{.mark}**
domain [is]{.mark} the **[large investment]{.mark}** required to develop
credible offensive capabilities. Moreover, an offensive cyber capability
is a **transitory tool**]{.underline}31. [The ability to access a
computer system or network to cause harm or damage is **only temporary**
and **dependent** on a **very rapid and ongoing patching** of
vulnerabilities]{.underline}. At the same time, wielding the cyber
instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might have a
de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility to the
opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline} -- including cyberspace
-- [[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} **relevant
[rules]{.mark}**]{.underline}, law and due-process [[which]{.mark} will
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the **range** of **[targets]{.mark}** and
**actions** available.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} final [**"escalatory showstopper"** is]{.mark} related to
the challenge of **identifying** and **developing targets** of adequate
strategic significance -- **not too much, not too little** -- to achieve
the desired effect. Responding to hybrid aggression by applying "middle
range" punitive [actions]{.mark} that are **[proportionate]{.mark}** to
the aggression threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also
**[self-limit]{.mark}** the escalatory potential. [It is
**unlikely**]{.mark} to be [in the **interest** of **any**]{.mark}
hybrid aggressor [to pursue **a**]{.mark}n **escalatory
[spiral]{.mark}** above and beyond where they were looking to compete in
the first place: on the hybrid level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, one way
to mitigate the risk of escalation -- while enhancing civilian oversight
and interagency coordination -- would be to establish rules of
engagement for punitive actions on the hybrid level32 . This would
provide decision-makers with common guidelines to pursue punitive
actions that fall below the "use of force threshold". Moreover, this
could actually bolster the credibility of punitive actions by signaling
to hybrid aggressors the intent to take pre-prepared punitive actions
when deemed necessary: in other words, a "playbook" for countering
hybrid threats.

### AT: Escalation\-\--1AR

#### US OCOs are restrained in nature -- no risk of accidents

International Service at American University, "ARE CYBER WEAPONS TOO
DANGEROUS TO USE?", War On the Rocks, 8/22/17,
https://warontherocks.com/2017/08/are-cyber-weapons-too-dangerous-to-use/

Surprisingly, **[we find that the effects of high-profile attacks have
been quite limited]{.underline}**. [In the aftermath of both Stuxnet and
the Snowden revelations, users continued to log on in record numbers,
and most do not seem to have taken additional steps to reduce their
exposure]{.underline}. Although the data is still somewhat patchy ---
ours go from 2015 to 2016 --- it appears that a small minority reduced
the scope of their online activities and engaged in self-censorship.
Meanwhile, the vast majority continued to communicate, share photos and
videos, buy Christmas gifts, and so on. [Firms acted
similarly]{.underline}, even though business leaders were some of the
fiercest critics of the National Security Agency's actions. Their
responses have not been uniform, but [the general trend has been
continued engagement online with increased investment in cyber
defenses]{.underline}. Finally, [**states have not noticeably reduced
cooperation with the United States on cybersecurity**. This is true of
states like India, which were third-party victims of Stuxnet, along with
states like Brazil, whose leaders were allegedly targets of U.S.
surveillance]{.underline}. [The major exception is China, which
suspended nascent cooperative efforts with the United States in
2014]{.underline}. But given the broader turmoil in U.S.-China
relations, **[it's unclear whether this was a result of either Stuxnet
or Snowden]{.underline}**. **[The technical responses also suggest that
the internet is resilient]{.underline}**. **[The frequency, severity,
and duration of attacks have not increased in the aftermath of the dual
shock of Stuxnet and Snowden]{.underline}**. And the [broader adoption
of measures like encrypted web traffic suggests the internet's
infrastructure is becoming more robust]{.underline}. Some caveats are in
order, because the data we use to assess the response to Stuxnet and
Snowden is immature and incomplete. We will surely learn more, and it is
possible that additional information will lead to a different
assessment. It is also possible that new kinds of cyberattacks may lead
to wider and longer-lasting destruction. Stuxnet, for instance,
contained target verification checks to prevent collateral damage to
machines it inadvertently affected. NotPetya notably did not, and caused
real damage to third-party victims. One reason the attack propagated so
quickly was that it used stolen credentials to pose as an administrator,
allowing it to avoid detection. Moreover, NotPetya seems to have been
designed to maximize confusion about its origin by raising the specter
of states, criminals, and cyber-exploits run amok. If we learn that
consumer, firm, or state behavior changes as a result of generalized
fears stemming from NotPetya or its offspring, then we will have more
doubts about internet resilience. So far, however, we do not have
evidence that this is the case. **[The upshot is that it is possible for
states to go on the offensive in cyberspace without undermining
cybersecurity]{.underline}**. Unlike ice-nine, **[the tools the United
States creates to fight in this realm do not appear, at least so far, to
be uncontrollable]{.underline}**. There may be good reasons to eschew
offensive cyber operations, and the United States already has a process
to determine whether to act in any specific case, but [officials need
not be deterred by the fear of extensive and lasting collateral
damage.]{.underline}

#### Low risk of escalation from OCOs

Brandon **Valeriano '20**, is the Bren Chair of Military Innovation at
the Marine Corps University and a Senior Advisor with the Cyberspace
Solarium Commission, "Managing Escalation Under Layered Cyber
Deterrence", Lawfare, 4/1/20,
https://www.lawfareblog.com/managing-escalation-under-layered-cyber-deterrence

A [few patterns of escalation have been explored thus far]{.underline}.
First, **[the cyber domain is not escalation dominant]{.underline}**.
**[Most cyber operations exhibit no responses, let alone escalatory
responses, that prevent future action]{.underline}**. Second, there are
vastly different escalation patterns based on nationality or state.
[There is no uniform view of how escalation should work in
cyberspace]{.underline}. [We polled the public-at-large in Russia, the
United States and Israel, and found that Americans prefer proportional
responses, while Russians prefer escalatory or deescalatory response
patterns]{.underline}. Assuming uniformity in responses across
nationalities is folly. Third, there is a danger of escalation in
cyberspace when a power with technological superiority attacks a state
lacking technological capabilities. A feeling of inadequacy likely
provokes an escalatory response to keep control of a situation. [When
escalatory options are used, they tend to appear in ongoing conflict
situations, such as Israel's kinetic attack on Hamas cyber operators in
2019]{.underline}. **[Placed in the proper context, these cross-domain
operations are not escalatory but, rather, are deescalatory when
compared to other kinetic operations being run or considered at the same
time]{.underline}**---such as a massive retaliatory bombing campaign or
a ground operation to root out terrorist operators.

### OCOs Good\-\--Election Interference\-\--2AC

#### OCOs [well in advance]{.underline} of threats [secures elections]{.underline}. 

**Sulmeyer \'18** \[Michael; 2/13/18; Director of the Cyber Security
Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs in
the Harvard Kennedy School; \"Testimony of Michael Sulmeyer,\"
https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Sulmeyer_02-13-18.pdf\]

[In addition to **improving defenses**]{.underline} and becoming more
resilient, [[we should]{.mark} also consider how best to **[counter
threats]{.mark}** abroad **[before they hit]{.mark}**]{.underline} us at
home. To that end, let me transition to how I see some potential roles
for the military in protecting our elections. I will focus my remarks on
roles that the military could play outside of the United States.

[There are two **necessary conditions** of posture]{.underline} that I
see as critical:

1\. Reconnaissance Posture: [Our [cyber]{.mark} mission [forces should
be **constantly** conducting]{.mark} **reconnaissance
[missions]{.mark}**]{.underline} abroad [[to discover
**election**]{.mark}**-related** [threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
United States [[and]{.mark} provide **indicators** and
**[warnings]{.mark}**]{.underline} to our forces and decision-makers.
[There will never be sufficient resources to prioritize all threats
equally, so prioritizing threats to]{.underline} our [elections
and]{.underline} our [democratic processes is crucial. If we do not
prioritize collecting information abroad]{.underline} about
election-related threats, than [we cannot hope [to **disrupt
them**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2\. Force Posture: Our [cyber mission [forces must]{.mark} be
sufficiently **ready to [strike]{.mark}** against **[targets
abroad]{.mark}** identified by **reconnaissance** as threats to our
election. [**Readiness** is]{.mark} a **[critical]{.mark} issue** for
our armed forces]{.underline} today, and I would encourage the Senators
on this committee to ensure they are asking tough questions about the
readiness of our cyber mission forces just as they would about any other
area of our military. Our [[forces]{.mark} must be ready to create
different effects against a range of targets]{.underline}. Sometimes,
[they [will **not have much notice**]{.mark}, so developing
[tactics]{.mark} that can be [**employed on the fly** is
important]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the military's reconnaissance and
forces are postured to focus on threats to our elections from abroad,
there are four objectives that our forces should be prepared to pursue.
[It should go without saying that undertaking these [actions]{.mark}
would [need to be **consistent** with **i**]{.mark}nternational [**law**
and]{.mark} other]{.underline} relevant [[U.S.
**commitments**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

1\. Preventing Attacks from Materializing: Based on election-focused
reconnaissance, [U.S. [cyber]{.mark} mission [forces should]{.mark}
develop options to **[disrupt]{.mark}** the [activities of those
**planning to meddle**]{.mark}]{.underline} in our elections, [[and
those]{.mark} who are [in]{.mark} the [early steps]{.mark} of doing
so]{.underline}. Because [these would be actions conducted by U.S.
forces [with a]{.mark} **relatively [long lead
time]{.mark}**]{.underline}, scenario-based plans should be developed
and socialized with decision-makers so they are aware of the viability,
risks, and benefits of different options.

2\. Preempting Imminent Attacks: [Reconnaissance abroad may provide
**indicators** and **warnings** of an imminent cyber attack]{.underline}
against election-related infrastructure, campaigns, and media and social
media platforms. [Our [forces can]{.mark} prepare to [neuter]{.mark}
those [attacks **before they commence**]{.mark}. Such [actions]{.mark}
would [need to be **undertaken rapidly**]{.mark} as [opportunities to
strike may be fleeting]{.mark}, so developing options in advance to
deliver effects promptly when so ordered is essential.]{.underline}

The Ideals of the American Republic

[The stakes in the Russo-American conflict are **high**]{.underline}.
Russian leader Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} seeks to **undermine
confidence** in **democratically elected institutions**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [the **institution of democracy itself** in the United
States and the West.]{.underline}1 [He [is trying to interfere
with]{.mark} the [ability of]{.mark} American and European [peoples to
**choose their leaders freely**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and is
undermining]{.mark} the **[rules-based international
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on which **American**]{.mark}
**prosperity** and [**security** rest]{.mark}]{.underline}. [His actions
in Ukraine and Syria have driven the **world** toward **greater
violence** and **disorder**.]{.underline} [The **[normalization of
Putin's]{.mark} illegal [actions over time]{.mark}** [will]{.mark}
likely **[prompt other s]{.mark}tates [to emulate his behavior]{.mark}**
[and cause]{.mark} further **[deterioration of]{.mark} the international
[system.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Moscow's war on]{.mark} the **very idea of [truth]{.mark}** has been
perhaps the most **damaging** Russian undertaking in recent
years]{.underline}. [The most basic element of the Russian information
strategy]{.underline}, which we will consider in more detail presently,
[is the creation of a sense of **uncertainty** around **any important
issue**]{.underline}. [Russia's strategy does not require persuading
Western audiences that its actions in]{.underline} Ukraine's
[Crimea]{.underline}n Peninsula [or the Kerch Strait]{.underline}, which
connects the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, for example, [were legal or
justified]{.underline}.3 [It is enough to create an environment in which
many people say simply, "who knows?" The "who knows?" principle feeds
powerfully into the phenomena of viral "fake news," as well as other
falsehoods and accusations of falsehoods which]{.underline}, **[[if left
unchecked]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[will]{.mark} ultimately [make civil
discourse **impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Kremlin's propaganda
does not necessarily need its target audiences to believe in lies; its
primary goal is to make sure they do not believe in the truth.

[[This]{.mark} [aspect]{.mark} of Putin's approach]{.underline} is one
of the greatest obstacles to forming an accurate assessment and making
recommendations. It [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[one of the [most
insidious threat]{.mark}s]{.underline}** [the current [Russian strategy
**poses** to]{.mark} the **[survival of]{.mark} the [American
republic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The good news is that the war on the
idea of truth **does not involve military operations or
violence**]{.underline}, [though it can lead to both]{.underline}. [The
bad news is that it is **extraordinarily difficult to
identify**]{.underline}, **[let alone to counter.]{.underline}** [Yet we
**must counter it** if we are to **survive** as a **functioning
polity.**]{.underline}

Challenges (and Opportunities) of Alliances

Integrated deterrence goes beyond what is already a very difficult
challenge of making cyberspace work better within the U.S. military.
Alliances also seem to play a huge role in the Department of Defense's
new deterrence concept. As Undersecretary of Defense Colin Kahl
explained, the new strategy requires that the Department of Defense be
"integrated across our allies and partners, which are the real
asymmetric advantage that the United States has over any other
competitor or potential adversary."

[[Cyberspace presents a **unique challenge for
alliances**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For years, Washington's traditional
alliance relationships struggled to even agree on basic cyber terms and
attempts to share information were complicated by cyber operations'
close relationship with the highly classified world of signals
intelligence. Moreover, U.S. actions in cyberspace have, in some cases,
strained alliance relationships. Two prominent examples include the
backlash over the Edward Snowden leaks as well as concerns about the
implications of persistent engagement and defend forward for
allied-owned networks.

These were considerable challenges. However, as cyber incidents have
escalated over the last few years, there has also been an increasing
recognition across these relationships that cyberspace matters. This
[[joint recognition spurred new
infor]{.underline}]{.mark}mation-[[sharing]{.underline}]{.mark}
mechanisms and partner efforts to find and root out adversary
infiltration attempts on allied networks. Most recently, [[joint
attribution by NATO]{.mark} and E.U.]{.underline} [partners [called out
China]{.mark}]{.underline} [for the Microsoft Exchange Hack --- a rare
reaction from these organizations. This comes on the heels of public
statements at the NATO summit in Geneva in June that reaffirmed the
applicability of the mutual defense clause of the alliance agreement to
cyberspace]{.underline}. Further, [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the
aforementioned [[alliance tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the
[Defense]{.mark} Department [has conducted 24 "**hunt forward**"
operations]{.mark}]{.underline} [in which U.S. cyber protection teams
partnered with 14 countries to root out adversary activity on allied
networks.]{.underline}

Building on this forward momentum, perhaps [[the greatest opportunity
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration's national defense strategy [[is to use]{.underline}
**[military alliances and partnerships to facilitate norm
development]{.underline}**. [Norms are shared understandings about
appropriate behavior]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some norms are written down
and formalized in agreements, while others are more informal and emerge
as a result of state practice over time. Moreover, norms are agnostic
with respect to morality: there could be "good" norms that facilitate
cooperation, but also "bad" norms that make the international system
less stable.

**[[In the past]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly under the Obama
administration, **[[norms were considered]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
realm of the [[State]{.mark} Department [while]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense [[focused on deterrence by
punishment]{.underline}]{.mark} and denial. This changed under the Trump
administration, when the State Department's norms efforts took a back
seat to Department of Defense efforts to defend forward. The initial
foundational work done by the Obama administration on cyber norms,
paired with four years of experimentation and more risk-acceptant cyber
authorities under the Trump administration, have created a track record
for cyber norms that is far more heterogeneous than policymakers have
let on. While there are certainly many areas where states disagree,
[[norms do exist in cyberspace.]{.underline}]{.mark} For instance, a
diverse set of states --- beyond just the United States and "like
minded" nations --- has come to formal agreements about "rules of the
road" for cyberspace through various international institution-driven
processes, most notably the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts
and the Open-Ended Working Group. To the surprise of many observers,
earlier this year both of these processes resulted in consensus reports
where parties agreed to a set of cyber norms. And from a bilateral
perspective, rivals such as Russia have been willing to engage the
United States in discussions about cyber norms, even if the prospects
for cooperation remain uncertain. And [[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}
formalized [[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark}, there is a range of
unwritten, [[implied norms]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[shape mutual
expectations of behavior in cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark}. These
include a firebreak between cyber and conventional operations, such that
states to not respond to cyber attacks with the use of kinetic military
force; the idea that cyber espionage is generally treated as other forms
of espionage (with some exceptions); and a pattern of tit-for-tat
responses in cyberspace that have led to a nascent sense of what counts
as "proportional."

[The Defense Department plays a large role in this process]{.underline}
--- though in the past this hasn't been a formal effort. Specifically,
**[[how the D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense [[uses
its own cyber]{.mark} capabilities o[r threatens to respond]{.mark} to
[cyber]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline} **[[can play an outsized role
in whether cyberspace norms proliferate]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Some
have argued that [[employing military cyber power
can]{.underline}]{.mark}, through a tacit process, [[contribute
to]{.mark} the development of]{.underline} [[cyber
norms]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the ambiguous signaling strategies
that this line of argument generates are often overly complicated and
obtuse. Strategic documents are some of the clearest articulations of
norms that adversaries receive. Given that, the U.S. military should use
the opportunity of a new national defense strategy to voice clearly what
the U.S. believes are appropriate norms of behavior in cyberspace. In
particular, it should consider making unambiguous statements about what
the Pentagon won't do in cyberspace --- in effect, a declaratory policy
of restraint. This may be as important to norm propagation as efforts by
the State Department to codify international agreements.

#### The CP subordinates DOS to State\-\--that wrecks developing interoperable cyber doctrine

**Sadler '21** \[Brent; June 30; Senior Fellow for Naval Warfare and
Advanced Technology; "Don't Shift Security Cooperation to State
Department,"
https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/dont-shift-security-cooperation-state-department\]

[America spends billions each year on security cooperation and
assistance programs]{.underline}, but the results do not match the
investment. To help improve efficiencies, [the Center for American
Progress recently proposed **consolidating**]{.underline} all these
**[programs within the State Department]{.underline}**.

**[That would be a big mistake]{.underline}**, [because it would
**minimize**]{.underline} [the Pentagon's role in shaping and directing
security assistance and]{.underline}, ultimately, [the program's
**military objectives would be subordinated to State Department
interests**]{.underline}, [such as **judicial reform** and]{.underline}
**[humanitarian programs. Those are not the values by which
such]{.underline}** security assistance programs **[should be solely
judged.]{.underline}**

[Security sector assistance programs deliver arms, military training,
and other defense-related services to allies and partner nation
governments via grants, loans, credit, cash sales, or leasing. By
definition,]{.underline} [these programs should prioritize national
security]{.underline}. To this end, reforms should enhance joint State
and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in terms of America's
national strategic goals.

[In the existing system, State consults with Defense on its security
assistance designs]{.underline}. Defense then implements State programs,
as well as its own security cooperation programs, **[such as
multinational military exercises and military training and
advising]{.underline}**.

[The departments differ in the scope to which they apply security
assistance]{.underline}. [Defense programs target narrower **national
security objectives**]{.underline}, such as the Maritime Security
Initiative, launched in 2015 to expand maritime domain awareness.
State's programs, such as the Central America Regional Security
Initiative, emphasize broader regional stability and humanitarian goals.

[Assistance programs can be better tailored to their objectives when
**State shares directive authority**]{.underline} [and decision-making
power with the entity most relevant to each program's
purpose]{.underline}. For example, when the objective is military
capacity-building, the Defense Department should be an equal partner;
[when the goal is justice system reform]{.underline}, the Department of
[Justice should be a full partner.]{.underline}

Consider how the Philippines used American-sourced coast guard cutters
when responding to China's intrusions at Whitsun Reef earlier this year.
Given President Biden's emphasis on strategic competition with China,
strengthening partner nations to resist Beijing's maritime coercion
should be a no-brainer. In this context, State should ensure it ties the
objectives of its weapons sales program to Defense Department
priorities, such as improving maritime domain awareness, by enabling the
Philippines and, perhaps other countries, to increase patrols of
exclusive economic zones.

Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance in the Middle East
should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to military effects.
However, the report's recommendations are limited to counterterrorism
activities and a strategy of deprioritizing the Middle East in favor of
the Indo-Pacific. [If limiting security assistance to military purposes
would make programs more effective in a region of waning emphasis, it
stands to reason that this should be the formative basis for all
security assistance programs]{.underline}, especially when strategy
calls for increased investment in the security capacities of partner
nations.

[Reforms to security assistance should push the agencies in this
direction, encouraging---or compelling---State to design its programs in
closer coordination with the Pentagon and in support of]{.underline}
Defense Department's [operational needs, such as improving military
forward presence, wartime **resilience** and
**interoperability**.]{.underline}

Congress should recognize and re-evaluate its role in these decision as
well, as legislative earmarks can limit State's directive agility and
responsiveness. But even the best-laid plans cannot succeed without
follow-through.

The Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), for example, tried to
catalyze cooperation between State and Defense, but it neglected
assessment processes. As a result, it fell short. This pilot program
required concurrence from each department on any GSCF project and
offered more flexibility in program funding. But two years after the
first seven projects were announced, none had materialized. State and
Defense failed to clearly define timeframes and track GSCF projects
against those benchmarks, only starting to implement these standards
years into the program. By 2016, execution still lagged expectations,
and a frustrated Congress stopped paying for the program.

Regular evaluation that prioritizes timely, tangible measures of success
directly tied to U.S. strategic interests is crucial to ensuring that
programs deliver on their objectives. But as the GSCF showed,
implementing assessments only after problems arise is damage control,
not effective program design.

[In devising reforms]{.underline} to ensure that U.S. funds, arms, and
training are directed to viable projects that serve our national
strategy, [it's critical to keep the main thing the main thing. State
Department priorities for security assistance should emphasize specific
national security objectives that enable better Defense Department
forward presence, resilience and interoperability with our security
partners]{.underline}.

#### Allies have asked for security cooperation with the DOD for cybersecurity\-\--they're not compelled by the CP

[The Defense Department wants to help its partner
contractors]{.underline}, large and small, [become better at their own
cybersecurity efforts]{.underline}, the deputy assistant of defense for
cyber policy said yesterday.

\"We definitely want to make sure that size is not an obstacle to
working with the Defense Department,\" Mieke Eoyang said at the Defense
One Tech Summit. \"And we are trying to figure out how to make it easier
for \[contractors\] to understand what kinds of better security
practices are out there and what they can do to protect themselves.\"

Eoyang said U.S. adversaries are very much aware that DOD relies on
innovation, but she added DOD doesn\'t just look at only large
contractors when looking for a technological edge. It\'s also important
for contractors to adopt best practices in cybersecurity --- such as
turning on multi-factor authentication, using cloud migration or working
with cybersecurity companies --- to enhance their own security, she
said.

[DOD participates in whole-of-government activities to target and
disrupt ransomware,]{.underline} the deputy assistant secretary said,
adding that the department is willing to work through its intelligence
and law enforcement partners to provide insights to disrupt such
threats.

It\'s vital for industry to think about this from the perspective of
resilience, Eoyang said of protection in cybersecurity.

\"Companies need to be prepared for the possibility that it could happen
to them,\" Eoyang said. \"They need to improve their security, make
themselves harder targets, but also really think about continuity of
operations, so if, or when, they get hit, they know how to keep moving
and how to work around the problem. But I don\'t think that we want to
be in a position where people are turning to the Department of Defense
to try and stop every single criminal gang out there .... We have to be
able to focus on those nation state adversaries, and we do focus on
that. But in the meantime, people also need to focus on improving their
own resilience, being harder targets.\"

DOD is resilient and mature in its cybersecurity practices, the deputy
assistant secretary said. \"I think it\'s very clear from the president
on down ... and other countries should make no mistake about the
seriousness with which the United States treats this problem and our
interest in being able to get after malicious actors.\"

[DOD has been working through U.S. Cyber Command and other
entities]{.underline}, she said, directly with industry to help
contractors identify potential malicious activity on their networks.
\"And there are other things we can do to help people --- \[such as\]
when we identify malware, we can post it out there for the world to see
--- so that they can take that into consideration as part of their
efforts to secure their own systems.\"

[As DOD considers how to bolster its allies,]{.underline} **[security
cooperation is]{.underline}** a big factor, Eoyang said. \"What I\'ve
seen so far is that one of [the **No. 1 requests** to]{.underline} the
combatant [commanders for **security cooperation**]{.underline}
assistance [is in]{.underline} the area of
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}**. But we do not have the clarity of
offerings that the private sector could provide under security
cooperation funds to our partners and allies, so I would encourage
industry to work with us so that we have a better understanding of what
might be available, what they might be able to provide through security
cooperation, to help shore up the cybersecurity of our partners and
allies. And \[our\] door\'s always open to talk about that.\"

[In the area of DoD efforts in security cooperation with international
partner military and security forces, **DoD has certainly exploded with
authorities**]{.underline} and authorizations [to conduct training and
equipping efforts outside of the traditional security assistance
programs]{.underline} enshrined under State Department Title 22
authority. After 9/11 and with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well
as GWOT efforts around the globe, DoD felt it needed these programs to
address emergent requirements in partner capability development. In this
environment, DoD deemed traditional programs like Foreign Military
Financing Program (FMFP) and International Military Education and
Training (IMET), State Department security assistance under its Title 22
authority, were no longer sufficient, if not wholly inappropriate.
Established with the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, these programs
reflect the nature of traditional bilateral political relationships as
opposed to an emergent security requirement. During the Bush
Administration, building up indigenous security forces and coalition
partners during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan became important
requirements. Under President Obama, coalition development thinking
evolved as the administration sought to address security challenges with
"other people's armies." The Obama Administration sought to be
preventative rather than reactive to security challenges, resolving such
challenges before there was a need for another extended commitment of
U.S. troops.

Civilian institutions of diplomacy and development express skepticism as
to whether the U.S. military is suited for these tasks, pointing out
that results are at best mixed and these efforts risk militarization of
the problem set at the expense of social, economic, civil society, and
governmental institutional development \-- core issues of most security
problems. Others counter that while the criticisms have merit, the U.S.
military is the only institution with the personnel, resources,
planning, and projection capability to reliably deliver security in
relatively short order. As the DoS and some members of Congress have
chafed at DoDs conduct of these sorts of activities, authorizations
regularly mandate DoS coordination and concurrence on proposals. Many of
these proposals, or "Building Partner Capacity" cases, funded with DoD
Title 10 funds, require Country Team Assessments (CTA), ultimately
expressing embassy agreement for a particular project. Now, the DoS is
involved with these cases from the country team, through the geographic
combatant command and the Pentagon, to congressional notification.

Writing in Foreign Policy, James Jeffery, former U.S. Ambassador to
Turkey, Iraq, and Albania (and as of this writing serving as the U.S.
Special Representative for Syria Engagement), agrees with Brooks'
argument of the outsized role of the DoD, noting that the "military's
effectiveness in such quasi-diplomatic business is limited." He argues
that the authorities and funding appropriations DoD has accumulated
since 9/11 in training and equipping security forces should revert to
DoS in its traditional role of managing and overseeing security
assistance as foreign policy. However, he places a good bit of
responsibility for State's diminution in foreign policy on its own
ever-expanding set of priorities at the expense of big-picture
"traditional diplomacy." He is critical of State Department's direction
over the years in emphasizing an unfocused grab bag of "soft power"
social agendas in a bid to be a "deep transformer." He notes that in the
2015 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR), issues like
the South China Sea and Ukraine are dramatically less prominent than the
stated priorities that consist of what he characterized as a "hodgepodge
of social engineering" and climate change. He notes that now,
"operationally, the State Department is seen as an alternative to \--
rather than partner or exploiter of military and other hard power."

FSOs, particularly more junior ones, do tend to view diplomatic and
military actions almost as a binary choice. Instinctively, they have
difficulty understanding what role the military plays in diplomacy.
Accepting perhaps a very narrow role for the U.S. military to assist
with host-nation defense reforms, or exercising with a friendly
host-nation military, they tend to view the military as an entity to be
called on in an emergency\--"just break glass." But in the meantime, it
is best for the military to stay in the glass box. From their
perspective, if DoS succeeds in its "deep transformation efforts," there
is little need for military involvement and the immense resources the
military consumes. Today's FSO's view of diplomacy is broader than DoD's
view (which arguably trends more towards Ambassador Jeffrey's more
traditional model) and encompasses promoting American values through a
host of agendas. They have seen that the military's success has been
limited and are naturally skeptical when an enthusiastic staff officer
from a geographic combatant command pitches them on something he or she
thinks is a grand new idea.

As Jeffrey and others have noted, [DoS has accumulated a broad set of
more narrow activities]{.underline} in what retired Ambassador Larry
Butler has called a "proliferation of priorities." The proliferation of
priorities is perfectly understandable considering [State's culture of
open discussion, respect for complexity, and resistance to risk. The
result is numerous smaller "soft power" efforts of limited funds
targeting big scope issues]{.underline}: child and gender issues, civil
society development, LGBTQ issues, [religious rights,
micro-finance]{.underline}, anti-graffiti campaigns, media funding,
[civil society]{.underline} [development, climate change]{.underline}
intervention promotion, etc. **[This strategic diffusion results in many
benign smaller programs]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} have a
positive optic and may raise awareness but **[have questionable
transformative effects]{.underline}**, particularly at current funding
levels. Jeffery argues that since World War II, "nowhere but Japan,
Germany, and in Western Europe (via the Marshall Plan) have soft-power
tools transformed strategic terrain to our advantage." In many respects,
the issue is not wholly of State Department's diminution in foreign
policy, but that institution's diffusion of its efforts, which others
have argued is the reason why many of State's foreign policy development
functions have migrated to an ever-growing National Security Council.

FAOs assigned to an embassy will often walk **[into a blizzard of DoS
activities]{.underline}**, [outside of just defense and
security]{.underline}. FSOs, in addition to their core task of cable
writing, feverishly try to keep track of the myriad of issues,
activities, and working groups. The DoS, particularly at the country
team level, has difficulty in prioritizing its efforts and asking itself
whether a particular initiative is necessary, sufficient, and truly
transformational. Of course FSOs at embassies are quick to assess that
the many things an embassy is doing at times need to be scaled back.
Many well-intentioned country team meetings have sincerely tried to neck
down priorities, but the open discussion format of problem sets often
triggers the "it's complicated" default and priority lists have
ballooned again. Like any other bureaucracy in the U.S. Government, it's
hard for the DoS to drop product lines, even with its nuanced thinking
and flexible approaches. In the end, the only solution agreed upon is
the need for more people and more resources.

Much of this development work is done by the United States Agency for
International Development (USAID), an agency that is separate from the
DoS but which reports to the Secretary of State (somewhat analogous to
the U.S. Marine Corps falling under the Department of the Navy), though
the DoS also manages and implements specific programs in many sectors
such as law enforcement and the media, and not every country has a USAID
presence. USAID prefers to guard its independence from the DoS, and
there are usually energetic and complex discussions at a country team
between State and USAID on the direction of development as well.
However, USAID does have a more deliberate planning and assessment
process in the implementation of its programs that DoD is learning from
to better enable security cooperation program assessments.

"So what's a Combatant Command...?"

Given the ambassador's authority over all U.S government representation
at an embassy and State's responsibility to coordinate "whole of
government" approaches at the country team level, including DoD security
cooperation, most rank-and-file FSOs typically know little of the U.S.
military. It is true, however, that over the last several years a
greater percentage of incoming FSO do have prior military experience,
and there have been a significant number of FSOs that have served with
the military as political advisors or on Provincial Reconstruction Teams
(PRTs). Unfortunately, [the DoS advancement systems don't particularly
value assignments that have FSOs working with the military.]{.underline}
After their initial training at the Foreign Service Institute, [FSOs
have little professional development outside of on-the-job experience
throughout their careers that can expand their aperture of the U.S.
government.]{.underline}

Moreover, FSOs receive little development in leadership and management.
There are often few opportunities for FSOs in the Political, Economic,
and Public Diplomacy "cones" (State Department's version of career
tracks) to lead and manage and programs. There are FSOs that can go
there entire careers without managing programs. For the interagency,
this is unfortunate as DoS personnel at country teams are expected to
coordinate and integrate multi-departmental efforts to support "whole of
government" approaches. On a practical level, they chair working groups
on such issues as economic development, investing in people, law
enforcement, or countering violent extremism, which FSOs sometimes view
as a distraction from their core tasks. These working groups tend not to
be planning or strategy development affairs but have a more basic
"clearing house" function. Interagency participants share activity
information and present proposals, but too often the priority purpose of
these fora is to ensure a particular department's initiative first, does
no harm.

[In contrast to the State Department, the military sends service members
to various professional military education]{.underline} (PME) courses
throughout their careers. At the more senior courses, military members
are at least exposed to the need for "whole of government\" approaches
and the primacy of the State Department in foreign affairs (though PME
could do much better on presenting the functions and organization of
State Department itself). Army officers training as FAOs, conducting
their one-year in-region training, will intern at one if not several
embassies under the direction and mentorship of an attaché or SCO. Even
as FAOs prepare for attaché and SCO assignments by attending the Joint
Military Attaché School (JMAS) and the Defense Institute of Security
Cooperation Studies (DISCS) (SDO/DATTs attend both), they are exposed to
concepts such as the interagency process and U.S. embassy roles and
organization. At these courses, military personnel learn about the role
of the DoS, the country team, and the authorities of DoS versus DoD in
the conduct of security cooperation and security assistance. Military
personnel report to a country team understanding that whatever DoD does
requires consistency with, and support to, the ambassador's Integrated
Country Strategy (ICS). SCOs are briefed on their requirement to provide
input to the embassy's Mission Resource Request (MRR) by way of their
FMF and IMET projections. As a result of this continuing education
coupled with hard experience, military leaders regularly acknowledge the
importance of DoS diplomacy, USAID's important work in development, the
insufficiency of a military-only approach, and the need for DoS
leadership. Other than hard experience, there is nothing comparable for
State Department FSOs to prepare them to work with interagency partners,
including the military.

[As professional development DoS sends few of its population to U.S.
military professional military education institutions, and fails to make
use of the experiences of those that do attend.]{.underline} Despite the
strong demand signal sent out by senior military leaders, POLAD
positions throughout the various U.S. military commands aren't always
filled with the most qualified candidates, and these positions aren't
thought to be particularly career enhancing within the DoS personnel
advancement system. The political-military portfolio in a Political
Section of an embassy isn't considered particularly "attractive" and
career enhancing, and these officers often feel the need to seek
additional portfolios to make themselves more competitive. This is
unfortunate as the Pol-Mil officer is an absolutely crucial position to
integrate DoD-DoS efforts at the country team level. A good Pol-Mil
officer is a "force and resource multiplier," and are worth their weight
in gold to DoD and DoS, and should be recognized and rewarded for their
work.

[As a result of unfamiliarity with the military and the lack of appeal
of political-military issues, an FSO tends to be surprised at the role
of the military at the country team and wonders why military officers
show up to public affairs planning meetings, law enforcement working
groups, and countering violent extremist meetings]{.underline}.
Additionally, with the possible exception of FAOs, military personnel
are not seen as having the requisite level of understanding of
host-nation nuances to speak authoritatively on an issue, let alone
suggest a remedy. This is particularly true of military members who come
in from a command to propose an initiative or those who deploy to an
embassy for temporary duty, often a source of consternation for FSOs.
Having limited understanding of how DoD works, its capabilities,
authorities, and resources, they can see themselves as holding the line
against militarization. They generally do not understand DoD security
cooperation programs and authorities. Many are even unaware that
traditional security assistance programs such as Foreign Military
Financing (FMF) and International Military Education and Training
(IMET), are actually DoS Programs under Title 22 authority and only
administered by DoD.

Military personnel can report to an embassy enthusiastically looking
forward to jumping into "whole of government" efforts with a broad range
of colleagues, only to be greeted at times with suspicion,
dismissiveness, and curiosity as to the reason for the enthusiasm. The
military person walks away disappointed their "whole of government"
effort is unrequited, perhaps with the impression of the stereotypical
arrogant FSO, an unfortunate take away for a future potential senior
military leader. This can be particularly true of military members that
deploy on short six-month rotations, who don't have the time and
opportunity to develop situational awareness and relationships of trust
with FSOs. FAOs serving as Attaches and SCOs at embassies should work to
build relations (face-to-face), trust, and inform foreign service
personnel on the U.S. military, its organizational processes, its
programs and capabilities, and resources \-- and then let them lead. At
embassy working groups, military members should work constructively with
FSOs, suggesting potential options for organizing work, but make clear
they are there to "complement and reinforce" embassy efforts, not to
take over. And as hard as it may be for military, sometimes "dialing
back" the energy and assertiveness is more appropriate for a country
team setting. Attaches and SCOs should mentor short-term military
deployers and help them navigate the idiosyncrasies of country teams. In
turn, short-term deployers should work closely with DAOs and SCOs and
not only coordinate with these offices, but seek out advice on how best
to work within the culture of a given country team.

Conclusion

Considering the personnel and resources at the military's disposal
relative to DoS, [it is easy to see how quickly a **growing DoD
presence**]{.underline} [and "Swiss army knife" of missions]{.underline}
and authorities [could soon overwhelm a country team]{.underline}. Aside
from the traditional Defense Attaché Office and the Security Cooperation
Office, civil affairs teams, MISTs, and special operations forces
elements can increase the number of military members visible at an
embassy. Obviously military individuals wearing civilian attire attract
the eye and can stir consternation throughout the embassy sections. In
the small bubble of an embassy community, the question, "what are they
really doing here?" is asked in hushed whispers, as if witnessing some
bad movie or television show. Some FSOs, concerned about the optic of a
militarized embassy, would prefer short-term military personnel not come
into the embassy at all.

#### Cyber arms control fails

Arms Control Agreements?,"
https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-are-there-no-cyber-arms-control-agreements\]

During the Cold War, when nuclear-armed superpowers faced concerns
regarding crisis instability and escalation, they entered into arms
[controls agreements. Arms control regimes can alter the military
incentives for the use of offensive technologies;]{.underline} [limit
the damage to states]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
[event these technologies are used; and]{.underline} [generally
contribute to stable interstate relations]{.underline}, even between
adversaries. [With the emergence of a **militarized cyber
domain**]{.underline} [that creates the conditions for
**misperceptions** that]{.underline} [could lead to **inadvertent
conflict**]{.underline}, [why are there no **cyber arms control
regimes?**]{.underline}

[Traditional [arms control]{.mark} [regimes are **inapplicable to
cyber**]{.mark}**space**]{.underline} [for four reasons: it is difficult
to]{.underline} **[measure]{.underline}** [the relative **strength of
states**]{.underline} [in cyberspace; there is **uncertainty** regarding
the **military effects** of **cyber technology**]{.underline}; [the
**challenges** of **monitoring compliance**; and]{.underline}
**[difficulties with enforcement]{.underline}**.

[Arms control regimes [require]{.mark} states to have a **basic
[understating]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} each other's **[relative
strength]{.mark}** so that an agreement can promote]{.underline}
**[strategic stability]{.underline}**. For conventional munitions,
nuclear weapons, or even chemical ordinances, warheads or pounds of a
virulent gas that a state possesses can be counted, allowing others to
assess comparative strength. The same cannot be said for assessing
relative strength in cyberspace for two reasons. First, [[how can a
state]{.mark} possibly **[count virtual weapons]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
by definition **[cannot be destroyed]{.mark}** and, in theory, could be
**continuously regenerated?**]{.underline} Second, [unlike nukes or
tanks, some cyber weapons **lack universal
lethality**]{.underline}---unique tools and accesses are often required
to deliver effects against specific targeted systems.

In contrast, [what may be more readily measurable in cyberspace is the
technical skill]{.underline} of cyber threat actors---a qualitative,
rather than quantitative measure of capability. [However, using relative
skill to drive arms control regimes may be **impractical** due to the
difficulty of **crafting** or **enforcing** agreements that **limit
skill** or **access to technology**]{.underline}, particularly when
governments are not the sole proprietors.

[Arms control regimes may also form if governments are able to make
**reasonable calculations**]{.underline} [regarding the **likely
military effect** of technological change]{.underline}s. [However, the
[**rapid** and **unpredictable pace**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} technological
[innovation]{.mark} in the cyber domain **[complicates]{.mark} these
[assessments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [At the **tactical
level**]{.underline}, [attack vectors and offensive capabilities are
**continuously evolving**]{.underline}, in contrast to the nuclear arena
where innovations had long development timelines and could often be
observed. The lag time in nuclear innovation gave states breathing room
to adjust arms control agreements or develop other means, such as
tailored intelligence or their own complimentary programs, to mitigate
the fears posed by technological advances. [In cyberspace, the
open-ended promise of innovation coupled with quickly changing
tradecraft that can emerge with little to no warning **challenges** the
**creation of any agreement**.]{.underline} [A cyber arms control
[agreement]{.mark} [runs the risk of being
**outdated**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[restrictive]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} some]{.underline}
**[[unanticipated way]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[before the ink has even
had time to dry.]{.underline}**

Even if states are able to calculate relative capabilities and assess
the military implications of a technological innovations, [cyber arms
control agreements are unlikely to form if [governments **cannot detect
cheating**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The verification problem contains two
prongs: being able to ascertain]{.underline} the **[size]{.underline}**
[of a state's arsenal and **monitoring** it to ensure future
**compliance**.]{.underline}

[Ascertaining compliance in the cyber domain would require participants
to agree to **intrusive access to government networks**]{.underline}.
[Malicious software can be developed just about
**anywhere**]{.underline}, [meaning that any [verification]{.mark}
mechanism [would]{.mark} [require a government to **open up all of its
networks to inspection**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It would be
**[unfathomable]{.mark}** for one state to allow another]{.underline},
or any outside actor, [to have **unfettered access**]{.underline} [to
its networks. [Such access would provide]{.mark} an external party with
**[critical info]{.mark}rmation**]{.underline} [[about]{.mark}
**[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** and **potential exploits**]{.underline},
and potentially violate the agreement it is attempting to enforce.

A less invasive means to assess compliance would be to have monitoring
occur through national technical means of intelligence. During the Cold
War, spies analyzed imagery collected from satellites that monitored the
nuclear posture of another state. The equivalent in cyberspace would be
to use cyber espionage to collect information about another state's
internal networks. However, while satellite collection is entirely
passive, gaining access to and potentially absconding with data from
sensitive government networks is not. If a state observes a third party
penetrating its networks, it may be unable to distinguish between
routine espionage activity for the purposes of monitoring compliance,
other legitimate espionage purposes unrelated to compliance, or
preparation for an offensive operation. This could prompt the targeted
state to respond in an escalatory fashion. Therefore, the inability to
perceive intent could, again, undermine the very stability the arms
control agreements were meant to create.

Finally, [**even if** the preceding obstacles could be
overcome]{.underline}, **[[enforcement]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of any
arms control agreement [would be **difficult**]{.mark} **to
implement**]{.underline} [due to two factors]{.underline}:
[[problems]{.mark} associated [with]{.mark} **[attribution]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} divining a **[proportionate
punishment.]{.mark}**]{.underline} First, [in the event of a violation,
states would have to attribute it with a level of
**confidence**]{.underline} [that would justify a reciprocal
response]{.underline}. While attribution capabilities have
unquestionably improved over time, not all states have the same
attribution capabilities or enough confidence in them to justify action.
This is particularly relevant given that a state that detects a
violation would need to convince other parties to the same treaty that a
violation occurred.

Second, [enforcing an arms control agreement requires proportionate
responses to observed derogation]{.underline}. [This is
problematic]{.underline} for several reasons. [There may be a
significant]{.underline} **[time lag]{.underline}** [between when a
derogation occurs and when it is actually observed]{.underline}. [Thus,
the **deterrent effect** of a response is likely to be **diluted** by
the simple]{.underline} **[passage of time]{.underline}**. Furthermore,
resource and access constraints may limit the capabilities a state has
at a given moment to respond, which means that it may not necessarily be
effective. A potential alternative could be to use non-cyber elements of
national power to punish a derogation of a cyber arms control agreement.
However, crafting an effective response that relies on physical elements
of power may be difficult to formulate if the violation only caused
virtual damage.

RUSSIAN GRAY ZONE CONFLICT\", https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/64844

2\. Applying Deterrence in the Context of Russian Behavior

This section builds on the previous assessments and [explores the
application of deterrence theory at the **sub-conventional
level**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} specific [context of
Russia]{.underline} as a state actor [and its]{.underline} use of a
[gray zone strategy]{.underline}. It considers the [value of
**tailoring** a deterrent strategy against Russian gray zone conflict by
**supplementing** conventional deterrence with]{.underline}
"**[cumulative deterrence]{.underline}**." Recall that any deterrence
strategy relies on sufficient capabilities, solid resolve, and strong
communication of a threat, which in turn create credibility.225
[Cumulative deterrence]{.underline}, elaborated in the following
paragraphs, [introduces the idea that **credibility** can
be]{.underline} **[sustained]{.underline}** [across **multiple
encounters** even if deterrence fails in **certain
instances**]{.underline}, [vis-à-vis **classic**
**zero-tolerance**]{.underline} [nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

Regarding tailoring deterrence, Bunn writes, "If deterrence is about
influencing the perceptions---and ultimately, the decisions and
actions---of another party, it is logical that the [requirements for
deterrence will differ with each]{.underline} party that we might try to
deter and may well differ in each [circumstance or
scenario]{.underline}."226 [**Adapting deterrence** to the
**subconventional level**]{.underline} [requires an understanding of the
unique relationship between the states to identify the relative
stability and instability that can inform deterrence
strategy.]{.underline}

The [stability--instability paradox applies to the **nuclear** and
**conventional**]{.underline} [level]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
indeed, [Russia's effort to]{.underline} **[avoid]{.underline}**
[conventional-level warfare with the United States **strengthens
stability** between the states at the]{.underline} **[conventional
level]{.underline}** similar to the strategic nuclear level. While
U.S.--Russian nuclear stability is based on parity, conventional
stability in this relationship is more complex. As shown in Chapter II,
Russia has a strong aversion to conflict with the United States and NATO
at the conventional level. Russia would be outmatched in military
superiority after two to three weeks of conflict and beyond its near
abroad and, thus, prefers to operate at the sub-conventional level below
the threshold of armed conflict.227 In effect, [Russia's strategy of
**avoiding** any actions that might trigger **conventional
conflict**]{.underline} [aims to bolster a sort of "**firewall**"
between]{.underline} [conventional warfare and gray zone
conflict]{.underline}. [NATO, up to now, has **effectively obliged**
this Russian strategy by **not brandishing threats of conventional
escalation**]{.underline} [in response to Russian gray zone aggression,
**let alone undertaking conventional responses.** As much as
[Russia]{.mark} seeks **to avoid escalation** to conventional warfare it
could not win, it [is]{.mark} also [learning]{.mark} [**how averse NATO
is** to **threaten**]{.mark} **such [escalation]{.mark}**. This aversion
is **ironic**]{.underline} insofar as Cold War--era extended deterrence
relied on NATO's threat of escalatory nuclear responses to conventional
attacks.

[These respective]{.underline} [Russian and [NATO posture]{.mark}s
**enhance conventional stability**]{.underline}, [but at the **cost** of
**[fuel]{.mark}ing [instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[at the **gray
zone**]{.mark} **level**]{.underline}, [reflecting a form of the
stability-- instability paradox familiar in nuclear
strategies]{.underline}. This tailored application of the stability--
instability paradox to the specific Russian context yields a tiered
relationship of stability between the United States and Russia at each
level of warfare, as depicted in Figure 1, and helps explain why the
United States and Russia are the most unstable at the subconventional
level, on which this research focuses.

**[Cumulative deterrence]{.underline}** [may be an option to **address
the issues** created when adapting conventional deterrence to the
sub-conventional level]{.underline} including the credibility and
communication of the threat. Cumulative deterrence has not been a
standard element of U.S. deterrence strategy in the past, and there is
limited academic literature and strategic thought about its use in areas
outside of cyber and terrorism. However, this [new security environment
characterized by great power competition at levels **below open
conflict**]{.underline} [requires a **new way**]{.underline} [of looking
at the deterrence landscape at the]{.underline} **[sub-conventional
level]{.underline}**. [Subject matter experts for this research
confirm]{.underline} that [[a **zero-tolerance**]{.mark}
[deterrence]{.mark} mindset **[will not work]{.mark}** at the
sub-conventional level and that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [might [have to **choose**]{.mark} **[what
portions of]{.mark} the [gray zone it wants to deter]{.mark} because it
may be [difficult to deter everything]{.mark}.**]{.underline}229

There is a precedent for applying a cumulative model and mindset of
deterrence to limit and shape the sub-conventional level of conflict,
and this suggests it may also be applied to the current U.S. need to
deter Russia's gray zone conflict. According to Thomas Rid, [[cumulative
deterrence]{.mark} "consists of a series of acts of force to
create]{.underline}---[and [maintain]{.mark}]{.underline}--- [general
**[norms of behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for many political actors
[over]{.mark} an **[extended period.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Using
force,]{.underline} consequently, [does **not** represent a principal
**failure of deterrence**]{.underline} [but its **maintenance** through
**swift**]{.underline}, **[certain]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline}
**[measured]{.underline}** [responses]{.underline}."230 Cumulative
deterrence has been a key part of Israel's strategy for decades and was
developed in the conventional and subconventional level focusing on
limiting and shaping ongoing conflicts against both state and non-state
actors at the conventional and sub-conventional level.231 In addition,
cumulative deterrence has recently been considered for use in deterring
terrorism and cyberattacks, as it is designed for long-term sustained
conflict, such as competition in the gray zone.232

Doron Almong describes cumulative deterrence as functioning on two
levels: the macro, which creates an image of overwhelming military
superiority, and the micro, which relies on responses to adversarial
actions.233 Almong also explains that cumulative deterrence has three
key features.

First, its [effectiveness is measured in terms of the number of
victories **accumulated** over the **duration** of the
conflict,]{.underline} which might be envisioned as "assets in a victory
bank." Second, [over time, these victories produce]{.underline}
**[increasingly moderate behavior]{.underline}** [on the part of the
adversary and a shift in its **strategic**]{.underline},
**[operational]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[tactical
goals]{.underline}** [until there is a **near-absence** of **direct
conflict.**]{.underline} Third, [this moderation may **eventually**
result in **political negotiations** and perhaps even a **peace
agreement**.]{.underline}234 Almong is describing cumulative deterrence
as applied to the conventional level of warfare; however, in the context
of Russia, the construct can be transposed to the subconventional level.
[At the sub-conventional level, [U.S. responses over time]{.mark} to
Russian gray zone aggression [could **moderate Russian
behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [causing a **shift** in Russia's
**decision calculus** and **strategic goals,** thereby
**[diminishing]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The advantage of layering a strong conventional deterrence strategy with
cumulative deterrence is that it allows the restoration of deterrence
over time if conventional threats fail to deter at the sub-conventional
level. **[Over time]{.underline}**, [cumulative deterrence responses to
gray zone actions **[bolster]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}ibility**]{.underline} [[of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and **alter Russia's decision calculus**]{.underline}
[at the sub-conventional level, therefore **[strengthening]{.mark}
[deterrence overall]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**Successful deterrence**
at the **sub-conventional level** requires]{.mark} a
**[reorientation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in how the U.S. **views
deterrence**]{.underline}, [moving [from a **zero-tolerance
strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} the [**long-term**
attrition]{.mark} of gray zone conflict]{.underline}. [This renewed
mindset allows for **tailored** punitive]{.underline} [strategies that
**over time** **limit the bounds**]{.underline} [of the gray zone
through the **reiteration** of **unacceptable behavior**]{.underline}
through punishment. Regardless of the level at which a state wishes to
conduct warfare, all deterrence strategies rely on three aspects that
must work in concert: sufficient capabilities, solid credibility, and
strong communication of a threat.235 As Rid explains,
[[confrontations]{.mark} should be "seen as necessary evils that should
be kept on **as low a level as possible**, **but that [could not be
pushed]{.mark} down [to zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}."236 This argument
assumes escalation control, which is to say that the United States can
control escalation at the sub-conventional level on its own terms.

Many authors challenge the notion of escalation control, claiming that
it is risky and nearly impossible. Scholars claim that avoiding
escalation requires deterring the action and that a policy to deter one
action could in fact risk escalation to another. Additionally, scholars
claim, "Escalation control or management is an inherently imperfect
business. It can be done well or poorly, but it is extremely rare for
any set of policies to eliminate the risk of significant escalation
altogether."237 These same scholars agree that the risk of inadvertent
escalation can be reduced, but they are concerned that policy makers are
incorrectly assuming it can be eliminated altogether.238 The concerns
over escalation control are valid; however, it is possible to control
escalation and use the threat of escalation to bolster deterrence.
Mazarr explains that the gray zone puts the defender in the position to
escalate, which is part of the challenge of deterrence.239 Both
escalation control and deterrence fundamentally rely on communication
and a thorough understanding of the adversary. Proper communication of
the capability and the resolve to use the capability to deny or punish
an action are just as crucial to escalation control as they are to
deterrence. The same scholars who express concerns over escalation
control also admit there is a way to control the risk: "Escalation
depends heavily on an astute understanding of how the adversary will
perceive and interpret events that have not yet occurred---not only in a
general sense, but also under the specific and often
difficult-to-predict conditions that will shape the opponent's
perceptions and responses when a particular event occurs."240 The United
States can both mitigate escalation and contribute to deterrence by
adding an element of ambiguity to its deterrence threats that leave
something to chance but also allow a response that limits or controls
the escalatory response of the adversary.

When the United States responds with an instrument of state power in any
DIME category, such as the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats in response
to the Russian nerve agent attack on a British citizen in 2018, it can
strengthen cumulative deterrence credibility. Some of the literature on
cumulative deterrence suggests that deterrence works by banking "wins"
by responding to events with military power. However, when adapted to
the gray zone, it seems critical that all elements of state power must
be utilized, not just the military[. The military is
**sometimes**]{.underline}---**[not always]{.underline}**---[an
appropriate response to an action in the gray zone]{.underline}, [so
[threatening military retaliation for]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**every
tactic** in the gray zone is **not credible**]{.underline}]{.mark};
however, a state must still have the ability to impose costs on an
adversary for an action to make cumulative deterrence successful.

the Pew Research Center revealed a worrying trend: While NATO is
generally seen in a positive light across publics within the alliance (a
median of 53 percent view NATO positively, though with double-digit
percentage point declines in Germany and France over the past 10 years),
many in 16 surveyed NATO countries seem reluctant to fulfill Article V
collective defense obligations. A median of 50 percent across 16 NATO
member countries is against their country defending an ally, while only
38 percent express willingness to come to help a fellow ally.

Future Defense Spending in Peril right, especially in the context of the
short- and long-term consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
While the scope of the economic impact is still unclear, it is likely to
reshuffle financial priorities in NATO countries. Defense ministries
will find it more difficult to reach the 2 percent spending level by
2024 or even to maintain the current defense expenditures programs.
Moreover, with economies put to halt and eventual drops in national GDP,
even if countries fulfill the 2 percent pledge, they could end up
spending less in real terms. If NATO members continue to frame fairness
in terms of the 2 percent defense spending target, it will further
aggravate the burden-sharing problem, seriously test NATO solidarity,
and ultimately endanger the alliance's ability to adapt to the
increasingly unpredictable security environment and the changing nature
of security threats.

### AT: Process/Conditions CP\-\--2AC

#### Cumbersome approval processes bad\-\--wreck effective cyber policy

**Schneider '22** \[Jacquelyn; April 25; assistant professor and
affiliate faculty at the Center for Cyber Conflict Studies at the U.S.
Naval War College; Wall Street Journal; "The Biden White House\'s
Cyberwarfare Power Grab," Factiva\]

To most onlookers, the U.S. appears to be in the midst of a successful
cyber defense campaign against Russia. As Gen. Paul Nakasone, commander
of U.S. Cyber Command, recently testified before Congress, the U.S.
military is deploying military members to the region to sit \"side by
side with our partners.\" Cyber Command has also \"crafted options for
national decision makers\" and is \"conducting operations as directed.\"
Yet at a pivotal time in Ukrainian cyber defense, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
reportedly [[considering a proposal to take away]{.underline}
[Defense]{.underline}]{.mark} Department [[authorities to conduct
o]{.underline}]{.mark}ffensive [[c]{.underline}]{.mark}yber
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}peration[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} and reinstate a
centralized approval process from the White House. This would be a
mistake.

[[All departments and agencies within the federal government operate
under different authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}, delegated from the
president through executive policies and from Congress through law.
These define what an organization can and can\'t do and when it needs to
ask for permission. In a conflict or military campaign, the president
(and sometimes Congress) delegates authorities to the Defense Department
to conduct operations.

[[Offensive cyber operations didn\'t quite fit under existing military
authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}, so the Obama administration created
Presidential Policy Directive 20 in 2012. This directive created a
centralized interagency review process to approve offensive cyber
operations and gave other government organizations a veto over military
cyber operations. The review process was slow, deliberative and prone to
internecine fights: The [[intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} community
[[didn\'t want to cede control over cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}
operations; the diplomatic community worried over implications for
international partnerships; the Pentagon was eager to come off the cyber
sidelines. Not surprisingly, few if any offensive cyber operations made
it through the review process, despite significant cyber incidents such
as North Korea\'s hack of Sony in 2014 and Russia\'s cyber-enabled
election interference in 2016. When Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) asked
Gen. Nakasone in April about military offensive cyber operations under
PPD-20, he replied, \"I know of no effects operations ever conducted
prior to 2018.\"

For the Obama administration, military cyber restraint was an acceptable
hedge against the risk of escalation. Faced with uncertainty about
responses to cyberattacks, the administration chose to err on the side
of inaction.

That perception of [[cyber risk changed during]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration---and [[so did the
military\'s cyber authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}. While National
Security Presidential Memorandum 13 remains classified, U.S. officials\'
public statements suggest [[the policy delegates authorities to the
Defense Department to conduct \"time-sensitive\"]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**ffensive **[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**yber
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**perations [[without a **cumbersome**
interagency approval process]{.underline}]{.mark}. Concurrently,
Congress delegated authorities to the Pentagon in the 2019 National
Defense Authorization Act to conduct \"military activity and operations
in cyberspace,\" [[including \"active defense\" against China, Russia,
North Korea and Iran.]{.underline}]{.mark} The act went on to define
this as traditional military activity not subject to a presidential
finding, which is required for covert action.

In the decade since the Obama administration began defining U.S.
offensive cyber policy, [cyberspace has become less
uncertain]{.underline}. Academic research and the emerging lessons from
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine suggest that cyber operations don\'t
escalate to violence. Case studies, data analyses, experiments and war
games all show the Obama administration\'s fears about cyber escalation
were misplaced.

Cyberspace isn\'t the \"Wild West.\" [[Norms are being
developed]{.underline}]{.mark}---both tacitly as actors operate and
explicitly as states agree on formal cyber rules. The lack of violent
responses to cyber operations, for example, suggests that states view
cyberspace differently than conventional uses of force. And a United
Nations Group of General Experts on cyberspace (which includes the U.S.,
China and Russia) agreed in 2021 that cyberattacks against critical
infrastructure before violent conflict is inappropriate.

[We know more about when and how cyber operations are most effective.
They are best for espionage, perception shaping, or creating
fog,]{.underline} [friction and uncertainty]{.underline}, all of which
are most effective at the early stages of conflict. [Gaining access to
networks and exploiting their weaknesses requires large investments,
which is why highly centralized operations with tight control struggle
to keep pace as network configurations change, patches are implemented,
or other new controls are adopted]{.underline}. Ukraine has proved that
bottom-up adaptation and experimentation are key to success, especially
in cyberspace.

Critics argue that [current cyber authorities gave the Pentagon free
rein to conduct whatever offensive cyber operations it deems
useful]{.underline}. But given how little evidence we\'ve seen of U.S.
offensive cyber operations in the general public, this is likely an
exaggeration. [[Instead of taking away these authorities, the White
House should clearly communicate what the Defense Department can do in
cyberspace]{.underline}]{.mark} before a declared war or conflict and,
as important, what it will not do. Finally, we should be wary of turning
cyber authorities into a partisan debate.

security," Journal of International Relations and Development volume 18,
pages52--74 (2015),
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jird.2013.22

[With regard to ontological security, the distinction between security
and insecurity is]{.underline} the more **[critical]{.underline}** one.
[In a state of **ontological insecurity,**]{.underline} [the Self
experiences **instability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[uncertainty of being]{.underline}**. [Ontological insecurity refers
to a]{.underline} [state of **disruption**]{.underline} [where the Self
has **lost its anchor**]{.underline} [for the definition of its
identity]{.underline} [and,]{.underline} consequently, [its ability to
sustain a narrative and answer questions about doing, acting, and being
(]{.underline}Kinnvall 2004). It may arise from deep uncertainty (Mitzen
2006a) and/or from the failure to have its sense of Self affirmed by
others (Zarakol 2010). [Conversely, in a state of ontological security,
the Self experiences a **stable**, **certain**, and **consistent**
social existence]{.underline}, [where it remains in control about its
identity and capacity for action]{.underline}. While I do not rule out
the possibility of a state of ontological asecurity, where the Self is
simply not concerned with the stability and certainty of its identity, I
do not explore this possibility and how it varies across different
states of physical security in this article.

Having identified different states of physical and ontological security,
I make the further assumption that [since **ontological** and
**physical** security]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}**, [states of security do not vary
**uniformly** across the ontological and physical layers of
security.]{.underline} [One can be at a state of physical insecurity
while being at a state of ontological security, and vice
versa.]{.underline} Consequently, Table 1 charts out the four possible
states of security based on the conception of security as both
ontological and physical.

[The [state of **ontological
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[/[physical
(in)security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} one [where]{.mark} [the
Self experiences concern about]{.mark} **[physical
harm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and uncertainty [of its
**being**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ontological insecurity **tempts
actors** to engage in practices that mark Others as not only
**different**]{.underline}, [but also as **morally
inferior**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[threatening]{.underline}**
(Campbell 1992). **[[Ontological]{.mark} insecurity [and physical
(in)security reproduce one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[As actors
**seek ontological security**]{.mark} [through **constructing Others
as**]{.mark} **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to their
security-as-survival]{.underline}, [[they **mobilise**]{.mark} **their
[physical defences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[pursuit of
physical security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through representing the
sources of threat as **different** and **morally
inferior.**]{.underline}

[Similarly, in a state of ontological security/physical (in)security,
actors experience stability and certainty of being in a relationship
where the Other is constructed as threat to their security-as-survival.
Consequently, they remain locked]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
**[conflict-producing routines]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[maintain their certainty of being]{.underline}** (Mitzen 2006a). In
protracted conflicts such as in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine, this state
of security sustains a stable Self/Other relationship based on enemy
roles. [When in such a state of security, minority and majority groups,
migrants and host societies perceive and represent each other's
identities as radically different and inherently incompatible, and
reproduce these perceptions and representations through acts of
securitisation]{.underline} [in order to **ensure their ontological
security**.]{.underline} The states of ontological insecurity/physical
(in)security and ontological security/physical (in)security are both
securitised states; however, whereas the former compels actors to
construct new narratives of difference and threat and engage in the
securitisation of new issues to regain their certainty and stability of
being, the latter compels actors to reproduce the existing narratives
and continue the securitisation of existing differences and conflicts to
maintain it.

[[The state of **ontological security**/**physical asecurity**
is]{.mark} certainly **the [most attractive]{.mark} state of
security**]{.underline} [from a **normative**]{.underline} [point of
view]{.underline}. [[**Security communities** in i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations]{.underline}, and in particular, the European non-war
community (Wæver 1998) and the Nordic community (Browning and Joenniemi
2012) [[constitute the best examples]{.mark} of such a state of security
in international relations.]{.underline} [[A **collective identity
discourse**]{.underline} [makes it possible]{.underline} ]{.mark}[for
states in security communities [to maintain]{.mark} the [us/them]{.mark}
[distinctions]{.mark}, which are]{.underline}
[**[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
**certainty** and **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
being]{.underline}]{.mark}, [while remaining in a state of **physical
asecurity** vis-à-vis one another]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006b; Browning
and Joenniemi 2012). [[In this state]{.mark} of security, **[conflicts
are sustainably resolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [issues that have
propelled conflict in the past are either **settled**]{.underline} [or
have **[shed]{.mark} their [physical
security-ness]{.mark},**]{.underline} [and are negotiated in normal
political channels]{.underline}. Yet, identity differences maintain
their ontological security-ness as groups reproduce their distinct
identities through various social and cultural practices.

### AT: Turf Wars DA\-\--2AC

#### Squo causes turf wars\-\--NSA and Cyber Command compete for priority, and NSA's veto power over OCO's both distracts from effective NSA law enforcement and rapid, effective cyber operations 

**Schoka '19** \[Andrew; April 3; active duty Army cyber operations

CYBERSPACE: TIME TO END THE DUAL HAT,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/cyber-command-the-nsa-and-operating-in-cyberspace-time-to-end-the-dual-hat/\]

However, though Cyber Command and NSA share technical similarities in
their operations, they operate under distinct legal authorities for
different purposes. **[[NSA]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[with authority
from Title 50]{.underline}]{.mark} of the U.S. Code, [[is responsible
for conducting sig]{.underline}]{.mark}nals
[[int]{.underline}]{.mark}elligence [[collection]{.underline}]{.mark},
which involves accessing computer networks for the purpose of secretly
gathering information from them. Conversely, [[Cyber Command primarily
derives its authority from Title 10]{.underline}]{.mark} and is
responsible for conducting military computer network operations, which
involves accessing computer networks for the purpose of creating
noticeable effects on them. These effects, which are intended to support
a specific military objective, are typically one of the "5 Ds": deny,
degrade, disrupt, deceive, or destroy. This subtle, yet important,
distinction between the two organizations' authorities and missions is
critical to understanding the sometimes contentious relationship between
Cyber Command and NSA. Cyber Command, in its earliest days, was
essentially an organizational arm of NSA established to provide legality
for conducting operations that [[NSA possessed the technical capability
to execute, but not the legal authority]{.underline}]{.mark}. While some
of Cyber Command's recent operational successes against adversaries have
made headlines, NSA's operations have not --- and that's exactly how it
ought to be.

The dual hat arrangement was never intended to be permanent. The
guidance that President Barack Obama issued after signing the 2017
National Defense and Authorization Act clearly stated the commander in
chief's desire to see the two organizations separated. That NDAA
established a specific set of criteria to terminate the dual hat
relationship. A number of these criteria are easily quantifiable and
have already been met, such as Cyber Command's mission forces achieving
full operational capability. Others, however, are more difficult to
objectively assess, such as ensuring that "robust command and control
systems and processes have been established for planning, deconflicting,
and executing military cyber operations." These are systems and
capabilities that continue to be developed out by Cyber Command with
significant influence and assistance from NSA.

[[Cyber Command's current approach to conducting computer network
operations focuses heavily on the review and approval
process.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[In addition to ensuring legal
complianc]{.underline}]{.mark}e with the myriad authorities and orders
pertaining to cyberspace operations, **[[review processes focus on risk
management]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Strategic-level operations
conducted by Cyber Command undergo exhaustive
review]{.underline}]{.mark} and approval processes meant to minimize
risk to tradecraft, capabilities, and security. [[Operational security
is of critical importance]{.underline}]{.mark} to cyberspace operations,
where the efficacy of a weapon system hinges upon its ability to operate
secretly. In 2016, a hacking group known as the Shadow Brokers published
cyber tools and capabilities that allegedly belonged to NSA, causing
profound damage to the agency's ability to conduct operations.

For every operation Cyber Command executes, joint leaders and operations
planners must meticulously calculate and evaluate the risk associated
with that particular operation. This is an exceedingly complicated task
that requires detailed knowledge of the operations planning and approval
process, in addition to technical familiarity with the underlying
technologies associated with the operation. In developing this process,
Cyber Command has relied heavily on the experience of NSA, using similar
processes to ensure that risk is minimized. In so doing, Cyber Command
has inadvertently patterned its own appetite for risk after NSA's. But
while NSA's operations are conducted with scrupulous operational
security, intelligence collection is not the primary mission of Cyber
Command. In the words of Gen. Paul Nakasone, Cyber Command's primary
mission is to impose costs on adversaries who have acted in the
cyberspace domain without fear of retaliation. Imposing cost implies
inflicting noticeable damage to a target in a manner that would
typically be considered too noisy, risky, or noticeable in signals
intelligence operations.

When conducting offensive cyberspace operations, there are essentially
two ways to acquire access to a target system: using credentials to
masquerade as a legitimate user, and using a vulnerability to exploit a
system. In a masquerade, an attacker uses valid credentials, such as a
username and password, to log in to the target system as an authorized
user. Masquerade attacks are usually difficult to detect because they
rely on the system behaving the way it's supposed to. Conversely, an
exploit relies on the existence of a technical vulnerability that allows
an attacker to gain unauthorized access to a system. Exploitation relies
on a system functioning incorrectly, and is significantly more likely to
produce alerts that can expose an attack.

To assess the risk associated with these types of operations, [[Cyber
Command solicits approval from an array of staffs and
reviewers]{.underline}]{.mark}. In part because Cyber Command has relied
heavily on NSA training, support, and experience to establish these
processes, exploitation operations --- which by nature carry a greater
risk of detection --- are subject to increased standards of scrutiny.
Likewise, operations that produce a noticeable effect, such as a
denial-of-service attack, are typically viewed with aversion. This is
detrimental to Cyber Command's execution of its mission, as producing
the desired outcomes against an adversary requires assuming more risk.
In reality, the operations approval structure of Cyber Command is set up
to prioritize the security of operations above all else, and is
extremely risk-averse. Cyber Command's mission is fundamentally
different than NSA's, and rather than copying approval processes used in
intelligence operations, it ought to employ a structure more typical of
a military command. However, as long as it relies on NSA tradecraft and
expertise Cyber Command will continue to use a paradoxical operations
process that is fundamentally opposed to the exact type of mission it is
charged with conducting.

The review process for a Cyber Command operation also requires an
equities review by a multitude of government, intelligence, and military
stakeholders. The idea is that all relevant parties have an opportunity
to address potential concerns with a proposed offensive cyberspace
operation. While one of the principal original concerns with the dual
hat arrangement was the potential for unfair prioritization of Cyber
Command support requests to the NSA, the equities review process has
instead created the opposite problem. [[Because Cyber Command depends so
heavily on NSA logistical and operational support, it has essentially
lent the agency de facto veto authority on offensive cyberspace
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}: **[[Cyber Command risks losing
NSA-facilitated training]{.underline}]{.mark}**, NSA-provided office
space, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[access to NSA's signals
intelligence data by bickering with NSA over who get a shot at a given
targets]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The responsibility of balancing the
prioritization of the distinct missions of two different organizations
should not be delegated to a single individual. Doing so inevitably
privileges one mission at the other's expense, and ultimately impedes
overall progress for both.

The self-defeating nature of the dual hat also runs contrary to
America's increasingly risk-tolerant approach to countering adversary
competition in cyberspace. Analysts have repeatedly advocated that the
United States take a more proactive approach to cyberspace operations.
The summary of the 2018 Department of Defense Cyber Strategy shifts
toward a focus on "defending forward," establishing a more aggressive
stance in cyber operations through a policy of embracing constant
forward contact. The strategy explicitly replaces the previous focus on
risk mitigation and escalation control with a risk-acceptant commitment
to "assertively defend our interests." The strategy indicates that the
Department of Defense will "accept and manage operational and
programmatic risk in a deliberate manner that moves from a 'zero defect'
culture to one that fosters agility and innovation." The document
acknowledges the risk inherent to the conduct of cyberspace operations,
but ultimately accepts the possibility of operational failure as a
necessary consequence of deterring adversary competition in cyberspace.
Shifting to a more proactive stance with military cyberspace operations
is not a provocative overreaction to malicious activity, nor does it
reasonably stand to elicit an escalatory response from adversaries.
Rather, shifting Cyber Command away from a risk-averse mindset is a
recognition of an increasingly contested information environment in
which the command is at serious risk of being outpaced and outplayed in
its current state.

[[The missions of NSA and Cyber Command will continue to compete for
priority and advocacy under the dual hat.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[The
shaping effect of this relationship has diminished Cyber Command's
appetite for risk, and **slowed the approval process for military
cyberspace operations to a sluggish crawl.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[What
takes adversaries mere minutes to do takes Cyber Command
weeks]{.underline}]{.mark}, or even months. In the cyberspace domain,
where windows of opportunity for an operation can be vanishingly small,
Cyber Command's review and approval processes need a paradigm shift. NSA
has been instrumental to the development of Cyber Command, and the
existence of the command, as well as its operational successes, are a
credit to NSA's diligent work to establish and support a military
presence in cyberspace. However, as has been echoed by previous
presidential administrations, [[the time has come to allow Cyber Command
to stand on its own]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[and free NSA from the
responsibility of nurturing a full-fledged combatant
command]{.underline}]{.mark}** in addition to pursuing its own mission.

#### 2018 DoD Cyber Strategy thumps\-\--and ensures effective relationships that solve turf wars

**Herr '18** \[Trey and Jacquelyn Schneider; Oct 10; visiting fellow at
the Hoover Institution; assistant professor and affiliate faculty at the
Center for Cyber Conflict Studies at the U.S. Naval War College;
"Sharing is Caring: The United States' New Cyber Commitment for NATO,"
https://www.cfr.org/blog/sharing-caring-united-states-new-cyber-commitment-nato\]

Given the recent blockbuster headlines about alleged Chinese snooping on
server hardware sold to major technology companies and the latest
joint-denunciation of Russian cyber operations, you could be forgiven
for having missed an important NATO-related development. The Associated
Press reports that the U.S. Defense Department will announce a new
commitment to use offensive and defensive cybersecurity capabilities on
behalf of NATO allies.

[The new commitment is notable given how cybersecurity has long been
treated as an exceptional domain of operations]{.underline}, and cyber
capabilities reserved as strategic national assets to be shared with
only the closest of allies. With this announcement, [the Pentagon is
suggesting that cyber capabilities might be used alongside]{.underline}
[conventional weapons with allies and]{.underline} indeed, [equal weight
appears to be given to offensive and defensive operations]{.underline}.
Perhaps most significantly, the announcement [[moves NATO partners
closer to what has been a **tight**]{.mark} [**coterie** of
U.S.-favored]{.mark} signals intelligence [partners]{.mark}]{.underline}
such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada.

[[The DoD announcement is a sign of the continued]{.underline}]{.mark},
if nascent, [[normalization of cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} under
the current administration and in Europe. Even where offensive cyber
operations may not rise to the level of war, they provide
decision-makers with options to influence the geopolitical environment.
[[This aligns with recent trends in the U.S. military to integrate cyber
capabilities into maneuver units and large
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}, and reflects the shift towards more risk
acceptant and offensive measures to counter cyberattacks found in the
2018 DoD Cyber Strategy.

[[Moving cyber]{.mark} capabilities [into the same strategic
frame]{.mark} as conventional weapons]{.underline},
[especially]{.underline} [**[with NATO]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
[[reflects a **shift** in **institutional**]{.mark} **cyber
[arrangements]{.mark}**]{.underline} **[within the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[and the **growing**]{.mark} **[power of the
military]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[relative to]{.mark} the
[intelligence]{.mark} community]{.underline}. For the United States,
cyber capabilities have always had a complicated relationship with the
intelligence community, in particular the National Security Agency
(NSA). [[When **Cyber Command** stood up]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2010 as
a sub-unified combatant command [[within the
**D**]{.underline}]{.mark}epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense, [[it moved into the **NSA's
headquarters**]{.underline}, [staffed its]{.underline}]{.mark}
[management [ranks with longtime NSA employees]{.mark}, [borrowed
networks and technical capabilities, and]{.mark} to this day [shares a
dual-hatted commander]{.mark}. In the immediate years after the command
was created, it was logical that [the]{.mark} [structure of partnerships
with allies looked more like the **special signals
intel**]{.mark}**ligence** relationships formed around the
NSA]{.underline} rather than traditional alliance networks in NATO and
Asia. [[The]{.mark} recent [announcement **aligns cyber**]{.mark}
**operations [more closely with]{.mark} [D]{.mark}**epartment
**[o]{.mark}**f **[D]{.mark}**efense]{.underline}
**[[missions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[which are more **likely to
posture capabilities** for **deterrent effects**]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[than intelligence missions]{.underline}**, which view capabilities as
assets to be carefully husbanded.

[Treating cybersecurity capabilities more like conventional arms and
less like national assets also helps drive the integration of cyber
operations into the planning and execution of a broader array of
conventional military missions.]{.underline} Early cyber operations were
largely conventional espionage and surveillance activities supercharged
by the spread of computing and the internet. In the United States, this
led to the creation of large and complex software tools, carefully
guarded by the intelligence community as national assets (sometimes
unsuccessfully). The DoD's announcement indicates a move towards
treating at least some of these capabilities, along with their
supporting infrastructure, more like conventional armaments and making
them available for broader use; a model closer to Central or Special
Operations Command and less like the National Security Agency.

The Pentagon's new commitment also reflects changes in how Europe talks
about cybersecurity and characterizes the Russian [threat. The last two
years have seen a trend toward more open discussion of **o**ffensive
**c**yber **o**peration**s**]{.underline} and the possibility of [[the
alliance adopting]{.underline}]{.mark} [[more
assertive]{.underline}]{.mark} postures to counter cyber operations
against its members. After years of devastating ransomware attacks and
cyber-enabled information attacks, NATO members are more willing to
explore cyber triggers to Article 5. They have also been more willing to
articulate the cyber threat against the alliance. In addition to last
week's denunciation by Dutch, UK, and U.S. authorities, Russian state
actors are widely suggested to be responsible for an increasingly brazen
series of operations, including targeting German government ministries,
French and British TV stations, and more.

[Sharing offensive cyber capabilities raises the question of whether
cyber operations can extend effective deterrence to NATO
partners]{.underline}. There seems to be little focus on using these
operations to deter conventional or nuclear attacks on NATO countries,
but this may evolve. **[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[seems to want NATO to
use]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[cyber]{.mark} operations [to deter other
cyber op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [particularly those
**[falling under the threshold of armed conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Cyber operations have all sorts of problems for deterrence: signaling is
difficult, they can be perceived as a cheap threat, and their effects
are largely uncertain. By contrast, moving new military forces in
Eastern Europe or conducting ground exercises are credible signals of
extended deterrence, but are costly and time consuming. [Cyber
capabilities aren't free, nor are they necessarily cheap, but [the
**promise** to use them can add **new credibility to a deterrent
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [without the same investment and delay as
conventional alternatives.]{.underline} **[[Sharing cyber]{.mark}
capabilities [may be a cheaper way]{.mark} [to signal alliance
commitment]{.mark} than other options [and might
signal]{.mark}]{.underline}** a further **[[maturation]{.mark}, and
acceptance, of cybersecurity into geopolitics]{.underline}**.

This past month, buried beneath an ant mound of political scandal and
news cacophony, President [[Trump set in motion a plan to gut]{.mark}
**[P]{.mark}**]{.underline}residential **[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**olicy
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**irective [[20, **a**]{.mark}n Obama-era
[policy limiting]{.mark} the use of destructive **[offensive
cyber]{.mark}weapons** like Stuxnet]{.underline}. What exactly will
replace PPD-20 remains clouded in uncertainty, but [one thing seems
clear: **The [military's gloves are off]{.mark}**. Without PPD-20, the
U.S. military [can]{.mark} now use **[hack]{.mark}**ing weapons
[with]{.mark} **far [less oversight]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the
State Department, Commerce Department, and intelligence agencies. [A
paper released earlier this year by U.S. **[Cyber Com]{.mark}**mand, the
**hacking arm** of the U.S. military, [outlines]{.mark} a **proposed
policy** of **[increased]{.mark} military [intervention]{.mark}**, and
paints a landscape of nations under constant cyberassault]{.underline}.
It's not a stretch to say the removal of PPD-20 may fundamentally
restructure the way America conducts war in cyberspace. Whether or not
that is a good thing depends on whom you ask.

"What [[this is]{.mark} all [about is **streamlining**]{.mark} the
**process** [and giving]{.mark} the military [permission]{.mark} to use
cyberweapons under certain circumstances [without]{.mark} having to go
through a **[cumbersome]{.mark} process of [coordination]{.mark}** with
all the different agencies]{.underline}," former Navy Captain Gail
Harris says. In conversation, Harris, who was involved in cyberdefense
for the Department of Defense, echoed the arguments laid forth by Cyber
Command in its paper. In that document, Cyber Command describes
cyberspace as an "active and contested operational space in which
superiority is always at risk." Whether you like it or not, Cyber
Command argues, we are currently engaged in a persistent war of code
with adversaries continuously attacking and entrenching themselves deep
in American networks. The brisk nine-page document details a world under
constant subversion. These ["persistent threats," **[Cyber
Com]{.mark}**mand argues, require **swift** and **aggressive** military
responses in kind]{.underline}. Be they Russian and Iranian state
hackers, terrorists, or hacktivists, [the document [blames]{.mark}
**bureaucratic [red tape]{.mark}** [and **political
hand-holding**]{.mark} for much of America's recent cyber
woes]{.underline}.

"We cede our freedom of action with lengthy approval processes that
delay US responses or set a very high threshold for responding to
malicious cyber activity," the vision statement reads.

[If Cyber Command **has its way**, it will also be able to
**transition** its **fundamental role** from defense to potentially more
**offensive** campaigns]{.underline}. Cyber Command says it wants to
"expand the military options available to national leaders," and "defend
forward as close as possible to the origin of adversary activity." [[The
move follows a]{.mark} **recent [trend]{.mark}** by officials geared
toward **strengthening Cyber Command** and [**granting** **it**]{.mark}
**far [more]{.mark}** offensive **[capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

While anyone losing hair over election hacking, foreign manipulation,
and electrical grid vulnerabilities may take some solace in sharpening
the military's cyber teeth, the prospect of a perpetual online war could
come with serious, sometimes unforeseen, consequences.

The Plunge Into Perpetual War

"We've slipped into permanent warfare," Columbia research scholar and
cybersecurity expert Jason Healey told Select All. "There is no winning
this war, it is happening online." Healey, who wrote the first history
of cyberconflict and previously worked on network defense for the
Pentagon, said he worried traditional military solutions may simply not
work to address cyberconflict. "[The [military is asking politicians to
**give**]{.mark} **them this [authority]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} then
**[get out of the way]{.mark}** forever]{.underline}. Once we have done
this, we are not going to be able to go back to the way it was before."

#### NSA lawyering will meet the [letter]{.underline} of the plan but they'll still find loopholes

**Schlanger '15** \[Margo, Professor of Law at the University of
Michigan Law School, and the founder and director of the Civil Rights
Litigation Clearinghouse., Intelligence Legalism and the National
Security Agency's Civil Liberties Gap\]

One key question about all this legal advice is whether it is ever
constraining---whether the lawyers ever tell their clients no. NSA's
lawyers do sometimes advise their clients/colleagues not to do specific
things. One released training document, for example, advises analysts
not to use certain search techniques, cautioning: "Do Not: Wildcard
domains. Wildcard user names. Wildcard across domains."149 One would
expect agency counsel to say no with relative ease where the rules are
clear and when those rules govern how and not whether a particular
activity can occur. It is crucial to remember, however, that agency
lawyer advice-giving is not adjudication and agency lawyers are not
judges. The judicial ideal of even-handedness is not, even
theoretically, applicable. Rather, the goal of legal advice for lawyers
within the Intelligence Community, as with any organization's lawyers,
is to assist the client. To quote the same senior IC lawyer, "you're
hoping to get done what your client wants to get done, so there's a
tendency to try to find the most room to get that done."150 Or, in the
less careful words of a former NSA chief analyst, "Look, [NSA has
**platoons of lawyers** and their entire job is figuring out how to
**stay within the law** and maximize collection by **exploiting every
loophole**]{.underline}." 151 Unsurprisingly, then, [some training
slides that say no also include work-arounds---methods for achieving
various searching or analytic goals that are not covered by the stricter
FISA rules]{.underline}.152

#### No OCrime impact

Stewart **Patrick 17**, James H. Binger Senior Fellow in Global
Governance and Director of the International Institutions and Global
Governance Program at the Council on Foreign Relations, Fall, "Civil
Wars & Transnational Threats: Mapping the Terrain, Assessing the Links,"
Daedalus, 146.4, 45-58

Here again, though, nuance is warranted[. Much of the [organized
crime]{.mark} in wartorn states [is localized]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the
[connections]{.mark} [between state failure]{.mark} and transnational
crime [vary]{.mark} depending on the type of criminal
activity.3]{.underline}7 Most countries experiencing civil war, for
instance, are not heavily implicated in illegal cross-border ventures
like human trafficking, money laundering, drug trafficking, or
environmental crime (to say nothing of intellectual property theft,
cybercrime, and manufacturing of counterfeit merchandise). [As with
terrorism, [it is not state failure that criminals find advantageous,
but]{.mark} a more [modest]{.mark} level of state [weakness:
collapsed]{.mark} and wartorn [states are]{.mark} generally [less
attractive]{.mark} than superficially functional states that maintain a
baseline level of political order and easy access to the infrastructure
of global commerce]{.underline}, [but also where corruption is
rife,]{.underline} the rule of law absent or imperfectly applied, and
gaps in public services and shortages in licit economic opportunities
provide openings for illicit actors. [[To sell]{.mark} illegal
[commodities and launder]{.mark} the [proceeds]{.mark},
[criminals]{.mark} [need]{.mark} secure [access to financial services
and]{.mark} modern [telecom]{.mark}- munications]{.underline}, banking,
and transportation. **[Such [requirements are]{.mark} often (though not
always) [lacking]{.mark} in war-torn states.]{.underline}** [In their
thirst for profits, [criminals may be drawn to]{.mark} a convenient
geographical base and [proximity to the]{.mark} global
[market]{.mark}place]{.underline}, even if it presents other risks.
[Such factors help explain why Mexico and South Africa --neither of
which is a war-torn or even fragile state--have emerged as hotbeds of
criminal activity and violence.38]{.underline}

[[The D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [S]{.mark}tate [works]{.mark}
closely]{.underline} with the Department of Treasury [[on **diplomatic
engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline} efforts [[to
counter]{.mark}]{.underline} the financing of [[terrorism]{.mark} with
countries and international organizations. [We]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[provide assistance to]{.mark}]{.underline} build the capacity of
partner [[countries]{.mark} around the world to]{.underline} help
[**strengthen their legal frameworks** [to prevent]{.mark}]{.underline}
money laundering and [[terrorist financing, **prosecute
criminals**]{.mark} **and terrorist financiers**, strengthen financial
regulatory institutions]{.underline} and [improve information sharing,
[and track]{.mark} suspicious [transactions]{.mark}]{.underline} that
could support criminal or terrorist activity. These activities require
constant interagency collaboration, as well as adaptation and
coordination with our foreign partners. Terrorist financing is a complex
and dynamic threat, and one that requires the U.S. Government to utilize
the full range of its tools. I sit in [the Bureau of Economic and
Business Affairs (EB)]{.underline} at the Department of State. We [help
coordinate Department of State policy on terrorist finance]{.underline}
among a number of regional and functional bureaus [and liaise
with]{.underline} our [interagency partners]{.underline}, including the
Department of Treasury and Department of Defense, [to shape the counter
ISIL finance campaign]{.underline} at the strategic level. My team in
[[EB]{.mark} also [coordinates]{.mark} **counter terrorist finance
sanctions**]{.underline} for the Department of State [and works
closely]{.underline} with other bureaus in the Department of State and
with the Department of Treasury [[to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} our
[[sanctions target]{.mark} individuals and [groups effectively]{.mark}
and in a way that promotes broader U.S. foreign policy
interests]{.underline}. The fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and
the Levant (ISIL) is one of our highest priorities, and it is my
principal counter-terrorist finance focus. [Our efforts to diminish
ISIL]{.underline}'s finances [illustrate [the D]{.mark}epartment
[o]{.mark}f [S]{.mark}tate's many tools to **[disrupt terrorist]{.mark}
groups' [financial networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and our work with
the interagency demonstrates how effectively [[we]{.underline}]{.mark}
can [[leverage the **full spectrum** of U.S.]{.mark} authorities and
[capabilities]{.mark} in]{.underline} pursuit of [this]{.underline}
important [goal]{.underline}. We have worked very closely with our
interagency colleagues, including those represented here today, since
2014 to disrupt ISIL's finances, and we can point to the real impact our
efforts and those of our coalition partners have had on ISIL's finances.
ISIL's revenues in 2014 and 2015 made it by far the richest terrorist
group in the world, and the sources of its revenues make it an unusual
counter-terrorist financing challenge. In 2015 ISIL earned at least \$1
billion, mostly through the production and sale of energy resources and
through extortion of the population in ISIL-controlled areas of Iraq and
Syria. ISIL likely made around \$500 million in 2015 from oil and gas
sales and about \$350 million from extortion. In addition to those two
large revenue streams, ISIL made at least several million from foreign
donations in 2014 and in 2015, between \$20 and \$45 million from
kidnapping for ransom in 2014 but less in 2015, and less than \$10
million from trafficking in antiquities. In 2014 and early 2015, when
ISIL seized cities throughout northern Iraq, it captured between \$500
million and \$1 billion dollars in Iraqi currency from local bank vaults
-- a one-time windfall and not a recurring source of revenue. Other
terrorist groups, including Al-Qaida, have traditionally raised funds
primarily by soliciting donations. ISIL, on the other hand, makes the
majority of its money from the territory it controls. This relative
financial self-reliance has hindered our ability to use our traditional
counter-terrorist finance tools and obliged us to develop creative
approaches to address each aspect of the problem. [U.S. and]{.underline}
coalition [[partner countries have]{.underline}]{.mark} adapted and
[**[pursued new strategies]{.mark}** to squeeze ISIL's ability to fund
its operations]{.underline}. Efforts to Disrupt ISIL's Finances As the
interagency co-lead of the counter-ISIL finance effort alongside the
Department of Treasury's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial
Crimes, we coordinate the Department of State's counter-ISIL finance
activities and leverage our diplomatic authorities and resources to
disrupt ISIL's finances. We work closely with our interagency partners
in the Departments of Treasury, Defense, Justice, Homeland Security, and
the Intelligence Community to coordinate this unique and challenging
mission. As a result of the efforts detailed below, [[we have seen a
**significant impact** on ISIL]{.mark}'s operations in Iraq and Syria.
ISIL has cut salary payments]{.underline} to its fighters in Raqqa and
Mosul [by fifty percent]{.underline}, leading many ISIL fighters to
defect and leave the battlefield. [ISIL has struggled to fulfill
its]{.underline} various [governance obligations such as basic services
to Iraqi and Syrian citizens in ISIL-controlled territory]{.underline}
due to stretched finances. ISIL has also increasingly resorted to the
theft of property and arbitrary "tax" increases to make up the funding
gap. Finally, [we have seen]{.underline} increasingly
[frequent]{.underline} incidents of [corruption within ISIL's ranks as
funds]{.underline} have [diminished]{.underline}. While encouraged by
these indications of financial stress, there is still much work to do
both in Iraq and Syria and around the world against ISIL's affiliates
and supporters.

### AT: Turkey DA\-\--2AC

#### Russian hybrid tactics threatens the unity and credibility of the alliance

Ivana **Stradner and** Max **Frost 2o**, Jeane Kirkpatrick fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute, senior research associate at the American
Enterprise Institute, NATO Has a New Weak Link for Russia to Exploit,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/22/north-macedonia-nato-russia/

In 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made it possible for
Adolf Hitler to march into Czechoslovakia despite the overwhelming
military superiority of Prague's Western allies because Chamberlain had
decided the issue was "a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of
whom we know nothing." Today, **[[it is]{.mark}]{.underline}** similarly
[[**difficult to believe that NATO would go to war** over]{.mark} its
far-flung commitments in [Eastern Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nevertheless]{.underline}, on March 27, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Western [[alliance]{.underline}]{.mark} [admitted North Macedonia as
its]{.underline} newest---and
[weakest]{.underline}---[member]{.underline}. In so doing, [it [has
given]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin a]{.mark}
terrific [opportunity to]{.mark} expand his influence]{.underline},
further [**[erode NATO's unity]{.underline}**, **[and test the bloc's
commitment]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to defend a member of the
alliance.]{.underline}

[[North Macedonia]{.mark} is the definition of a weak link and easy
pickings]{.underline} for an adversary. A landlocked country of 2
million inhabitants, it has weak political institutions and only a short
history of independence. As of 2018, it spent only 1 percent of its
GDP on defense---short of the 2 percent NATO guideline---and had
just 8,000 active-duty soldiers. [There is simmering communal tension
between a Slavic Orthodox majority and a sizable ethnic
Albanian]{.underline}, [mainly]{.underline} [Muslim]{.underline}
[minority]{.underline}, **[making it vulnerable to
interference]{.underline}**. Within NATO, [only]{.underline} neighboring
[Albania has a]{.underline} lower per capita GDP and a [higher level
of corruption]{.underline}. The Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy
Index ranks North Macedonia as having Europe's least developed political
culture.Russia has held massive war games that were only thinly
disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as Poland and the
Baltic States.

Moscow has viewed NATO's expansion in Eastern Europe with suspicion
since the 1990s. Yet it wasn't until the 2000s, after Russia's military
and economy rebounded from the chaos of the post-Soviet era, that Putin
declared NATO's eastward expansion a "direct threat" and openly
confronted the alliance. [Russia's invasion of
[Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2008---not coincidentally, the year
that NATO declared an interest in Georgia's eventual accession to the
alliance---[stopped the bloc's expansion]{.underline} into former
Soviet-controlled areas in its tracks. [Putin's]{.underline} 2014
invasion of Ukraine and subsequent [annexation of
[Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}, while not a direct assault on a NATO
member, further **[[demonstrated Western
impotence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the face of Russian aggression.
Further north, Russia has held massive war games that military experts
say were thinly disguised simulations of attacks on NATO members such as
Poland and the Baltic States.

Now that North Macedonia has joined NATO, [[Putin appears to]{.mark} be
relishing his]{.underline} first [chance to [prove that **the alliance
is** ]{.mark}**little more than [a paper tiger]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
In 2018, Russia's ambassador to North Macedonia declared the country a
"legitimate target" if tensions between NATO and Russia were to
increase. But there was no "if" about it: Even before North Macedonia
became a member, [Russia had]{.underline} already [been working
assiduously to ratchet up tensions in the region]{.underline}. [Moscow
has]{.underline} shipped S-400 anti-aircraft missiles to neighboring
Serbia for joint Russian-Serbian military drills[, facilitated an
attempted coup]{.underline} in Montenegro, and tried to destabilize
Bosnia and Herzegovina by [stoking sectarian tensions]{.underline}. And
in North Macedonia itself, [Russia has funded **troll
factories**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}, among other things, [were
used to]{.underline} target the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign with
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. Moscow also tried to influence North
Macedonia's September 2018 referendum on NATO membership, is using its
embassy and consulates there as bases
for [intelligence-gathering ope]{.underline}rations, [and has spread
propaganda]{.underline} detailing alleged Western plots to break up the
country.

That Russia would threaten NATO's members in Eastern Europe is nothing
new, of course. Russia has long attempted to undermine the Baltic
countries---Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia---which joined NATO and the
European Union after gaining their independence from the Soviet Union.
But today, the Baltic States are well integrated into alliance
structures and the European economy and are home to thousands of NATO
troops. Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored
front, the Balkans are its soft underbelly.

Whereas the Baltics have become part of NATO's well-armored front, the
Balkans are its soft underbelly.

 [NATO's posture]{.underline} in North Macedonia and its neighborhood
[is very limited.]{.underline} The Balkan countries are also poorer,
more ethnically divided, and less economically integrated with Europe.
[Their potential instability]{.underline} and the much lower likelihood
of a robust response by the West [make]{.underline} North Macedonia and
its neighbors ripe and **[easy targets for Russian
meddling.]{.underline}**

Taking a page from history's playbook, Putin rightly assumes that most
decision-makers in NATO capitals would consider North Macedonia a
"faraway country" of "people of whom we know nothing." U.S. President
Donald Trump, whose relationship with Putin continues to attract
attention, confirmed a similar suspicion with regard to neighboring
Montenegro when he appeared to question NATO's commitment to defend the
Balkan nation during an interview aired on Fox News. And while some may
have taken offense at Trump's statement, the truth is he speaks for
many.

According to a February poll by the Pew Research Center, [less than
half]{.underline} the populations of [France, Spain, Turkey, and Greece
hold a favorable view of NATO.]{.underline} Pandering to the alliance's
critics, French President Emmanuel [Macron]{.underline} last
year [declared that NATO had "brain death."]{.underline} The citizens of
[only three European countries]{.underline}---Britain, the Netherlands,
and Lithuania---[say their country should respond with military force if
Russia were to attack a NATO member in Eastern Europe.]{.underline}

No surprise then that **[[NATO's posture]{.underline}]{.mark}** toward
its newest member **[[remains unclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Though
[NATO broadened]{.mark}]{.underline} the definition of its joint defense
commitment---**[[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the alliance's
charter---**[[to include cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[[it has failed to clarify]{.mark} just [what that
means]{.mark}.]{.underline}** When asked what level of cyberattack on
one of its members would trigger a response, NATO Secretary-General Jens
[Stoltenberg said]{.underline} only, "[We will see]{.underline}."
[The]{.underline} 2018 [Brussels Declaration reaffirmed NATO's
intent]{.underline} to defend member states from nonconventional
attacks---**[but only meekly asserted that in "cases of hybrid
warfare]{.underline}**, [the Council could decide to invoke Article
5.]{.underline}" **[These Western weasel words]{.underline}** will
**[have been duly noted in the Kremlin]{.underline}**.

These Western weasel words will have been duly noted in the Kremlin.

[The type of meddling Russia]{.underline} has specialized in
[includes]{.underline} **[[election interference]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[inflaming ethnic tensions]{.underline}**,
**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[provoking violent
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [These]{.underline} three [real
possibilities [could trigger a NATO response]{.mark} under Article
5.]{.underline} [The most pressing issue is]{.underline} securing [North
Macedonia's upcoming elections]{.underline}, now postponed until further
notice due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Polls last showed VMRO-DPMNE,
a pro-Russian nationalist party, in a dead heat with
the pro-Western Social Democrats. Russian interference in the election
process or outcome not only threatens Macedonian sovereignty but, if
successful, could result in a government that tilts North Macedonia
toward Moscow.

[Russia may also seek to pressure and destabilize]{.underline} North
Macedonia in other ways, including through Moscow's regional client,
Serbia. [Russian propaganda]{.underline} aimed at North Macedonia
[includes conspiracy theories about the]{.underline} country's sizable
Albanian [minority supposedly colluding with NATO]{.underline} and
Albania to fold North Macedonia into a "greater Albania" amid great
bloodshed. As any student of Balkan history knows, [such rhetoric has
led to ethnic violence in the region before]{.underline}. Alternatively,
[Russia may stoke simmering conflicts]{.underline} in Serbia, whose
unstable Presevo region directly borders North Macedonia, or the
unresolved Kosovo dispute. Either conflict could easily spill into North
Macedonia.

NATO's next steps to secure its new member could include adapting the
successful tactics used when Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017. A
NATO-sponsored cyberteam provided the Montenegrin government with
technical support to learn to identify and counter hybrid warfare. NATO
raised awareness of the benefits of NATO membership by working with
officials, civil society, local governments, and media organizations. It
also worked to improve governance in Montenegro's defense sector.
Similarly, the European Union, which has just opened accession talks
with North Macedonia, could move quickly to signal to the world that the
Balkan nations are an integral part of Europe.

More broadly, however, NATO needs a mechanism to respond to Russian
aggression in the event that the alliance's members can't unanimously
agree to do so. **[[Article 5 requires unanimity]{.underline}]{.mark}**
before invoking collective defense, **[[but NATO's members
differ]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in their attitudes to
Russia.]{.underline}

Article 5 requires unanimity before invoking collective defense, but
NATO's members differ in their attitudes to Russia.

 One solution would be to form, as a backstop in case it is needed, a
coalition of the willing comprising NATO members with credible defense
capabilities that are willing to confront Russia and prepare a
collective response to any attack.

Despite NATO's overall military superiority, it has a weak hand in the
Balkans, and Russia continues to outmaneuver it there. NATO must quickly
signal that it remains steadfast and, having decided to admit it, that
North Macedonia is an integral member of the alliance. **[[If NATO fails
in its support of new members]{.underline}]{.mark}** like North
Macedonia, [the chances have just risen that [it will be met with
Russian]{.mark} [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}---[hybrid]{.underline}
or conventional---**[[that may]{.mark} just mean the [end]{.mark} of
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as a **credible
alliance**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Hybrid war uniquely threatens Turkey -- they require better NATO planning

Oktay **Bingöl 17**, Professor of International relations at Istanbul
Arel University, December 2017, Hybrid War and Its Strategic
Implications to Turkey, Gazi Akademik Bakış, 11(21):123-125

In addition to the dependencies, the foreign relations pose serious
risks to Turkey's political and military capability to deter hybrid
adversaries and fight them when necessary. First area is the fact that
**[[Turkey has been encircled]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by troubled
neighbors]{.underline}. [Turkey is at hybrid war with the regime, ISIL,
PYD and]{.underline} others in [Syria, Iran, Iraq, RF and
Armenia]{.underline}. The [foreign relations]{.underline} with Greece,
Southern Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, the EU an even with the US [are
fragile]{.underline}. Turkey's isolated position particularly in the
Middle East does not provide her with acceptable opportunities to
establish alliances and balance potential adversaries. **[[This is
a]{.mark} significant [weakness in]{.mark}]{.underline}** emerging
**[[hybrid]{.mark} strategic [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When
Turkey approaches Sunni Monarchies of the Gulf to overcome such a
weakness, fragile domestic fault lines activate. **[[Turkey has been in
a hybrid conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** context **[[for long
years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, intensifying in the last decade,
[especially after a Russian aircraft was shot down]{.underline} by
Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) at Syrian border on 24 November 2015.78 On
this event, [[Russia had initiated]{.underline}]{.mark} temporally
[coordinated [attacks]{.mark} against Turkey in physical, moral,
economic and cognitive domains [to **exploit Turkey's
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The battle in the cognitive and moral domains was especially intense.
Russian Federation soughted to gain regional and international
legitimacy in its struggle against Turkey and targeted Turkish public
will. **[Russian [hybrid war became effective]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and created strategic implications as a result of]{.underline}
interaction of [several]{.underline} internal, regional and
international [dynamics influencing Turkey]{.underline}. [Russian
**hybrid** strategies **against Turkey perfectly fit**]{.underline} some
of the strategies and tactics discussed above. The RF has implemented
several [economic sanctions]{.underline} on Turkey including ban on
tourism, agricultural product, suitcase trading, international
contracts, and direct investments.79 The RF [endangered Turkish foreign
policy]{.underline} in Syria by targeting Turkey supported rebels and
Syrian Turks (Turkomans), and by supporting Esad regime and PYD/ YPG
which is accepted as a terrorist organization by Turkey. The deployments
of Russian S-300/400 missile systems to Syria had established [a no-fly
zone]{.underline} for Turkey.80 Thus Russia closed Syrian airspace to
Turkey which could not fly its aircrafts to target PYD/YPG and ISIL even
if it was attacked by them. After the shot down of Russian aircraft, PKK
terrorist activities inside Turkey dramatically increased. PKK used
Russian made manportable air-defense system MANPADS which is a big
threat to Turkish aircrafts and particularly helicopters although the
weapon used by PKK to hit Turkish helicopter on 14 May 201681 does not
prove Russian direct involvement.82 While Russian direct military
support to PKK is questionable, diplomatic and moral support to PKK,
PYD/YPG and affiliated political organizations is clear.83 Moreover,
Russian hybrid concept had focused on indicating Turkey's supports to
ISIL.84 Overall, [**Russia** foughted]{.underline} **[in cognitive and
moral domains]{.underline}** [and aimed to]{.underline} **[shape
perceptions of Turkish public opinion]{.underline}**, regional and
international community. [In Lieu of [Conclusions]{.mark}]{.underline}:
Recommendations for Turkish Decision Makers Defeating hybrid threats and
winning a hybrid war **[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}**, first of all,
[**[to]{.underline}** **[understand what is hybrid
war]{.underline}**]{.mark} and make preparation in terms of civil
military relations, suitable theory and adjusted policies, strategies,
concepts and doctrines, structures, education of civilian and military
leaders, equipment, training and readiness of forces. The most important
measure is clearly building a resilience society. This means that
Turkish society should be freed from further polarization and
marginalization of various sub groups. Identities should not be
exploited by politicians to consolidate their electoral bases. However,
this requires a radical change in mentality, not only of the ruling
party and ruling elites but also opposition parties and the media, to
develop a more positive approach. Turkish strategic paradigm must
reorient to give more emphasis to the cognitive and moral domains, just
as potential enemies' paradigms have changed. It may be time to learn
and adapt to the enemy's way of war with an increase in the effective
use of the cognitive and moral domains. [The use of the media in hybrid
war is a force multiplier]{.underline} to complement hybrid war
asymmetric advantages. [[Turkey's response]{.mark} to hybrid
war]{.underline} will require a whole of government approach that is
very difficult for Turkey to coordinate, plan, and de-conflict. This
actually **[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark}** inter- agency
**[[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}** and implementation mechanism which
Turkey is clearly lacking. [The [western]{.mark}]{.underline} states and
[[organizations have]{.underline}]{.mark} long [[endeavored to
formulate]{.mark} suitable [policies to deter hybrid
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. The EU and **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[efforts led to the emergence of a comprehensive approach blending all
actors and available instruments]{.underline}: military forces,
diplomacy, humanitarian aid, political processes, economic development,
and technology. While NATO has developed Comprehensive Approach in
200885 the EU's own comprehensive approach was adopted in December
2013.86 In these approaches, government-led actions have increasingly
been complemented by whole-of-society strategies aimed at managing risks
and building resilient societies by believing that the focus on
resilience helps to mitigate risks that might lead to hybrid conflicts
in the future and improves associated resource-management practices. The
western governments have recently taken concrete steps to increase and
modernize their civilian and military capabilities. The EU is aware of
the fact that some of the **[present [legal concepts and
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[anachronistic]{.underline}** [and **do not**]{.underline}]{.mark}
always **[[address hybrid threats adequately]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It
initiated new legal measures to overcome the weaknesses. Lastly many
countries have adjusted to hybrid threats by expanding the missions of
existing institutions or creating new organizations.87 Turkey obviously
needs such a comprehensive approach which requires a cooperative and
constructive internal and external atmosphere, and a transformed
security sector. Yet it is unfortunate that Turkey, being trapped to
polarization and conflict, does have many difficulties to overcome.

#### Growth key to [space colonization]{.underline}\-\--extinction. 

**Kovic \'19** \[Marko; March 2019; co-founder president of the Zurich
Institute of Public Affairs Research; \"The future of energy,\"
https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aswz9/download\]

[Ideally]{.underline}, the [mitigation of climate risks
will]{.underline} **[coincide]{.underline}** [with and]{.underline}
**[contribute]{.underline}** [to the development of improved or even
entirely novel **sources of energy**]{.underline} [that will increase
the **long-term chances of humankind's survival**]{.underline} [by means
of]{.underline} **[[space colonization]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This
[is]{.mark} **not an un[realistic]{.mark} expectation**]{.underline},
[given that the mitigation of climate risks consists]{.underline}, to a
large degree, [of replacing fossil fuels with other, less harmful
sources of energy]{.underline}. However, [[some climate]{.mark} change
mitigation [strategies]{.mark} might actually]{.underline}
**[[harm]{.mark} the [long-term prospects]{.mark} of
humankind]{.underline}**.

First, [[it is possible]{.mark} that dominant climate change
[mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} strategies [[will]{.mark} actively
**[exclude]{.mark}** any form of]{.underline} **[[nuclear
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from the repertoire of climate-friendly
energy sources. Existing and experimental]{.underline} (molten salt)
[fission reactors could play a significant role in replacing
carbon-heavy energy sources]{.underline}, but pro-environmental
attitudes often overlap with anti-nuclear sentiments \[65\]. As a
result, and in combination with other problems such as large-scale
market failures of existing fission reactors (one of the reasons being
that generating electricity from fossil fuels is cheaper) \[66\],
nuclear fission does not currently have significant standing as a
"cleantech" contribution to climate change mitigation. From a long-term
perspective, an unfavorable view of nuclear energy in the context of
climate change might mean that technological progress in the areas of
nuclear fission and fusion might come to a halt (for example, due to
explicit bans or implicit disincentives). [If such a scenario came to
be, our [attempts at **colonizing space** would]{.mark}
almost]{.underline} **[certainly [fail]{.mark}]{.underline}**: [There
are currently no alternatives to **fission** and **fusion**, and it
is]{.underline} **[highly improbable]{.underline}** [that Solar power
alone could suffice for sustaining **extraterrestrial
habitats**]{.underline}.

Second, [[there is]{.mark} some [probability]{.mark} that climate change
mitigation [strategies will **change**]{.mark} **the social
order**]{.underline} [[towards]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[degrowth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [philosophy. Degrowth is a vague
socio-economic concept and social movement that]{.underline}, in
general, [calls for a]{.underline} **[contraction]{.underline}** [of the
global and national economies by means of]{.underline} **[lower
production]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[consumption
rates]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}, to some degree, to [more
**profound changes**]{.underline} [to the "capitalist" system
of]{.underline} **[economic production]{.underline}** \[67\]. Degrowth
or degrowth-like approaches are being actively considered as climate
risk mitigation strategies \[68, 69\], and [degrowth would almost
certainly be a highly effective measure for mitigating climate
change]{.underline}. After all, if we were to drastically reduce or even
completely eliminate the (industrial) sources of greenhouse gases, [the
amount of greenhouse gases that are being emitted would accordingly
drastically sink. [From]{.mark} the **[long-term
perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} **humankind's
[survival]{.mark}**[, degrowth is **problematic**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in at least two ways. [First, there is a risk that the general
[contraction of economic activity would]{.mark} also [slow
or]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[eliminate progress]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the domain of]{.underline}
[**[energy]{.underline}**, [which
would]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} in turn, [[reduce]{.mark} the
[probability of]{.mark} **successful [space
colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline} [due to an absence of **suitable
energy sources**]{.underline}. [Second, and more fundamental: [If
degrowth were]{.mark} to become [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[dominant]{.mark} societal [paradigm]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [it is
**uncertain** whether]{.underline}]{.mark} [the long-term survival of
humankind by means of **[space colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[would be]{.mark} regarded a **[desirable]{.mark} goal**]{.underline}.
[In a literal sense, [establishing]{.mark} **extraterrestrial [colonies
would mean growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [the size of the total human
population would grow,]{.underline} and the area of space-time that
humans occupy would grow.

[In a more philosophical sense, [degrowth might]{.mark} even
[be]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[antithetical to]{.mark} space
[colonization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Even though both degrowth and
space colonization have a similar moral goal]{.underline} -- [increasing
wellbeing]{.underline} -- , [the ends to that goal are very different.
Within degrowth]{.underline} philosophy, [[the goal
is]{.mark},]{.underline} metaphorically speaking, [[not to "live beyond
our means"]{.mark}: We should strive for "ecological balance", and such
a state should increase the]{.underline} **[average
wellbeing]{.underline}**. [But [the frame of reference is the status
quo]{.mark}; Earth and [humankind]{.mark} as we know it [**today**.
Space colonization]{.mark},]{.underline} on the other hand, [[operates
with a]{.mark} much]{.underline} [**[larger frame]{.mark}** of
reference]{.underline}: **[[All]{.mark} the [future generations]{.mark}
of humans]{.underline}** (and other sentient beings) [who could enjoy
wellbeing if we succeed in colonizing space]{.underline} -- [and who
will categorically be **[denied]{.mark} that
[wellbeing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[if we fail to colonize]{.mark}
space]{.underline} \[70\]. [The goal of space colonization as a **moral
project**]{.underline} [is not to live beyond our means, but to actively
**redefine** and]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}** [what our means
are through scientific and **technological progress**]{.underline}.

#### Growth [outruns]{.underline} recurrent [blackball risks]{.underline} and shifts [public preference]{.underline} to [optimal]{.underline} existential risk mitigation\-\--unlocks [infinite]{.underline} future value. 

**Aschenbrenner '20** \[Leopold; September 6; Research Fellow in
Economics at the Forethought Foundation and Global Priorities Institute
at the University of Oxford, B.A. from Columbia University; Global
Priorities Institute, "Existential risk and growth," no. 6\]

Secondly, note that this existential risk Kuznets curve appears in the
transition dynamics of the optimal allocation. Considering that
[[ex]{.mark}istential [risk mitigation is a]{.mark} **global [public
good]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is unlikely resources are allocated to
safety optimally in the real world. As such, this should not be taken to
be a prediction of what a particular country with a particular set of
institutions will do with regard to existential risk.

Nevertheless, [there are a **number of reasons** why we
might]{.underline} still [be interested in the **transition** dynamics
under the]{.underline} (impatient) **[optimal allocation]{.underline}**.
For one, since there are very long timescales involved here, it is very
hard to know (and thus model) what government and societal institutions
will evolve to deal with existential risk. However, the ideal these
[institutions will]{.underline} likely [aim at]{.underline} is the
[optimal allocation]{.underline}. The optimal allocation might thus be
[a]{.underline} rough [**proxy** for the real-world
allocation]{.underline}.

Moreover, the (impatient) optimal allocation represents what I would
call the "democratic possibilities frontier" or the "impatient public
possibilities frontier." [[Those]{.mark} who are principally
[**concerned** about the]{.mark} **long-run [future]{.mark}** of
humanity and advocate for a zero rate of]{.underline} pure [time
preference]{.underline} might [[want]{.underline}]{.mark} us [[to
**spend**]{.mark} as **much as possible** on safety]{.underline} in
order [[to avoid]{.mark} **existential [catastrophe]{.mark}** [and
enable]{.mark} **human [flourishing]{.mark}** millions of years into the
future]{.underline}. Indeed, even in the Hamiltonian of the optimal
allocation, the relative value of life ˜vt is a discounted term; the
lower your discount rate ρ, the more you would want to spend on safety.
However, the broader public is not so patient. As the empirical evidence
cited earlier shows, people tend to have a (relatively large) positive
rate of pure time preference; the public is impatient. Even perfectly
designed institutions that take into account existential risk
externalities will ultimately be constrained by the degree to which
society actually cares about the future---they will be constrained by an
impatient public. [[The]{.mark} existential risk [**Kuznets curve**
illustrates]{.mark} the implications]{.underline} of this impatience. On
the one hand, this impatience results in a period of initially rising
levels of risk. For example, this might mean that
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} arguably [rising [level of]{.mark}
existential risk [of]{.mark} the past century [is **not**]{.mark}
necessarily [a **market failure**, but]{.mark}]{.underline} may well be
part of [[the **optimal path**]{.mark} given positive pure time
preference]{.underline}. On the other hand, [[rising
**standards**]{.mark} **of living** [lead]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} most impatient [[public to start
caring]{.mark} more [about]{.mark} safety and **[averting]{.mark}** an
**existential [catastrophe]{.mark}**[. This leads]{.mark} workers and
scientists]{.underline} to be [shifted to the safety
sector]{.underline}, eventually [causing [the hazard
rate]{.mark}]{.underline} δ [[to **exponentially
decline**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Even if people are **impatient**, if
you make them **well off enough**, they will **start caring** about
existential risk]{.underline}.

[[Seeing]{.mark} the]{.underline} arguably [[rising]{.mark} levels of
**[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the past century,
[[some]{.underline}]{.mark} might [call [for an **end** to]{.mark}
**economic [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet [this existential risk
Kuznets curve indicates that **[stopping]{.mark}** economic [growth
would]{.mark} be **deleterious**: it would simply **[freeze the]{.mark}
hazard [rate]{.mark}** at a **high level**, [leading to a]{.mark}
**fatal [catastrophe]{.mark}** sooner or later. **Economic
[growth]{.mark}** [enables]{.mark}]{.underline} even
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}n impatient [[public]{.underline}]{.mark} with a
high rate of pure time preference [[to start]{.mark} **caring about
life**, thus ultimately **[reducing risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} and even
leading to positive M ∞.

Some prominent thinkers have previously posited that [[humanity is
passing through a]{.mark} **unique [period]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} an
**elevated** risk of **[tech]{.mark}nological
[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Sagan (1994) calls this the "time
of perils." Parfit (2011, p. 616), concurs:

> We live during the hinge of history. [Given the **scientific** and
> **technological** discoveries of the last two centuries, the world has
> **never changed** as fast]{.underline}. We shall soon have even
> greater powers to transform, not only our surroundings, but ourselves
> and our successors. [If]{.underline} we act wisely in the next few
> centuries, [humanity will survive its **most dangerous** and decisive
> period. Our descendants could]{.underline}, if necessary,
> [go]{.underline} elsewhere, [**spreading through** this
> **galaxy**]{.underline}.

This existential risk Kuznets curve provides theoretical evidence that
grounds the intuition that we are living in a "time of perils." [[We may
be]{.mark} **economically [advanced]{.mark}** [enough to]{.mark} have
[create]{.mark}d]{.underline} the [[means for]{.mark} our **permanent
[destruction]{.mark}**[, but **not**]{.mark} economically **advanced
[enough]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} care enough about **[decreas]{.mark}ing**
this existential [risk]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This "time of perils" has profound implications. For instance, those
alive today who care about preserving the long-term future of humanity
may have extraordinary altruistic leverage. By working to reduce
existential risk now (increasing the resources dedicated to safety),
they can reduce the area under the "hump" of the hazard rate δ. This in
turn increases M∞, unlocking tremendous value. Moreover, [since so **few
resources** are dedicated to safety]{.underline} at the moment, [there
are]{.underline} likely [**very high** marginal value opportunities
available to work on safety]{.underline}. This is a unique situation.
Suppose existential risk did not decline to zero exponentially: then M∞
= 0 regardless---the existential risk curve would never bend---so
reducing risk now would not change the probability of a long and
flourishing future of humanity. And if existential risk did not
initially increase, it would never be such a substantial challenge and
there wouldn't be such high marginal value opportunities to work on
reducing it.

#### Dedev fails and causes transition wars. 

**Smith \'19** \[Noah; 4/5/19; Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University; \"Dumping
Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\"
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism\]

[It has become **fashionable**]{.underline} on social media and [in
certain publications to argue that **capitalism is killing the
planet**]{.underline}. Even renowned investor Jeremy Grantham, hardly a
radical, made that assertion last year. [The **basic idea** is that the
**profit motive** drives the **private sector** to **spew
carbon**]{.underline} into the air with reckless abandon. Though many
economists and some climate activists believe that the problem is best
addressed by modifying market incentives with a carbon tax, [many
activists believe that the problem can't be addressed **without
rebuilding** the **economy**]{.underline} along centrally planned lines.

[The [climate]{.mark} threat [is]{.mark} certainly
[dire]{.mark}]{.underline}, and carbon taxes are unlikely to be enough
to solve the problem. [[But eco-socialism is]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[**not** going to be]{.mark} an **[effective]{.mark} method**
of addressing that threat. [**Dismantling** an **entire**]{.mark}
**economic [system]{.mark}** [is **never easy**, and]{.mark} probably
[would **touch off armed conflict** and]{.mark} **major [asdasd
upheaval]{.mark}**[. In the scramble]{.mark} to win those battles, [even
the socialists]{.mark} would almost [certainly abandon their
limit]{.mark}ation [on **fossil-fuel**]{.mark} **use**]{.underline} ---
[either [to support **military efforts**, or]{.mark} to [keep the
population from turning]{.mark} against them. The [precedent]{.mark}
here [is the **Soviet Union**]{.mark}, whose multidecade effort to
**reshape its economy** by **force** amid **confrontation** with the
West led to profound **environmental degradation**. The world\'s climate
does not have several decades to spare]{.underline}.

[[Even **without**]{.mark} **international [conflict]{.mark}**[, there's
**little guarantee**]{.mark} that [moving away from capitalism would
**mitigate**]{.mark} **our [impact]{.mark}** on the
environment]{.underline}. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power
[in Bolivia, living standards have improved substantially]{.underline}
for the average Bolivian, which is great. [But this has come at the cost
of higher emissions. Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed to **decrease
its per capita emissions**]{.underline} a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, [in terms of **economic growth** and **carbon
emissions**, Bolivia looks]{.underline} similar to more
[capitalist]{.underline} developing countries. [That suggests that
[**faced with a choice** of enriching]{.mark} their [people or
helping]{.mark} to save the [climate, even **socialist leaders**]{.mark}
will often [choose the former]{.mark}. And that [same]{.mark} political
calculus [will]{.mark} probably [hold in China and the
U.S]{.mark}.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [[leaders
who demand]{.mark} **draconian [cuts]{.mark}** [in **living
standards**]{.mark} in pursuit of environmental goals will [have
**trouble staying in power**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The **best hope**]{.mark} for the climate therefore [lies in
**reducing the tradeoff**]{.mark} between **material prosperity** and
**carbon emissions**. [That requires
**tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline} --- [**solar**, **wind** and
**nuclear power**, **energy storage**, **electric cars** and other
vehicles, carbon-free cement production and so on. The **best climate
policy** plans all involve **technological [improvement]{.mark}** as a
**key feature**.]{.underline}

#### Transition impossible\-\--requires reversing centuries of notions of everyday life 

**Timms 20** \[Aaron; 1/27/20; writer for the New Republic, articles
have appeared in The Guardian, The Outline, The Daily Beast, and The Los
Angeles Review of Books; \"Beyond the Growth Gospel,\"
https://newrepublic.com/article/156024/degrowth-movement-cerbere-can-decreix-commune\]/

[We all know]{.underline} that our [time to]{.underline} **[stabilize
the climate]{.underline}** [is short]{.underline}. But in the supposed
battle between the Green New Deal left and
[[degrowth]{.mark}ers]{.underline}, there's only one side that seeks, in
any meaningful sense, to stabilize the climate with anything like the
required urgency. In its [critique of economism and rejection of
technocratic business]{.underline} as usual, in the exhortation of its
proponents to think critically about what we as a species really want,
degrowth [contains much that I find **theoretically
compelling**]{.underline}. [But the movement [has]{.mark}
surprisingly]{.underline} [**[little to say]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline}]{.mark} **[renewable energy]{.underline}**, [the result
of a latent hostility to techno-**scientific innovation**]{.underline},
[and [the idea]{.mark} that]{.underline} [**[billions]{.mark}**, with[in
the next decade, will]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**voluntarily embrace
degrowth**]{.mark} at a sufficient scale to arrest global heating is
**unrealistic**]{.underline}. [Even its most ardent defenders concede
that genuine [degrowth]{.mark}]{.underline}---[which means
real]{.underline}, Can Decreix-grade [upheaval to daily
life]{.underline}, not just fewer steaks or car trips every
year---[[will **not materialize**]{.underline}]{.mark} under present
economic and social conditions. Latouche is typically forthright on this
question: "Degrowth society cannot emerge from the iron corset of
scarcity, needs, economic calculation, and homo æconomicus." His meaning
is what the experience of Can Decreix makes plain: that [a life of pure
degrowth is **logically impossible**]{.underline} [in this world, indeed
that [the **preconditions**]{.mark} **for degrowth society [do
not]{.mark} yet [exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Any
attempts]{.underline}]{.mark} [to institute degrowth from above [will be
seen as an]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[intolerable offense]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[human [dignity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline} **[well-being]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, so long
as]{.underline} the rest of [civilization is hitched to the train of
economic expansion]{.underline}---[whether capitalist, socialist, or
otherwise]{.underline}.

Not even François can avoid compromising himself through contact with
the world as it is. The degrowth he practices at Can Decreix is
necessarily a diluted form of the ideal, dependent as it is on the
structures and economies of the very system degrowth hopes to supersede.
[There's an additional irony here, which is that virtually no degrowther
wants to put down roots in the home of degrowth]{.underline}, though
François's partner, Alexandra Guerri, lives with him in the austere
precincts of Can Decreix. Other degrowth sympathizers have joined
François at the encampment in the eight years since its foundation, but
they have not stayed; today he continues alone. De Decker returns to
Barcelona shortly after his business at the Belvédère is concluded;
other summer school speakers appear in Can Decreix for a day or two and
then scuttle back to the city. If the defining property of utopia is
that it's nowhere (the word's meaning in Greek), it's perhaps
appropriate that this utopia has attracted no one. "I feel isolated with
this practice here," François tells me on my first night at Can Decreix.
"[It's a struggle to convince people about this way of]{.underline}
life. The idea was to do something collective, but now it's just me.
[[Few people are **willing to try**]{.underline}]{.mark} [something else
with flowing and a new way of living." This is]{.underline} **[[no
surprise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even a hair shirt worn voluntarily is
uncomfortable. Le Guin once described the anarchist lunar colony she
puts at the center of The Dispossessed, [the fiction that everyone here
is reading]{.underline}, as an "**[ambiguous utopia]{.underline}**." [A
similar description seems apt for the home of degrowth]{.underline}.

A group of rowdy Irish cycling tourists stops by the Dorade, cleats
clacking, and they ask for douze bières merci while the owner replies in
English. I finish my coffee, then continue on my path back to Can
Decreix. In the town square, I pass some of the summer school attendees.
It's been only two hours since breakfast up on the deck at Can
Decreix---porridge, plums, nuts---but one of them is seated at a bench,
noise-canceling headphones on, bopping to the beat, and oblivious to the
world as he tears into a whole wheel of Camembert with rye crisps and a
family-size packet of Bolognese sauce-flavored chips by his side. The
man is salt-deprived and hungry. I feel a great surge of sympathy.

[Since [degrowth can't form]{.mark} the [basis of]{.mark} a realistic
**[electoral politics]{.mark}**, its [proponents are]{.mark} left
[clinging to the **lifeboat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.mark}
"institutional and [cultural change]{.mark}" as they attempt to plot a
course to our **collective degrowing**]{.underline}, or they retreat
into didacticism. (The working class "must master" its wants, Kallis has
written, "not insist that they should be satisfied.") [What the
[degrowthers seek]{.mark}, in their **priestliest
utterings**]{.underline}, [is not only a new society but also
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[complete reset]{.underline}** [of the
**psychological habitus**]{.underline} [of everyday
life]{.underline}]{.mark}[. For degrowth to "work," its ideal-type
citizen must be]{.underline} **[radically different from you or
me]{.underline}**, [or almost anyone else living under industrial
modernity today. This]{.underline} homo post-æconomicus [will operate
according to as yet **undiscovered automatisms**]{.underline},
[**affects**, and]{.underline} **[instincts]{.underline}**, [conjuring
in the process a more sustainable model of human endeavor]{.underline}
onto the stage of our desperately overheated globe.

[This could indeed be]{.underline} a [great]{.underline} thing. After
all, a society built on reciprocity, sharing, self-limitation, and care
sounds far preferable to the plutocratic catastrophe of present-day
financialized capitalism. [But [such a society cannot arise if
**we**]{.mark} **continue to [view material limitations as
privations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It will only work if the longing for
less comes **naturally**]{.underline}, [is]{.underline} **[authentically
aspirational]{.underline}**---[if we want to live the life
unseasoned.]{.underline} This is the journey from the Belvédère to Can
Decreix: a journey from We Want Everything to Actually, We Want Very
Little. Climate stabilization needs to happen now. **[Degrowth cannot
happen now]{.underline}**. [This is why **degrowth is not a
plan**]{.underline} [for combating]{.underline} **[climate
change]{.underline}**, [not in any **immediate**]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} **[direct]{.underline}** [sense]{.underline} at least.
Instead, [it is]{.underline} something much more ambitious, with a much
hazier time horizon: [a project to build a new person.]{.underline}

My contributions to the many energy-sapping tasks required to keep Can
Decreix in order throughout the summer school---lugging wood, creating
shade for discussion groups using bamboo mats and wooden rods, repairing
stone walls, building rocket stoves, coming to grips with human
compost---have been every bit as half-assed as you'd expect from a weak,
unresourceful knowledge worker in the dog days of capitalism with panna
cotta-soft hands and no interest in camping. I am, on anyone's reading,
a hopeless volunteer, the least useful of the useful muzhiks. The one
activity at which I've shown any kind of skill is the chabrot, a
postprandial ritual François has adapted from regional custom. There are
two types of wine made in-house at Can Decreix: a sweet grenache and
rancio, a dry oxidized wine similar to sherry. To perform the chabrot,
each diner pools wine into their plate at the end of the meal, agitates
the wine with a fork to degrease the plate, then drinks the wine.
(Blessedly the house prohibition on addictive substances does not extend
to alcohol.) The point of this ritual is to "go easy on the pipes" when
washing the dishes, François tells us. I've developed a technique of
mopping food scraps off the wine-flooded plate with my fingers, drinking
the wine, licking my fingers, then licking the plate clean, such that it
does not need to be washed at all and is immediately ready for reuse.
For days, I survive off a single, self-cleaned plate, earning François's
trust as the summer school's "official zealot of the chabrot." The
revulsion others feel at this practice is obvious; despite eager
propagandizing on my part, no one performs the chabrot with anything
like my level of ideological rigor.

[There was once a time in the West when licking your
fingers]{.underline} at the table, [along with a host of other behaviors
now considered **beyond the pale of respectable**]{.underline} society,
[such as blowing your nose into your hand, were deemed acceptable. The
"civilizing process,"]{.underline} as Norbert Elias called
it---[the]{.underline} **[gradual [recalibration]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[of daily social mores]{.underline}]{.mark} by which Europeans cast off
these habits---[[took]{.underline} [**centuries**,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} [required the **mass
internalization**]{.underline} [of [a]{.mark} completely **[new model of
individuality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This was not planned, but was
rather the result of myriad colliding stochastic
evolutions]{.underline}: state formation and the state's monopoly over
violence, urbanization, the growing differentiation of occupations in
increasingly complex economies. [[A]{.mark} **similar process** on

only make sense once individuals want in a way we don't want, feel as we
don't feel. Whether a future this different can be **engineered** is
**debatable**]{.underline}. But that does not mean there remains, in the
interim, no virtue to thinking carefully about our course, or even
slowing down. On the train of progress, sometimes it's wise to pull the
emergency brake.

### Growth Good\-\--War\-\--2AC

#### Growth solves war

**Gat, 19**---professor of national security and international politics
at the University of Tel Aviv (Azar, "Is War Declining: Why and Where?,"
Anali 16 (1) 201-208 (2019), dml)

Most [people are]{.underline} very [surprised]{.underline} by the claim
[that [we live in the **most peaceful period**]{.mark} in
history]{.underline}. Are we not flooded with media reports and images
of conflicts around the world today, some of them very active and
bloody, and others seemingly waiting to happen? [Have the United States
and its allies not been involved in a series of **messy
wars**]{.underline} over the past few decades? [Scholars]{.underline},
for their part, [ask]{.underline} themselves, [if there has]{.underline}
indeed [been a **decline** in belligerency]{.underline},
[when]{.underline} exactly [did it **begin**]{.underline}: with the end
of the Cold War, in 1945, or perhaps earlier? And what exactly caused
it?1

Again, most people are surprised to learn that [the occurrence of [war
and]{.mark} overall [mortality]{.mark} rate in war **sharply
[decreased]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} as early as [**1815**
onward]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in the developed world.
[The]{.underline} so-called **[Long Peace]{.underline}** among the great
powers [after 1945 is **more recognized**]{.underline}, [and is widely
attributed to the **nuclear factor**]{.underline}, a decisive factor to
be sure, which concentrated the minds of all the protagonists
wonderfully, as they say about the hanging rope. [The]{.underline}
(inter-)[**democratic peace** has been equally recognized]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, [the decrease in war had been very marked even
**before** the nuclear era]{.underline}, [and has encompassed
**nondemocracies**]{.underline} as well as democracies. In the century
[after 1815]{.underline}, [wars among industrializing countries
**declined**]{.underline} in their frequency [to]{.underline} about [a
**third**]{.underline} of what they had been in the previous centuries,
[an **unprecedented** change]{.underline}. Compared to their record
during the eighteenth century, Austria and Prussia, for example --
neither of them a democracy -- fought about a third to a quarter as much
during the century after 1815.

Indeed, [the Long Peace after 1945]{.underline}, more than 70 years to
date and counting, [was preceded by the **second longest** peace ever
among the modern great powers]{.underline}, between 1871 and 1914,
[**43** years]{.underline} in all; [and]{.underline} by [the
**third**]{.underline} longest peace, between 1815 and 1854, [**39**
years]{.underline}. Thus, [the **three longest periods of peace by
far**]{.underline} in the modern great powers system [have all occurred
**after 1815**]{.underline}, with [the first two]{.underline} taking
place [**before** the nuclear age]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
striking phenomenon [**cannot** be accidental]{.underline}. A decline in
belligerency began from 1815, not 1945 or 1989. Clearly, one needs to
explain the entire period of reduced belligerency since 1815, while also
accounting for the glaring divergence from the trend: the two world
wars.

[There is a tendency to assume that wars have declined in
frequency]{.underline} during the past two centuries [because they have
become **too lethal**]{.underline}, [**destructive** and
**expensive**]{.underline} -- [**fewer** but **more
ruinous**]{.underline} wars. [This]{.underline} hypothesis **[barely
holds]{.underline}**, however, [because relative to population and
wealth wars have **not** become more lethal and costly than
earlier]{.underline} in history. The wars of the nineteenth century,
from 1815 to 1914 -- the most peaceful century in European history --
were in fact particularly light, in comparative terms. Prussia won the
German Wars of Unification in short and decisive campaigns and at a
remarkably low price, and yet Germany did not fight again for 43 years.
True, the [world wars]{.underline}, especially World War II, were
certainly on the upper scale of the range in terms of casualties. Yet,
contrary to widespread assumptions, they [were **far** from]{.underline}
being [exceptional]{.underline} in history. We need to look at relative
casualties, general mortality rates in wars, rather than at the
aggregate created by the fact that many states participated in the world
wars.

For example, in the Peloponnesian War (431-403 BC) Athens is estimated
to have lost between a quarter and a third of its population, more than
Germany in the two world wars combined. In the first three years of the
Second Punic War (218-216 BC), Rome lost some 50,000 male citizens of
the ages of 17-46, out of a total of about 200,000 in these ages. This
was roughly 25 percent of the military age cohorts in only three years,
the same range as the Russian military casualties and higher than the
German rates in World War II. Similarly, in the thirteen century the
Mongol conquests inflicted on the societies of China and Russia
casualties and destruction that were among the highest ever suffered
during historical times. Even by the lowest estimates casualties were at
least as high as, and in China almost definitely far higher than, the
Soviet Union\'s horrific rate in World War II of about 15 percent of its
population. A final example: during the Thirty Years War (1618- 1648)
population loss in Germany is estimated at between a fifth and a third
-- either way again higher than the German casualties in the First and
Second World Wars combined.

[People often assume that more developed military
technology]{.underline} during modernity [**must** mean greater
lethality and destructiveness]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} in fact
[it also means **greater protective power**]{.underline}, as with
mechanized armour, mechanized speed and agility, and defensive
electronic measures. [Offensive and defensive advances]{.underline}
generally [rise in **tandem** and]{.underline} tend to [**offset** each
other]{.underline}. In addition, it is all too often forgotten that the
vast majority of the many millions of non-combatants killed by Germany
during World War II -- Jews, Soviet prisoners of war, Soviet civilians
-- fell victim to intentional starvation, exposure to the elements, and
mass executions rather than to any sophisticated military technology.
[Instances of genocide]{.underline} in general during the twentieth
century, much as earlier in history, [were carried out with the
**simplest** of technologies]{.underline}, as the Rwanda genocide
horrifically reminded us.

[**Nor** is it true that wars]{.underline} during the past two centuries
[have become **economically more costly**]{.underline} than they were
earlier in history, again relative to overall wealth. [War **always**
involved massive economic exertion]{.underline} and was the single most
expensive item of state spending. Both sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries Spain and eighteenth century France, for example, were
economically ruined by war and staggering war debts, which in the French
case brought about the Revolution. Furthermore, death by starvation in
premodern wars was widespread.

Another strand of interpretation of the perceived decrease in warfare
during recent times has posited voluntary and ideaic factors, has
attributed the decline of warfare during recent times to a social
\'attitude change\'. Why this attitude change should have occurred at
this point in history rather than any time earlier is not explained.
After all, most powerful moral doctrines such as Buddhism and
Christianity decried war for millennia without this having any
noticeable effect.

It is suggested that people have suddenly become aware that war is
senseless if not crazy, devoid of any rationale. Such a view of war is
widespread in today\'s modern and affluent world. In the discipline of
international relations so-called realists, especially 'defensive
realists', even claim with a straight face that countries have never
gained from war because of the balancing effect that contain rising
powers. Try this strange idea on Rome, the Aztecs or Inca, the Ottomans,
the Mughals or eighteenth century Britain, to name but a few out of many
examples. Or on Chinggis Khan, whose descendants constitute, according
to genetic studies, 8 percent of all males in Eastern and Central Asia,
evidence of staggering sexual opportunities enjoyed by his sons and
grandsons whose houses ruled over that part of the world for centuries.

And you should not think that only autocrats and military aristocracies
profited from war, while the people were its unwilling victims. This
idea was advanced during the Enlightenment and is very popular today.
However, it ought to be remembered that the two most successful
war-making states of classical antiquity were democratic Athens and
republican Rome. And they were so successful precisely because the
people of these polities benefited from war and imperial expansion,
championed them, and enlisted in their cause. Half of the Athenian
budget at the time of Pericles came from the tribute of the Empire which
was used to build the Acropolis and pay for the huge navy, in both of
which the demos was employed.

We said before that in pursuit of their aims people may resort to
cooperation, peaceful competition, or violent conflict. Each of these
behavioral strategies is a well-designed tool interchangeably employed,
depending on the particular circumstances and prospects of success.
Thus, to understand the gravitation of human choices -- and norms --
from violent conflict towards the non-violent options of cooperation and
peaceful competition one needs to understand the changing circumstances
and calculus of cost-effectiveness during the past two centuries and in
recent decades.

So if modern war has not become more lethal and expensive, why the
decline? Two main theories dominate the scene: the democratic peace and
the capitalist/trade peace. But, in and of themselves they cannot be the
complete answer because of the following, contradicting historical
evidence: premodern democracies and republics actually did fight each
other; nondemocratic great powers also shared in the general reduction
in belligerency during modern times, from 1815 on, including communist
powers that largely opted out of the global trade system; until the
nineteenth century states tried to monopolize trade by force and bar all
others out rather than share with them -- think ancient Athens, medieval
Venice, early modern Holland, France and Britain, and many others.

[What]{.underline} then [is [the **cause**]{.mark} of the decline in
belligerency]{.underline}? Even before the middle of the nineteenth
century, thinkers such as Saint-Simon, Auguste Comte, and John Stuart
Mill, who were quick to note the change, realized that [it
was]{.underline} caused by the advent of [the **industrial-commercial
revolution**]{.underline}, the most profound transformation of human
society since the Neolithic adoption of agriculture. In the first place,
[given **explosive [growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} in per capita wealth,
about 30 to 50-fold from the onset of the revolution to the present,
[the Malthusian trap has been **broken**]{.underline}. [[Wealth no
longer constitutes a]{.mark} **fundamentally [finite]{.mark}**
[quantity]{.mark}]{.underline}, when the only question is how it is
divided, [so wealth acquisition progressively shifted **away** from a
zero-sum game]{.underline}.

Secondly, [the significance of **[trade]{.mark}** in the economy [has
**ballooned**]{.mark} to entirely new dimensions]{.underline} precisely
because of the new process of industrial growth. [Greater freedom of
trade has become all the more attractive]{.underline} in the industrial
age for the simple reason that the overwhelming share of fast-growing
and diversifying production has now been intended for sale in the
marketplace rather than for direct consumption by the family producers
themselves. During industrialization, advanced powers\' foreign trade
increased twice as quickly as their fast growing GDPs, so that by the
beginning of the twentieth century, exports plus imports grew to around
half of GDP in Britain and France, more than onethird in Germany, and
around one-third in Italy and Japan. Consequently, [economies are **no
longer** overwhelmingly autarkic]{.underline}, [having become
**increasingly interconnected**]{.underline} by specialization, scale
and exchange. [Foreign [devastation]{.mark} potentially [depresses the
**entire system**]{.mark} and is **detrimental** to a state\'s own
wellbeing]{.underline}. What Mill discerned in the abstract in the
1840s, was repeated by Norman Angel during the first global age before
World War I, and formed the cornerstone of John Maynard Keynes\'
criticism of the harsh reparations imposed on Germany after that war.

[Greater [economic openness]{.mark} has **[decreased the likelihood of
war]{.mark}** also by disassociating economic access from the confines
of political borders and sovereignty]{.underline}. [It is [**no longer
necessary** to]{.mark} politically [possess a territory]{.mark} in order
[to benefit]{.mark} from it]{.underline}. Of all these factors,
commercial interdependence has attracted most of the attention in the
scholarly literature. But both the escape from Malthus with rapid
industrial growth and open access have been no less significant aspects
of what I call the Modernization Peace.

Thus, [[the **greater**]{.mark} **the yield** of competitive [economic
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} **more
counterproductive** and [**less attractive** conflict
becomes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather than war becoming more costly, as
is widely believed, it is in fact **[peace]{.underline}** that [has been
growing **more profitable**]{.underline}.

If so, [[why have wars continued]{.mark} to occur]{.underline} during
the past two centuries, albeit at a much lower frequency? In the first
place, [ethnic and nationalist tensions often **overrode** the logic of
the new economic realities]{.underline}, accounting for most wars in
Europe between 1815 and 1945. [They continue to do so
today]{.underline}, especially in the less developed parts of the globe.
Moreover, [the logic of the new economic realities
**receded**]{.underline} during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, [as the great powers resumed **[protectionist
policies]{.mark}** and expanded them to the undeveloped parts of the
world with]{.underline} the New **[Imperialism]{.underline}**.
[This]{.underline} development [[signalled]{.mark} that
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} emergent global [[economy might become
**partitioned**]{.mark} rather than **open**]{.underline}, with each
imperial domain becoming closed to everybody else, as, indeed, they
eventually did in the 1930s, with the Great Depression. [A **snowball
effect** ensued]{.underline}, [generating a **runaway grab for imperial
territories**]{.underline}. For the territorially confined Germany and
Japan the need to break away into imperial Lebensraum or \'co-prosperity
sphere\' seemed particularly pressing. [[Here lay the seeds of]{.mark}
the **two [world wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the [retreat
from **economic liberalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the first decades
of the twentieth century [[spurred]{.underline}]{.mark}, and was spurred
by, [the rise to power of **anti-liberal** and **anti-democratic
political ideologies** and **regimes**]{.underline},
[incorporating]{.underline} a creed of violence: [**communism** and
**[fascism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Since 1945 the decline of major war has **deepened
further**]{.underline}. [Nuclear weapons have been a **crucial
factor**]{.underline} in this process, [but **no less significant** have
been the institutionalization of **free trade** and the closely related
process of **rapid** and **sustained economic growth**]{.underline}.
[The spread of liberal democracy has been **equally
potent**]{.underline}. Indeed, although nonliberal and nondemocratic
states also became much less belligerent during the industrial age, it
is the [liberal democracies]{.underline} that [have been the **most
attuned** to its pacifying aspects]{.underline}.

[Relying on **arbitrary coercive force** at home]{.underline},
[nondemocratic countries have found it **more natural** to use force
abroad]{.underline}. By contrast, [[liberal]{.mark} democratic
[societies are socialized to **peaceful**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**law-mediated [relations]{.mark}** at home]{.underline}, [and [their
citizens]{.mark} have grown to **[expect]{.mark}** that [the
same]{.mark} norms be applied internationally]{.underline}. Living in
increasingly tolerant societies, they have grown more receptive to the
Other\'s point of view. [Promoting freedom]{.underline}, [legal
equality]{.underline}, [and political participation
domestically]{.underline}, [liberal democratic
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [though [**initially** in possession
of]{.mark} **vast [empires]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [have [found
it]{.mark} **increasingly [difficult]{.mark}** [to justify
ruling]{.mark} over [foreign peoples]{.mark} without their
consent]{.underline}. And sanctifying life, liberty and human rights,
[they have proven to be **failures** in forceful
repression]{.underline}. Furthermore, with the individual's life and
pursuit of happiness elevated above group values, [sacrifice of life in
war has **increasingly lost legitimacy** in liberal democratic
societies]{.underline}. War retains legitimacy only under narrow and
narrowing formal and practical conditions, and is generally viewed as
extremely abhorrent and undesirable.

Thus, [modernization]{.underline}, most [notably its liberal
path]{.underline}, [has **sharply reduced** the prevalence of
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as the violent option]{.underline} for
fulfilling human desires [[has become]{.mark} **much [less
rewarding]{.mark}** than the peaceful option of competitive
cooperation]{.underline}. For instance, with the much increased sexual
opportunity within society, young men now are more reluctant to leave
behind the pleasures of life for the rigors and chastity of the field.
\'Make love, not war\' was the slogan of the powerful anti-war youth
campaign of the 1960s, which not accidentally coincided with a
far-reaching liberalization of sexual norms. Furthermore, is societies
of plenty people naturally become risk-averse. Ingelhart's World Values
Survey reflects this, as does, only a bit less seriously, Thomas
Friedman's concept of a Macdonald Peace. All these are interrelated
aspects of the Modernization Peace.

The fruits of these deepening trends and sensibilities have been nothing
short of miraculous. [The probability of war between affluent
democracies has declined to a **vanishing point**]{.underline}, where
[they no longer even see the need to prepare for the **possibility** of
a militarized dispute with one another]{.underline}. [The security
dilemma]{.underline} between neighbours -- [that **seemingly intrinsic**
feature of international anarchy]{.underline} -- **[no longer
exists]{.underline}** among them. This is most conspicuously the case
[in **North America** and **Western Europe**]{.underline}, the world\'s
most modernized and liberal-democratic regions.

[Realists]{.underline} in international relations theory [have **never
been able to explain** why [Holland and Belgium **no longer
fear**]{.mark} in the slightest a [German]{.mark} ([or French]{.mark})
[invasion]{.mark}]{.underline}, a historically unprecedented situation.
Similarly, [[Canada is **not**]{.mark} **at all [concerned]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark} the prospect of conquest by [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, though people
find it difficult to explain why exactly this is so. In East Asia, the
most developed countries, such as [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea]{.underline}, and
[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[do not fear]{.mark}** war among
themselves or with]{.underline} any of [the other [developed
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, though [they are **deeply apprehensive**
of being attacked by **less developed** neighbors]{.underline}, [such as
China or North Korea]{.underline}.

[With the collapse of the Soviet Empire and **rapid economic growth**
coupled with **democratization** in Eastern Europe]{.underline}, [East
and South Asia and Latin America]{.underline}, [the prospect of a major
war within the developed world seems to have become **very
remote**]{.underline}. Thus, war\'s geopolitical centre of gravity has
shifted radically. The [modernized]{.underline}, [economically developed
parts of the world have become a \'**zone of peace**\']{.underline}.
[War]{.underline} now [appears]{.underline} to be [confined to the
**less developed** parts of the globe]{.underline}, [the world\'s
\'**zone of war**\']{.underline}, [where countries that have lagged
behind in modernization and its pacifying spin-off effects occasionally
still fight among themselves]{.underline}, as well as with developed
countries.

### AT: Warming\-\--2AC

#### Growth and innovation [solves]{.underline} warming.

**Ogutonye, 21**---Policy Lead, Science & Innovation Unit, Tony Blair
Institute for Global Change (Olamide, "Should Tech Make Us Optimistic
About Climate Change?,"
<https://institute.global/policy/should-tech-make-us-optimistic-about-climate-change>,
dml)

In the middle of a climate emergency, it is challenging to stay upbeat.
Yet the good news is that [[investment in climate tech]{.mark}nology has
**[continued to grow]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the early 2010s.
US-listed [companies involved with providing technology solutions that
support global [decarbonisation]{.mark} have **consistently
[outperformed]{.mark}** [the average]{.mark}]{.underline} since 2019
(Figure 7). Venture capital ([VC]{.underline}) [investment]{.underline}
in the sector [grew **tenfold**]{.underline} between 2013 and 2018,
representing five times the growth rate of the overall VC market. By
comparison, the growth rate of VC investment in Artificial Intelligence
was a third of climate tech between 2013 and 2018 although AI is
renowned for its uptick within the same timeframe. Beyond VC, [[**public
investment** in climate]{.mark} technology research has [continued to
grow]{.mark}]{.underline} too. [In 2019]{.underline},
[government]{.underline} [r]{.underline}esearch [and]{.underline}
[d]{.underline}evelopment [funding for energy technologies alone stood
at **\$30 billion**]{.underline}, with around 80 per cent of it aimed at
low-carbon solutions.

In addition to the positive role of technology, [political leaders are
**increasingly showing** a willingness to make **ambitious commitments**
on climate]{.underline}. The **[Paris]{.underline}** Agreement is a case
in point. The international treaty [was]{.underline} adopted in 2015 and
[ratified internationally within a **year**]{.underline} -- a **[much
quicker]{.underline}** pace [than]{.underline} its predecessor, the
**[Kyoto]{.underline}** Protocol, which took eight years. The
[[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark} deal [[grew into a]{.mark} **political
[snowball]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[galvanising]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[**further [commitment]{.mark}** from most of the world's leading
emitters]{.underline} and arguably becoming the most symbolic climate
event of the 21st century. [The US withdrawal]{.underline} from the
Paris Agreement in 2019 dealt a political blow to the global pact
although the decision, since reversed by President Biden, [**did not
resonate** or **last long enough** to have any major
impact]{.underline}.

The [Biden-Harris]{.underline} administration [has]{.underline} already
[indicated that it **will not sit on the fence** but will instead
**revive** the country's leadership on climate action]{.underline}. [In
the **UK** and **elsewhere**]{.underline}, [**similar efforts** can be
observed as more countries commit to some form of **net zero
target**]{.underline}. [**[More than 100 countries]{.mark}** have
[pledged]{.mark} a commitment towards [net zero]{.mark}]{.underline},
with estimates suggesting that [[**over 70 per cent** of global
GDP]{.mark} and **55 per cent** of CO2 emissions are now covered by a
similar target]{.underline}. A Climate Action Tracker Report indicates
that [the **[cumulative effect]{.mark}** of countries'
pledges]{.underline} to the Paris Agreement -- if kept and fully
achieved -- [could **[keep]{.mark}**]{.underline} global temperature
rise below 2.1°C by 2100, putting the stated goal of **[[1.5°C
within]{.mark} striking [distance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

As explored in our recent Institute paper, there are also important
insights for politicians in terms of applying lessons from the Covid-19
pandemic to the climate emergency. Although the pandemic is different in
scale, complexity and timeline, it offers an immediate window into how
policy leaders can adapt and make decisions in order to better support
climate innovation. Countries can also apply the "recovering better
together" principles outlined by the UN, which calls for a commitment to
climate-related actions as economies recover from the Covid-19 slowdown.
**[[More than 60]{.mark} countries]{.underline}**, [including **high
emitters**]{.underline}, [are [already making an **explicit
promise**]{.mark} to link their]{.underline} nationally determined
contributions (**[NDC]{.underline}**) [to **Covid-19
recovery**]{.underline}, supported by the United Nations Development
Programme's Climate Promise programme. [Countries in the Global South
are **equally** aligning their climate mission with]{.underline}
international support for various [NDC support programmes]{.underline}.
[A green recovery can **cut** the level of 2030 emissions to **25 per
cent lower** than projections based on pre-Covid
commitments]{.underline} and put the world close to a 2°C pathway. The
pandemic has also highlighted the significance of tech innovation, not
least in record-breaking vaccine delivery but also in the suite of
digital solutions developed for contact tracing, compliance monitoring
and management of health-care records.

[[The]{.mark} global [financial landscape is **evolving** to
become]{.mark} more [responsive to climate
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since they were first issued in 2007,
[**green bonds** have grown into]{.underline} what is now estimated to
become [a **\$1 trillion market**]{.underline}. Analysts expect as much
as \$500 billion of green bonds this year as the EU raises capital for
its Covid recovery fund. From target-linked to transition bonds,
[innovations in this green market are being used to bring projects [in
**energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[transport]{.underline}**,
[**buildings** and **other**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**economic
[sectors]{.mark}** to life]{.underline}. [Investor-led
initiatives]{.underline} such as Climate Action 100+, whose members
control over \$50 trillion of assets, [are actively using funds to
**ensure** the world's largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters
**commit** to climate action]{.underline}. [Other investor networks are
pursuing a similar agenda]{.underline}, including Europe's Institutional
Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) and Australia and New
Zealand's Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC). [Humanity's
competence in technology and innovation will be **central** to the race
in mitigating and tackling climate change]{.underline}.

#### The [overall]{.underline} environment is [resilient]{.underline}\-\--'existential' threats are [false]{.underline}

Ronald **Bailey 20**, Science Correspondent at Reason, Member of the
Society of Environmental Journalists and the American Society for
Bioethics and Humanities, "The Global Environmental Apocalypse Has Been
Canceled", Reason Magazine, 8/1/2020,
<https://reason.com/2020/08/01/the-global-environmental-apocalypse-has-been-canceled/>
\[grammar edit\]

[[According to]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[activists]{.underline}]{.mark} and politicians, [humanity is beset on
all sides by [catastrophes]{.mark} that [could **kill**]{.mark} **off
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and maybe even our species. [Are
they right?]{.underline}

Absolutely not, answers the longtime environmental activist Michael
Shellenberger in an engaging new book, Apocalypse Never: Why
Environmental Alarmism Hurts Us All. \"[[Much]{.mark} of what people are
being told about the environment]{.underline}, including the climate,
[[is **wrong**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and we desperately need to get it
right,\" he writes. \"I decided to write Apocalypse Never after getting
fed up with [the **[exaggeration]{.mark}**, **alarmism**]{.underline},
and extremism that [are the enemy of]{.underline} positive, humanistic,
and [rational environmentalism]{.underline}.\" While fully acknowledging
that significant global **[[environmental
problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** exist, Shellenberger argues that they
**[[do not constitute]{.mark} inexorable [existential
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Economic [[growth and
**tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[progress]{.underline}]{.mark},
he says, [can [ameliorate them]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Shellenberger\'s analysis relies on largely uncontroversial mainstream
science, including reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) and the Food and Agriculture Organization. And as a
longstanding activist, Shellenberger is in a good position to parse the
motives behind the purveyors of doom.

Shellenberger\'s activism is the real deal. To raise a donation to the
Rainforest Action Network, he charged his friends \$5 to attend his 16th
birthday party. At 17 he went to Nicaragua to experience the Sandinista
revolution. In the 1990s he worked with the Landless Workers\' Movement
in Brazil.

In 2003, Shellenberger and allies launched the New Apollo Project to
jumpstart a no-carbon energy revolution over the next 10 years. In 2008,
Time named him \"A Hero of the Environment.\" He co-founded the
ecomodernist Breakthrough Institute, which advocates the use of advanced
technologies such as nuclear power and agricultural biotechnology to
decouple the economy from the ecology, allowing both humanity and the
natural world to flourish. More recently, he founded Environmental
Progress, which campaigns for, among other things, the deployment of
clean modern nuclear power. He is an invited expert reviewer of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\'s next assessment report.

Ohio Passes Controversial Conscience Clause for Doctors

So what does he say about climate change? \"On behalf of
environmentalists everywhere, I would like to formally apologize for the
climate scare we created over the last 30 years,\" he wrote in an essay
to promote his new book. \"[[Climate]{.mark} change [is]{.mark}
happening. It\'s just **[not the end of the
world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It\'s not even our most serious
environmental problem.\" Needless to say, there are environmentalists
everywhere who do not believe they have anything to apologize for. A
group of six researchers assembled by the widely respected Climate
Feedback fact-checking consortium rated his article as having low
scientific credibility.

Shellenberger doesn\'t devote much of Apocalypse Never to the science
behind man-made climate change. He basically accepts the consensus that
it\'s a significant problem and instead focuses on various claims about
the harms it is supposedly already causing. In that promotional essay,
he argues that (1) [[human\[s\]]{.mark} being [are **not**
causing]{.mark} a **\"sixth [mass extinction]{.mark},\"**]{.underline}
(2) [the [Amazon]{.mark} rainforests [are not the \"lungs]{.mark} of the
world,\"]{.underline} (3) [climate change is not making natural
disasters worse, and]{.underline} (4) [[fires]{.mark} have
[declined]{.mark} 25 percent around the world since 2003]{.underline}.

Shellenberger isn\'t denying the reality of man-made climate change.
He\'s arguing that [[humanity is]{.mark} **already [adapting]{.mark}**
to the ways climate change has been making weather patterns evolve,
[and]{.mark} that we **[will continue]{.mark}** to adapt successfully in
the future]{.underline}. His book is ultimately a sustained argument
that poverty is world\'s most important environmental problem, and that
[rising [**prosperity** and]{.mark} increasing **[tech]{.mark}nological
[prowess]{.mark}** [will]{.mark}]{.underline} ameliorate or
[[**reverse** most]{.mark} deleterious environmental
[trends]{.mark}]{.underline}.

monthly columnist for Scientific American, and a Presidential Fellow at
Chapman University; "Why Artificial Intelligence Is Not an Existential
Threat," Skeptic, vol. 22, no. 2, pp. 29--35\]

Why AI is not an Existential Threat First, [most [AI doomsday
prophecies]{.mark} are [grounded]{.mark} in the]{.underline} **[[false
analogy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [between]{.underline} **[human
nature]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**computer nature**, or natural
intelligence and artificial intelligence. We are thinking machines, but
natural selection also designed into us]{.underline}
**[emotions]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[shortcut]{.underline}**
the **[thinking]{.underline}** process because natural intelligences are
limited in speed and capacity by the number of neurons that can be
crammed into a skull that has to pass through a pelvic opening at birth,
whereas artificial intelligence need not be so restricted. We don\'t
need to compute the caloric value of foods, for example, we just feel
hungry. We don\'t need to calculate the waist-to-hip ratio of women or
the shoulder-to-waist ratio of men in our quest for genetically healthy
potential mates; we just feel attracted to someone and mate with them.
We don\'t need to work out the genetic cost of raising someone else\'s
offspring if our mate is unfaithful; we just feel jealous. We don\'t
need to figure the damage of an unfair or non-reciprocal exchange with
someone else; we just feel injustice and desire revenge.
[[Emotions]{.mark} are]{.underline} **[proxies]{.underline}** [for
getting us to act]{.underline} in ways that lead to an increase in
reproductive success, particularly [in response to threats]{.underline}
faced by our Paleolithic ancestors. Anger leads us to strike out, fight
back, and defend ourselves against danger. Fear causes us to pull back,
retreat, and escape from risks. Disgust directs us to push out, eject,
and expel that which is bad for us. [Computing the odds of danger in any
given situation takes too long. We need to]{.underline} **[react
instantly]{.underline}**. Emotions shortcut the information processing
power needed by brains that would otherwise become bogged down with all
the computations necessary for survival. [Their purpose, in an ultimate
causal sense, is to [drive behaviors toward goals]{.mark} selected by
evolution to]{.underline} **[[enhance survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and reproduction. **[[AIs]{.underline}]{.mark}** \-- even AGIs and ASIs
\-- [will [have]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[no need]{.underline}** [of such
emotions]{.underline}]{.mark} and so there would be no reason to program
them in unless, say, terrorists chose to do so for their own evil
purposes. But that\'s a human nature problem, not a computer nature
issue. [[To believe]{.mark} that an [ASI would be]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[\"evil]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** in any emotional sense [[is to
assume a computer cognition that includes]{.mark} such psychological
traits as]{.underline} [**acquisitiveness**, competitiveness,
[vengeance, and bellicosity]{.mark}, which seem to be projections coming
from the mostly]{.underline} **[male writers]{.underline}**
[who]{.underline} **[concoct]{.underline}** such [**dystopias**, [not
features any **programmer**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[would]{.underline}
[**bother including**,]{.underline}]{.mark} [assuming that
it]{.underline} [**could even be done**. What would it mean to program
an emotion into a computer? [When]{.mark} IBM\'s [Deep Blue
defeated]{.mark} chess master Garry [Kasparov]{.mark}]{.underline} in
1997, [[did it feel **triumphant**]{.underline}]{.mark}, vengeful, or
bellicose? [**[Of course not]{.mark}**. It **[wasn\'t even
\"aware]{.mark}\"**]{.underline} [\-- in the human sense of
self-conscious knowledge \-- that it was]{.underline} [**playing
chess**, much less feeling nervous about possibly losing]{.underline} to
the reigning world champion (which it did in the first tournament played
in 1996). In fact, toward the end of the first game of the second
tournament, on the 44th move, Deep Blue made a legal but
incomprehensible move of pushing its rook all the way to the last row of
the opposition side. It accomplished nothing offensively or defensively,
leading Kasparov to puzzle over it out of concern that he was missing
something in the computer\'s strategy. It turned out to be an error in
Deep Blue\'s programming that led to this fail-safe default move. It was
a bug that Kasparov mistook as a feature, and as a result some chess
experts contend it led him to be less confident in his strategizing and
to second-guess his responses in the subsequent games. It even led him
to suspect foul play and human intervention behind Deep Blue, and this
paranoia ultimately cost him the tournamentt.\[ 13\] Computers don\'t
get paranoid, the HAL 9000 computer in 2001 notwithstanding. [Or
consider **Watson**]{.underline}, the IBM computer built by David
Ferrucci and his team of IBM research scientists tasked with designing
an AI that could rival human champions at the game of Jeopardy! This was
a far more formidable challenge than Deep Blue faced because of the
prerequisite to understand language and the often multiple meanings of
words, not to mention needing an encyclopedic knowledge of trivia
(Watson had access to Wikipedia for this). After beating the all-time
greatest Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011, did
Watson feel flushed with pride after its victory? Did Watson even know
that it won Jeopardy!? I put the question to none other than Ferrucci
himself at a dinner party in New York in conjunction with the 2011
Singularity Summit. His answer surprised me: \"Yes, [Watson knows it won
Jeopardy!]{.underline}\" I was skeptical. How could that be, since such
self-awareness is not yet possible in computers? \"[Because]{.underline}
**[I told it]{.underline}** that it won,\" he replied with a wry smile.
Sure, and you could even program Watson or Deep Blue to vocalize a
Howard Dean-like victory scream when it wins, but that is [still
a]{.underline} **[far cry]{.underline}** [from a computer feeling
triumphant]{.underline}. [This brings to mind the **\"hard problem\" of
consciousness**]{.underline} [\-- if we don\'t understand how this
happens in humans,]{.underline} **[how could we program it into
computers?]{.underline}** As Steven Pinker elucidated in his answer to
the 2015 Edge Question on what to think about machines that think,
[\"[AI dystopias]{.mark} project a]{.underline} **[parochial alpha-male
psychology]{.underline}** [onto the]{.underline} [**concept of
intelligence**. They [assume]{.mark} that [superhumanly intelligent
robots would develop **goals** like]{.mark} **deposing their
masters**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[[taking over the
world.]{.mark}\"]{.underline}** [It is]{.underline} **[equally
possible]{.underline}**, Pinker suggests, [that \"artificial
intelligence will naturally develop along]{.underline} female
[lines]{.underline}: fully capable of solving problems, but
[with]{.underline} **[no desire to annihilate innocents]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[dominate the civilization]{.underline}**.\"\[ 14\]
So [the fear that computers will become emotionally evil are unfounded,
because without the suite of these evolved emotions it will]{.underline}
**[never occur to AIs]{.underline}** [to take such actions against
us]{.underline}. [What about an [ASI
**inadvertently**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[causing]{.underline}]{.mark}
our [[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark} by turning us into paperclips, or
tiling the entire Earth\'s surface with solar panels? [Such scenarios
imply yet another emotion \-- the feeling of]{.underline}
**[[valuing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [or]{.underline} **[wanting
something]{.underline}**. As the science writer Michael Chorost adroitly
notes, [when humans resist an AI from undertaking any form of global
tiling, it \"will have to be able to]{.underline} **[imagine
counteractions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**want to carry them
out**.\" Yet, \"until an AI has feelings, it\'s going to be unable
to]{.underline} [**want to do anything at all**, let alone **act counter
to humanity\'s interests**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[fight off
human resistance]{.underline}**.\" Further, Chorost notes, \"the minute
an A.I. wants anything, it will live in a universe with rewards and
punishments \-- including punishments from us for behaving badly. In
order [to survive in a world dominated by humans, a nascent A.I. will
have to develop a humanlike moral sense that certain things are right
and others are wrong. By the time it\'s in a position to **imagine**
tiling the Earth with solar panels, it\'ll **know that it would be
morally wrong**]{.underline} to do so.\"\[ 15\] From here Chorost builds
on an argument made by Peter Singer in The Expanding Circle (and Steven
Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature\[ 16\] that I also developed
in The Moral Arc\[ 17\] and Robert Wright explored in Nonzero\[ 18\]),
and that is the propensity for natural intelligence to evolve moral
emotions that include reciprocity, cooperativeness, and even altruism.
Natural intelligences such as ours also includes the capacity to reason,
and once you are on Singer\'s metaphor of the \"escalator of reason\" it
can carry you upward to genuine morality and concerns about harming
others. \"Reasoning is inherently expansionist. It seeks universal
application,\" Singer notes.\[ 19\] Chorost draws the implication:
\"[AIs will have to step on the escalator of reason just like humans
have, because they will need to]{.underline} **[bargain for goods in a
human-dominated economy]{.underline}** [and they will face **human
resistance to bad behavior**]{.underline}.\"\[ 20\] Finally, [for an AI
to get around this problem it would need to evolve emotions on its own,
but the only way for this to happen in a world dominated by the natural
intelligence called humans would be for]{.underline}
**[us]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [**allow it to happen**, which we
**wouldn\'t**]{.underline} [because there\'s]{.underline} [**time enough
to see it coming**. Bostrom\'s \"treacherous turn\" will come
with]{.underline} **[road signs ahead]{.underline}** warning us that
there\'s a sharp bend in the highway with enough time for us to grab the
wheel. [Incremental progress is what we see in most technologies,
including and especially AI, which will continue to serve us in **the
manner we desire and need**]{.underline}. Instead of Great Leap Forward
or Giant Fall Backward, think Small Steps Upward. As I proposed in The
Moral Arc, [instead of Utopia or dystopia, think]{.underline}
**[protopia]{.underline}**, a term coined by the futurist Kevin Kelly,
who described it in an Edge conversation this way: \"I call myself a
protopian, not a Utopian. I believe in progress in an incremental way
where every year it\'s better than the year before but not by very much
\-- just a micro amount.\"\[ 21\] Almost all progress in science and
technology, including computers and AI, is of a protopian nature.
Rarely, if ever, do technologies lead to either Utopian or dystopian
societies. Pinker agrees that [there is]{.underline} [**[plenty of
time]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [plan for all conceivable
contingencies and [build safeguards]{.mark} into our AI systems. \"They
would not need any ponderous \'rules of robotics\' or some newfangled
**moral philosophy**]{.underline} [to do this, just the
same]{.underline} **[common sense]{.underline}** [that went into the
design of]{.underline} **[food processors]{.underline}**, **[table
saws]{.underline}**, **[space heaters]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[automobiles]{.underline}**.\" [Sure, an ASI would be many orders of
magnitude]{.underline} **[smarter]{.underline}** [than
these]{.underline} machines, [but Pinker reminds us of the]{.underline}
**[AI hyperbole]{.underline}** [we\'ve been fed for decades: \"The worry
that an AI system would be **so clever**]{.underline} at attaining one
of the goals programmed into it (like commandeering energy) [that it
would **run roughshod over**]{.underline} the **[others]{.underline}**
(like human safety) [assumes that AI will descend upon us **faster than
we can design fail-safe precautions**. The reality is that [progress in
AI is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**hype-defyingly slow**]{.mark}, and there
will be plenty of time for feedback from incremental implementations,
with humans wielding the screwdriver at every stage.\"]{.underline}\[
22\] Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt agrees, responding to the fears
expressed by Hawking and Musk this way: [\"Don\'t you think the humans
would notice this, and start **turning off the
computers**?\"]{.underline} He also noted the irony in the fact that
Musk has invested \$1 billion into a company called OpenAI that is
\"promoting precisely AI of the kind we are describing.\"\[ 23\]
[Google\'s own DeepMind [has]{.mark} developed the concept of an **AI
[off-switch]{.mark}**, playfully described as a **\"big red
button\"**]{.underline} to be pushed in the event of an attempted AI
takeover. \"We have proposed a framework to allow a human operator to
repeatedly safely interrupt a reinforcement learning agent while making
sure the agent will not learn to prevent or induce these
interruptions,\" write the authors Laurent Orseau from DeepMind and
Stuart Armstrong from the Future of Humanity Institute, in a paper
titled \"Safely Interruptible Agents.\" They even suggest a
precautionary scheduled shutdown every night at 2 AM for an hour so that
both humans and AI are accustomed to the idea. [\"Safe [interruptibility
can be useful to take control of a robot that is
misbehaving]{.mark}]{.underline} and may lead to irreversible
consequences, or to take it out of a delicate situation, or even to
temporarily use it to achieve a task it did not learn to perform or
would not normally receive rewards for this.\"\[ 24\] [As well, it is
good to keep in mind that artificial intelligence is not the same as
artificial **consciousness**. Thinking machines **may not be
sentient**]{.underline} machines. Finally, Andrew Ng of Baidu responded
to Elon Musk\'s ASI concerns by noting (in a jab at the entrepreneur\'s
ambitions for colonizing the red planet) it would be \"like worrying
about overpopulation on Mars when we have not even set foot on the
planet yet.\"\[ 25\] Both Utopian and dystopian visions of AI are based
on a projection of the future quite unlike anything history has given
us. Yet, even Ray Kurzweil\'s \"law of accelerating returns,\" as
remarkable as it has been has nevertheless advanced at a pace that has
allowed for considerable ethical deliberation with appropriate checks
and balances applied to various technologies along the way. With time,
[even if an unforeseen motive somehow began to emerge in an AI we would
have the **time to reprogram it** before it got out of
control]{.underline}. That is also the judgment of Alan Winfield, an
engineering professor and co-author of the Principles of Robotics, a
list of rules for regulating robots in the real world that goes far
beyond Isaac Asimov\'s famous three laws of robotics (which were, in any
case, designed to fail as plot devices for science fictional
narratives).26 Winfield points out that [all]{.underline} of these
[doomsday scenarios depend on a]{.underline} **[long sequence of big
ifs]{.underline}** [to unroll sequentially:]{.underline} \"If we succeed
in building human equivalent AI and if that AI acquires a full
understanding of how it works, and if it then succeeds in improving
itself to produce super-intelligent AI, and if that super-AI,
accidentally or maliciously, starts to consume resources, and if we fail
to pull the plug, then, yes, we may well have a problem. [The risk,
while not impossible, is **improbable**]{.underline}.\"\[ 27

### AT: AI\-\--1AR

#### No catastrophic AI impacts -- their ev is flawed scholarship 

Edward Moore **Geist 15**, MacArthur Nuclear Security Fellow at Stanford
University\'s Center for International Security and Cooperation, 8/9/15,
"Is artificial intelligence really an existential threat to humanity?,"
<http://thebulletin.org/artificial-intelligence-really-existential-threat-humanity8577>

Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies is an astonishing book
with an alarming thesis: Intelligent machines are "quite possibly the
most important and most daunting challenge humanity has ever faced." In
it, Oxford University philosopher Nick
**[[Bostrom]{.underline}]{.mark}**, who has built his reputation on the
study of "existential risk," [[argues]{.underline}]{.mark} forcefully
that **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence [[might be the most apocalyptic
tech]{.mark}nology of all]{.underline}. With intellectual powers beyond
human comprehension, he prognosticates, [self-improving **a**rtificial
**i**ntelligences could effortlessly enslave or destroy Homo
sapiens]{.underline} if they so wished. While he expresses skepticism
that such machines can be controlled, [Bostrom claims]{.underline} that
[if we program the right "human-friendly" values]{.underline} into them,
[they will continue to uphold these virtues, no matter how powerful the
machines become]{.underline}.

These views have found an eager audience. In August 2014, PayPal
cofounder and electric car magnate Elon Musk tweeted "Worth reading
Superintelligence by **[Bostrom]{.underline}**. We need to be super
careful with AI. Potentially more dangerous than nukes." Bill Gates
declared, "I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't
understand why some people are not concerned." More ominously, legendary
astrophysicist Stephen Hawking concurred: "I think the development of
full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."
Proving his concern went beyond mere rhetoric, Musk donated \$10 million
to the Future of Life Institute "to support research aimed at keeping AI
beneficial for humanity."

Superintelligence [is propounding a **solution that will not work** to a
**[problem]{.mark} that**]{.underline} probably **[[does not
exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but Bostrom and Musk are right that now is
the time to take the ethical and policy implications of artificial
intelligence seriously. [The [extraordinary claim]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[machines can]{.underline}]{.mark} become so intelligent as to
[[gain demonic powers requires **extraordinary
ev**]{.mark}**idence**]{.underline}, particularly [since]{.underline}
artificial intelligence ([AI) [researchers]{.mark} have [struggled to
create machines that show much]{.mark}]{.underline} evidence of
[[intelligence]{.mark} at all]{.underline}. While these investigators'
ultimate goals have varied since the emergence of the discipline in the
mid-1950s, the fundamental aim of AI has always been to create machines
that demonstrate intelligent behavior, whether to better understand
human cognition or to solve practical problems. Some AI researchers even
tried to create the self-improving reasoning machines Bostrom fears.
Through decades of bitter experience, however, they learned not only
that [creating intelligence]{.underline} is more difficult than they
initially expected, but also that it [grows increasingly harder the
smarter one tries to become]{.underline}. [Bostrom's concept of
"[superintelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}," which he defines as "any
intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in
virtually all domains of interest," [[builds upon]{.underline}]{.mark}
similar [**[discredited assumptions about]{.mark} the nature of
[thought]{.mark}** that the [pioneers of AI held decades
ago]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A summary of Bostrom's arguments,
contextualized in the history of artificial intelligence, demonstrates
how this is so.

In the 1950s, the founders of the field of artificial intelligence
assumed that the discovery of a few fundamental insights would make
machines smarter than people within a few decades. By the 1980s,
however, they discovered fundamental limitations that show that [[there
will]{.mark} always [be diminishing returns to]{.mark} additional
[processing power]{.mark} and data. Although these technical
[hurdles]{.mark} pose no barrier to]{.underline} the creation of
[human-level AI, they [will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
**[[forestall]{.mark} the [sudden]{.mark} emergence of an [unstoppable
"superintelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

BROOKS: People always want us to fight, but we don\'t really. I think,
although I agree with the general themes that Andy talks about, I think
**[it\'s very [easy]{.mark} [for people]{.mark} who are [not]{.mark}
[deep]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nology itself [to make
generalizations]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [which may
be]{.underline} a little [dangerous]{.underline}. And [we\'ve certainly
seen that recently with Elon [Musk]{.mark}, Bill [Gates]{.mark}, Stephen
[Hawking, all saying AI is]{.mark}]{.underline} just taking off and
it\'s [[going to take over]{.mark} the world very quickly]{.underline}.
And [the thing that they share is **[none of them work in this
technological]{.mark} [field]{.mark}.**]{.underline} So let me explain
why---and they\'re all smart people, but I think they\'re making a
fundamental error and it gets to NEIL, actually. THOMPSON: After taking
down Bill Gates, Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, he\'s going to take down
the Dalai Lama. Please continue, Rodney. BROOKS: So let\'s go back to an
example from the \'90s, when IBM\'s Deep Blue beat Kasparov, beat the
world chess champion. And Kasparov got up and said, well, at least it
didn\'t enjoy beating me. That was his---holding on to his humanity. And
now, today, you can get programs that run on---and that was on a
supercomputer and now you can get programs that run on laptops. There\'s
about twelve of them that have a better chess rating than any human
being has ever had. So people see that \-- MCAFEE: It\'s so bad
now---let me underscore what Rod is saying. It\'s so bad now that they
asked human grand master a couple years ago how he would prepare for a
match against a computer and he said, I\'d bring a hammer. BROOKS: So
they can play chess really, really well. And I think [[people
generalize]{.underline}]{.mark} that [in the way that if a person can do
some task really]{.underline}, really well, [they can do adjacent tasks
quite well]{.underline}. But [[none of those chess programs can play
tic-tac-toe]{.underline}]{.mark}. Imagine a chess grand master who
couldn\'t play tic-tac-toe. It doesn\'t make sense. None of those chess
programs can give advice to an aspiring human on how to play better.
[All they can be is a sparring partner.]{.underline} MCAFEE: That
program couldn\'t play tic-tac-toe without being substantially
redirected, right? BROOKS: Right. So people, I think, are seeing some of
the image labeling that\'s going on, for instance. Google came out with
image labeling, which is a great commercial problem for them. They want
to be able to label images. And one of the examples was, that Jeff
Hinton shows, one of the chief scientists, is, it\'s a picture and it
says there\'s a baby holding a teddy bear or doll in there. You look at
it, it\'s a baby holding a teddy---a doll. But then if you ask the
program, where is the baby? All it can say is, well, this pixel has 10
percent probability of being a baby, this pixel has 80 percent. And
people have done experiments. You have a mashup of, you know, a
grotesque mashup of baby parts and it says it\'s a baby. It\'s a baby.
It\'s got all the parts. But a person says, no, that\'s a grotesque
mashup of baby parts in the image. THOMPSON: But Abhinav, you\'ve solved
this, right? GUPTA: No, no, no. BROOKS: Well, he\'s working towards\--
GUPTA: So, can I\-- BROOKS: He\'s working towards it because it\'s such
a hard problem. GUPTA: Yeah, OK. Thank you. So since we are talking
about images, I think I should chime in a little bit and tell you
that---so what Andrew is talking about, that we have made big advances,
again, they\'re very, very specific tasks. Given an image, tell me what
label can you put on that image? We have gotten really good at this
task. Some people claim even better than humans. I don\'t buy that, but
let\'s assume that even better than humans. But that doesn\'t mean we
can do anything else apart from that exact task. And that\'s what Rodney
was talking about. They have no idea that---what does baby mean? What
does having a baby mean in those images? No idea. You, as a human, would
know, OK, if I\'m saying there\'s a baby, it has a lot of meaning
inside. You get a lot of meaning out of that thing. So [while we have
made significant advances]{.underline} in the last two years, I want to
boil it down a little bit and say [**we still are a long, long way to
go** but Elon Musk or Bill Gates, everyone is talking
about]{.underline}, we still have a long way to go. But there\'s hope,
and that\'s what I think we have to see here. Two years ago, if you
asked me can computers take an image and solve this problem, I would say
I have invested seven years of my life but if you give me a random
image, it will not work. And now, given a random image, it will work. So
all it \-- MCAFEE: This was the guy who was doing this for a living and
if you asked him two years ago would this happen, he would say, no. This
progress is weirdly fast and is surprising insiders in the field. GUPTA:
Yeah. I agree. And I\'m an insider in the field and I\'m very surprised,
I have to say. Now, at this point of time, I am like living in an awe of
myself, in some sense, that---but it was like Rodney told---Rodney told
us that in thirty-five years he never thought he\'d do this all. I also
thought some of it, like that, for thirty-five years, I will not
solve---see this kind of classification performance. But as I\'m saying
this, still a long, long way to go and much harder way to go.
What---where all the kind of gains have come from is the data. And I
think---so technology, this like deep-learning technology has been there
from \'70s and \'80s. [Don\'t misunderstand that [this
tech]{.mark}nology came two years ago and everything\'s changed. **This
[has been there for thirty years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It\'s just that
for the first time in our technological advances we have data for this
deep-learning technology to learn. MCAFEE: Let me jump on this because I
think the three of us are really agreeing, instead of disagreeing. I
chose my adjective pretty carefully. I said these advances are going to
be economically significant. I completely agree with Rod that
**[[they\'re not going to be existentially significant on any timeframe
that we]{.mark} really [need to worry
about]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} for exactly the reasons that
you\'re bringing up. One way to think about this, the way I try to get
my mind around it, is there are, from what I\'ve been able to take in,
[there are]{.underline} something like between [ten and twenty really
fundamental challenges]{.underline} that these guys and [their
discipline have been working on]{.underline}. Common sense is a really
great example of that. As I\'ve looked around, these breakthroughs that
we\'re seeing seem to be---kind of indicate that [we\'re making real
progress on **one of those challenges**, the challenges of learning in a
pretty unstructured environment]{.underline}. That\'s a big deal. [There
are lots of other fundamental challenges in the discipline where the
progress has not been as fast]{.underline}, and these are the ones that
you\'re working on.

Although it was not clear at the time, Bill [Joy's article warning of
the dangers of emerging technologies was to spawn a veritable "dystopia
industry]{.underline}." [More recent contributions have tended to focus
on **a**rtificial **i**ntelligence]{.underline}, or AI; electric car and
space technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has warned that AI is "summoning
the demon" (Mack, 2015), while physicist Stephen [Hawking has argued
that "the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the
end of the human race]{.underline}" (Cellan-Jones, 2014). The Future of
Life Institute (2015) recently released an open letter signed by many
scientific and research notables urging a ban on "offensive autonomous
weapons beyond meaningful human control." Meanwhile, the UN holds
conferences and European activists mount campaigns against what they
characterize as "killer robots" (see, e.g., Human Rights Watch, 2012).
Headlines reinforce a sense of existential crisis; in the military and
security domain, cyber conflict runs rampant, with hackers accessing
millions of US personnel records, including sensitive security clearance
documents. Technologies such as uncrewed aerial vehicles, commonly
referred to as "drones," are highly contentious in both civil and
conflict environments, for many different reasons. A recent US Army
Research Laboratory report foresees genetically and technologically
enhanced soldiers networked with their battlespace robotic partners and
remarks that "the presence of super humans on the battlefield in the
2050 timeframe is highly likely because the various components needed to
enable this development already exist and are undergoing rapid
evolution" (Kott et al., 2015: 19). How is one to think about this
outpouring of analysis, hypothesis, events, and existential angst? A
useful first step is to realize that [there are three levels to such
discussions of technology]{.underline}.2 [[Level I is the instrumental
level]{.underline}]{.mark}: a gun shoots a bullet and kills someone; a
watch is used to tell time; a vaccine is used to prime an individual's
immune system to protect against a disease. [Level II is the systems
level]{.underline}: an uncrewed aerial vehicle conducting surveillance
is part of a battlefield intelligence system; watches function in a
globally standardized time system that was only institutionalized in the
United States by an act of Congress in 1918; vaccinations are part of a
public health system. [Level III, [the effect of a technology]{.mark} on
individual psychology, society and culture, economic patterns,
geopolitical status, and other Earth systems, [is unpredictable and
uncertain]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the major drivers for
standardized time, for example, was railroad technology, which was
certainly not foreseen by those who first began developing steam
locomotives. It is important to remember, however, that even if the
specifics of Level III impacts cannot be predicted a priori, they will
occur. Level I effects are usually not difficult to figure out: They are
the reasons that a technology is commercialized. For example, the Level
I effect of a bomb-dismantling robot is clear: It helps save the lives
of soldiers who would otherwise have to be doing that job. Level II
effects can be more complex and may point in different directions than
first-order effects. A robotic hummingbird surveillance device may have
entirely beneficial effects if used in counterinsurgency, because it can
improve targeting and thus reduce collateral damage (Level I effect).
But if the same technology becomes widely available to political parties
and divorce lawyers, it could have very negative effects on privacy and
public discourse (a Level II effect). And, hypothetically, robotic bugs
and hummingbirds, combined with data-mining software and massive
databases, could become important tools of techno-totalitarian elites, a
possible, but hypothetical, Level III effect. [This distinction among
Level I, Level II, and Level III is useful because much of the
[confusion regarding emerging techn]{.mark}ologies [comes from
conflating]{.mark} relatively predictable [Level I aspects]{.mark} of an
emerging technology [with highly unpredictable Level III
hypotheticals]{.mark}, and treating them as equally valid insights into
future technological trajectories]{.underline}. [Not so. A concern about
the use of drones to attack human targets in countries that are not
participants in a conflict is qualitatively different than polemics
against "killer robots," and [while conflating the two for purposes of
argumentation]{.mark} may be effective, it [is]{.mark} profoundly
[misleading]{.mark}]{.underline}. We have historical and operational
data that enable us to evaluate the former; we don't even know what a
"killer robot" really is, except as an evocative term, and virtually no
idea what would happen if such technologies became widespread in the
real world. An analogous analytical mistake occurs when a particular use
of a technology is treated as if it were separable from the technology
itself. A medical advance in computer-brain interfaces in prosthetics,
for example, is the same technology that might be used in the near
future to directly connect a soldier to a remote weapons system. Any
effort to ban "military AI" will fail because "military AI" is not a
relevant technology category; rather, it is the advance of the
underlying technology as a whole that ensures at some point that AI will
be integrated into military devices. (Notably and presumably
unintentionally, the proselytizing against "military AI" fails to admit
that such a policy implicitly favors powers, such as Russia and ISIS,
that are operating under doctrines of asymmetric warfare that privilege
non-traditional tactics, technologies, and conflict.) It is precisely
this confusion that one notes in the language used in many of the
comments on and critiques of emerging technologies, including some of
the examples given above. It is not so much a question of whether these
popular dystopian visions are accurate predictions: They almost
certainly are not, because the ability to predict the future paths and
implications of complex and powerful technology systems is simply
nonexistent. Level I assertions of knowledge are being extended to
inherently unpredictable Level III systems without understanding that an
important conceptual shark has been jumped. But it is useful to explore
the assumptions underneath the current rage for dystopian visions of
emerging technologies, which are not as implausible as some have
suggested. To reduce such confusion, let me be clear from the beginning.
Because much recent commentary regarding emerging technologies is
generic and apocalyptic, that is what this essay will focus on. In other
words, I will not concern myself with whether a particular weapon
system, or smart phone app, or cyber worm, or AI tool is good or bad or
competitively successful, a Level I question. Nor will I address the
foreseeable Level II effects, an analysis which, as in the case of Level
I, would focus on particular technological artifacts or applications and
their systemic effects. Rather, since apocalyptic tends to be Level III
stuff, that's where we'll go. Emerging technologies as an Earth system
[The first question to ask about emerging technologies is deceptively
simple: Is today really that different? Is there something about today's
emerging technologies---which for purposes of this analysis include
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information and communication technology
(ICT), robotics, applied cognitive science, humtech]{.underline} (design
and engineering of the human as a foundational emerging technology),
[and their various combinations and permutations---that is qualitatively
different from those that characterized other eras of technological
change?]{.underline} [If there isn't, much of today's dramatic language
can be understood as simply a reflection of the emphasis that all humans
give to the particular era and landscape and culture within which they
exist. Each generation [tends to overemphasize the degree of change that
it experiences]{.mark}, partly [because of the immediacy of the
stresses]{.mark} to which it is exposed, and partly because it is [easy
to underestimate how difficult and unpredictable life was in the
past]{.mark}]{.underline}**,** [since when one looks back at history it
seems to flow logically and necessarily]{.underline}. Indeed,
[[apocalyptic fears have been common when many major technology systems
first emerged]{.mark} because of this immediacy, even as subsequent
generations grew to view the technology as banal, even
boring]{.underline}. [[In the early days of railroads]{.mark}, for
example, there was a [widespread belief that traveling]{.mark} at the
heretofore unimaginable speed of 25 miles per hour [would kill the
passengers]{.mark}, in part because such technology was against the
obvious will of God]{.underline}. As an Ohio school board put it, If God
had designed that His intelligent creatures should travel at the
frightful speed of 15 miles an hour by steam, He would have foretold it
through His holy prophets. It is a device of Satan to lead immortal
souls down to Hell. (Nye, 1994: 57)3 In this case, however, a strong
argument can be made that emerging technologies today are different not
just in degree, but in kind, from those of the past. To begin with, the
scope, scale, and speed of technological change are unprecedented. Where
previous waves of technological change have involved a few core
technologies, such as railroads or electrification, today technological
evolution is occurring across the entire technological frontier.
Partially as a result of such technologies rippling across a population
of seven billion people, we now live on a terraformed planet, the first
world we know of anywhere that has been shaped by the deliberate
activities of a single species. That is not a discontinuous process, but
it is qualitatively new. Moreover, as the discussion of the engineered
warrior of 2050 suggests, the human itself has become a design space. It
is certainly true that people have always changed themselves in many
ways, from consuming intoxicants of all kinds, to medicine, to
education, but there is little question that the direct interventions
that are now possible, combined with accelerating advances in fields
such as neuroscience, genetics and molecular biology, and prosthetics,
make virtually all aspects of the human, including cognitive and
psychological domains, potentially subject to design. That the designer
is not just engineering external systems, but him- or herself, adds a
degree of reflexivity, nonlinearity, and complexity that makes simple
predictions about particular technologies tangential and irrelevant at
best. It is worth emphasizing in passing that the argument that humans
are at risk from emerging technologies is in an important sense
circular. Humans are increasingly both designer and designed; they are,
in other words, increasingly an emerging technology in their own right.
People are many things, but they are now, and certainly will be in the
future, a design project. Thus, in a meaningful way the argument that
people are at risk from emerging technologies becomes the argument that
emerging technologies are at risk from emerging technologies, which
makes little sense, and isn't very helpful analytically, or in guiding
policy or practice. Additionally, technological evolution is
accelerating, which has significant implications. Past rates of
technological change were slow enough that psychological, social, and
institutional adjustments were possible, but today technology changes so
rapidly that technology systems decouple from governance mechanisms of
all kinds. All these factors, operating together, synergistically
increase the impact, speed, and depth of change. Any technology potent
enough to be interesting will inevitably destabilize existing
institutions, power relationships, social structures, reigning economic
and technological systems, and cultural assumptions. Previous waves of
technological change---from steam and coal, to electricity, to rail and
automotive technologies---have destabilized and restructured human and
natural systems at all scales, interacting unpredictably with
contemporary natural, human, and built systems. Railroads, for example,
opened up continental interiors, creating the underlying transportation
infrastructure necessary to support industrialized agriculture, which,
coupled to advances in production of artificial fertilizers and
innovation in farm machinery, created the potential for dramatic
increases in global human population. It also dramatically changed
ecologies and landscapes; the American Midwest is an agricultural
breadbasket, not a large swamp, because railroads provided the link
between that farming region and the demand of the East Coast and, via
steamship, Europe. The Earth's atmosphere has been in part restructured
by development of internal combustion engine technology coupled to a
psychologically potent automotive technology, which is in turn based on
a massive fossil fuel infrastructure. Proposals to address climate
change through so-called "geoengineering technologies," from designing
the atmosphere to reflect incoming sunlight to deploying devices that
capture carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, are explicitly intended to
engineer major natural systems and cycles. In short, major new
technologies are not just about artifacts; rather, they represent an
unpredictable, sometimes apparently discontinuous, shift in the
structure of integrated Earth systems. Moreover, these shifts are not
predictable a priori; railroads, for example, required new systems of
time, of communication, and, more subtly, of finance and of corporate
management. Development of a mass consumption economy, with washing
machines from new merchandising giants and cars from Detroit, required
innovation in the development of consumer credit, and massive coupled
innovation in everything from road systems to supply-chain management.
Widespread consumer credit, in turn, generated an ability to consume,
and a concomitant quality of life, that was beyond imagining for those
generations of humans that lived prior to the 20th century. It is thus
highly likely that the first implicit assumption of the dystopian
perspective is correct: Things are indeed different today, and the
difference is fundamental and qualitative, not simply one of degree.
Emerging technologies are making everything from individual molecules,
to the human, to the planet itself, design spaces. Moreover, it is also
likely that technological evolution, and all the concomitant changes in
coupled institutional, social, economic, and cultural systems, will be
more challenging and complex than anything humans have yet experienced.
The remaining two issues, then, are: First, what can we do about it; and
second, is this the end of humanity? What can we do about it? Precisely
because new technologies are disruptive, they inevitably call forth
opposition, both by conservative social forces and by threatened
economic interests. Historical examples abound. With railroad
technology, for example, conservative states such as the
Austro-Hungarian Empire and Russia resisted rapid deployment, in part
because it was feared that railroads might create social unrest in the
still somewhat feudal and highly stratified cultures that characterized
such countries; the French held back because of concerns it would
destroy rural culture. The predictable result was that modernizing
states that realized the commercial and military potential of railroad
technology, such as Prussia, rapidly overtook the laggards in building
rail infrastructure, with an eventual shift in geopolitical stature. In
the United States, railroads were bitterly opposed by river
transportation interests; in fact, Abraham Lincoln, when still a
practicing lawyer, argued and won the seminal case for the Rock Island
Railroad.4 (River shippers at the time were arguing that any railroad
bridge over a river was an unlawful obstruction of commerce; had they
been successful, railroads would have been limited to operating between
rivers and streams, but not crossing them.) A more recent example is
provided by the thousands of people sued by the Recording Industry
Association of America in its vain effort to defend a technologically
obsolete business model for the distribution of music. There are plenty
of reasons, in other words, why emerging technologies might be regarded
as dangerous and disruptive, and thus worth stifling. History, however,
indicates that while local opposition can be successful, it will not
halt the evolution of technology. Consider, for example, the Japanese
attempt to limit gunpowder technology to preserve traditional Samurai
culture; successful in the short term, it left Japan open to subjugation
by Western naval forces with gunpowder technology. Similarly,
environmentalists and governments in Europe have aggressively opposed
genetic engineering (GMOs, or "genetically modified organisms") in
agriculture. Outside Europe, however, GMO technology has been one of the
most rapidly adopted agricultural technologies in history. Efforts to
regulate the proliferation of nuclear weapon technology have been
somewhat successful, but it appears unrealistic to assume that the
technology can be uninvented. Especially given today's globalized
culture, and the strategic and military advantages that emerging
technologies can provide, it is highly unlikely that meaningful
constraints on technological evolution, whether derived from cultural,
competitive, or religious foundations, will be successful. That is
particularly true as all players in the global Great Game understand
that leadership in science and technology domains is a necessary, if not
sufficient, prerequisite for dominance. Moreover, given the complexity
of many emerging technology systems, especially as they co-evolve with
other natural, built, and human systems, it is unfortunately also likely
that projecting their effects and evolutionary paths before they are
actually adopted and become embedded in their social and cultural
context is not just hard, but for all practical purposes impossible. One
can, and should, generate scenarios. But exhortations that purport to
elevate hypotheticals to predictions and implications of certainty about
future states are misplaced. In short, there is no certainty, and the
genie is well and truly out of the bottle. However, that doesn't
necessarily imply that we can't modulate future technological evolution,
but that the way we think about it today may be too simple, and our
institutions too slow and maladaptive, to be up to the task. Beyond
simplistic dystopianism This analysis suggests that, as dystopians might
argue, emerging technologies are indeed potent, and that, especially as
the human is becoming an active design space, if AI doesn't destroy
humanity, something will. But this is a grossly incomplete perspective.
[Humanity, as it appears at any particular time, is always doomed.
Foragers and hunter-gatherers were doomed, as were the serfs of medieval
Europe with their small plots and lives lived within a radius of a few
miles of where they were born. And so, in our turn, are we]{.underline}.
Doom is, in other words, evolution, and it is unlikely that we will stop
it---or, really, that we should want to. In fact, the images that we
cling to, personally and institutionally and culturally, are already
obsolete. The ethics and values that we insist we will impose on the
future are not only historically and culturally contingent, but already
obsolete as well. We want the physical and cultural landscape we live in
now to propagate into tomorrow, because we all unconsciously privilege
the present, but that is not how complex systems work. They evolve, and
indeed our world is evolving at a remarkable and accelerating clip. [The
fallacy of the dystopians, then, is not in their analysis of the power
of technology, or the accelerating and destabilizing rates of change.
The fallacy is in equating evolution with dystopia, and, without
admitting it, privileging the present over the promise and inevitability
of the future]{.underline}. What is at risk is the limited mental model
of "human" that all of us carry with us, not "humans" as an ongoing
process. This is actually a common category mistake in modern discourse:
Sustainability advocates and environmental activists often claim that
"the planet is at risk," but of course it is not. The planet is a large
mass of rock and a film of various carbon compounds, and that is not at
risk at all. What is at risk is a particular mental model of what the
world should look like, a constructed snapshot. That does not mean that
there aren't many environmental issues that require attention; of course
there are. But, as in the case of the emerging technology discourse, it
does mean that existential catastrophe language is not only invalid, but
can actually prevent seeking constructive adaptations to accelerating
change. Our only recourse is neither technological fatalism nor ethical
relativism. It is true that we have not yet appreciated, much less begun
to respond to, the challenge of a future that will indeed be more
complex and difficult than anything we have experienced as a species.
Nonetheless, we can already identify several important principles. For
example, we need to stop thinking of "problems" with "solutions," and
think more in terms of "conditions" that will require long-term,
adaptive management. Challenges such as ISIS and climate change will not
be solved, but they can and must be managed in light of other relevant
goals. In this, [[the experience with nuclear weapons is
instructive]{.mark}: They are not a problem that can be unmade, but they
are a condition that can be, and has so far been, relatively
successfully managed]{.underline}. We also need to focus on creating
option spaces---portfolios of social, institutional, and technological
choices that can be adaptively and flexibly deployed in complex
environments. Similarly, we need to play with scenarios: If dystopian
pronouncements are instead taken as scenarios---"What would you do
if...?"---they are far more useful and informative than suggestions of
doom. Socially and institutionally, we need to become more agile and
adaptive. This is uncomfortable for many, because it implies a degree of
contingency and uncertainty, but that is precisely why such skills are
necessary. The rate of technological change is unforgiving and has
already decoupled to a large extent from traditional governance
mechanisms. So we need to develop new ones. Individually, we need to
become far more humble about our ability to visualize and prognosticate
on a complex and dynamic future. [[Cautionary scenarios and
hypotheticals]{.mark} are welcome exercises in practicing to adjust to
the unknowable that lies in front of us, but [they are not appropriate
foundations for policy or legal action in the present]{.mark}.
Nightmares are seldom reality, and when bad things do happen they are
seldom the ones we thought about]{.underline}. Fear and anger in the
face of change are popular responses---witness the rise of far right and
far left factions, and fundamentalisms of all stripes, around the
world---but they are maladaptive, and those in responsible positions at
least cannot afford such luxuries.

http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2013/04/01/phosphorus-essential-to-life-are-we-running-out/)

In fact, [[phosphorus is]{.mark} a **[renewable]{.mark}** resource and
[there is **plenty**]{.mark} **of it [left]{.mark}** on
earth]{.underline}. [[Animals]{.mark} and humans [excrete]{.mark} almost
[100 percent of the phosphorus they consume]{.mark} in
food.]{.underline} In the past, as part of a natural cycle, the
phosphorus in manure and waste was returned to the soil to aid in crop
production. Today phosphorus is an essential component of commercial
fertilizer. Because industrial agriculture moves food around the world
for processing and consumption, disrupting the natural cycle that
returned phosphorus to the soil via the decomposition of plants, in many
areas fertilizer must now be continually applied to enrich the soil's
nutrients.

Most of the phosphorus used in fertilizer comes from phosphate rock, a
finite resource formed over millions of years in the earth's crust.
Ninety percent of the world's mined phosphate rock is used in
agriculture and food production, mostly as fertilizer, less as animal
feed and food additives. When experts debate peak phosphorus, what they
are usually debating is how long the phosphate rock reserves, i.e. the
resources that can economically be extracted, will hold out.

Pedro [Sanchez, [director of the]{.mark} [Ag]{.mark}riculture [and Food
Security Center]{.mark} at the Earth Institute, [does not believe there
is a shortage]{.mark} of phosphorus]{.underline}. "In my long 50-year
career, " he said. ["Once every decade, [people say we are going to run
out]{.mark} of phosphorus. **[Each time this is disproven]{.mark}**. All
the most reliable estimates show that [we have enough]{.mark} phosphate
rock resources [to last]{.mark} between 300 and **[400 more
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

In 2010, [the International Fertilizer Development Center determined
that phosphate rock reserves would last for several
centuries]{.underline}. [In 2011, the U.S. Geological Survey revised its
estimates of phosphate rock reserves from]{.underline} the previous
[17]{.underline}.63 billion tons [to 71.65 billion tons]{.underline} in
accordance with IFDC's estimates. And, according to Sanchez, [[**new
research** shows that the amount]{.mark} of phosphorus [coming to the
surface by **tectonic uplift** is]{.mark} in [the same]{.mark} range [as
the amounts]{.mark} of phosphate rock [we are extracting
now]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another hypothesized planetary boundary entails the conversion of
natural habitats to agricultural land. The mechanism by which too much
agricultural land could cause a crisis is unclear---unless it is because
land conversion causes so much biodiversity loss that species
extinctions are the proximate cause of an ecocatastrophe. [[**Excessive
chemical pollution** and]{.underline}]{.mark} excessive [**[atmospheric
aerosol loading]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} each [been suggested as]{.mark}
planetary [boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline} as well. In the case of these
pollution boundaries, [there are **well-documented mechanisms** by which
surpassing some concentration of a pollutant inflicts severe human
health hazards. There is **abundant evidence** linking chemical and
aerosol pollution to higher mortality and lower reproductive success in
humans]{.underline}, which in turn could cause a major die-off. It is
perhaps appropriate then that when Hollywood envisions an unlivable
world, it often invokes a story of humans poisoning themselves. [That
said, [it is **doubtful**]{.mark} that [we will **poison ourselves

circular**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Mathews & Tan, 2016),
[[environmental damage due to waste products is **likely to
decline**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The key point is that [the pollutants
associated with the planetary boundaries are **so widely recognized**,

[[These are **not isolated**]{.mark} **examples**]{.underline} of the
intensity of modern agriculture. The [**total [crop tonnage]{.mark}** in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[[tripled]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the 1970s, [but the cropland
area **shrunk**]{.underline} from about 472 million to 390 million
hectares by the 2010s, [[saving an area **three times larger**]{.mark}
than the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' **[total urban
area]{.underline}**. [Productivity gains in animal agriculture
**dramatically reduced** the environmental footprint of livestock
production]{.underline} in the US. [Similar reductions in farmland
accompanied by large increases in output are seen in]{.underline}
countries of **[Europe]{.underline}**, **[Latin America]{.underline}**,
[and **East Asia**]{.underline}. The global footprint of agriculture has
"started decreasing in size during the past two decades."

[US [ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline}, having a positive trade balance,
[[consumes **25 percent less**]{.mark} fertilizer]{.underline} than it
did in 1999, [and the volume of water used]{.underline} for irrigation
[has decreased by **22 percent**]{.underline} since then.
[Raising]{.underline} the [average world farm productivity]{.underline}
to the levels seen among US farmers [would allow enough [food]{.mark} to
be grown to [feed **10 billion people**]{.mark}]{.underline} an
American-type diet [[on **half** the land]{.mark} currently
used]{.underline} for farming. [The land released would exceed the area
of **Amazonia**]{.underline} (7 million square kilometers).

[Most developed countries are now in]{.underline} the stage of
"**[forest transition]{.underline}**," when a country gains forest area.
[[**Europe** is greener]{.mark} now than it was 100 years
ago]{.underline}; [the size of **US** forest resources]{.underline}
remained constant over the 20th century and [**increased** over the last
decade]{.underline}. [[**China** is adding]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
**[2 million hectares]{.underline}** (about 1 percent) [of [forests a
year]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [rates of **global forest loss** have
been **slowing**]{.underline} since 1980.

At the same time, [forestry has become **more productive**]{.underline}.
Shifting wood harvest from the north to the southeast, where the forests
are twice as productive, decreased the United States' logged area by 3.1
million hectares. [Forest plantations are much more productive than
unmanaged forests]{.underline}: Brazilian eucalyptus plantations provide
at least 10 times more timber per hectare per year than northern forests
do. [The [consumption]{.mark} of wood [is]{.mark} also
**[declining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ships and railroads are no longer
built of wood. Globally, the use of wood for fuel and construction
dropped sharply since the 1960s; the global demand for paper has been
stagnant, decreasing across the developed countries over the last two
decades. [The footprint of the developed world on the
planet]{.underline}, as an area occupied by human activities, [is
**shrinking**]{.underline}.

[[There has also been a **marked decline**]{.mark} in US consumption
of]{.underline} the most economically important
**[minerals]{.underline}**. According to the US Geological Survey
(USGS), since the end of the 20th century, US consumption of metals has
fallen by 15 percent for steel, 30 percent for aluminum, and 40 percent
for copper. [The decline reflects **increased efficiency**]{.underline}.
Aluminum soda cans are six times lighter than they were in the early
1960s, and cars weigh 30 percent less than they did. The introduction of
high-strength steel framing, reinforced concrete, and stronger and
lighter glass have reduced consumption of cement, stone, sand, and
gravel in construction. US energy use has plateaued for more than a
decade. [Similar trends are observed in the **UK**]{.underline}, which
began to reduce its consumption of physical resources between 2001 and
2003. Even individual caloric intake is falling in the UK, mainly
because of the decline in most environmentally damaging meat
consumption.

[Off-shoring **could** affect]{.underline} the local consumption of
national [resources]{.underline}. [Country statistics]{.underline},
which rely on a territorial perspective of material use, [**might** fail
to account for]{.underline} the [global patterns]{.underline} of
material consumption. What looks like "green growth" might be just an
artifact of globalization. For example, some intermediate metal
consumption might be hidden in imported finished merchandise like cars
or trucks. While these are valid concerns, [the reduction of materials
used]{.underline} in agriculture, forestry, and construction
[appears]{.underline} to be [**largely isolated** from such measurement
issues]{.underline}. [[**Actual** consumption]{.mark} of these materials
in developed countries is **dropping**]{.underline}; [whether the
material is imported or not [is **irrelevant**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The concept of dematerialization refers to an absolute or relative
reduction in the quantity of materials required to serve economic
functions in society. Unlike the traditional \`end-of-pipe' measures,
**[[dematerialization]{.underline}]{.mark}** is an input-oriented
strategy intended to [[reduce]{.mark} environmental [damage at the
**source**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The production and consumption of
products]{.underline}, the so-called "industrial" and "social
metabolisms," [could harm the environment]{.underline}. [Reducing the
volume of material and energy used to produce goods and services
**diminishes** the environmental impact]{.underline}. But in contrast
with the degrowth movement, which is based on the premise that
environmental damage rises with population and economic growth, the
proponents of dematerialization argue that [[societal
metabolism]{.underline}]{.mark} might [[exhibit an **inverted U-shaped
relationship** with economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. A country's
[environmental impact rises as]{.underline} its national [income grows
but then **declines** after]{.underline} a (very) **[high]{.underline}**
level of [**GDP** is reached]{.underline}. Similar argument is made by
the recent literature on growth and pollution conversions.

If we believe these trends, the reduction (both relative and absolute)
of material consumption observed in developed countries might have
important policy implications. [[Growth in]{.mark} developed [countries
**might not**]{.mark} **necessarily [cause environmental
distress]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **natural [resource
depletion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Advanced [economies]{.mark} may be
able to **[decouple]{.mark}** economic [growth]{.mark} and growing

countries [**greener** and **less**]{.mark}
**material-[intensive]{.mark}**]{.underline} compared to the growth the
now rich countries experienced at comparable income levels decades ago.

Several factors drive dematerialization. [Technological [progress

### AT: Financialization\-\--1AR

#### No market complexity or financialization. 

Hung **Tran 19**, nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council
and a former executive managing director of the Institute of
International Finance, with; Jaime Caruana, former general manager at
Bank for International Settlements, is a member of the board of
directors at BBVA, 4/9/19, "Diversity builds financial resilience,"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/diversity-builds-financial-resilience/

[The **[diversity of financial institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[with their differences in business models]{.underline}, [liability
structures]{.underline}, [time horizons]{.underline}, [and investment
motivations could]{.underline} **[[contribute]{.mark} [greatly to
financial resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Since]{.mark} the
20[08]{.mark} crisis, financial [institutional diversity]{.mark} has
[helped sustain **market liquidity**]{.mark} while banks have curtailed
their market-making activity \[a readiness to buy and sell securities to
accommodate their clients\] [due to regulatory changes]{.mark} and
business strategies]{.underline}. Improving [[resiliency and
liquidity]{.underline}]{.mark} in financial markets is critical to
[better finance the real economy, [allocate risks]{.mark} properly, [and
support]{.mark} **financial [stability]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Many financial institutions and practices, together with regulatory and
accounting requirements, however, tend to exacerbate cyclical
fluctuations in the economy by buying assets or extending credit in good
times and cutting back in bad times. It is important, therefore, to
promote financial diversity and foster counter-cyclical behaviors among
institutions capable of doing so. This helps reduce the risk of market
imbalances leading to liquidity crises and offset self-reinforcing
dynamics in times of financial stress. This risk has become important to
guard against as the International Monetary Fund's just-released World
Economic Outlook finds the global economy entering a synchronized
slowing phase.

The idea is to exploit the natural differences in the balance sheet
structures of financial institutions like banks and investment funds on
the one hand, and insurance companies and pension funds on the other,
and develop regulatory and accounting regimes that encourage diversity
of behaviors.

[[Banks]{.mark} and investment funds have a positive duration gap in
their balance sheets]{.underline}---meaning the average duration of
their assets tends to be longer than that of their liabilities.
Consequently, banks and investment funds [[tend to act in a
**pro-cyclical manner**]{.underline}]{.mark}. When asset quality
deteriorates, prices fall, and interest rates rise, the value of banks'
assets declines by more than that of their liabilities. Regulatory
capital and liquidity requirements increase under those circumstances,
pressuring banks to liquidate falling assets.

Investment funds can sell into falling markets to meet redemption
demand, according to research by the Bank for International Settlements.
Funds can also buy and sell at the same time if they use similar
investment strategies, sharing economic and market views.

The pro-cyclical practices described above can be ameliorated to some
extent by regulations requiring higher capital and liquidity ratios for
banks as well as heightened liquidity risk management. Better
capitalized banks with sufficient liquidity can arguably contribute
less, but more reliable, market liquidity---compared with the very
liquid pre-crisis market conditions driven by high leverage, which
turned out to be illusionary. Funds can also maintain adequate cash
positions to meet possible redemption demand. In any event,
pro-cyclicality remains a natural tendency for those institutions and
needs to be managed.

**[By contrast]{.underline}**, [[insurance companies]{.mark} and pension
funds have a negative duration gap in their balance sheets]{.underline}
and, under some circumstances, **[[could play a stabilizing
role]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in mitigating selling
pressure]{.underline}. As their average asset duration is much shorter
than that of their liabilities, when rates rise, the value of their
assets fall by less than that of their liabilities. This strengthens
their solvency, allowing them to acquire assets having fallen in prices.
[[They]{.underline}]{.mark} thus can **[[act in a counter-cyclical
manner]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, some research indicates that
this counter-cyclical behavior may need to be further supported. The
International Monetary Fund's Global Financial Stability Report observed
that life insurance companies---but not property and casualty
insurers---and pension funds act counter-cyclically in liquidity crises,
but pro-cyclically in solvency crises.

More recent empirical research, using recently available granular data
on security-by-security holdings by EU institutional investors, shows
that their behavior is more nuanced. Overall, insurers and pension funds
behaved in a counter-cyclical manner, but the intensity of such effect
has weakened since the pre-crisis period. Other preliminary research
notes that the counter-cyclical behavior of insurers and pension funds
can be observed for safe assets whose value can be discounted by the
same risk-free rate used for liabilities. However, these institutions
tend to pro-cyclically reduce holding of risk assets, including equities
and corporate bonds, as their values tend to fall by more than
liabilities in a market correction.

Regulators should encourage insurers and pension funds to make more use
of the counter-cyclical measures provided in the EU insurance regulatory
regime Solvency II---as highlighted by the European Insurance and
Occupational Pension Authority. [While interventions by government
authorities are necessary to stabilize severe financial turmoil, more
[counter-cyclical behaviors by insurers]{.mark} and pension funds, many
of [which]{.mark} likely **[stay resilient in]{.mark} a
[crisis]{.mark}**, can [help reduce]{.mark} the [**frequency** and
**severity**]{.mark} of financial crises]{.underline}. Remember: during
the Great Depression in the United States and its aftermath, some 7,000
banks failed but most of the insurers remained financially healthy.

change?," Phys.org, 1-21-2021,

On Wednesday this week, [the **[concentration]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[carbon dioxide]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
atmosphere [was]{.underline} [[measured]{.mark} [at **415**]{.mark}
**parts per million ([ppm]{.mark}**]{.underline}). [The level is [the
**highest in human history**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and is growing each
year.

[Amid all the focus on **emissions reduction**]{.underline},
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(**[[IPCC]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[says \[emissions reductions\] will
not be enough to **avoid**]{.mark} **dangerous [levels]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} global]{.underline} [[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[world must actively]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[remove]{.mark} historical
[CO2]{.mark}]{.underline}** already [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
atmosphere---[a process]{.underline} often [described as \"**[negative
emissions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

[CO2 removal can be done in two ways]{.underline}. [The first is by
**enhancing carbon storage**]{.underline} [in natural
ecosystems]{.underline}, [such as planting more forests]{.underline} or
storing more carbon [in soil.]{.underline} [The second is by
[using]{.mark}]{.underline} direct air capture ([**[DAC)
technology]{.mark}** [that strips CO2]{.mark}]{.underline} [from the
ambient]{.underline} [air,]{.underline} [[then]{.mark} either
[stores]{.mark}]{.underline} [[it **underground**]{.underline}]{.mark}
or turns it into products.

[[US research]{.mark} published last week]{.underline}
[[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} **[global [warming]{.mark} [could be
slowed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} an emergency
[deployment of]{.underline} a fleet of \"**[CO2
scrubbers]{.underline}**\" [using [DAC technology]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark} [a wartime level of funding]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} government and [**[business]{.underline}** [would be
**needed**]{.underline}]{.mark}. So is direct air capture worth the time
and money?

What\'s DAC all about?

**[D]{.underline}**irect **[a]{.underline}**ir **[c]{.underline}**apture
[refers to any **mechanical system capturing CO2**]{.underline} [from
the atmosphere]{.underline}. Plants operating today use a liquid solvent
or solid sorbent to separate CO2 from other gases.

Swiss company Climeworks operates 15 direct air capture machines across
Europe, comprising the world\'s first commercial DAC system. The
operation is powered by renewable geothermal energy or energy produced
by burning waste.

[The machines use a fan to draw air into a \"collector]{.underline},\"
[inside which a selective filter captures CO2]{.underline}. [Once the
filter is full]{.underline}, the collector is closed and the [CO2 is
sequestered]{.underline} [underground]{.underline}.

[D]{.underline}irect [a]{.underline}ir [c]{.underline}apture of CO2
[will be needed to address climate change]{.underline}.

Canadian company Carbon Engineering uses giant fans to pull air into a
tower-like structure. The air passes over a potassium hydroxide solution
which chemically binds to the CO2 molecules, and removes them from the
air. The CO2 is then concentrated, purified and compressed.

[Captured CO2 can be injected into the ground to extract
oil]{.underline}, [in some cases helping to counteract the
emissions]{.underline} [produced by burning the oil]{.underline}.

The proponents of the Climeworks and Carbon Engineering technology say
their projects are set for large-scale investment and deployment in
coming years. Globally, the potential market value of DAC technology
could reach US\$100bn by 2030, on some estimates.

Big challenges ahead

[Direct air capture faces many hurdles]{.underline} and challenges
[before it can make a real dent]{.underline} in climate change.

[**[DAC technology]{.mark}** [is currently
**expensive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [relative to many
alternative]{.underline} [ways of capturing CO2]{.underline}, [[but is
expected]{.mark} [to become cheaper]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as
the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[technology]{.mark} [scales
up]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The economic
[feasibility]{.mark}]{.underline} [[will be helped by]{.mark} the
recent]{.underline} [**emergence of [new carbon markets]{.mark}**
[where]{.mark} negative [emissions can be
**traded**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

DAC machines process an enormous volume of air, and as such are very
energy-intensive. In fact, research has suggested direct air capture
machines could use a quarter of global energy in 2100. However new DAC
methods being developed could cut the technology\'s energy use.

While the challenges to direct air capture are great, the technology
uses less land and water than other negative emissions technologies such
as planting forests or storing CO2 in soils or oceans.

[DAC technology is also increasingly **gaining the backing of big
business**]{.underline}. [Microsoft]{.underline}, for example, [last
year included the technology]{.underline} [in its carbon negative
plan]{.underline}.

Opportunities for Australia

Australia is uniquely positioned to be a world leader in direct air
capture. It boasts large areas of land not suitable for growing crops.
It has ample sunlight, meaning there is great potential to host DAC
facilities powered by solar energy. Australia also has some of the
world\'s best sites in which to \"sequester\" or store carbon in
underground reservoirs.

Direct air capture is a relatively new concept in Australia. Australian
company Southern Green Gas, as well as the CSIRO, are developing
solar-powered DAC technologies. The SGG project, with which I am
involved, involves modular units potentially deployed in large numbers,
including close to sites where captured CO2 can be used in oil recovery
or permanently stored.

[If [DAC technology]{.mark} can **overcome** its hurdles]{.underline},
[the benefits will extend beyond tackling climate change]{.underline}.
[It [would create a **new**]{.mark} **manufacturing
[sector]{.mark}**]{.underline} and potentially re-employ workers
displaced by the decline of fossil fuels.

Looking ahead

[The urgency of removing CO2]{.underline} [from the atmosphere seems
like an enormous]{.underline} [challenge]{.underline}. [But [not
acting]{.mark} [will bring]{.mark} far greater challenges]{.underline}:
**[more [climate]{.mark}]{.underline}** and weather

**extinction**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} [threats to
health]{.underline}, [**food**, **water** and **economic

[DAC technology]{.underline} [undoubtedly faces stiff
headwinds]{.underline}. [But with [the right **policy**]{.mark}
**[incentives]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and **market

COVID-19 economic pause: Can we equate with degrowth?

Many [scholars are **[comparing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the
**current**]{.mark} **state** of the [economy with]{.mark} the state of
**[degrowth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, I argue [this comparison
[is]{.mark} not only]{.underline} **[conceptually
[incorrect]{.mark}]{.underline}** [but also]{.underline}
**[simplistic]{.underline}**. At first, we need to acknowledge that
[[the pandemic is]{.mark} an]{.underline} [**[external]{.mark}**,
independent factor that is inducing such a drastic downshift in the
economy. [There is **no change**]{.mark}]{.underline} [happening [at the
**systemic level**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to ensure]{.mark} the
**sustainability**]{.underline} [of such [a shift]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Such [a pandemic is denoted as an upshot of climate crisis and
disruption in the ecological balance. In the coming future,
with]{.underline} [**[resorting to business as usual]{.mark}**, such
external events are likely to be frequent and intense.
However]{.underline}, once we manage to find our way around such an
external factor, even if temporarily, [[the economy is **waiting to
bounce back**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to its normal.
Moreover]{.underline}, as observed in the post-world war II economic
boom, [the economy is [likely to reach]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[higher
throughput]{.underline}]{.mark}** [than the initial after the
lockdown]{.underline}.

[To sustain the drastic downshift of the economy that resembles
degrowth, consumers have a major role to play]{.underline} in the
realisation of such a massive economic shift [as [the]{.mark} current
capitalist [economy is]{.mark} entirely [fueled by **consumer
desires**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In our lives, [we consciously or at
times unconsciously uphold a]{.underline} **[notion of a good
life]{.underline}**. [This amicable notion guides us continuously in
making decisions]{.underline}, be it life-changing ones or concerning
everyday affairs.

My research, as well as several anthropological studies, show how the
**[prevailing [notions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of the good life
have]{.mark} slowly [turned]{.mark} into being
**[materialistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It means now [we use]{.mark}
**material [goods]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**earn status**, [**construct identities**, and]{.mark} **mark
[success]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and value them over intangible things
like relationships.]{.underline}

[Our [life stories are]{.mark} now [stitched around]{.mark} material
[possessions]{.mark}]{.underline} that we carefully choose. These
notions are socio-culturally constructed. One's social upbringing and
conditioning enable the seeping of certain notions of good life over
others. [[These]{.mark} socio-culturally **construed [notions]{.mark}**
are influenced by the economic climate to [give rise to **insatiable
desires**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[false
needs]{.underline}** [among consumers]{.underline}.

Upshots of COVID-19- a welcome push towards practising degrowth

[To achieve a **sustained state** of **degrowth**]{.underline}, we as
[consumers need to realize the intricate interconnection between our
constructed notions of a good life and our consumption
decision]{.underline}. A realisation of how we as consumers are turned
into this driving force, that is running the entire economic juggernaut
by discounting ecological balance and a consequent conscious decision to
move away from it, would be the first step to degrowth.

[As the second step, we need to ensure that the wealth produced in
degrowth or controlled growth of the economy should **entirely be
diverted**]{.underline} [to ensuring a good life for]{.underline} the
socio-economically **[underprivileged]{.underline}** ones, [which
requires a certain amount of **sacrifice from the
privileged**]{.underline} sections of the society. However, this would
not appear as a sacrifice if we can adopt alternative notions of a good
life that value the current state of the environment and social justice
over a world obsessed with material possessions and growth.

[A **[sustained change]{.mark}** in the economic system [can **only
come**]{.mark} if the **main internal driving force** of the
system]{.underline} -- [[consumers]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[[start]{.mark}s [valuing]{.mark} things that the current system cannot
simply offer.]{.underline} It is going to be [[a]{.underline}
**[slow]{.underline}**]{.mark} [socio-cultural
[shift]{.mark}]{.underline}, but that seems to be the only way to
realise a sustained change.

**[[constant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The risks of a]{.underline}

to name only one example, [[are a]{.mark} direct [consequence of]{.mark}

[There are different approaches to existential risk mitigation. One
approach is to develop]{.underline} **[targeted

we can and should develop specific strategies for that risk.

#### Disease doesn't cause extinction.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been
around for **[200,000 years]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Homo genus
for around six million years [[without]{.mark} being
[exterminated]{.mark} by an infectious disease, which is
evidence]{.underline} that **[[the]{.mark} base [rate]{.mark} of
extinction-risk natural pathogens [is low]{.mark}]{.underline}**.82
Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks have not **come
close**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to rendering humans extinct]{.underline}.
Although bodies were piled high in the streets across Europe during the
Black Death,83 human extinction was never a serious possibility, and
some [economists even argue]{.underline} that it was [a boon for
the]{.underline} European [economy]{.underline}.84 Secondly, [infectious
disease]{.underline} has [only contributed to the extinction of a
**small minority of animal species**]{.underline}.85 [The only confirmed
case of a mammalian species extinction]{.underline} being caused by an
infectious disease [is **a type of rat** native **only to Christmas
Island**]{.underline}. Having said that, the context may be importantly
different for modern day humans, so it is unclear whether the risk is
increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to globalisation, the
world is more interconnected making it easier for pathogens to spread.
On the other hand, [[interconnectedness could]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[**[increase immunity]{.mark}** by [**increasing exposure** to **lower
virulence strains**]{.mark} **between subpopulations**]{.underline}.87
Moreover, [[advancements in **medicine** and **sanitation** limit
the]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[damage]{.underline}]{.mark} an
outbreak might do.

4\. **[[Interstellar warfare: fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark}** and real
fantasy [Even if we accept]{.underline} -- in spirit, if not in words --
[Clarke's Third Law]{.underline} ("any sufficiently advanced technology
is indistinguishable from magic"; Clarke, 1999), the inverse does not
hold: there are infinitely many conceivable "magical" effects which
could not be realized with any advanced technology under the known laws
of physics. As stated above, **[[it is doubtful]{.mark}, to say at
least, that [there ever will be a "galaxy destroying
weapon]{.mark}"]{.underline}**, [irrespectively of how much time and
effort is expended]{.underline}. The influence of science fictional
discourse, while in general beneficial for futures studies, becomes at
this point perhaps too strong (especially in a rather naïve, Star Wars-
or Starship Troopers-like manner). The discussion might be finished
here, since it seems unreasonable to engage in such extreme speculation;
so, a few comments in the rest of this section should be taken with
reservations. Although there have not been serious strategic studies of
the topic, **[there are many indications that the "[interstellar
warfare" is an oxymoron]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Insofar as [[there are
no]{.mark} topological shortcuts in forms of [traversable
wormholes]{.mark}]{.underline} (and even if there are some, but with
fixed points of entrance and egress), [[there is a]{.mark} large delay
and [logistic nightmare in sending any military expeditions]{.mark}
across interstellar distances]{.underline}. [Except in the case of huge
[technological imbalance]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [which
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} possible in contact between (post)human and
some extraterrestrial civilization, but **[highly unlikely if not
[impossible between]{.mark} any two ([post)human
factions]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- [the defense of planetary systems
would have overwhelming advantage]{.underline}, **[measured by orders of
magnitude in both reconnaissance, logistics, and capacity for tactical
concentration of forces]{.underline}**. Above all, [the [defenders could
easily destroy any]{.mark} non-stellar [resources in the defended
system]{.mark} if their situation becomes desperate enough, so
that]{.underline} "**[[piracy and plunder" would]{.mark} simply [not be
viable]{.mark} options in the interstellar case]{.underline}**. And, if
the desired resources consist of uplifted stellar matter, [[there would
always be billions of undefended stars]{.mark} in the
Galaxy]{.underline}. (This would be valid even if the efficiency of
colonization is 99%. In the unlikely scenario that all stars in the
Galaxy are colonized and defended, which is perhaps in itself
incompatible with the Torres's argument, since the constant destructive
warfare will likely impede or arrest the colonization efforts, the
required timescale is so long that it will perhaps make more economic
and strategic sense to go after undefended resources in other Local
Group galaxies.) In brief, **[plunder is hardly viable as a motivation
for interstellar warfare]{.underline}**. A reasonable conclusion that
[interstellar travel will always be expensive and
difficult]{.underline}, [coupled with the defensive advantages and the
total abundance of undefended cosmic resources elsewhere]{.underline},
makes this [motivation of "Machiavellian actors" largely
irrelevant]{.underline}. "Tuckerian actors" have been dealt with in the
Section 2 above. Finally, [[there remains the option of warfare
for]{.mark} the sake of spreading particular "**[bad
memes]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Zubrin, 1999). If this kind of motivation
requires the same expenditure of time and resources required for the
interstellar travel (not to mention intergalactic travel, which is an
entirely different order of magnitude problem, with additional
difficulties, like the impossibility of gathering any fuel or resources
en route), it is reasonable to conclude that **[such [instances would be
rare]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Of course, [it is impossible to eliminate
the possibility that particularly virulent political or religious
movements will emerge in the distant future, leading to an overwhelming
motivation for spreading The Word by fire and sword even in the face of
unfavorable strategic odds]{.underline}. **[This seems
improbable]{.underline}**, however, for at least two reasons. (i) [The
relevant "bad memes" will certainly be easier to spread by other means,
notably modulated radiation and inscribed matter packages, in forms of
[self-reproducing software or other virulent forms]{.mark}, which might
be violent in a generalized sense, but still]{.underline} **[[would not
entail any]{.mark} of the drastic [scenarios of
destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}** invoked by Torres. Insofar human
history is any guide, while religions are stronger in the contemporary
world than they have been for the last couple of centuries, this is
manifested by televangelists rather than crusades.7 (ii) [The
immunization against such bad memes is quite likely to improve by many
orders of magnitude, just as new computer viruses always provoke
stronger and more efficient immunization response]{.underline}. In this
sense, the conclusions of Pinker (2011) seem fully vindicated; and they
are certainly more appropriate for the interstellar case.

#### We're alone \-\-- studies prove

\-\--esp true given no alien observation and uncertainty in Drake
parameters.

**Sandberg et al 18** \[Andres Sandberg, Future of Humanity Institute
researcher, PhD in computational neuroscience from Stockholm
University.\] "Dissolving the Fermi Paradox" 6 June 2018
(<https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404>) -- MZhu

Our argument so far is related to a recent argument sketched by Max
Tegmark \[34\]. Like us, he suggests that [we should have great
uncertainty about f_l and f_i,]{.underline} [making us very uncertain
about the probability of intelligent life arising around a given
star]{.underline}. [He thus models our uncertainty over the average
distance between two independently arising intelligent civilizations as
log-uniform]{.underline}. [That is, we should be no more surprised if
this average distance were at one order of magnitude rather than
another]{.underline}. Thus, [when we gain some evidence that there is no
other civilization within our galaxy, we update this prior by greatly
lowering our credence in the average distance being less than
this]{.underline} (≈10\^21 m). [Since there are only six orders of
magnitude from the radius of our galaxy to the radius of the observable
universe]{.underline} (≈10\^27 m) and infinitely many beyond that, [he
reaches a conclusion that **[it is unlikely for two civilizations to
arise within the same observable universe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Brian
Lacki has suggested an improvement to Tegmark's model, in which the
log-uniform prior is replaced with a bounded log-log-uniform prior
\[35\].

[Our argument shares the same broad outline. But rather than starting
with a very abstract prior representing initial radical uncertainty over
more than 10\^100 orders of magnitude, we used two different methods to
provide a prior that captured the existing scientific uncertainties of
tens or hundreds of orders of magnitude]{.underline}. We have seen how
**[[this is more than enough make an empty]{.mark} observable [universe
plausible ex ante]{.mark}]{.underline}** (dissolving the Fermi paradox),
[[and **quite likely** once we account for the Fermi
observation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

5 Updating the factors

So far [we have looked at how the Fermi observation affects our credence
in N]{.underline}. [We can go further than this and examine how it
**affects our credence in each of the Drake parameters**]{.underline}.
**[[Updating on the Fermi observation reduces the expectation of
all]{.mark} the [parameters]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [However, parameters
with broad distributions (**those with the most uncertainty**) tend to
have their expectation reduced far more than parameters with tight
distributions]{.underline} (see Supplement IV).

[All the observations we consider have a strong effect on our estimates
for f_l]{.underline} , a substantially weaker effect on our estimates
for L, and almost no effect on our estimates of the more certain
astrophysical factors. As we can see in Table 2, [the observations
reduce the median for fl by between a factor of 7 and factor of
10\^37,]{.underline} while the median for L is only reduced by a factor
between 1 and 2.

[[Given]{.mark} the state of scientific [uncertainty about]{.mark} the
[Drake parameters and the Fermi observation]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[the default guess should]{.mark} hence [be that]{.mark} the
[low-probability]{.mark} term [is likely]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the
past (fl) rather than the future (fc, L).]{.underline} [The Fermi
observation thus provides]{.underline} only very weak evidence about
whether we will soon go extinct or whether interstellar communication or
travel is impossible. Instead, the observation mainly just **[increases
our credence that life is rare]{.underline}**.

[This conclusion is quite robust to changing the log-uncertainties of
the factors (it remains as long as most uncertainty is in the past
factors) or their distribution shape (using log-normals instead of
log-uniform distribution has no effect]{.underline}). The conclusion can
be changed if we reduce the uncertainty of past terms to less than just
7 orders of magnitude, or if the f_c factor turns out to be radically
uncertain.

6 Conclusion

[We have seen that a Fermi paradox arises if we combine a high and
extremely confident prior for the number of civilizations in our galaxy
with the absence of evidence for their existence]{.underline}. [The high
confidence that causes this clash typically results from applying a
Drake-like model using **point estimates** for the
parameters]{.underline}. [These estimates, however, make implicit
knowledge claims about processes]{.underline} (especially those
connected with the origin of life) [which are untenable given the
current state of scientific knowledge]{.underline}.

[[When we take account of **realistic
uncertainty**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[replacing point estimates by
probability distributions]{.mark} that reflect current scientific
understanding]{.underline}, **[[we find no reason]{.mark} to be highly
confident that [the galaxy]{.mark} (or observable universe) [contains
other civilizations]{.mark}, and thus no longer find our observations in
conflict with our prior probabilities]{.underline}**. [We found
qualitatively similar results through two different methods: using the
authors' assessments of current scientific knowledge bearing on key
parameters, and using the divergent estimates of these parameters in the
astrobiology literature as a proxy for current scientific
uncertainty]{.underline}.

[When we update this prior in light of the Fermi observation, **[we find
a substantial probability that we are alone in our galaxy, and
perhaps]{.mark} even in [our observable universe]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(**[53%--[99.6% and]{.mark} 39%--[85%
respectively]{.mark}]{.underline}**). ['Where are they?' --- probably
extremely far away, and quite possibly beyond the cosmological horizon
and forever unreachable]{.underline}.

#### No interstellar travel means no aliens

Astrophysics and Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds. Michael

(<https://doi.org/10.1017/S1473550417000222>) -- MZhu

To illustrate this another way, [[a foundational concept in]{.mark}
SETI, [the Drake Equation]{.mark}, [contains]{.mark} a final term, "L",
representing the length of time a civilization may be transmitting
signals, or [the "lifetime" of a civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Drake, 1980; Shostak, 2011). [A civilization that is
destroyed]{.underline} (whether by self-destruction or some external
cataclysm) [will probably not be actively communicating, and so the
opportunities for detecting alien civilizations are extremely sensitive
to this term]{.underline}. But [[spaceflight enables a civilization to
spread]{.mark} beyond its birthplace,]{.underline} inoculating it
against many forms of annihilation and multiplying the number of
potential transmission sites (e.g. Wright et al., 2014[**). [The success
of SETI is]{.mark} thus [strongly dependent on the prior success of
interstellar spaceflight]{.mark}** and settlement by alien
species]{.underline}. Indeed, interstellar spacecraft themselves may be
a signal detectable via SETI (Yurtsever and Wilkinson, 2015; Lingam and
Loeb, 2017).

### Nuclear War Causes Extinction\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Even a small nuclear war causes extinction and destroys the ozone

**Starr 14** \[Steven Starr, the Senior Scientist for Physicians for
Social Responsibility and Director of the Clinical Laboratory Science

Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and the Strategic Arms Reduction

[https://truthout.org/articles/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-nuclear-war](https://truthout.org/articles/there-can-be-no-winners-in-a-nuclear-war/)\]

[Nuclear war has no winner]{.underline}. Beginning in 2006, several of
[the [world's leading climatologists]{.mark}]{.underline} (at Rutgers,
UCLA, John Hopkins University, and the University of Colorado-Boulder)
[[published a series of studies]{.mark} that evaluated the long-term
environmental consequences of a nuclear war]{.underline}, [[including
baseline scenarios fought with merely 1% of]{.mark} the [explosive power
in the US]{.mark} and/or Russian [launch-ready nuclear
arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They concluded that the consequences of
**[even a "small" nuclear war]{.mark} would include [catastrophic
disruptions of global climate]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} massive
[destruction of]{.mark} Earth's protective [ozone]{.mark}
layer]{.underline}. These and more recent studies predict that global
agriculture would be so negatively affected by such a war, a global
famine would result, which would cause up to 2 billion people to starve
to death. These peer-reviewed studies -- which were analyzed by the best
scientists in the world and found to be without error -- also predict
that a war fought with less than half of US or Russian strategic
[[nuclear weapons would destroy the human race]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
other words, a US-Russian nuclear war would [create such extreme
long-term [damage to the]{.mark} global [environment]{.mark} that it
[would leave the Earth uninhabitable]{.mark} for humans and most animal
forms of life]{.underline}. A recent article in the Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists, "Self-assured destruction: The climate impacts of
nuclear war," begins by stating: "[A nuclear war]{.underline} between
Russia and the United States, even after the arsenal reductions planned
under New START, [could produce a nuclear winter. Hence, an attack by
either side could be suicidal, resulting in self-assured
destruction]{.underline}." In 2009, I wrote "Catastrophic Climatic
Consequences of Nuclear Conflicts" for the International Commission on
Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament. The article summarizes the
findings of these studies. [It explains that nuclear [firestorms would
produce millions of tons of smoke]{.mark}, which would rise above cloud
level and form a global stratospheric smoke layer [that would]{.mark}
rapidly [encircle the Earth]{.mark}. The smoke layer would remain for at
least a decade, and it would act to destroy the protective ozone
layer]{.underline} ([vastly increasing the UV-B reaching
Earth]{.underline}) [as well as block warming sunlight, thus [creating
Ice Age]{.mark} weather [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} that would last
10 years or longer. Following a US-Russian nuclear war,
[temperatures]{.underline} in the central US and Eurasia [would fall
below freezing every day]{.underline} for one to three years[; the
intense cold would completely eliminate growing seasons]{.underline} for
a decade or longer. [[No crops could be grown]{.mark}, leading to a
famine that would kill most humans and large animal populations.
**[E]{.mark}**lectro**[m]{.mark}**agnetic **[p]{.mark}**ulse from
high-altitude nuclear detonations [would destroy]{.mark} the integrated
[circuits in all modern electronic devices]{.mark}, [including]{.mark}
those in commercial [nuclear power plants]{.mark}. [Every]{.mark}
nuclear [reactor would]{.mark} almost **[instantly meltdown]{.mark}**;
every nuclear spent fuel pool]{.underline} (which contain many times
more radioactivity than found in the reactors) [would boil off,
releasing vast amounts of long-lived radioactivity. [The]{.mark}
[fallout]{.mark}]{.underline} would make most of the US and Europe
**[[uninhabitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Of course, [the survivors of
the nuclear war would be starving to death]{.underline} anyway. Once
nuclear weapons were introduced into a US-Russian conflict, there would
be little chance that a nuclear holocaust could be avoided. [Theories of
"limited nuclear war" and "nuclear de-escalation" are
unrealistic]{.underline}. In 2002 the Bush administration modified US
strategic doctrine from a retaliatory role to permit preemptive nuclear
attack; in 2010, the Obama administration made only incremental and
miniscule changes to this doctrine, leaving it essentially unchanged.
Furthermore, Counterforce doctrine -- used by both the US and Russian
military -- emphasizes the need for preemptive strikes once nuclear war
begins. Both sides would be under immense pressure to launch a
preemptive nuclear first-strike once military hostilities had commenced,
especially if nuclear weapons had already been used on the battlefield.
Both the US and Russia each have 400 to 500 launch-ready ballistic
missiles armed with a total of at least 1800 strategic nuclear warheads,
which can be launched with only a few minutes warning. Both the US and
Russian Presidents are accompanied 24/7 by military officers carrying a
"nuclear briefcase," which allows them to transmit the permission order
to launch in a matter of seconds. Yet top political leaders and
policymakers of both the US and Russia seem to be unaware that their
launch-ready nuclear weapons represent a self-destruct mechanism for the
human race. For example, in 2010, I was able to publicly question the
chief negotiators of the New START treaty, Russian Ambassador Anatoly
Antonov and (then) US Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller,
during their joint briefing at the UN (during the Non-Proliferation
Treaty Review Conference). I asked them if they were familiar with the
recent peer-reviewed studies that predicted the detonation of less than
1% of the explosive power contained in the operational and deployed US
and Russian nuclear forces would cause catastrophic changes in the
global climate, and that a nuclear war fought with their strategic
nuclear weapons would kill most people on Earth. They both answered
"no." More recently, on April 20, 2014, I asked the same question and
received the same answer from the US officials sent to brief
representatives of the NGOS at the Non-Proliferation Treaty Preparatory
Committee meeting at the UN. None of the US officials at the briefing
were aware of the studies. Those present included top officials of the
National Security Council. It is frightening that President Obama and
his administration appear unaware that the world's leading scientists
have for years predicted that a nuclear war fought with the US and/or
Russian strategic nuclear arsenal means the end of human history. Do
they not know of the existential threat these arsenals pose to the human
race . . . or do they choose to remain silent because this fact doesn't
fit into their official narratives? We hear only about terrorist threats
that could destroy a city with an atomic bomb, while the threat of human
extinction from nuclear war is never mentioned -- even when the US and
Russia are each running huge nuclear war games in preparation for a
US-Russian war. Even more frightening is the fact that the neocons
running [[US foreign policy believe]{.mark} that the US has "[nuclear
primacy]{.mark}"]{.underline} over Russia; [[that]{.mark} is, [the US
could successfully launch a nuclear sneak attack
against]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian (and
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[nuclear forces and completely destroy
them]{.underline}]{.mark}. This theory was articulated in 2006 in "The
Rise of U.S. Nuclear Primacy," which was published in Foreign Affairs by
the Council on Foreign Relations. By concluding that the Russians and
Chinese would be unable to retaliate, or if some small part of their
forces remained, would not risk a second US attack by retaliating, the
article invites nuclear war. Colonel Valery Yarynich (who was in charge
of security of the Soviet/Russian nuclear command and control systems
for 7 years) asked me to help him write a rebuttal, which was titled
"**[[Nuclear Primacy]{.mark} is a Fallacy]{.underline}**." Colonel
Yarynich, who was on the Soviet General Staff and did war planning for
the USSR, concluded that the "[Primacy]{.underline}" article [[used
faulty methodology and erroneous assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark}, thus
invalidating its conclusions. My contribution lay in my knowledge of the
recently published (in 2006) studies, which predicted [**[even a
"successful" nuclear first-strike]{.mark}**, which destroyed 100% of the
opposing side's nuclear weapons, [would cause the]{.mark} citizens of
[the side that "won"]{.mark} the nuclear war [to **perish from nuclear
famine**]{.mark}, just as would the rest of humanity]{.underline}.

titled "Confronting future catastrophic threats to humanity.", "The Risk
of Nuclear Winter", FAS, May 29 2015,
<https://fas.org/pir-pubs/risk-nuclear-winter/>

Since the early 1980s, the world has known that a [large [nuclear war
could cause **severe global environmental effects**]{.mark}, including
dramatic cooling of surface temperatures, declines in precipitation, and
increased ultraviolet radiation]{.underline}. The term [nuclear winter
was coined specifically to refer to cooling that result in winter-like
temperatures occurring year-round]{.underline}. **[Regardless of whether
such temperatures are reached, there would be severe consequences for
humanity]{.underline}**. But [how severe would those consequences
be?]{.underline} And what should the world be doing about it? To the
first question, the short answer is **[nobody knows.]{.underline}** [The
total human [impacts]{.mark} of nuclear winter [are]{.mark} both
**[uncertain and under-studied]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[In light of
the uncertainty]{.underline}**, [[a risk perspective is
warranted]{.mark} that considers the **breadth of possible impacts,
weighted by their probability**]{.underline}. More research on the
impacts would be very helpful, but [we can]{.underline} meanwhile [make
some general conclusions.]{.underline} That is enough to start answering
the second question, what we should do. In regards to what we should do,
nuclear winter has some interesting and important policy implications.
Today, nuclear winter is not a hot topic but this was not always the
case: it was international headline news in the 1980s. There were
conferences, Congressional hearings, voluminous scientific research,
television specials, and more. The story is expertly captured by
Lawrence Badash in his book A Nuclear Winter's Tale.1)Much of the 1980s
attention to nuclear winter was driven by the enthusiastic efforts of
Carl Sagan, then at the height of his popularity. But underlying it all
was the fear of nuclear war, stoked by some of the tensest moments of
the Cold War. [When the Cold War ended, so too did attention to nuclear
winter]{.underline}. That started to change in [2007]{.underline}, with
a new line of nuclear winter [research]{.underline}2) [that uses
advanced climate models developed for the study of global
warming]{.underline}. Relative to the 1980s research, the new research
found that **[the smoke from nuclear firestorms would travel higher up
in the atmosphere, causing nuclear winter to last longer]{.underline}**.
This research also found dangerous effects from smaller nuclear wars,
such as an India-Pakistan nuclear war detonating "only" 100 total
nuclear weapons. Two groups---one in the United States3) and one in
Switzerland4)---have found similar results using different climate
models, [lending further support to the validity of the
research.]{.underline} Some new research has also examined the human
impacts of nuclear winter. [Researchers simulated agricultural crop

the [scenario could cause agriculture productivity to decline by around
**10 to 40 percent** for several years after the war]{.underline}. The
studies looked at major staple crops in China and the United States, two
of the largest food producers. [Other countries and other crops would
likely face similar declines.]{.underline} Following such crop declines,
**[severe global famine could ensue]{.underline}**. One study estimated
the total extent of the famine by comparing crop declines to global
malnourishment data.6) When food becomes scarce, the poor and
malnourished are typically hit the hardest. [This study estimated two
billion people at risk of starvation]{.underline}. And this is from the
100-weapon India-Pakistan nuclear war scenario. **[[Larger nuclear wars
would have more severe impacts. This is where the]{.mark} recent
[research stops]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To the best of my knowledge
[there are [no]{.mark} recent [studies examining]{.mark} the secondary
[effects of famines, such as **disease** ]{.mark}**outbreaks
[and]{.mark} violent [conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are no
recent studies examining the human impacts of ultraviolet radiation.
That would include an increased medical burden in skin cancer and other
diseases. It would also include further loss of agriculture ecosystem
services as the ultraviolet radiation harms plants and animals. At this
time, we can only make educated guesses about what these impacts would
be, informed in part by what research was published 30 years ago. When
analyzing the risk of nuclear winter, one question is of paramount
importance: Would there be permanent harm to human civilization?
Humanity could have a very bright future ahead; to dim that future is
the worst thing nuclear winter could do. It is vastly worse than a few
billion deaths from starvation. Not that a few billion deaths is
trivial---obviously it isn't---but it is tiny compared to the loss of
future generations. Carl Sagan was one of the first people to recognize
this point in a commentary he wrote on nuclear winter for Foreign
Affairs.7) Sagan believed nuclear winter could cause human extinction,
in which case all members of future generations would be lost. He argued
that this made nuclear winter vastly more important than the direct
effects of nuclear war, which could, in his words, "kill 'only' hundreds
of millions of people." Sagan was however, right that human extinction
would cause permanent harm to human civilization. It is debatable
whether nuclear winter could cause human extinction. Alan Robock, a
leader of the recent nuclear winter research, believes it is unlikely.
He writes: "Especially in Australia and New Zealand, humans would have a
better chance to survive."8) This is hardly a cheerful statement, and it
leaves open the chance of human extinction. I think that's the best way
of looking at it. [Given all the uncertainty and the limited available
research, [it is **impossible to rule out the possibility of human
extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I don't have a good answer for how
likely it is. But the possibility should not be dismissed. Even if some
humans survive, there could still be permanent harm to human
civilization. [Small patches of [survivors would be extremely vulnerable
to **subsequent disasters**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They also could not
keep up the massively complex civilization we enjoy today. It would be a
long and uncertain rebuilding process and survivors might never get
civilization back to where it is now. More importantly, they might never
get civilization to where we now stand poised to take it in the future.
Our potentially bright future could be forever dimmed.9) Nuclear winter
is a very large and serious risk. But that on its own doesn't mean
much---just another thing to worry about. What's really important are
the implications of nuclear winter for public policy and private action.

war between India and Pakistan would pose an existential threat to both
countries. A larger nuclear war would threaten humanity itself. These
realities make bolt-from-blue strikes much less likely and in turn,
reduce the imperative for pre-emptive strikes.
