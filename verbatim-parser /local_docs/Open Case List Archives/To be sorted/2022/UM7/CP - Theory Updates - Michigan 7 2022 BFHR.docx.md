### Debating Russia Good

#### Debating about Russia as an actor creates more critical thinking and solves interpersonal violence

Research into the psychology of control has revealed that control needs
are key elements of individual psychological functioning. [This
paper]{.underline} argues that a "need for control'' framework is also
useful for understanding actions and ideologies at the national and
international levels. It [critically analyzes prevalent strategies for
**exerting control**]{.underline} in this domain [and proposes
alternative strategies which permit greater fulfillment of control
needs]{.underline}. [These [alternatives emerge from an
**examination**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} potential
[**[similarities]{.mark}** [between **satisfaction of**]{.mark}
**control [needs]{.mark}** with[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**separate** but **parallel**]{.mark} **domains**]{.underline} [of
**[international]{.mark} relations** [and **interpersonal
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Political psychology has]{.mark} the [potential to
**translate**]{.mark} [issues]{.mark} of **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline} [[into]{.mark} the [**terms** of
**human interpersonal encounte**]{.mark}**r**]{.underline}. In my view,
[[such]{.mark} a translation [**enhances** our **ability** to **think
creatively**]{.mark}]{.underline} about the current world situation.

The [[students in my]{.underline}]{.mark} freshman psychology
[[course]{.underline}]{.mark} recently surprised me by adopting this
approach for an in-class assignment. [[I]{.underline}]{.mark} had
[[asked]{.underline} [them to **role-play**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
**[negotiating]{.mark}** session [between the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} the [**Soviet Union** on]{.mark} the
issue of **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}. My assumption had been
that they would act out the roles of political leaders on both sides,
and would proceed by exchanging official positions on arms control
issues. Instead, [[they took the view]{.mark}point [of]{.mark} ordinary
Ameri-can and Soviet [citizens]{.mark} and exchanged candid
remarks]{.underline} concerning their feelings about the nuclear danger.

Their tone of earnest sincerity was in stark contrast to the kind of
elaborate posturing, deceitfulness, and strategic "positioning" that
usually characterizes this kind of endeavor at the diplomatic level.
Having translated the arms race into its smallest constituent
parts---the feelings of individual Soviet and American citizens---they
had stripped away the layers of pretense and revealed the rigidly
arbitrary nature of their country's "party line." After the role-play
had ended, the students pressed me to admit that, if the political and
military leaders on both sides were removed from the picture, much of
the current conflict between the two countries could be settled by a
consensus of common citizens from both sides.

It only occurred to me later that, regardless of the practicality of
their solution, my class had arrived at it by a highly unusual means:
[[They]{.mark} had [asserted]{.mark} that the [**problems** were
**amenable to human control** by acknowledging]{.mark} their own
[**individual human reactions** to]{.mark} the dangers of continued
**[international confrontation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I choose to focus
here not on the solution my students proposed but on the impulse behind
their proposal. The need expressed by these students to render these
issues "controllable" in some fashion is a basic one. Perhaps an
examination of this need, and the more vs. less healthy ways it can be
satisfied, holds the key to a novel approach to international relations.

The concept of a "need for control" has recently received much attention
within the field of psychology. The belief that one can exercise control
over one's outcomes is said to be critical to psychological well-being
(Glass and Singer, 1972; Langer, 1983; Seligman, 1975; Wortman and
Brehm, 1975). Research has shown that the negative consequences of a
stressful event on physical and mental health can be overcome by a sense
of control---i.e., a belief in one's ability to cope with (respond
effectively to) the event (Anderson, 1982; Langer and Rodin, 1976;
Perlmuter and Monty, 1979; Weiss, 1972). The accumulating body of
research in this area has promising applications for the restoration and
maintenance of psychological health in a wide range of human
environmental settings.

To date, feelings of control have been studied as an attribute of
individual psychological functioning. However, the recent work of Fred
Rothbaum and John Weisz and their colleagues (Rothbaum et al., 1982;
Weisz et al., 1984) suggests that a "need for control" analysis may also
be useful for understanding the functioning of individual nations within
the international arena. Rothbaum et al. distinguish between primary and
secondary forms of control. Primary control is the ability to enhance
one's rewards by doing something to influence existing realities (e.g.,
other people, circumstances). In secondary control, rewards are obtained
by accommodating to existing realities and maximizing satisfaction with
things as they are.

In other words, people attempt to gain control not only by bringing the
environment into line with their wishes (primary control) but also by
bringing themselves into line with environmental forces (secondary
control). Weisz et al. argue that cultures differ in the extent to which
they emphasize primary vs. secondary forms of control. They conclude
that the proper relation between the two forms of control involves a
dynamic interplay between them, and warn that too heavy an emphasis on
either primary or secondary control may be maladaptive for cultures as
well as individuals.

Extending the logic of Weisz et al. to the realm of international
relations, it can be assumed that [[**citizens** and **policymakers
alike** define]{.mark} the [**requirements** of **national
self-interest** in]{.mark} somewhat [the **same terms** they use to
evaluate]{.mark} their own **[individual]{.mark} sense of
[well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, there is widespread
agreement that a key element of a "healthy" American psyche is a sense
of national potency ("primary control," in our terms) in the
international arena. Ronald Reagan's Presidency has been lauded by both
supporters and detractors for its "restoration" of this sense of control
after the "humiliating" decade of the 1970s---a legacy of Vietnam, the
oil embargo, and the Iranian hostage crisis (cf. Yankelovich, 1982).
Whether or not such a felt sense of control (or lack of same) would be
sustained by an objective appraisal, it is nonetheless real if it has
real consequences for domestic political priorities and foreign policy
actions.

Given the present context of international relations, is an enhanced
sense of control by one nation purchased at the expense of diminished
control by other nations? \[The Weisz et al. analysis does not attempt
to address this key issue.\] Under what conditions can this zero-sum
notion of control be overcome? If the attainment of a sense of control
is indeed an important objective within the world community, then these
questions are critical.

[The answer may lie in exploring **alternative strategies** for
attaining **primary control**]{.underline}. For example, [the prevailing
strategy requires nations to **maximize their power** vis a vis
**potential adversaries**]{.underline}. [Yet the **sense of control**
thus attained is **always tenuous**]{.underline}, [because]{.underline}
(a) [the tech]{.underline}nological [basis for maintaining]{.underline}
such [relative power may be eclipsed by breakthroughs]{.underline} on
the other side, (b) such technology is subject to dissemination to third
parties, thus diluting the power of its former owners, and (c) power
that involves the domination of one nation by another (either directly
or through surrogates) is bound to be resisted by those subject peoples
whose own needs for control have been thwarted. Numerous examples attest
to the existence of these needs (under the guise of "nationalism" and
"self-determination" or "revolution" and "rebellion"---depending on the
orientation of the describer) as a continued source of frustration for
the great powers in their attempts to maintain the stability of client
states.

[Faced with these difficulties of asserting primary control, both [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} the [**Soviet
Union** have come to rely]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark}]{.underline} a
form of secondary control that Weisz et al. refer to as **[[interpretive
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This is [the]{.mark} attempt to
**interpret events** so as to **derive** a sense of **meaning and
purpose** from them]{.underline}. In the current great power struggle,
[[this]{.mark} assumes the form of [**rigidly ideological beliefs**
about the]{.mark} **nature** of the **["other side'']{.mark}** and the
**necessity** of **continued struggle**]{.underline}. [[It
allows]{.mark} **individual [persons]{.mark}** []{.mark}and **actions**
[to be **subsumed** under a **"grand scheme"** of]{.mark} impersonal
global forces]{.underline} (e.g., **[["good" vs.
"evil"]{.underline}]{.mark}**). The interpretive route to control works
to the extent that it provides a reassuring sense of order and
predictability. However, [[this]{.mark} [**unifying vision** is
**purchased** at]{.mark} the [**expense** of]{.mark} an [**empirically
based analysis**]{.mark} of what the **rest of the world** is doing and
**why**]{.underline}. **[[Reality]{.mark} [is
distorted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to fit the **dichotomy of
rightness**]{.underline}]{.mark} (on one's own behalf) **[[vs.
transgression]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The selective "management" of information about foreign policy successes
vs. failures is essential to this enterprise \[the U.S. invasion of
Grenada provides a recent example; see e.g., Middleton (1984) and Nelson
(1983)\]. Unfortunately, such selective information-gathering seriously
impairs foreign policy. Numerous authors have described occasions on
which great powers have become the captives of their own over-simplified
world views (e.g., Didion, 1983; Tuchman, 1984; Sick, 1985).

Extended use of this secondary control strategy requires a blurring of
the distinction between international politics and fiction. The Soviet
Union does not enjoy a monopoly in this regard. Within the last year,
the Vietnam War veteran has been resurrected as an American hero, and
American audiences have eagerly imbibed his cinematic revenge against
the North Vietnamese in "Rambo," "Missing in Action," and their
television counterparts.

A related phenomenon is the president's identification with the
on-screen personas of fellow actors Clint Eastwood and Sylvester
Stallone, whose adherence to simplified credos belie the gnawing
complexities of value choices in the real world. Such reactions are
likely not unique to Americans or to their current president. Instead,
they are symptomatic of the frustrations incurred by nations who have
failed in their attempts to exert active control over world events.

The control needs themselves are legitimate; the strategies that are
currently employed for satisfying those needs are not. Use of such
measures guarantees that the cycle will repeat itself---i.e., that
unrealistic thinking and erroneous judgment will serve as the basis for
future foreign policy actions.

The question remains: If the nations of the world cannot afford
continued reliance on such an ineffective (and unbalanced) "mix" of
control strategies, what are the alternatives? As suggested above, the
answer lies in exploring alternative conceptions of "control." Rather
than conceiving of control as a subject-object relationship, in which
the "object" is a fixed quantity (of land, resources, subject
populations) to be apportioned among contending powers, one could
instead consider it in the context of a subject-subject relationship, a
dy-namic system in which control needs are realized by the exercise of
mutual influence.

[An **analogy** between the realms of **international relations** and
**interpersonal relations** may serve to illustrate this
distinction]{.underline}. [In a **personal relationship** that is
**subject-object-based**, [each]{.mark} party [has]{.mark} a **[mutually
exclusive]{.mark} sphere** of **[self-interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}
("turf") [to be protected]{.underline}; [[the **relationship** must be
**negotiated** on]{.mark} the basis of [how much turf each]{.mark} party
[will cede]{.mark} to the other in exchange for similar
consideration]{.underline}. [A **[failure of negotiation]{.mark}** may
[lead to **unilateral attempts**]{.mark} by either/both parties to grab
some of the other's turf]{.underline}. [**"[Compromise"]{.mark}** [and
**"confrontation"**]{.mark} thus **[define]{.mark}** the parameters of
this type of relationship]{.underline}.

[**Alternatively**, a personal relationship may be
**subject-subject-based**, to the extent that the relationship is not
primarily directed toward the issue of sharing vs. hoarding]{.underline}
(of a separate domain of self-interest) [but rather toward a
redefinition of self and self-interest in terms of the
relationship]{.underline}. [Satisfaction]{.underline} in such a
relationship is not derived from the amount of turf seized from, or
conceded by, the other party. Instead it [obtains from the opportunity
to exert positive influence over the other's outcomes]{.underline}, and
in turn to be the beneficiary of the other's positive consideration and
favorable regard (cf. Kelley, 1979; Kelley and Thi-baut, 1978).

#### Ethnocentrism---scholars that isolate the US role are suspect

**McFaul 9** (Michael, Democracy Badass @ Stanford,
http://iis-db.stanford.edu/res/2278/Evaluating_International_Influences\_-\_Transitions\_-\_Concept_Paper.pdf)

A second shortcoming stems from the fact that **[the existing [analyses
on]{.mark} international [democracy promotion focuses on]{.mark} the
democracy promotion efforts]{.underline}** (the "supply side") [**of
individual countries**, **notably []{.mark}**[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. 15 In reality, [[**it is never the case
that the** U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [alone]{.mark}]{.underline} -
or any other external actor for that matter - **[[plays an independent
causal role in]{.mark} the development of [democratization]{.mark} in
another country]{.underline}**. **[The unique American
contribution]{.underline}** to democratic development in a given country
**[can only be isolated if all other external variables are
included]{.underline}** in the analysis. **[There was a time when the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates government **[was the
only major actor in]{.underline}** the world **[promoting
democracy]{.underline}**, but **[that time has passed]{.underline}**. As
noted above, [today, **the E**uropean **U**nion]{.underline}, individual
European governments **[and their democracy-promoting
foundations]{.underline}** and NGOs, the United Nations, NATO, the World
Bank, and hundreds if not thousands of transnational networks and
private foundations also **[[contribute]{.mark} to the democracy
promotion business. [Simply focusing on the American
contribution]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a case of democratization (or the
lack thereof) **[[is methodologically suspect and]{.underline}]{.mark}**
therefore [**[empirically flawed]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[There is
some analysis on the role of]{.underline}** Western **[European
governments]{.underline}** and supranational European institutions
(particularly the European Union) in promoting democracy abroad, 16
**[but American and European insights are rarely integrated, and few
studies are prepared to look at a range of international actors and
processes.]{.underline}** 17 Consequently there has been little
systematic thinking about the spectrum of forces shaping the
international "democratic environment," not to mention the interaction
of the external environment with domestic processes.

#### Develops critical thinking and checks ethnocentrism \-- net benefit alone fails

**Hulme 11** -- Ph.D. Candidate (Michael, March 23, "Education for
Global Citizenship in America",
http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/Hulme_uncg_0154D_10611.pdf)

[The richness and [diversity of sources **reinforces** the need for
their **critical evaluation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is more than
understanding that all „data‟ are more or less partial, in the senses of
being both biased and incomplete: a compounding factor is the extent to
which interpretation may be influenced, possibly unintentionally, by the
mediating influence of one‟s own (possibly ethnocentric, certainly
partial) view of the world. [Even where ethnocentrism is not a factor,
interactions with others might nevertheless be perceived as
ethnocentric, especially in the minds of those whose understanding of
the US and Americans have already been adversely
prejudiced]{.underline}, in the same way as some Americans have
internalized prejudices against others. [[This points to a **greater
need** to]{.mark} develop the willingness to [try to see the world
**through the eyes of others**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}-- and
conversely to help others to see the world through American eyes (though
without imparting any sense of superiority). [Developing
[this]{.mark}]{.underline} skill, and generally developing awareness and
understanding of others‟ perspectives, [[might]{.mark}
a]{.underline}dditionally [[**inform students**‟ **perceptions of bias**
in domestic]{.mark} media, domestic [political representations]{.mark},
and other domestic sources.]{.underline} It should also provide insights
into the extent to which media channels reinforce the prejudices of
their respective audiences, no matter how 'false' those prejudices might
be, effectively stifling critical thinking.

[An example of a particular lesson here is to compare and deconstruct
the various stories presented about a particular event or phenomenon in
another country, whether contemporary or historical.]{.underline} These
various presentations might include historical records, news media
coverage, „official‟ statements, and stories shared by individuals with
whom relationships have been established on the one hand, and the
domestic equivalents on the other.87 Comparisons of this sort may well
provide significant insights into how others (even those essentially
friendly to the US) view the US and Americans, and why they do so. [This
in turn might lead to some understanding of others‟ behavior, which
would otherwise remain opaque.]{.underline} Some of the findings set out
in Chapter IV constitute cases in point, two example being on the one
side you say we want to assist you, but on the other side you are
pointing fingers at us. So which way do you want to be, a devil or an
angel?

I think you have a lot of interest shown by the Western world to make an
establishment, to establish their force in the military alliance but
they aren\'t really responsible, ensuring responsibility in ensuring
that it is used for the right purposes.88

[The [lessons]{.mark} implicit in this form of investigation [**should
lead to a more critical evaluation of the myths of superiority and**
**salvific mission**]{.mark} which form the focus of this
Dissertation]{.underline}, and facilitate President Kennedy‟s 1962
exhortation to "move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases
to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality" (Miller
Center of Public Affairs, 2011b). This includes the extent to which
America still clings to some isolationist, nationalist ideologies
despite a proclaimed espousal of globalization, together with the
symbols that are used to reinforce those ideologies rather than simply
engendering a legitimate sense of community and unity -- flags and
Pledges being examples.89 [[They]{.mark} also [include **an ethnocentric
orientation**]{.mark} to other cultures predicated only in part on **[a
reductionist view]{.mark}** of those cultures‟ identity, potentiated by
the demonizing rhetoric of those who "lead‟ the country, [which
characterizes others base**d on their different political** ]{.mark}**or
religious [orientations]{.mark}** (or some other facet of identity) as
"evil".]{.underline} There is also the hope that this will lead to an
awareness of the dissonance bound up in beliefs about freedom and
democracy on the one hand, and US foreign policy and militarism,
including coerced regime change (both covert and overt) in other
sovereign states, in pursuit of maintaining its (meaning Americans‟)
„interests‟ abroad.

### Debating EU Good

a Europe without divisions and bringing back all Central Eastern
European (CEE) countries into the European family where they belong.
However, **[[after half a]{.mark} [century]{.mark}]{.underline}** of
isolation in the totalitarian communist system the CEE countries (CEEC)
had to undertake fundamental institutional, political, economic,
military and other reforms in order to join NATO and the EU. In order to
ease the process of accession, [both organizations set
certain]{.underline} [criteria]{.underline} [for membership]{.underline}
for the CEECs. [While [NATO's requirements]{.mark} for membership [were

#### Narrow focus good---engaging small parts of the plan spurs adaptation and innovation that solves their offense, it's net better cause it creates in depth debates instead of stale disad and case---you should reward specificity, not punish it \-\-- this is the best internal link to education

**Branson 2007** (Josh, NDT winner who became a policy analyst for major

Thinking back on my 8 years in debate[, [the]{.mark} [topic about which
I can best converse with experts]{.mark} about [is the design of
emissions trading schemes]{.mark}]{.underline}. That [was [because the
literature was deep and the prevalence of

think we get that in a ton of debates, because most PICs are either
wanky rhetoric PICs (and yes I was an extreme culprit) or something even
worse like Consultation. Thinking back on it, I don't think that the
legal topic was worded particularly poorly, I just think that our
strategic norms of judging/debating create a lot of problems in
generating the type of education a lot of us want. But one of the most
striking thing for me about last year's topic was that I learned more
from Repko's post about his day at the Supreme Court than I did from all
the debates I judged combined. In any event[, how to [create the types

### AT: Negation Theory

#### Negation theory\-\--if we win the counterplan is competitive then it's worth considering\-\--any other standard results in incomplete policy analysis\-\--competition debates are good because they force strategic thinking and an in-depth understanding of cost-benefit analysis\-\--outweighs any other value for debate

**Strait and Wallace '7** \[L. Paul, USC and Brett, George Mason U., The
Scope of Negative Fiat and the Logic of Decision Making, Policy Cures?

More to the point, [debate]{.underline} certainly [helps teach a lot of
skills, yet]{.underline} we believe that [[the way]{.underline}]{.mark}
policy [[debate]{.underline}]{.mark} participation [[encourages you to
think is the **most valuable educational benefit**,]{.mark} because [how
someone makes decisions **determines** how they will employ the rest of
their abilities]{.mark}, including]{.underline} the [research and
communication skills]{.underline} that debate builds. Plenty of debate
theory articles have explained either the value of debate, or the way in
which alternate actor strategies are detrimental to real-world
education, but none so far have attempted to tie these concepts
together. We will now explain how [[decision-making]{.mark} skill
development [is the **foremost value**]{.mark} of policy
debate]{.underline} and how this benefit is the decision-rule to
resolving all theoretical discussions about negative fiat. Why debate?
Some do it for scholarships, some do it for social purposes, and many
just believe it is fun. These are certainly all relevant considerations
when making the decision to join the debate team, but as debate
theorists they aren't the focus of our concern. Our concern is finding a
framework for debate that educates the largest quantity of students with
the highest quality of skills, while at the same time preserving
competitive equity. [The ability to make decisions]{.underline} deriving
from discussions, argumentation or debate, [is **the key skill.** It is
[the **one thing** every]{.mark} single [one]{.mark} of us [will do
every day]{.mark} of our lives]{.underline} besides breathing.
[Decision-making transcends boundaries between]{.underline} categories
of learning learning like "[policy]{.underline} education" [and "kritik
education]{.underline}," it makes irrelevant considerations of whether
we will eventually be policymakers, [and it transcends questions of what
substantive content a debate round should contain]{.underline}. The
implication for this analysis is that t[he critical thinking and
argumentative skills offered by real-world decision-making are
**comparatively greater** than any educational disadvantage weighed
against them]{.underline}. It is the skills we learn, not the content of
our arguments, that can best improve all of our lives. While [policy
comparison skills]{.underline} are going to be learned through debate in
one way or another, those skills [are **useless** if they are not
**grounded in the**]{.underline} kind of [**logic** actually used to
make decisions]{.underline}.

**Any action could make the plan more likely.**

butterfly effect When you hear the words "The Butterfly Effect", most of
you will probably think of the movie. That was about the chaos theory,
meaning one series of events leads to another and the effect of changing
the course of those events. Actually the term "The Butterfly Effect",
was a phenomenon proposed in a doctoral thesis written in 1963 by Edward
Lorenz. It states that [[a butterfly]{.mark}, by flapping its wings in
one place and time [is able to create]{.mark} a major [weather]{.mark}
event in another place and time]{.underline}, eventually having a
far-reaching ripple effect on subsequent events. The butterfly effect
suggests that [[cause and effect are applicable]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the universe [[even if the]{.mark} pattern is indecipherable and the
precise [cause]{.mark}]{.underline} of our predicaments, rooted far away
in time and space, [[are]{.mark} ultimately
[unfathomable]{.mark}.]{.underline} More than just an esoteric science,
the chaos theory works off the concept that the relation between any two
things is rarely linear in nature, that any reaction is usually the
result of an accumulation of causative factors small and large,
intentional and accidental.

**[S]{.underline}**tates]{.mark}. 15 In reality, [**[it is never the
case that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[alone]{.underline}**]{.mark} - or any other external actor for that
matter - **[[plays an independent causal role in]{.mark} the development
of [democratization]{.mark} in another country]{.underline}**. **[The
unique American contribution]{.underline}** to democratic development in
a given country **[can only be isolated if all other external variables
are included]{.underline}** in the analysis. **[There was a time when
the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates government **[was the
only major actor in]{.underline}** the world **[promoting
democracy]{.underline}**, but **[[that time has
passed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As noted above, [[today, **the E**uropean
**U**nion]{.underline}]{.mark}, individual European governments **[[and
their]{.mark} democracy-promoting [foundations]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and NGOs, the United Nations, NATO, the World Bank, and hundreds if not
thousands of transnational networks and private foundations also
**[[contribute]{.mark} to the democracy promotion business. [Simply
focusing on the American contribution]{.mark}]{.underline}** to a case
of democratization (or the lack thereof) **[[is methodologically suspect
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** therefore [**[empirically
flawed]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[There is some analysis on the role
of]{.underline}** Western **[European governments]{.underline}** and
supranational European institutions (particularly the European Union) in
promoting democracy abroad, 16 **[but [American and European insights
are rarely integrated]{.mark}, and few studies are prepared to look at a
range of international actors and processes.]{.underline}** 17
Consequently there has been little systematic thinking about the
spectrum of forces shaping the international "democratic environment,"
not to mention the interaction of the external environment with domestic
processes.

#### Develops critical thinking and checks ethnocentrism---net benefit alone fails

**Hulme 11** -- Ph.D. Candidate (Michael, March 23, "Education for
Global Citizenship in America",

[The richness and [diversity of sources reinforces the need for their
critical evaluation]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is more than
understanding that all „data‟ are more or less partial, in the senses of
being both biased and incomplete: a compounding factor is the extent to
which interpretation may be influenced, possibly unintentionally, by the
mediating influence of one‟s own (possibly ethnocentric, certainly
partial) view of the world. [Even where ethnocentrism is not a factor,
interactions with others might nevertheless be perceived as
ethnocentric, especially in the minds of those whose understanding of
the US and Americans have already been adversely
prejudiced]{.underline}, in the same way as some Americans have
internalized prejudices against others. [[This points to a greater need
to]{.mark} develop the willingness to [try to see the world **through
the eyes of others**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}-- and conversely to
help others to see the world through American eyes (though without
imparting any sense of superiority). [Developing
[this]{.mark}]{.underline} skill, and generally developing awareness and
understanding of others‟ perspectives, [[might]{.mark}
a]{.underline}dditionally [[inform students‟ perceptions of bias in
domestic]{.mark} media, domestic [political representations]{.mark}, and
other domestic sources.]{.underline} It should also provide insights
into the extent to which media channels reinforce the prejudices of
their respective audiences, no matter how 'false' those prejudices might
be, effectively stifling critical thinking.

[An example of a particular lesson here is to compare and deconstruct
the various stories presented about a particular event or phenomenon in
another country, whether contemporary or historical.]{.underline} These
various presentations might include historical records, news media
coverage, „official‟ statements, and stories shared by individuals with
whom relationships have been established on the one hand, and the
domestic equivalents on the other.87 Comparisons of this sort may well
provide significant insights into how others (even those essentially
friendly to the US) view the US and Americans, and why they do so. [This
in turn might lead to some understanding of others‟ behavior, which
would otherwise remain opaque.]{.underline} Some of the findings set out
in Chapter IV constitute cases in point, two example being on the one
side you say we want to assist you, but on the other side you are
pointing fingers at us. So which way do you want to be, a devil or an
angel?

I think you have a lot of interest shown by the Western world to make an
establishment, to establish their force in the military alliance but
they aren\'t really responsible, ensuring responsibility in ensuring
that it is used for the right purposes.88

[The [lessons]{.mark} implicit in this form of investigation [should
lead to a more **critical evaluation** of the myths of superiority and
salvific mission]{.mark} which form the focus of this
Dissertation]{.underline}, and facilitate President Kennedy‟s 1962
exhortation to "move on from the reassuring repetition of stale phrases
to a new, difficult, but essential confrontation with reality" (Miller
Center of Public Affairs, 2011b). This includes the extent to which
America still clings to some isolationist, nationalist ideologies
despite a proclaimed espousal of globalization, together with the
symbols that are used to reinforce those ideologies rather than simply
engendering a legitimate sense of community and unity -- flags and
Pledges being examples.89 [[They]{.mark} also [include an ethnocentric
orientation]{.mark} to other cultures predicated only in part on [a
reductionist view]{.mark} of those cultures‟ identity, potentiated by
the demonizing rhetoric of those who "lead‟ the country, [which
characterizes others based on their different political]{.mark} or
religious [orientations]{.mark} (or some other facet of identity) as
"evil".]{.underline} There is also the hope that this will lead to an
awareness of the dissonance bound up in beliefs about freedom and
democracy on the one hand, and US foreign policy and militarism,
including coerced regime change (both covert and overt) in other
sovereign states, in pursuit of maintaining its (meaning Americans‟)
„interests‟ abroad.

This **[[heavy conditionality]{.mark} has [now become the official
position of the United States]{.mark} in the Biden era.]{.underline}**
It is, however, a hugely challenging political condition for Erdoğan,
who has relentlessly defended the S-400 decision at home. The question,
now, is this: can Turkey and the United States find a mutually
satisfactory compromise to overcome this strategic divide?

[Intent]{.underline} is **[key to understanding how]{.underline}** aid
**[[conditionality is supposed to work]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[why it [doesn\'t]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
The short answer is that [the]{.underline} donor government---in this
case, the U[nited States]{.underline}---**[is [not actually
committed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to]{.mark} any
[reform]{.mark}]{.underline} agenda that is nominally attached to its
aid flows. In the Middle East, the U.S. goes to great lengths to
overlook routine, endemic violations of the conditions attached to aid
by U.S. law. Washington skirts or ignores outright those legal
obligations, in the Foreign Assistance Act, the Arms Export Control Act
and the so-called Leahy Laws. Even when the U.S. does withhold aid, it
doesn\'t seem to change regime behavior.

Look no further than the Obama administration\'s frustrating response to
the 2013 coup in Egypt, which the White House embarrassingly refused to
call a coup. The U.S. government temporarily withheld some weapons
transfers, which Abdel Fattah el-Sisi\'s regime claimed were a serious
impediment to its domestic counterterrorism operations. But Egypt
didn\'t make any concessions during the year and a half that it was
deprived of American weapons to which it felt entitled. Sure enough, by
the spring of 2015, U.S. military aid resumed---with no change in
Egypt\'s behavior.

The longer answer about aid [conditionality]{.underline} is that it
**[[would not compel]{.underline}]{.mark}** recipient **[[governments to
change their policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even if the U.S. pursued a
reform agenda that integrated its diplomatic, military and aid
strategies. The history of U.S. aid as a lever for reform is littered
with failures. Long-term aid recipients like Egypt, Jordan, the
Palestinian Authority and Lebanon have never once undertaken a reform
requested by Washington in exchange for copious aid.
