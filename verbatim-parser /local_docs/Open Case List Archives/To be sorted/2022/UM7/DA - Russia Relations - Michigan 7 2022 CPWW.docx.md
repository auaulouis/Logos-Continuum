## How to Use this File

#### This file presents multiple different scenarios for Russian influence being good around the globe. Each DA argues that the plan's increase in NATO cohesion/strength/unity trades off with the motivations behind \[x\] country/region relations with Russia which is bad. 

#### The best way to use this file is to [pick a region]{.underline} and [use that section of the file]{.underline} for execution of the DA. There are *[7 unique]{.underline}* relations scenarios for you to choose from. The "generic link" at the top of the file can be used with all of the scenarios.

#### Russia's relations across the globe are [driven by]{.underline} a desire to prevent NATO cohesion and strength -- the plan's implementation [saps]{.underline} motivation for sustaining influence

outlook", Germany\'s Russia problem, Published by Manchester University

The pattern of recent years indicates that **[in this situation, Moscow
is more likely to increase activities abroad to make its presence
felt]{.underline}**. **[It has playgrounds close to home]{.underline}**
-- **[in the Balkans, the Caucasus, Moldova and Ukraine as well as
further afield in Libya and Syria]{.underline}**. [Russia may also take
another step closer to China at a time when tensions in US--China
relations are increasing]{.underline}. In short, **[the scope for the
collision of interests with western countries, including Germany, looks
set to increase rather than decrease]{.underline}**. **[Such an outcome
is more likely because the Russian leadership appears undeterred by
greater confrontation]{.underline}**. [There are four reasons for this.
First, confrontation helps sustain the narrative at home that 'the West'
is working to cut Russian down to size as part of a neocontainment
policy, forcing Russia into a 'besieged fortress' posture]{.underline}.
This putative external danger to Russia allows the leadership to take
measures to protect itself against the real threat to its security --
its own people. **[Second, more confrontation increases the Kremlin's
appetite for fishing in troubled waters, whether in areas vacated by the
USA such as Syria, or in western countries themselves by interfering in
their democratic processes to increase their societal
divisions]{.underline}**. This is part of the strategy to protect the
Russian system by shaping the external environment to its benefit.
Third, **[confrontation offers opportunities to expose the weaknesses of
the EU and NATO and deepen estrangement between the USA and its European
allies]{.underline}**. **[Divisions within the EU on the issue of Russia
offer potentially rich opportunities to Russian
diplomacy]{.underline}**. Fourth, [Moscow recognises that confrontation
intimidates European governments, encouraging them to find ways of
talking more to Moscow rather than creating the means to deter its
aggressive behaviour]{.underline}. Germany's failure to invest in
maintaining adequate defence forces after the end of the Cold War says
much about its lack of a strategic mindset. It succumbed to a sense of a
new peaceful era reinforced by the enlargement of NATO, which relieved
Germans of the burden of being a frontier state as they had been for
fortyfive years as a divided nation on both sides of the Iron Curtain.
In this seemingly benign environment, there was less obvious need for US
security guarantees and Germany's armed forces needed to focus primarily
on out-of-area crisis management to the detriment of collective defence.
This had profound implications for the size, structure, equipment and
training of the Bundeswehr. In 2007, a senior British officer likened
the Bundeswehr's capabilities to those of 'an aggressive camping
organisation'.5 **[Since 2014, a defence planning process has been in
place to rebuild the armed forces' collective defence and deterrence
capabilities]{.underline}**. **[This will reach not completion until
2032, leaving a significant gap during which a key vulnerability is
visible]{.underline}**. [During the Cold War, the US military had the
ability to deploy forces to two major theatres at the same time and had
enough reserves to deal with a simultaneous minor crisis. It can now
only respond to one major crisis and one smaller emergency]{.underline}.
**[Should the US have to deal with a major crisis in the Asia-Pacific
region, European members of NATO at present would struggle alongside a
smaller US force to maintain Europe's defences if tested]{.underline}**.
The German government's strategic assessments after the invasion of
Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea in 2014 were clear about
the need to reinvest in defence but its leaders did not want to take
this message to the public because it would be unpopular. Policymakers
still use coded language to make the point. In a speech in October 2020,
Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer spoke compellingly of
Germany needing to be a 'strategic giver' rather than remaining a
'taker'. It meant becoming a 'hard, powerpolitical factor'.6 However,
there was no mention of paying for this capability. Her message instead
focused on the importance of preserving the transatlantic link
significantly weakened over the past two decades, and particularly under
the Trump presidency. **[The crisis of liberal democracy symbolised by
Trump's election in 2016 and the rise of populist forces in several
western countries have been grist to the Kremlin's mill]{.underline}**.
For this reason, **[Russia's leaders feel that history is on their
side]{.underline}**. [Putin boldly stated in 2019 that liberalism had
outlived its purpose]{.underline}.7 **[Russia's overconfidence derives
partly from the fact that it has worked out how to target western
weaknesses without provoking serious retaliation]{.underline}**.
**[Western countries have signally failed to study Russia's
vulnerabilities in the same way and apply pressure to them as part of a
strategy to defend their interests]{.underline}**. [Behind its claims
that it wishes to adapt the international system to new realities,
Moscow has a backward-looking agenda]{.underline}. It seeks refuge in
the past with its nostalgia for the Yalta and Potsdam agreements.8 When
it talks of a new security order, it has in mind an old one. [Ahead of
the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, Putin even
proposed a summit of the five permanent members of the UN Security
Council to discuss global security issues]{.underline}. This, of course,
did not include Germany, the country with the largest population in
Europe and the fourth-largest economy in the world. **[The Russian
leadership remains obsessed with the extent of US influence in
international affairs as if Russia were an equal, and despite clear
signs that Washington is returning to a new form of isolationism,
demonstrated by its reduced interest in the Middle East]{.underline}**.
**[These paranoias continue to fuel the traditional goal of weakening
the transatlantic link and returning Europe to its natural state in
which Russia can exert greater political influence over the
continent]{.underline}**. In this respect, **[Trump's disregard for
NATO, his contempt for the EU and his tendency to treat Germany as an
enemy rather than an ally made him Moscow's accomplice in weakening
transatlantic relations. His assault on Germany for its low level of
defence spending and the hostility of his administration to Nord Stream
2 were a deeply unnerving experience for German policymakers that look
set to recede to some extent under the presidency of Joe
Biden]{.underline}**. However, even if the atmosphere improves, a return
to the pre-Trump status quo in Germany's relations with the USA looks
unlikely because too much has changed in the meantime.

#### \*\*INSERT SPECIFIC RELATIONS SCENARIO\*\*

#### Russia's drive to establish global relations is only [facilitated by]{.underline} decohesion of US and NATO policy

"Introduction", Germany\'s Russia problem, Published by Manchester
University Press, 2021, accessed via Project Muse on 7.17.22

The premise of this book is that Russia in its current condition and
configuration poses a serious threat to the stability of Europe.
**[Russia's authoritarian system is weak at home and yet strong enough
to be a revanchist power, one able to fill power vacuums created by the
USA and its allies in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Central
America]{.underline}**. [Turning its back on Europe, Russia has moved
closer to China, apparently ready to accept being its junior partner in
the absence of allies to counter-balance Chinese influence]{.underline}.
**[The focus of Russia's leadership is on survival]{.underline}**. It
sees the restoration and upholding of Russia's international status as
essential to the process of securing its rule, prioritising it over the
need to equip Russia for a new economic and political age dominated by
climate change, digitalisation and other disruptive forces. The rise of
Asia, **[the disorientation of the USA and its allies as well as the
tarnishing of western values and the fractures in western societies all
offer short-term gains for a Russian leadership fearful of reform at
home but confident of its strength abroad]{.underline}**. This has
encouraged an ill-conceived policy of aggression towards Ukraine that
could easily have triggered a wider European conflict in 2014 when it
annexed Crimea and deliberately destabilised south-eastern Ukraine. In
the process, Russia has needlessly made an enemy of a people with which
it shares a strong cultural affinity, consolidating Ukraine as a
political nation that no longer sees its future in close alliance with
Russia. **[The 'return' of Crimea to Russia is meagre compensation for
forcing Ukraine on to a pro-western path of development and seriously
aggravating relations with the EU and NATO]{.underline}**. Moscow's
flat-footed reaction to revolution in Belarus in the summer of 2020
pointed again to poor decision-making and limited crisis management
capabilities. The Lukashenka regime had been living on borrowed time for
years beforehand and danger was looming. [Further misjudgements of this
kind are likely to increase rather than decrease as the Russian system
closes further in on itself in pursuit of greater resilience to outside
threats]{.underline}.

# Central Europe-Russia Relations

## 1NC -- Central Europe Relations

### 1NC -- Russian Probing Scenario

#### Central Europe-US relations are on the brink now which leaves the room for Russian influence

David **Hutt '21**, is a political journalist based between France and
the Czech Republic, reporting on European political affairs and EU-Asian
relations, "In Central Europe, Biden Can Build on Trump's Record", World
Politics Review, 2/17/21,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29428/in-central-europe-biden-can-build-on-trump-s-record

Today, **[the United States' relations with Central Europe are at an
inflection point]{.underline}**. Much of the recent media coverage in
the region has focused on how **[Washington's influence might wane
if]{.underline}** President Joe **[Biden picks a fight with the
governments of Hungary and Poland]{.underline}**, **[whose leaders had
cultivated close ties with]{.underline}** Biden's predecessor, Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}**. On the campaign trail, Biden bemoaned the
recent trajectory of democratic decline and the erosion of checks and
balances on executive power in those countries. Meanwhile, **[illiberal
leaders like]{.underline}** Hungary's Viktor **[Orban and]{.underline}**
Poland's Jaroslaw **[Kaczynski are suspicious of Biden's pledges to make
human rights and the rule of law key pillars of U.S. foreign policy,
viewing such efforts as affronts to their sovereignty]{.underline}**. As
the Atlantic Council's Petr Tuma noted in December, **[some observers in
Central and Eastern Europe also fear that after a period of "intensified
cooperation" under Trump, America could revert back to the era
of]{.underline}** President Barack **[Obama]{.underline}**, "**[when
many believed Washington (initially) sacrificed the region's interests
in the name of a reset with Moscow]{.underline}**." **[In reality,
though, Biden has given no sign of any such attempt at a reset,
signaling he will take a tough approach toward Russia]{.underline}**.
And even as Biden seeks to reorient U.S. foreign policy away from his
predecessor's approach, **[the Trump administration has actually left a
solid foundation of trust and cooperation for Biden to build upon in
Central Europe]{.underline}**. [Since 2017, all of the leaders from the
"Visegrad Four"]{.underline}---[the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia
and Poland]{.underline}---[have visited Washington, while]{.underline}
Trump's secretary of state, Mike [Pompeo, toured each of their
capitals]{.underline}. U**[.S. trade with the region is up across the
board, and Washington has signed new security pacts with Poland and
Hungary]{.underline}**. [And all except Budapest have backed
Washington's pressure campaign against the controversial Chinese
telecommunications giant Huawei]{.underline}. During his first weeks in
office, [Biden has focused more on reassuring Western European partners,
holding calls with the leaders of Germany, France and the United
Kingdom, as well the NATO secretary general]{.underline}. **[But having
served as the main interlocutor for Central and Eastern Europe as vice
president under Obama, Biden knows well the region's strategic
importance]{.underline}**. **[Its natural aversion to Russian influence
tends to suit U.S. interests. And China]{.underline}**, America's main
strategic competitor, **[has built up its investment and influence in
the region, backed by a powerful section of the Central European
political elite]{.underline}**. **[Improving relations with the region
won't require a great deal of heavy lifting from Biden's
administration]{.underline}**---a rare benefit as it faces numerous
intractable problems across the world. **[In fact, in many policy areas,
Biden can largely pick up where the Trump administration left
off]{.underline}**.

#### Renewed focus on European cohesion for NATO [undermines]{.underline} Russian influence in Central Europe -- continued attempts to [exclude]{.underline} Russia leads to violent probing to re-establish influence

Anatol **Lieven '22**, is a senior fellow at the Quincy Institute for
Responsible Statecraft, "Russia Belongs at the Center of Europe",
Foreign Policy, 2/10/22,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/10/russia-europe-ukraine-west-security-council/

**[The Western attempt to expel Russia from Europe has
failed]{.underline}**. [That there was such an attempt was always
implicit in the strategy of seeking to admit every European country but
Russia into NATO]{.underline} and the European Union. In this context,
the NATO slogan "A Europe Whole and Free" is an explicit statement that
Russia is not part of Europe.

**[But]{.underline}** as French President Emmanuel Macron has reminded
us, **[Russia is part of Europe and is simply too big, too powerful, and
too invested in its immediate neighborhood to be excluded from the
European security order]{.underline}**. **[A continued strategy along
these lines will lead to repeated Russian attempts to force its way back
in]{.underline}**. At best, this will lead to repeated and very damaging
crises; at worst, to war.

[A structure needs to be created that can defend the interests of NATO
and the EU while at the same time accommodating vital Russian interests
and preserving peace]{.underline}. The solution lies in a modernized
version of what was once called the "Concert of Europe."

**[The current security order has reached its limit]{.underline}**.
[Until 2007-2008, the expansion of the EU and NATO appeared to have
proceeded flawlessly, with the admission of all the former Soviet
satellites in Central Europe and the Balkans, as well as the Baltic
states]{.underline}. Russia was unhappy with NATO expansion but did not
actively oppose it. [Then, however, both NATO and the EU received
decisive checks, through their own overreach]{.underline}.

At the NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, in 2008, the United States and
its allies, though denied an immediate Membership Action Plan for
Ukraine and Georgia because of the opposition of France and Germany,
procured a promise of those countries' eventual membership. Seen from
Moscow, this created the prospect that NATO would include countries with
territorial disputes (and in the case of Georgia, frozen conflicts) with
Russia; that (as in the Baltic states) NATO would give cover to moves to
harm the position of local Russian minorities; and that NATO would expel
Russia from its naval base at Sevastopol and from the southern Caucasus.

Later that year, the Russo-Georgian War should have sounded the death
knell of further NATO expansion, for it demonstrated beyond doubt both
the acute dangers of territorial disputes in the former USSR and that in
the last resort Russia would fight to defend its vital interests in the
region, and the West would not fight. [**This is being demonstrated
again today by the repeated and categorical statements from Washington
and Brussels that there is no question of sending troops to defend
Ukraine; and if NATO will not fight for Ukraine, then it cannot admit
Ukraine as an ally**. **It is as simple as that**]{.underline}.

**[The rise of China is the other factor that makes the exclusion of
Russia unviable]{.underline}**. For this project was developed at a time
when Russia was at its weakest in almost 400 years and when China's
colossal growth had only just begun. [This allowed the West
possibilities that today have diminished enormously, if as seems likely
China is prepared to strengthen Russia against Western economic
sanctions]{.underline}.

The EU too has reached the limit of its expansion eastward. On the one
hand, there is Ukraine's size (44 million people), corruption, political
dysfunction, and poverty (GDP per capita that's one-third of Russia's).
Perhaps more importantly, EU expansion to eastern Europe no longer looks
like the unconditional success story that it did a decade ago.

[Romania, Bulgaria, and other states remain deeply corrupt and in many
ways still ex-communist]{.underline}. **[Poland and Hungary have
developed dominant strains of chauvinist and quasi-authoritarian
populism that place them at odds with what were supposed to be the core
values of the EU]{.underline}**---**[and that in some respects bring
them closer ideologically to the regime of]{.underline}** Russian
President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**. After this experience, there
is no chance that the EU will admit a country like Ukraine in any
foreseeable future.

**[An acknowledgment of these obvious truths]{.underline}** (which are
acknowledged in private by the overwhelming majority of Western
officials and experts) **[should open the way to thinking about a new
European security architecture that would incorporate NATO and the EU
while reducing the hostility between these organizations and
Russia]{.underline}**. [We should aim at the creation of this new system
as part of the solution to the present crisis, and in order to avoid new
ones]{.underline}.

#### Attempts by Russia to [re-gain]{.underline} influence in Central Europe result in hybrid war that undermines the entire alliance -- turns and outweighs the aff

**[Despite Russian conventional threats along the eastern borders of
NATO, Moscow has deployed a wide range of non-traditional weapons in its
grand strategy to regain some of its influence in Central and Eastern
Europe, to undermine the unity of the European Union, and to drive a
wedge between the U.S. and her NATO allies in Europe]{.underline}**.
**[In fact, a conventional, or a nuclear, military confrontation does
not seem to be likely in the foreseeable future]{.underline}**.
**[Therefore, NATO/U.S. had better prepare for such challenges posed by
Russia as hybrid warfare and cyber warfare]{.underline}**.
**[Intelligence, economic, or financial penetration into the Central and
Eastern European NATO members]{.underline}** (at times with the help of
front organisations), **[disinformation campaigns are imminent and real
threats to the national security of the countries targeted, and to the
cohesion of NATO alliance as well]{.underline}**. Hybrid warfare has
already been used by Moscow against Ukraine in Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine, and the experiences gained in these conflicts are bound to be
carefully studied by the Russian strategists as to their potential
application in future conflicts in the neighbourhood. [What is a 'clear
and present danger' for the U.S. and its allies in NATO is Russia's
cyber warfare which was used influencing the U.S. presidential elections
in 2016, possibly the French and German parliamentary elections in the
past few years, and definitely deployed against Estonia and Latvia in
the Baltics]{.underline} (The Straits Times, 2017), [as well as against
international organisations, such as, for instance, the Organisation for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons]{.underline} (Brunsden, 2018).
**[The wide range of Russian cyber warfare activity is, without
question, one of the most pressing chellenges NATO, and especially its
Central and Eastern European members are facing]{.underline}**. Given
the immense Russian capabilities in this area, it is stating the
obvious, **[that the individual members of NATO cannot successfully
defend themselves; it is their existential interest to work together
with the other members of the Atlantic Community, first and foremost
with the U.S.]{.underline}** [Moreover, cybersecurity threats to the
Europeans (and the U.S.) are not only posed by Russia]{.underline}. The
debate over the role of the Chinese Huawei in establishing the 5G mobile
network in Europe, or in some countries in Europe, relates in reality to
national security in a broader sense.

The municipal offices in the Estonian city of Narva are just a
snowball's throw from Russia. From her window Katri Raik, the mayor, can
watch cars and lorries trickling through a border checkpoint. More than
80% of Narva's residents are ethnic Russians, a legacy of the centuries
during which Narva was part first of the Russian empire and then of the
Soviet Union. [Ethnic Russians, nearly a quarter of the population, have
grown more integrated]{.underline} since Estonia became independent 30
years ago. Yet [most send their children to Russian-language schools and
rely on Russian media]{.underline}. "Yesterday someone on the city
council said 'U nikh v Estonii tak \[That's how it is over there in
Estonia\],'" says Ms Raik.

A former interior minister, Ms Raik was elected in December pledging to
bridge the gap. A new Estonian-language school will open in September.
The regional economy is now oriented towards the West. But [Russia's
military build-up on the Ukrainian border is reminding Narva of where it
sits.]{.underline} Opinion is divided along familiar lines. In several
conversations, ethnic Estonians saw Russia as the aggressor, whereas
[ethnic Russians tended to think the risk of war exaggerated or to blame
NATO]{.underline}. "We each know what the other thinks, so we simply
don't talk about it," says Ms Raik.

Across eastern Europe, the threat of war in Ukraine evokes long-standing
fears. Most countries, Estonia included, are nato members and face no
immediate risk of incursion. But Russian and Soviet expansionism has
shaped their politics for centuries. These days many eastern Europeans
are at odds with the Kremlin over energy supplies or Russian-financed
corruption. Others have friendlier relations, helped by trade,
Russian-speaking minorities or politicians who get on with Vladimir
Putin, Russia's president. But even in such places, the crisis in
Ukraine is causing problems.

The Baltic countries, which were Soviet territory until 1991, are the
strongest voices for deterrence and harsh sanctions. "Interdependence
means you can hurt the one who is dependent on you," says Kaja Kallas,
Estonia's prime minister, whose mother's family was deported to Siberia
under Stalin. Her government is trying to send weapons to Ukraine, but
Germany has been blocking the passing-on of German-made equipment. On
January 27th Latvia's defence minister called the German stance "immoral
and hypocritical".

Last summer, when Mr Putin wrote an essay claiming that Ukraine was not
a legitimate nation, it rang alarms in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,
because he had made similar arguments about them in the 2000s. Defence
planners in these countries consider Russia an existential threat.

In **[Romania and Bulgaria]{.underline}**, things are more complex. Both
are NATO members. But their [politics are plagued by
corruption]{.underline}, some of it [tied to Russia. They have
not]{.underline} always [been enthusiastic about American policies that
link anti-corruption efforts to regional security]{.underline}. Romanian
politicians have clamoured for years for NATO to upgrade its presence,
though Bulgarian ones downplay new deployments to avoid provoking voters
with Russian sympathies. Still, both countries were furious when Russia
demanded on January 21st that NATO pull allied forces out of their
territory. On February 2nd Joe Biden instead announced the deployment of
an additional 3,000 troops to the region

[It is in **central Europe** that attitudes towards Russia are most
**ambivalent**]{.underline}. Viktor [Orban, Hungary's populist prime
minister, is **friendly** with]{.underline} Mr [Putin and **visited**
him in Moscow on February 1st. He has **imitated**]{.underline} Mr
[Putin's model of government by taking **control** of his country's
media and judiciary]{.underline}. He [has]{.underline} also [bought
Russian **nuclear** **power** **plants**]{.underline}, [struck deals for
**Russian gas** that circumvent Ukraine and persistently called for
**relaxing** **EU sanctions**]{.underline}. Milos [Zeman]{.underline},
the [Czech Republic's president, is cosy with]{.underline} Mr [Putin,
too]{.underline}. But Petr Fiala, the new Czech prime minister, is
solidly in step with NATO and the EU.

[Poland's government also has some **affinity** with Mr Putin's. It is
**conservative**, **religious** and **nationalist**, and is fighting
with the EU over its efforts to turn judges into **political
pawns**.]{.underline} Yet it is the most fiercely anti-Russian
government in Europe. The Russian empire ruled much of Poland throughout
the 19th century and tried to Russify its population. In the second
world war Stalin carved Poland up with Hitler and executed much of its
elite. Many Poles see Russia as a country that tried to eliminate them
as a nation.

Eastern [European countries will pay a price for isolating Russia,
especially in **energy**]{.underline}. In October [Moldova was forced to
strike an **expensive** gas deal with Gazprom, and rising electricity
bills nearly **toppled** Ms Kallas's government in January]{.underline}.
But only for the Baltic countries is Russia among the top five export
markets[. In no country is direct investment from Russia more than a
**tenth** that from the EU, though in some pockets it plays a
significant role.]{.underline}

In Narva, for instance, [about **30%** of the firms in the city's
industrial zone are owned by Russians]{.underline}, reckons Vadim Orlov,
the zone's director. [Russian business]{.underline}~~men~~ [\[owners\]
want **factories** in a country governed by the rule of law. Why should
Estonia back sanctions that could make things harder for its own
**Russian-owned** businesses?]{.underline}

One reason is that [Russia likes to use **sanctions** too]{.underline}.
Ms Kallas mentions 2007, [when it **retaliated** for the removal of a
memorial to Soviet soldiers in Tallinn by cutting off **fuel
supplies**.]{.underline} Dumitru Alaiba, a Moldovan MP, recalls 2014,
[when Russia hit his country with an **embargo** after it signed an
association agreement with the EU]{.underline}. "\[We\] have learned
that [dealing with **Russia** has **risks**]{.underline}," says Ms
Kallas. If the region's ties to Russia are further weakened, Mr Putin
will have himself to blame.

#### Central Europe has Soviet ties difficult for Ukraine to overcome.

**Tuzhanskyi '22** \[Dmytro; director of the Institute for Central

Accessed 7-8-2022; RL\]

A string of [recent high level negotiations between the West and Russia
are not as fruitless as]{.underline} they are [deemed by]{.underline}
their participants and [political commentators]{.underline}.

It\'s true that no agreement on any of the key issues has been reached
during the negotiations held in Geneva, Brussels and Vienna, and 100,000
Russian soldiers are still located along the Ukrainian border. [No
agreement **save for one** may turn out to be the most
important]{.underline}.

[From]{.underline} the [**ultimatums** issued by]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin and the counter-stance of the
West]{.underline} (U.S., NATO and the European Union as one voice), one
may infer that [both parties realize that **Ukraine** is now part of the
West]{.underline}.

Neither Russia nor the West may be ready for this. Even Ukraine is not
ready, despite striving for such a reality more than others. But that
doesn\'t change anything. Ukraine is no longer an \"in-between,\" buffer
or gray-zone state as had been the case until 2014.

This new truth will not be changed by the fact that the West currently
is not ready to offer Ukraine EU or NATO membership in the foreseeable
future, with or without a new Russian military invasion.

Beginning from 2014, the large-scale war waged by Russia on Ukraine has
not ceased, claiming 14,000 Ukrainians. This grueling war has not
impacted the civilizational choice of Ukraine toward the West. On the
contrary, it has been entrenched in society as never before.

In November 2021, 58 percent of Ukrainians said they supported Ukraine
joining NATO. In 2014, that figure was 51 percent. Moreover, 59 percent
of Ukrainians do not think that Russia will abandon its aggressive
policy toward Ukraine provided Kyiv give up on its intention of joining
the EU and NATO.

Putin\'s intentions of receiving premature guarantees of NATO\'s
non-enlargement are yet another proof of Ukraine belonging to the West.
However, he is undertaking attempts to reject and change the reality
against Ukrainian\'s will, relying on (paradoxical as it may sound) the
West.

Thus, the historic moment of this situation lies in the question about
whether the West will abandon its own member, as has already been the
case once.

In 1983, the world famous Czech-French writer Milan Kundera described
such a precedent as \"a kidnapped West or the tragedy of Central
Europe.\"

[What he had in mind was power-sharing in the wake of World War II, when
countries like **Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary**, which had always
been associating themselves with the West in historical, cultural and
political terms, were \"**kidnapped**\" from the West, finding
themselves in the East, in the **Soviet sphere of
influence**]{.underline}. Here Kundera also emphasized the fact [that
this took place with the silent acquiescence of Western countries
themselves, which did not look at **Poland, Czechoslovakia** or
**Hungary** as part of the West]{.underline}. This was evident during
anti-Soviet uprisings in 1956 in Hungary and in 1968 in Prague, which
were quelled by the Soviet troops\' invasion of these two countries.

For the past eight years since the Revolution of Dignity happened in
Ukraine, Russia occupied Crimea and Donbas. The entire world has had the
opportunity to watch the same symbolic drama unfold in Europe, which was
previously described by Kundera.

[Ukraine now is the place where the civilizational border of the West
and Europe runs]{.underline}.

Moreover, in the Russian drafts of agreements with NATO and the U.S.,
the Kremlin put Ukraine in the same boat with Central European states,
which joined the Alliance after 1997. Putin wants the region to be
NATO-free regardless of the membership status of any given country. He
recently highlighted the \"historical unity of Russians and
Ukrainians.\"

The Kremlin insisted that the United States promised Moscow that NATO
will never enlarge to the East---an agreement that was never made by the
U.S. or any other nation.

Fortunately, unlike 1945, 1956 or 1968, [the West]{.underline} does not
remain silent today and has not ditched Ukraine with acquiescence, yet.
The current and possibly new sanctions, readiness to negotiate with
Russia at any level and in any format combined with the supply of
weapons to Ukraine corroborates this point.

However, these [efforts are insufficient]{.underline}.

\"[If Ukraine is to survive as an independent state, it will have to
become part of Central Europe]{.underline} rather than Eurasia, and [if
it is to be a part of Central Europe, then it will have to partake fully
of Central Europe\'s links to NATO and the European
Union]{.underline},\" wrote Zbigniew Brzezinski in his 1997 book The
Grand Chessboard, about the new world order.

It doesn\'t mean that today the West is obliged to fight Russia because
of Ukraine. However, so as not to repeat the hideous tragedy of Central
Europe, the West should help Ukraine to not only prepare for defense,
but also to be resilient.

And such resilience now can be brought about by what Brzezinski
said---Ukraine\'s deeper economic, infrastructural and political ties to
the West, particularly Central Europe.

In practical terms this has been already reaffirmed by the gas reverse
deliveries in Ukraine from Slovakia and Hungary, trade with Poland, the
export to which in 2020 exceeded that to Russia with this advantage
being still maintained and by the successful operations in Ukraine of
such companies as the Hungarian-owned OTP and WizzAir and the
Polish-owned PZU Group and LOT.

Not only Ukraine is in need of these ties. They may provide an incentive
for such projects as the Three Seas Initiative and the Bucharest Nine,
which would help rethink the relations between the old and new West,
adding value to the latter, in particular to Poland and Romania.

[All of these steps make for a multilateral democracy in action and
division of labor that are supposed to cement the Transatlantic
community, in particular its Eastern flank, which in recent years has
turned into a springboard for Russia and China in a new great power
competition]{.underline} with the West and U.S. in particular. In other
words, the entire West needs ties within Central Europe.

The consent to Putin\'s ultimatums is not part of realpolitik for the
sake of peace and security in Europe. It would be treason.

[Should Putin\'s ultimatum be complied with, the West will effectively
betray its allies along the whole Eastern flank all the way from the
Black Sea to the Nordic countries]{.underline}. That is why the true
realpolitik for the West currently is to keep its word to Ukraine and
not allow the new tragedy of Central Europe to be repeated.

**[Ethnic Minority Rights]{.underline}**

[Ukraine\'s multiethnic composition]{.underline} has recently [led to a
resurgence in identity politics]{.underline}. Since its independence,
[Ukraine has protected]{.underline} the [fundamental rights of ethnic
minorities]{.underline} within its borders, [including the right to be
educated in mother tongues]{.underline}. The annexation of
[Crimea]{.underline} by Russia in 2014 [and]{.underline} continued
[Russian support for non-state actors in Donbas triggered]{.underline} a
[change]{.underline} in policy. Since the Kremlin justified infringing
on Ukrainian territorial sovereignty by citing Russian ethnic and
linguistic ties to the local population, Kyiv decided to increase
national resiliency by disincentivizing Russian language use in Ukraine.

In 2017, [the Ukrainian Parliament adopted]{.underline} the new [Law on
Education, **reducing**]{.underline} traditional [rights of **ethnic
minorities** to be educated in their native language]{.underline}. Two
years later, [the]{.underline} new State Language [Law limited the use
of minority languages in]{.underline} the spheres of [public
life]{.underline}---[only private communications and religious events
were exempted]{.underline}. Although Kyiv\'s new policies are directed
at its Russian speaking population, [all ethnic minorities have been
heavily impacted, including Bulgarians, **Hungarians**, **Poles**, and
Romanians]{.underline}. The kin-states of [these minorities]{.underline}
all [protested against the new language regime. The strongest
reaction]{.underline} came [from Hungary]{.underline}, which has decided
to block top-level political talks between NATO and Kyiv. Budapest has
pledged to resume its full support for Ukraine\'s ambitions towards
Western integration once minority rights are restored.

Hungary's reaction was foreseeable. [Just like other countries in
Central]{.underline} and Eastern [Europe, Hungary has a special bond to
**ethnic** **Hungarians** living beyond its borders]{.underline}. As a
result of the border changes after the two world wars, today [**2
million** ethnic Hungarians live in]{.underline} the [neighboring
countries, including]{.underline} some [150,000 ethnic Hungarians in
Western Ukraine]{.underline}. The well-being of these communities has
always been important for Hungary. [This is]{.underline} not only the
priority of the current government but also [a **constitutional
obligation** dating back to the country's independence.]{.underline}

Moreover, in the Basic Treaty between Hungary and Ukraine, which entered
into force in 1993, [both parties declared that they would ensure the
necessary opportunities for ethnic minorities to learn their **native
language** and]{.underline} to [study in their native
language]{.underline} at all levels of the educational system. [Ukraine
**breached** this agreement when it introduced new language laws that
**infringed** upon these established rights of ethnic minorities,
including Hungarians]{.underline}.

Energy Policy

[A **divergence** of interests in the energy sector has only
**deepened** the divide between Ukraine and Hungary]{.underline}.
[Ukraine's extensive gas pipeline system]{.underline}, which [has an
annual transit capacity of 146 billion cubic meters]{.underline} (bcm),
historically provided 40 percent of Europe's gas import needs. [By
transiting hydrocarbons from Russia to Europe, Ukraine
collects]{.underline} upwards of [**\$3 billion** a year in transit
fees]{.underline}. The funds proved especially crucial for Ukraine
[after the **economic deprivations** caused by Russian transgressions in
Crimea and Donbas.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} alternative [routes offered by pipelines in
the]{.underline} Black and [Baltic Sea have]{.underline} severely
[**diminished** the amount Ukraine can collect in transit fees. An
agreement]{.underline} signed [in 2019 has ensured at least 40 bcm of
Russian gas]{.underline} will [flow]{.underline} annually through
Ukraine\'s Druzhba pipeline until 2024, but [European
investments]{.underline} in these alternative routes continue to
[threaten Ukraine\'s **fiscal security**]{.underline}. Upon the
completion of the new NordStream II project, the baltic route alone is
projected to deliver a combined 110 bcm of Russian gas to Europe via
Germany annually.

[Russia's willingness to use **gas reliance** for **political leverage**
has **underscored** the importance of energy diversification in European
countries like Hungary]{.underline}. Russia\'s refusal to transit gas
through Ukraine in 2006 and 2009 elicited concerns that Russia may make
similar unilateral decisions in the future, especially with hostilities
in Eastern Ukraine still ongoing. Hungary's current energy dependency on
Russia, which supplies 80 percent of the country's imported gas, places
the country in a particularly precarious position.

While [Hungary has attempted to diversify its energy sector by investing
in nuclear reactors and]{.underline} Liquid natural gas
([LNG]{.underline}), gas [imports]{.underline} still [cover]{.underline}
the [remaining **30 percent** of the country's energy
needs]{.underline}. In September 2021, Hungary signed a contentious new
gas deal that secures an annual 4.5 bcm of Russian gas imports over the
next 15 years. [By negotiating]{.underline} directly [with **Russian gas
company** Gazprom, Hungary has]{.underline} both [enhanced its business
relationship with]{.underline} its most important [**energy supplier**
and]{.underline}, by [rerouting]{.underline} through Serbia and Austria,
[increased]{.underline} the [reliability of transit by
circumventing]{.underline} the [**hostilities** in Ukraine]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[The current geopolitical situation in Europe]{.underline}, largely
[**orchestrated by Russia**, places significant strain on the
Ukrainian-Hungarian bilateral relationship]{.underline}. Both [countries
have attempted to enhance]{.underline} their [national and economic
security through]{.underline} controversial [policy initiatives,
including language laws]{.underline} in Ukraine [and the new energy deal
in Hungary]{.underline}. This schism between Hungary and Ukraine has
strong relevance to the U.S., given Biden\'s foreign policy objectives.

5\. Which other countries are exposed?

[Land-locked nations in]{.underline} eastern [and **central** Europe are
**more vulnerable** to Russian gas disruption as they have **fewer**
alternative options compared with western and southern European
nations]{.underline}. Russian supplies accounted for about 40% of
Italy's demand in 2021, but that country has been scouring the globe for
replacements and has secured new agreements with suppliers, particularly
in North Africa. Some smaller gas buyers like Finland, which has also
been deprived of Russian gas, are planning to use floating LNG
terminals. [Poland,]{.underline} which [generates most of its
electricity from coal, invested in a new gas pipeline from Norway, set
to start flows in October]{.underline}, while Bulgaria plans to increase
Azeri gas imports in 2022 with the opening of a spur from Greece, a
country that can also supply LNG.

[6. What role does Ukraine play?]{.underline}

[About a **third** of Russian gas flowing to Europe]{.underline}
normally [passes through **Ukraine**]{.underline}. Supplies via the
country have been curbed since May 11 after a transit point was put out
of service amid fighting in the eastern part of the country. Prior to
the cuts, Ukraine had been expecting to earn at least \$7 billion from
transit fees under a five-year transit deal in December 2019.

7\. How has Russia disrupted the market before?

[In 2006 and 2009, disputes with Ukraine over pricing and siphoning of
gas led to **cutoffs** of Russian supplies transiting through the
country]{.underline}. The second shutdown lasted almost two weeks in the
dead of winter. Slovakia and [some Balkan countries had to **ration
gas**, **shut factories** and cut **power supplies**]{.underline}. Since
then, the most vulnerable countries have raced to lay pipelines, connect
grids and build terminals to import LNG shipped from as far as Qatar and
the U.S.

[A combination of **ambivalence**, lack of **transparency**, legislative
**barriers** and hidden **owners**]{.underline} are
[undermin]{.underline}ing [Central Europe's imposition of **sanctions**
on **Russian entities** and **individuals**.]{.underline} In April,
Russian activist Alexei [Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation
published]{.underline} a list of over [6,000 bribe takers and warmongers
who]{.underline}, it accuses, [have enabled]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [Putin's war in Ukraine]{.underline}. The EU's
sanctions list falls far short of this, identifying only 80 entities and
1,093 individuals subject to asset freezes and travel bans, though
experts cast doubt on whether sanctions are being fully applied even on
these fewer targets. [**Central Europe** is **illustrative** of the
difficulties in applying **sanctions** to Russian companies and
individuals. Behind]{.underline} the [lurid]{.underline}
[headlines]{.underline} about the seizure of mega-yachts and opulent
mansions belonging to Russia's elite, who are conservatively estimated
to hold assets abroad worth over \$1 trillion, [there is a much more
complicated picture in which a combination of ambivalence, lack of
transparency, legislative barriers and hidden owners is conspiring to
**water down** the sanctions' **effectiveness**.]{.underline} At the
state level, while [all EU countries have unanimously
approved]{.underline} the five rounds [sanctions]{.underline} against
these Russian/Belarusian entities and individuals, they [have done so
with **varying degrees** of enthusiasm]{.underline}. At one end of the
sanctions-support spectrum you have Poland, which has been one of the
strongest advocates for tough EU sanctions against Russia. In April,
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki even urged the imposition of sanctions
against all members of the Kremlin's parliamentary party United Russia.
Given that at the end of 2021 [United Russia had more than **2.3
million** registered members, such a move would go far beyond even the
Navalny list.]{.underline} At the other end of the spectrum is [Hungary,
whose Russia-friendly prime minister is holding up the latest, sixth
round of EU sanctions, principally over the vexed issue of banning
Russian oil imports.]{.underline} The [Budapest
government's]{.underline} general [attitude]{.underline} towards the EU
sanctions [can be characterised as ambivalent]{.underline} at best. [It
expressed reservations when the European Commission included Moshe
Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, and Herman Gref, CEO
of Sberbank, on its sanctions list, but went along with it. But Russian
Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Kirill, who is included on the sixth
sanctions list for his vocal support for Putin's war, was a step too far
in Orban's view. "We do not support the inclusion of religious leaders
on the sanctions list, as this goes against freedom of
religion,]{.underline}" the prime minister said in his weekly radio
address on May 6. [In between Poland and Hungary are the Czech Republic
and Slovakia]{.underline}, both of which are run by Western-oriented,
EU-sanction supporting governments, [who have to deal with **prominent**
domestic pro-Russian forces ranged against them. In Czechia, this
includes President Milos Zeman and his **overtly pro-Russian entourage**
in Prague Castle; in Slovakia, it is the two-time former prime minister
Robert Fico and his SMER-SD party, around which various **extremist**
pro-Russian parties coalesce]{.underline}. Present and accounted for Of
course, [Central European governments can only apply **sanctions** to
that which is actually present in their country]{.underline}. One reason
why the British sanctions on Russian companies and individuals make such
attention-grabbing headlines around the world is because for so many
years the UK was, in the words of Transparency International, a "global
hub for money laundering". Perhaps [the most vivid example of Hungary's
**contradictory stance** over the sanctions is the continued presence of
the Russian-based International Investment Bank -- a multilateral
development institution which has had its headquarters in Budapest since
2019. Considered by many to be little more than a "spy bank" beyond the
remit of Hungarian regulators, Orban's government granted it full
diplomatic immunity, which allows staff to enter Hungary freely -- and
therefore the wider EU -- potentially **undermining
sanctions**]{.underline}. Yet despite the overt friendliness shown
towards Russia by Orban and his governing Fidesz party, Hungary has not
actually been a particularly favourite playground of Russian oligarchs,
and the presence of Russian companies is -- at least on paper -- fairly
negligible. Besides the Hungarian subsidiary of nuclear holding Rosatom
-- responsible for the extension of the Paks 2 nuclear power plant, a
project that the Hungarian government is still insisting, somewhat
optimistically, will go ahead -- [only a **few** Russian companies
officially have operations in Hungary.]{.underline} Steelmaker
[Dunaferr]{.underline}, a renowned industrial company dating back to the
communist era, [is directly owned by]{.underline} the [Cyprus-based
Steelhold Ltd]{.underline}. Steelhold belongs to Industrial Union of
Donbas, one of the biggest holdings in eastern Ukraine, but is basically
controlled by Russian stakeholders. Last year, speculation grew that the
company would be taken over by Russia's Metalloinvest, owned by Alisher
Usmanov, the sixth richest Russian, now also on the EU sanctions list,
but the deal never materialised. As such, Steelhold is still 50 per cent
owned by the Russian state development institution VEB, which is on the
EU sanctions list. It is not clear how the sanctions will impact on the
company's operations; officially, it will only say it "faces some supply
problems". Dunaferr has around 3,300 employees, but a long-running feud
between its Russian and Ukrainian owners has led to a management vacuum.
Another interesting case is that of the rail business and industrial
site Dunakeszi Jarmujavito, which is 50 per cent owned by
Transmashholding, the largest manufacturer of rolling stock in Russia.
The other 50 per cent of Dunakeszi, which has a major contract to
modernise and produce carriages for the Hungarian state rail company, is
held by the Hungarian entrepreneur Kristof Szalay-Bobrovniczky, who has
just been appointed Orban's next defence minister. Transmashholding is
not on the sanctions list, but the president of the company, Andrei
Bokarev, had to resign at the end of April after he was put on the
British sanctions list, though he's still absent from the EU list. Even
so, the arrangement means that a defence minister of a NATO country is
in a close business relationship with a Russian company that builds
materiel for Russia's war machine in Ukraine. When it comes to favourite
places for well-to-do Russians in Europe to visit, the spa town of
Heviz, some 200 kilometres west of Budapest, is high on the list.
Featuring a huge thermal lake, Heviz has been a popular meeting place
for the Russian intelligence services. In 2017, Austrian ex-colonel
Martin M칬ller was reported to have handed over classified NATO documents
to Russian spies in Heviz -- one of several rendezvous points in Central
Europe chosen by M칬ller, which also included Bratislava and 맚rbsk칠
pleso in the High Tatras. The five-star Lotus Therme Hotel & Spa in
Heviz is Russian owned, but by individuals who have been living in
Hungary for decades with no obvious connections to the Putin regime. The
spa town has also been a favourite destination for Russian tourists,
with many owning real estate. There's even a Russian Orthodox Church
being built in Heviz, with hefty Hungarian government support. Image: EC
Likewise, [Poland has been of limited interest to Russians due to
longstanding antipathy in the country to their presence]{.underline}, to
the extent that the Warsaw government felt moved to unilaterally modify
its national legislation to create room for its own sanction targets.
This led to the announcement in April that [a further 50 individuals and
companies from Russia and Belarus would be subject to measures, which
include a **ban** on **entry** to Poland and participation in public
tenders as well as a **freezing of assets**]{.underline}. Those found
guilty of breaking the sanctions are subject to fines of up to 5 billion
euros. "The Polish sanctions list is a supplement to the EU list,"
Interior Minister Mariusz Kaminski explained. "It applies to Russian
entities and oligarchs with real interests in our country." The list
also includes companies linked to the Belarusian regime of Aleksandr
Lukashenko as well as companies previously involved in the import of
Russian coal into Poland. [The Russian state gas company **Gazprom**
also appears on Poland's list, which is believed to]{.underline} have
been the [spark]{.underline} that led to [Russia **cutting** of gas
supplies to Poland in late April]{.underline}. A much bigger playground
for Russian interests has been the Czech Republic. As one expert who
monitors Russian-speaking organised crime once told BIRN, looking at the
private school rosters shows it has been the preferred destination for
the 'second' families of rich Russians -- a mix of oligarchs and
"criminal entrepreneurs" -- for the past two decades. Yet [following the
**mass expulsion** of **Russian diplomats** in 2021 after the
**revelation** that Russian intelligence officers were in all likelihood
behind the **explosion** of a munitions depot in the southeast of
Czechia and now the war in Ukraine, a **suspiciously large** number of
luxury properties are finding their way on to the Czech market, priced
to sell, say real estate professionals]{.underline}. The Czechs are
"dealing with the assets of several persons and dozens of entities on
the EU sanctions lists in the aggregate amount of hundreds of millions
of Czech koruna," a spokesperson for the Finance Ministry told BIRN.
Asked to specify some of the assets affected, the spokesperson noted
that the Finance Ministry acted in mid-April against the West End Hotel
in the spa town of Marianske Lazne. The resort is owned by Dmitry
Pumpyansky, whose main business is producing pipes for Russia's oil and
gas industries. The action taken against Pumpyansky means that while the
hotel can continue to operate, it cannot be sold or distribute profit to
Pumpyansky. A hotel of a similar name in nearby Karlovy Vary, owned by
Vladimir Yevtushenko of the telecommunications and banking conglomerate
Sistema, is also in the crosshairs. Other targets include a member of
the Russian State Duma and the wife of another. As well as real estate,
frozen assets include bank accounts and company shares. However, dealing
with some assets is proving more challenging. Skoda JS, for instance, is
owned by Gazprom (which is not yet on the EU sanctions list). Yet Skoda
JS's vital role maintaining and servicing Czechia's two nuclear power
plants means that the Czech state-controlled energy group CEZ has no
choice but to continue cooperating with it. The Ministry of Industry and
Trade admits that Russian ownership of what is a key strategic partner
for Czechia's energy security is a significant risk. "The fact that
Skoda JS has Russian owners can be clearly seen as a mistake," a
spokesman told the local press. In private, officials say that a
solution is being sought, which could include either a purchase by CEZ
via expropriation or the imposition of an administrator. However, both
routes require new legislation, a further stumbling block to the
effective imposition of sanctions. The vandalized facade of one of the
villas belonging to Russian state TV host Vladimir Soloviev on the
shores of Lake Como, Italy, 06 April 2022. EPA-EFE/MATTEO BAZZI Law &
order [As one of Ukraine's most **proactive** supporters, whose
relations with Moscow were already in the deep freeze, it's no surprise
that the Czech Republic has **enthusiastically leapt** to impose
sanctions]{.underline}. Yet current Czech legislation only allows the
government to act on EU or United Nations sanctions. Prague has no
option to enforce sanctions based on the US list, for instance, or even
to select its own targets like Poland is doing. "[The government would
like to **extend** the current EU **sanctions** lists to include certain
individuals and entities]{.underline}," said the Finance Ministry
spokesman. "This process is also underway, but requires close
cooperation with intelligence services and other security services."
"Currently, there exists no real legal tool with which the Czech
Republic could sanction a foreign entity on the basis of domestic
demand. This is why we are preparing our own Magnitsky Act," Foreign
Minister Jan Lipavsky said in late March, referring to the US
legislation of 2016 that authorises its government to sanction foreign
officials worldwide who are deemed to be human rights offenders, freeze
their assets and ban them from entering the US. [The Czech government is
also working on legislation that would allow it to cut off companies
from public money and tenders]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [implementation
of the sanctions can be messy and confused]{.underline}. The Polish
Interior Ministry appeared loath to provide further details to BIRN as
to the manner in which EU or Polish sanctions on Russian entities and
individuals since the war have been implemented, restricting itself to
stressing the country had imposed supplementary sanctions to the EU
ones. However, [the local media are beginning to report on a series of
issues with the implementation of sanctions on the Polish
list.]{.underline} For example, Gazeta Wyborcza reported that one
company, Maga Foods, was added to the Polish list because it was owned
by Mikhail Fridman, yet it is now actually in the control of a Dutch
businessman after the latter purchased Fridman's shares in March. The
company, a food producer, is now struggling to survive. Paradoxically,
one unintended consequence of the sanctions is that Ukrainian employees
of the firm -- about half of the 200-strong workforce -- are suffering.
"The whole situation is absurd," Piotr Pawinski, president of the
company, told Gazeta Wyborcza. ["They wanted to punish Fridman, but
ended up depriving our Ukrainian employees of a livelihood -- and they
had been sending most of their incomes to their families back home."
Experts agree that effective sanctions require **greater transparency**
and **enforcement**.]{.underline} Yet the region falls short on both.
[**Lack of transparency** has been a feature of the region for decades
and too little was done to address it]{.underline}. [This failure is a
significant complicating factor in implementing sanctions, because all
too often it's impossible to identify who owns what.]{.underline}

7.3.2 [**Security** and defence realignments: **build**]{.underline}ing
**[fences]{.underline}** or fostering cooperative approaches?

[The **Russian Federation's** relations with **NATO** have been
**difficult**]{.underline}, particularly [in the light of the Alliance's
open door policy]{.underline} (Karabeshkin and Spechler 2007; Kramer
2009; Romaniuk 2010; Shea 2010). For the Russian Federation [this policy
is understood as an establishment of a **virtual wall** that reproduces
the dynamics of **exclusion** that characterized the Cold War,
but]{.underline} now [further to the East. Despite]{.underline}
statements about [shared values, transparency and
c]{.underline}onfidence-[b]{.underline}uilding
[m]{.underline}easure[s,]{.underline} along with the establishment of
institutional mechanisms for cooperation, such as the NATO--Russia
Council (2002), [trust between **NATO** and **Russia** has been **hard
to achieve**.]{.underline}

In fact, [the Russian Federation Military Doctrine of 201015 is
**harsh** in its wording]{.underline}, as [it identifies the Atlantic
Alliance's enlargement policy as the main **external threat** to Russian
interests]{.underline}. But the Russian Federation's presence at the
Lisbon Summit of the Alliance (November 2010) marked a new stage in the
relations after a period of much difficulty, with the war in Georgia in
the summer of 2008 representing the height of the tension. [The summit
included discussions on missile defence and energy issues and,
correspondingly, the US proposal for a missile defence shield involving
two Central European countries -- Poland and the Czech
Republic]{.underline}. This project [raised serious concerns in the
**Russian** Federation about the enactment of an **encirclement**
**policy** that]{.underline}, despite some statements to the contrary,
[was understood in Russia as being driven against it]{.underline}. The
announcement of the project was not without consequences for the
EU--Russian Federation relations either (Seaboyer and Thr칛nert 2006).

In his annual address to the Federal Assembly in 2007, Vladimir Putin
stated that the issue of [missile defence was not just
Russian--American, but]{.underline} that it [involved 'the interests of
all European countries, including]{.underline} those in
[NATO']{.underline} (Putin 2007). Despite the assurance from the United
States that the project was not directed against the Russian Federation,
[the Russian position was one of **antagonism**]{.underline}. According
to President Barack Obama,

\[W\]e've also repeatedly made clear to Russia that its concerns about
our previous missile defense programs were entirely unfounded. Our clear
and consistent focus has been the threat posed by Iran's ballistic
missile program, and that continues to be our focus and the basis of the
program that we're announcing today. (Obama 2009)

President Obama's revision of the project with the announcement in
September 2009 of the withdrawal from the original plan that envisaged
stationing radar and missile sites in the Czech Republic and Poland
generated various reactions. The Russian Federation understood it as a
victory for itself. [Poland and the Czech Republic]{.underline},
however, [understood the move as signalling a **US disinvestment** from
European security]{.underline}. In Fawn's view, '\[t\]he danger is that
Russia's creeping intimidation and influence-peddling in the region
could over time lead to a de facto neutralization of the region' (Fawn
2010: 90). This means that the [Central European states considered that
the reset policy in the **US**--**Russia** relations]{.underline}
(Krastev 2011; Lucas 2011; Kupchan 2011) [might lead to a policy of
**'benign neglect'**]{.underline} (Larrabee 2010: 45), [which would
leave them **more** **vulnerable** to the Russian Federation's influence
independently of]{.underline} their integration into the EU and
[NATO]{.underline}.

#### Ukraine is our brink, not a thumper -- additional military provocations in Central Europe anger Russia. 

**Carpenter '22** \[Ted Galen; a senior fellow in defense and foreign
policy studies at the Cato Institute, is the author of 12 books on
international affairs; 2-28-2022; \"Many predicted Nato expansion would
lead to war. Those warnings were ignored\"; The Guardian;

Accessed 7-19-2022; RL\]

Russia's military offensive against Ukraine is an act of aggression that
will make already worrisome tensions between Nato and Moscow even more
dangerous. [The west's new cold war with Russia has turned
hot]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin bears primary responsibility for this
latest development, but [Nato's **arrogant**, **tone**넉**deaf** policy
toward Russia over the past quarter넉귺entury deserves a **large
share**]{.underline} as well. Analysts committed to [a US foreign policy
of realism and restraint have warned for more than a quarter넉귺entury
that continuing to expand the most powerful military alliance in history
toward another major power would **not** **end** **well**.]{.underline}
The war in [Ukraine provides definitive **confirmation**]{.underline}
that [it did not]{.underline}.

Thinking through the Ukraine crisis -- the causes

"[It would be extraordinarily difficult to expand Nato **eastward**
without that action's being viewed by Russia as **unfriendly**. Even the
**most** **modest** schemes would bring the alliance to the **borders**
of the old Soviet Union]{.underline}. Some of [the more ambitious
versions would have the alliance **virtually** **surround** the Russian
Federation itself]{.underline}." I wrote those words in 1994, in my book
Beyond Nato: Staying Out of Europe's Wars, at a time when expansion
proposals merely constituted occasional speculation in foreign policy
seminars in New York and Washington. I added that [expansion "would
**constitute** a **needless provocation** of Russia".]{.underline}

What was not publicly known at the time was that Bill [Clinton's
admin]{.underline}istration had [already made the fateful decision the
previous year to push for including some former Warsaw Pact countries in
Nato. The admin]{.underline}istration [would]{.underline} soon [propose
inviting Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become
members]{.underline}, and the US Senate approved adding those countries
to the North Atlantic Treaty in 1998. It would be the first of several
waves of membership expansion.

[Even that first stage provoked **Russian opposition** and
**anger**]{.underline}. In her memoir, Madeleine Albright, Clinton's
secretary of state, concedes that "\[Russian president Boris\] Yeltsin
and his country~~men~~ \[individuals\] were strongly opposed to
enlargement, seeing it as a strategy for exploiting their vulnerability
and moving Europe's dividing line to the east, leaving them isolated."

Strobe Talbott, deputy secretary of state, similarly described the
Russian attitude. "[Many Russians see Nato as a vestige of the cold war,
inherently directed against their country]{.underline}. They point out
that [they have disbanded the Warsaw Pact, their military alliance, and
ask why the west should not do the same.]{.underline}" It was an
excellent question, and neither the Clinton administration nor its
successors provided even a remotely convincing answer.

George Kennan, the intellectual father of America's containment policy
during the cold war, perceptively warned in a May 1998 New York Times
interview about what the Senate's ratification of Nato's first round of
expansion would set in motion. "I think it is the beginning of a new
cold war," Kennan stated. "I think [the Russians will gradually react
quite **adversely** and it will affect their policies]{.underline}. I
think it is a tragic mistake. There was no reason for this whatsoever.
No one was threatening anybody else."

He was right, but [US and Nato leaders proceeded with]{.underline} new
rounds of expansion, including [the provocative step of adding the three
Baltic republics]{.underline}. Those countries not only had been part of
the Soviet Union, but they had also been part of Russia's empire during
the Czarist era. [That wave of expansion now had Nato **perched** on the
**border** of the Russian Federation]{.underline}.

[Moscow's patience]{.underline} with Nato's ever more intrusive behavior
[was **wearing thin.**]{.underline} The last reasonably friendly warning
from Russia that the alliance needed to back off came in March 2007,
when Putin addressed the annual Munich security conference. "[Nato has
put its frontline forces on our borders,]{.underline}" Putin complained.
[Nato expansion "represents a **serious provocation** that reduces the
level of mutual trust.]{.underline} And we have the right to ask:
[against whom is this **expansion** intended?]{.underline} And [what
happened to the assurances our western partners made after the
dissolution of the Warsaw Pact?"]{.underline}

In his memoir, Duty, Robert M [Gates]{.underline}, who served as
secretary of defense in the administrations of both George W Bush and
Barack Obama, [stated]{.underline} his belief that "[the relationship
with Russia had been badly mismanaged after]{.underline} \[George HW\]
[Bush left office]{.underline} in 1993". Among other missteps, "[US
agreements with the **Romanian** and **Bulgarian** governments to rotate
troops through bases in those countries was a needless
provocation]{.underline}." In an implicit rebuke to the younger Bush,
Gates asserted that "trying to bring Georgia and Ukraine into Nato was
truly overreaching". That move, he contended, was a case of "recklessly
ignoring what the Russians considered their own vital national
interests".

The following year, the Kremlin demonstrated that its discontent with
Nato's continuing incursions into Russia's security zone had moved
beyond verbal objections. Moscow exploited a foolish provocation by
Georgia's pro넉긍estern government to launch a military offensive that
brought Russian troops to the outskirts of the capital. Thereafter,
Russia permanently detached two secessionist넉긄inded Georgian regions and
put them under effective Russian control.

[Western (especially US) leaders continued to blow through **red warning
light** after a **red warning light**, however.]{.underline} The
[Obama]{.underline} administration's shockingly [arrogant meddling in
Ukraine's internal political affairs in 2013 and 2014]{.underline} to
[help demonstrators overthrow Ukraine's elected, pro넉Russia
president]{.underline} was the [single most brazen
provocation]{.underline}, and it caused tensions to spike. Moscow
immediately responded by seizing and annexing Crimea, and a new cold war
was underway with a vengeance.

#### The [only]{.underline} area where NATO can revitalize the relationship with Central Europe is [security cooperation]{.underline}

https://kki.hu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FPR_2019_online_final.pdf

**[The single most important area where U.S. and Central European
interests meet is security cooperation]{.underline}**. [Ironically, one
of the challenges posed to this shared interest is coming from Western
Europe, more specifically from the advocates of the European Security
and Defence Policy (ESDP), a European security policy without U.S.
input]{.underline}. In 2000, a 60,000 strong Rapid Reaction Force (RRF)
was announced within the ESDP (McCray, 2014). [These attempts met almost
universal rejection in the U.S.; both Democratic and Republican
politicians warned against any 'duplication' of the existing
structures]{.underline}. **[Then Secretary of Defence William Cohen went
as far as saying that "if the EU created a defence capability outside of
NATO, the alliance would become 'a relic of the past'".]{.underline}**
Later U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Nicholas **[Burns branded the effort as
'one of the greatest t dangers to the transatlantic
community'"]{.underline}** (Carpenter, 2018). [Washington, instead,
lobbied for a military response force within NATO, and put pressure
primarily on the new members of NATO in Central and Eastern Europe,
which were]{.underline} -- on the whole - [receptive to the U.S.
concerns because they strongly believed that the only country that was
able to provide hard security guarantees for them was the
U.S.]{.underline} **[The underlying issue is a struggle between Western
European leaders, such as Emmanuel Macron, and the U.S. about the future
role that America might or should play in Europe]{.underline}**.
Washington is vary of a federalised Europe with an independent defence
and security capability because the present disagreements between the
U.S. and the EU might degenerate into open hostilities, which -- in turn
-- would weaken American positions in the world. **[NATO is the only
official institution that makes the U.S. 'a European power,' and it
obviously enhances America's opportunities to counter the Russian and
Chinese influence in Europe, and even elsewhere]{.underline}**.
Moreover, the U.S. can legitimately press within NATO its allies to
assume a larger share of the burdens of the Atlantic Community and thus,
at least theoretically, it offers an opportunity for Washington to
concentrate larger forces to combat the newly emerging military
challenges elsewhere in the world, first and foremost in the
Asia-Pacific region - the Obama administration's 'pivot to Asia' was
intended to address this issue by shifting naval assets from the
Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean - (Thompson, 2012). [From a Central
European point of view, a relatively strong American military, political
and economic presence in Europe can be a sort of counterbalance to the
centralising tendencies of the so-called core countries of
Europe]{.underline} - [which would mean, in essence, further loss of
national sovereignty over a number of areas]{.underline}. **[Therefore,
the countries of 'new Europe' have tended to support the U.S. even if
they had misgivings about the latter's policies, and a similar pattern
is likely to remain in place in the foreeseable future
too]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Link -- Security Cooperation Key

#### Defense cooperation is the [core tie]{.underline} between the West and Central Europe

David **Hutt '21**, is a political journalist based between France and
the Czech Republic, reporting on European political affairs and EU-Asian
relations, "In Central Europe, Biden Can Build on Trump's Record", World
Politics Review, 2/17/21,
https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/29428/in-central-europe-biden-can-build-on-trump-s-record

**[Another potential area of cooperation is defense, mainly aimed at
countering Russia's activities]{.underline}**. This is a field that
Biden has ample experience with, having served as vice president in
2014, when Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and began ramping up
military activities in eastern Ukraine. [Biden was one of the architects
of what was then called the European Reassurance Initiative, a push to
bolster the U.S. security presence in Europe in response to Russia's
aggression, including by stationing around 4,500 American troops in
Poland on a rotational basis]{.underline}. That number is set to rise to
5,500 under a bilateral agreement that was finalized during the final
months of the Trump administration. [While Biden announced last week
that he is reversing Trump's decision to move 12,000 troops out of
Germany]{.underline}---some of which were slated to redeploy elsewhere
in Europe, including Poland---**[he is unlikely to alter the defense
pacts Trump signed with Poland and with Hungary, nor is he expected to
interfere with planned sales of U.S. military equipment to those
countries]{.underline}**. **[Ultimately, Biden's tougher views on Moscow
will endear him toward the Central European states, especially
Poland]{.underline}**. **[The four states are among the most passionate
members of the NATO defense pact]{.underline}**, **[which Biden has
called "the most effective political-military alliance in modern
history," whereas Trump disparaged it as "obsolete.]{.underline}**"

#### Security cooperation initiatives are what Central European states seek to [revitalize]{.underline} the relationship

[In the recent past a planned trip to a Central European country by
a]{.underline} Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs
([EUR]{.underline}) [deputy assistant secretary was fairly big news
within EUR's Office of Central European Affairs]{.underline} (CE).
**[However, the pace has picked up considerably in the past few years,
with visits becoming more common]{.underline}**. **[In the last six
months alone, the United States has received the Polish president at the
White House]{.underline}**; Secretary of State Mike **[Pompeo traveled
to Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Slovenia and has received
his Romanian, Slovak, and Slovene counterparts in Washington; and three
different under secretaries of state have touched down in multiple
Central European capitals]{.underline}**. **[These visits and events
have kept the CE staff busy and active as they continue to plan and
conduct bilateral relations within 10 diverse European
states]{.underline}**. CE focuses their mission on seven of Europe's
youngest democracies (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia) and three neutrals (Austria,
Liechtenstein, and Switzerland). **[America's primary geopolitical
adversaries]{.underline}**---**[Russia and
China]{.underline}**---**[continue to compete for influence in Central
Europe]{.underline}**. **[Russia still aspires to maintain spheres of
influence in its former Soviet empire by occupying parts of neighboring
Ukraine, actively instrumentalizing disinformation and malign influence
in the area]{.underline}**. Communist **[China has returned as well,
using relationships dating back to 1949 to pursue its malign influence
via opaque investment among other means]{.underline}**. Chinese discount
pricing appeals in a region that has made huge economic strides in the
30 years since the collapse of communism, but that still has a long way
to go to reach Western European levels of development. Having suffered
from ostensible "liberation" by the Soviet Red Army, **[Central European
countries actively seek partnership with the United
States]{.underline}**. **[Positive popular attitudes there towards the
United States are among the highest in Europe]{.underline}**.
**[Governmental attitudes generally follow with sustained U.S.
engagement]{.underline}**. "**[Some Central European countries have
presented themselves as 'bridges between East and West]{.underline}**,'"
explained EUR Deputy Assistant Secretary Matt Boyse, who oversees CE.
"**[We've had to remind some Allies they are not 'bridges,' because in
1989 they freely and eagerly chose to rejoin the West. For the most
part, that message has stuck with governments]{.underline}**, even if we
still see 'old think' in parts of the population." CE's eight desk
officers translate that message into action every day. **[Security
cooperation is a top priority for most Central European
countries]{.underline}**. **[It takes many forms, like increased U.S.
presence along NATO's Eastern Flank and upgrading military cooperation
by replacing legacy Soviet gear with state-of-the-art NATO interoperable
equipment]{.underline}**. Poland is buying 32 F-35 multirole combat
aircraft, while Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Romania are modernizing with
F-16 fighter aircraft. [Military purchases also enable Allies to meet
their commitments in burden sharing, undertaken at the Wales and Warsaw
NATO Summits]{.underline}. **[The United States has recently signed new
Defense Cooperation Agreements with Poland and Hungary and 10-year
Defense Cooperation Roadmaps with Romania and Bulgaria]{.underline}**.
**[Military cooperation also includes Central Europe's
neutrals]{.underline}**. [Austria is a Partnership for Peace
member]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} many state National Guard forces
are competing to become its state partner. [Two U.S. companies are
competing to modernize Switzerland's air force]{.underline} with U.S.
fighter jets.

#### DCA's that [extend]{.underline} NATO defense guarantees determine relations

Benjamin **BASKA '19**, M.A. Student at Corvinus University of Budapest
, "The U.S. and the Eastern European Defence Cooperation Agreements:
Impacts, Geopolitics and the Hungarian Case", Institute for Foreign
Affairs and Trade - Budapest, Foreign Policy Review, 2019,
https://kki.hu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/FPR_2019_online_final.pdf

[Agreements on defence cooperation have a wider regional impact, where
an adversarial power might perceive the DCA as an element of an
aggressive posture by the signatory states]{.underline}. **[While DCAs
could increase tensions with the power to the East of NATO's border, at
the same time, they have a more cohesive effect between the
parties]{.underline}**. Brandon J. Kinne (2019) hypothesises that when
states favour ties to "partners of partners", it results in a phenomenon
that he refers to as the triadic closure. In terms of DCA networks,
Kinne highlighted that this would mean that country A and B are more
likely to cooperate with each other if they both sign a DCA with a
common country C. Of course, this would require a high degree of trust
between countries A and B in order to push for a closer defence
cooperation. This is where the EDI comes into play as well. **[As a tool
to reassure allies by the increasing US presence in these countries, it
enables the US to indirectly increase military cooperation among
countries, and to upgrade strategic airfields or forward basing
infrastructure in these countries]{.underline}**. [It is also important
to mention that the DCAs are directly connected to the geographical and
geopolitical position of a country]{.underline}. As it was mentioned
before, **[these countries form an imaginary line of defence that is
strengthened by their NATO membership and the bilateral agreement signed
with the US. Since the Trump administration is a vocal advocate of
increasing the share of defencerelated contribution by allies, the DCAs
could be an indirect tool to nudge them in the right
direction]{.underline}**. At the same time, it also means an increase in
the US presence in Central and Eastern Europe that could be perceived as
a threat to Russia. With more countries signing DCAs in the
neighbourhood, the growing number of concerned states would also mean
that eventually the upsetting peace and stability would increase in a
region. Conclusion [The aim of this analysis was to highlight the
important aspects of DCAs in Central and Eastern Europe]{.underline},
and to introduce the uniqueness of the HungarianUS agreement. Firstly,
it aimed to interpret and highlight the subtle differences between the
DCAs of the selected countries while it did seek to point out why
sovereignty was a focal point in each of these negotiations. Secondly,
it revealed the possible implications DCAs could have on the receiving
states' sovereignty and on the geopolitics of the region. [Generally,
there was no single framework under which these agreements could be
placed since they lacked uniformity in their scope and purpose in a
global context]{.underline}. **[However, the Baltic and Eastern European
DCAs were commonly grounded on a thematic setting, by the creation of a
legal framework for stationing US troops in the countries' territory and
for setting the stage for more detailed agreements]{.underline}**.
**[The similarity of the agreements stemmed from the objective that was
here to set the framework for defence- and security-related bilateral
cooperations]{.underline}**. In all the examined agreements, the focal
points, around which the debates revolved, were the movement and access,
the criminal jurisdiction, the ownership, or in the Hungarian case, the
tax exemptions. These are the essential variables that define the
purpose of the treaty from different aspects. Each variable effects the
sovereignty of the receiving states and could impose limitations on the
sending states. At the same time, these variables introduce measures
that dismantle bureaucratic roadblocks which could hinder future
cooperation among the parties. The difference in the level of details
between the Baltic and the Central European DCAs is more striking. The
former ones are more general with less details regarding the taxation,
the environmental safety or the administrative procedures, while the
latter ones put a heavy emphasis on these issues, and even specify the
administrative procedures, the military exercises and permits or
licenses. While these elusive differences are not easy to spot, a single
adjective or phrase can inherently reflect what the receiving states
prioritise on and regard important in case of foreign forces in their
territory. With the conflict of right of jurisdiction on one's own
territory and the law of flag, the agreements challenge the receiving
states' sovereignty. [Furthermore, these agreements are based more on
the absolute than the relative gains]{.underline}. **[Both parties
benefit from the cooperation separately in different
ways]{.underline}**. **[The US is able to enhance its military presence
along the borders of Eastern Europe and to create a logistical network
from the Baltic to the Black Sea, while sending a message of reassurance
to its NATO allies in the region]{.underline}**. **[The other parties
also gain concerning their security in defence, including defence
modernisation, cooperation through investments from the US, and through
the increased number of trainings and exercises]{.underline}**. **[The
defensive posture of these countries is also
strengthened]{.underline}**. **[The increasing number of military
exercises enable the harmonisation of European and US military standards
and systems paving the way for a greater cooperation and deployment
efficiency, as synchronisation and interoperability are becoming crucial
factors]{.underline}**.

**[The 'new' Eastern and Central European members of the Atlantic
Community put more trust into American security guarantees than the

of the latter, the other one is the rather mixed historical experiences

down to the existential threat provided by Russia]{.underline}**
(formerly the Soviet Union). [In parallel with the Eastern and Central
Europeans' continued reliance on U.S. deterrence against Russia's
repeated attempts to regain]{.underline}, at least, some of its
[influence in the region, a number of Western European countries have
been capitalising on having an entended strategic depth against
potential Russian threats, and have shown skepticism and reluctance to
follow the U.S]{.underline}. lead in a number of issues (for instance,
regarding U.S. policies towards Iraq in 2002-2003, see CNN, 2003.)

[It is a market dream to publish a book that would define several months
of frequent discussions in the transatlantic area]{.underline}. [One of
the authors with a great sense for timing is apparently]{.underline}
Robert [Kagan, whose fairly simplistic metaphors became widely discussed
during the first major post-Cold War transatlantic dispute surrounding
the beginning of the war in Iraq]{.underline}.10 **[Kagan's ideas did
not only influence scholars and analysts but determined a context in
which]{.underline}** Donald **[Rumsfeld could express his idea about the
new/old Europe division]{.underline}**. Although these discussions have
been fortunately deeply buried11, **[it should be understood that the
idea of the new Europe is the American geopolitical mirror image to the
Central European Alanticist conception]{.underline}**. [Ironically, this
perspective has appeared to be reflected by the current American
administration that tends to view the Baltic and Central European states
as accomplices of the former Bush's administration]{.underline}. This
became quite apparent from the US treatment of the former Polish foreign
minister Radek Sikorski's candidacy for the post of NATO
Secretary-General. One of the senior Obama administration officials
reportedly commented on his endeavor expressing a belief that "Radek
Sikorski now wishes that he had chosen Brookings over AEI."12 **[The
signs of symbolic diplomacy could be also recognized in other Obama's
moves. For the official commemoration of the outbreak of World War II
organized in Gdansk]{.underline}** on September 1st **[the
administration selected William Perry, a former secretary of defense,
who became known in Central Europe as the staunch opponent of the Polish
NATO membership]{.underline}**. [Finally, president Obama's long awaited
and perhaps postponed announcement about the future of the third pillar
of the American missile defense came]{.underline} on September 17th,
[which is the date of the Soviet invasion to Poland]{.underline} in
1939.13 **[No matter how suspicious one wants to be, these events reveal
a substantial lack of interest at best. It has been already mentioned
that from a broader perspective all Central European countries have a
tendency to emphasize the importance of the transatlantic
link]{.underline}**. **[Indeed, for a substantial part of political
elites as well as intelligentsia the interests of the US have served as
a sufficient legitimization for their own countries' foreign political
attitudes and decisions]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the Alanticist
positions differ in various countries. The following lines will analyze
the Czech and Polish reactions on the two recently important themes of
the transatlantic cooperation. The first will be the Iraqi issue that
has already been mentioned in a context of the new/old Europe split.
Then, the other topic will concern the American plan to build the
components of the third pillar of the ballistic missile defense in the
Czech Republic and Poland.

[**All** of this is being done in order **to punish

produce an **economic crash in Europe**, before this year is

The inevitability now of that economic crash is the clear message which
Jorge [Vilches documents]{.underline} in great detail at the Saker Blog,
on June 18th, [under the headline "No fuels for Europe",
citing]{.underline} as his sources, and linking through to, the Wall

Washington's demands to do what Washington requires them to do in order

not, **[this is going to destroy Europe.]{.underline}** Here is how and

It wasn't mere bravado when Russia's RT News headlined on June 19th "EU
warned of years of high gas prices ahead", and opened: "Gas prices in
the EU will remain high for several more years, Russia's vice-premier
and former energy minister, Aleksander Novak said on Friday, warning of
serious problems across Europe when the autumn-winter period starts."

[This is clearly to be a suffering by the peoples of Europe]{.underline}

the main political parties in Europe are the extents to which they
adhere to their instructions from Washington.

[Europe]{.underline}ans [will]{.underline} now be
[experienc]{.underline}ing [intensifying impoverishment in order for
their **imperial masters** in Washington to be able to **turn the screws
even tighter** against Russia, which they hate so much for not buckling
to the empire]{.underline} (as the rest of Europe has done).

This action against Russia is allegedly being carried out because 'Putin
started the war in Ukraine on 24 February 2022.' But that's a rabid lie.
Obama started the war in Ukraine, in February 2014, to replace Ukraine's
democratically elected and neutralist President, by a rabidly
anti-Russian regime that would then quickly proceed to eliminate the
people in the parts of Ukraine that had voted overwhelmingly for the
Ukrainian leader whom Obama had overthrown (Obama wanted the new,
anti-Russian, regime, to be permanent, 'democratically' permanent). The
coup worked. (The subsequent ethnic cleansing was only partially
successful.)

[The neoconservative]{.underline} (U.S.-imperialist) [American
regime]{.underline} did that --- [**transformed Ukraine** into Russia's
enemy]{.underline}, on Russia's very borders. For example: During
2003-2009, only around 20% of Ukrainians had wanted NATO membership,
while around 55% opposed it. In 2010, Gallup found that whereas 17% of
Ukrainians considered NATO to mean "protection of your country," 40%
said it's "a threat to your country." Ukrainians predominantly saw NATO
as an enemy, not a friend. But after Obama's February 2014 Ukrainian
coup, "Ukraine's NATO membership would get 53.4% of the votes, one third
of Ukrainians (33.6%) would oppose it." However, afterward, the support
averaged around 45% --- still over twice as high as had been the case
prior to the coup.

[Putin]{.underline}, prior to 24 February 2022, had done all he could,
short of [invading Obama's Ukraine]{.underline}, in order [to reverse
what Obama had done.]{.underline} This was [a matter of Russia's
essential national security]{.underline}, in order [to p**revent U.S.
missiles from ultimately becoming placed on Russia's border**,
within]{.underline} only [a **five-minute flying-distance away**
from]{.underline} hitting [Moscow.]{.underline}

The war in [Ukraine]{.underline} certainly didn't start in February
2022. [Overtly]{.underline}, it [started in February 2014.]{.underline}
But, actually, it had started by no later than June 2011, as being in
the planning stages by the Obama regime. That's when what might be WW
III started to be planned. We wouldn't even know about this if Julian
Assange had not told us about it.

[Cutting-off Russia's essential fuel-supplies to Europe is merely a
**continuation of that war**]{.underline}, which was already being
planned by Obama in Washington, by no later than June 2011.
[Obama]{.underline} even [said]{.underline} in 2014 that **[Europe is
"dispensable."]{.underline}** That's the attitude of an imperialist,
toward a colony (or group of colonies). It's [the attitude of America's
rulers, toward their stooge-regimes.]{.underline} The peoples of [Europe
are]{.underline} now [paying the prices]{.underline} for that, [and
those prices will be **sky-high**]{.underline}, as the weather turns
cold. Of course, those leaders will be blaming Putin (for what they
themselves actually did).

7.1 Introduction [Since 1989, Central Europe]{.underline}1 [has seen
substantial reforms, which included its countries' membership in the
European Union]{.underline} (EU) [and]{.underline} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}), which signalled a posture on
its part in which they distanced themselves from decades of
subordination to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, [in the Russian
Federation, a strong regime has been consolidating in order to reassert
the Russian Federation's status in a post-Soviet context.
This]{.underline} process, of course, [includes the redefinition of the
official Russian politics towards]{.underline} its (new) neighbourhood,
including [Central Europe.]{.underline} [Looking at the interconnections
that resulted from post-Cold War developments]{.underline}, the
[fo]{.underline}reign [po]{.underline}licy [changes]{.underline} that
have taken place [in Central Europe]{.underline} and the Russian
Federation [have allowed for]{.underline} the [distinct
dynamics]{.underline} that this chapter seeks to explore. It starts by
setting down the evolving context of Russian foreign policy. It looks at
the definition of [Russia's multi-vectoral]{.underline}2 [and pragmatic
policy and]{.underline} the [strengthening of]{.underline} the
[multipolar international order]{.underline} as two factors that
constitute the main axis for understanding the projection of Russia's
goals in its neighbouring areas. The analysis of [the Russian
Federation]{.underline}'s relations with Central European states is then
[pursue]{.underline}d in [the broader framing of the integration
processes of]{.underline} these [countries in NATO]{.underline} and the
EU, and the Russian Federation's own shaping of relations with these
multilateral organizations. The analysis follows the identification of
three factors that are central to the understanding of the Russian
Federation's policies towards Central Europe: [the course of political
reform and institutional capacity building; the **redefinition** of
**security** and **defence** **alignments**]{.underline} after the end
of the Warsaw Pact and the Cold War rivalry; [and energy
security]{.underline} as an essential factor in the redefinition of
relations. [These factors]{.underline} highlight different approaches to
common issues, [suggest]{.underline}ing [the need for a careful
management of challenges and opportunities]{.underline}, as will be
analysed later in the chapter. The chapter argues that, despite
difficulties at both the level of the EU--Russian Federation and
NATO--Russia relations and the bilateral level of Russia's relations
with Central European countries, the current state of affairs points to
an increased trend in cooperation between the Russian Federation and
Central Europe. It should be noted, however, that this cooperative trend
does not do away with the Cold War rhetoric, which is still very much
present (as will be shown below); [**traditional 'issues'** still play a
considerable role in the shaping and making of policies and actions both
in the **Russian Federation** and in **Central European**
states]{.underline}. 7.2 Russian Federation foreign policy:
multi-vectoral and pragmatic The first post-Cold War decade allowed for
a clarification of the Russian Federation's foreign policy objectives
which resulted from various adjustments that the process of transition
from Soviet times demanded. In the proWestern context of the period
after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, President Boris Yeltsin
proclaimed the Russian Federation as a natural ally of Europe and
pursued Russia's integration into European institutions on the basis of
the belief, as expressed by the first Russian foreign minister Andrei
Kozyrev, that there were 'neither potential adversaries nor military
threats to Russian interests' in Europe (Thorun 2009: 29). This posture
also implied an inward-driven approach towards the domestic transition
process in which relations with the former satellites to the West were
not prioritized. 'The story of relations between Russia and the
East-Central European countries in the nineties was the story of
Russia's departure from the region' (P칩ti 2007: 118). During the second
term of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, in the face of the Central European
states' integration into Euro-Atlantic structures, the Russian
Federation's policy has evolved from one of 'indifference' to one of
'engagement'. Many [concerns were voiced in the **Russian**
**Federation** regarding]{.underline} the impact of [expanding NATO
towards its borders, including concerns about the status and protection
of borders in the face of an **alliance** that, according to Russian
sources, had transformed itself from a **defensive** into an **offensive
alliance**]{.underline} (Yugoslavia in 1995 and 1999) (Karaganov 2011:
7; Krastev et al. 2009: 57). Also, [there was the predicted economic
impact]{.underline} that [the membership of]{.underline} the [Central
Europe]{.underline}an countries in the EU [was expected to have on the
Russian economy, which would consist of a decrease in trade]{.underline}
indicators [along with new formalities that would have implications for
the openness of the Central European markets to Russian
products]{.underline}.3 Arguably, though, [the NATO enlargement is a
**much more delicate issue** for Russian foreign
policymakers]{.underline}.

As [the West **scrambles** to maintain its united front against Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, the European Union (EU) member states
of **[Central]{.underline}** and Eastern **[Europe]{.underline}** have
[**led** the way]{.underline} as [some of the continent's loudest moral
voices, sending **arms** and **humanitarian** **aid** to Ukraine while
receiving **streams** of **refugees**.]{.underline}

But while neighboring [Poland has]{.underline} perhaps [been most
visible]{.underline}---[hosting]{.underline} both US President Joe
[Biden and]{.underline} Vice President Kamala [Harris]{.underline} in
recent weeks [while absorbing more than **two million
refugees**]{.underline}---geography isn't the only factor that
determines who is a frontline state.

Take [the **Czech Republic**]{.underline}, for example: [Though nestled
in the heart of Europe and away from the EU's eastern
border]{.underline}, its new government---[together with the three
Baltic countries, **Poland**, and the United
Kingdom]{.underline}---[**spearheaded** **weapons** **delivery** for
Ukrainians when most EU member states were still **hesitating**. It is
also now home to around **200,000 Ukrainian refugees**]{.underline}.

So when Prime Minister Petr Fiala---along with his Polish and Slovenian
counterparts, Mateusz Morawiecki and Janez Jan코a,
respectively---traveled to Kyiv earlier this month to visit Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it wasn't just a powerful symbolic
gesture[. It was also a reflection of the region's **growing clout** as
a bridge between **Brussels** and **Kyiv**.]{.underline}

I spoke to Tom치코 Pojar, Fiala's chief foreign-affairs adviser, who
accompanied the delegation to Kyiv. Below are six major takeaways I
distilled from our conversation---which can be also read as a guideline
for Europe's next steps for engagement toward Ukraine.

Europe's most important task is to continue providing Ukraine with
military support, especially anti-tank and -aircraft weapons. Quantity
and time matter here, and the coming weeks are likely to be decisive in
the war. Ukrainians are committed, but can't defeat the Russian military
without Western support. [Moscow needs to understand that **Europe**
stands firmly behind **Ukraine**, ready to provide what is needed to
wreck Russian President Vladimir **Putin's plans**]{.underline}. If
[Ukraine]{.underline} is properly equipped with more anti-aircraft
weaponry, it [can]{.underline} even [create something akin to its own
version of a no-fly zone (without]{.underline}, of course, achieving
[NATO-aided air superiority]{.underline}). Indeed, something similar is
already happening in parts of the country's airspace, where [**Russian
planes** and **helicopters** dare not enter]{.underline}. Military
support is critical to any prospects for meaningful negotiation; [if
Putin sees the West hesitating, he is likely to press his advantage on
the battlefield for quite some time]{.underline}.

Europe must also continue pushing for stronger sanctions against the
Kremlin, as [efforts]{.underline} thus far [seem]{.underline} to be
[quite effective]{.underline}. There are [many options still available
to the EU]{.underline}---not least in the field of energy---but as some
member states call for restraint, [the immediate task is to close
loopholes, such as]{.underline} those [facilitating sanctions evasion
through third-party entities]{.underline}. And if needed, [a sixth or
even seventh sanctions package should be on the table]{.underline}. The
key is to [remember that continuing to do **business** with **Russia**
enables]{.underline} the [Kremlin to **finance** its war]{.underline},
thus creating a further burden that Europe will need to carry in the
future---from accepting more refugees to paying for the stabilization
and reconstruction of a devastated Ukraine.

Ukraine needs a plan to rebuild. Beyond the immediate humanitarian needs
of the Ukrainian people, Europe must already start thinking about
postwar reconstruction. Even if we still don't have a clear picture of
the final scale of the wreckage (or even the final geographic extent of
the country), an aid package on the scale of the Marshall Plan will
likely be needed. At their summit in Brussels, European leaders
discussed an EU recovery fund for Ukraine similar to one set up in 2020
amid the pandemic. The EU should organize a donor conference with NATO
and partners from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development. France, as the head of the European Council through the end
of June, should start laying the groundwork now, to be continued by the
Czech Republic when it takes over the rotating presidency later this
year. The success of the reconstruction could, in turn, showcase the
value of liberal democracy---especially if a new Iron Curtain falls
across Europe.

Kyiv must attain a meaningful framework for cooperation with the West,
even though Ukraine's entry into NATO seems unlikely. By now, it's clear
that Ukraine deserves EU candidacy; yet accession is a long process with
many political and administrative hoops to jump through. While
Ukrainians must understand that there are no shortcuts, Kyiv should
still get something soon. That's why the European Union needs to invent
a fast-track special partnership for Ukraine as part of the bloc's
overall reinvention for the post-post-Cold War period. But this new
format needs to be credible: The effects of a protracted EU accession
process are already on display in the Western Balkans, where countries
have started searching for alternative patrons while backsliding on
their reforms.

Europe should offer asylum and humanitarian protection to Russian
soldiers ready to surrender. Today, those who don't want to fight their
Ukrainian neighbors face three awful options: death, captivity in
Ukraine, or a harsh prison sentence in Russia. Europe needs to offer an
alternative, something similar to temporary humanitarian asylum. Such
proposals would be more appealing to young soldiers than to officers,
and even in the best-case scenario, the number who would avail
themselves of the opportunity won't be in the thousands. But even
hundreds matter: It represents a powerful humanitarian gesture---a hand
extended to a demoralized Russian military.

The positive impact of the three prime ministers' trip to Kyiv
underscores the importance of having a diplomatic presence on the
ground. Any EU member states that withdrew their diplomatic corps from
Ukraine should consider sending them back to Kyiv. This is not just a
gesture of solidarity: I was stationed in war-torn Syria when Damascus
was shelled daily between 2013-2015, and while diplomatic work was
difficult, it was still possible---and very much worthwhile. The picture
we got on the ground was different and far more nuanced from the
mediated images the rest of the world was getting. In Syria, the West
left for good political reasons; in Ukraine, it should return as soon as
possible.

Is the East the new West?

As Ivan Kravstev and Stephen Holmes noted in their 2019 book The Light
that Failed, Eastern Europe had been mostly imitating the West since
1989. In the post-Cold War period, the chief aim in the East was to
become---politically, economically, and socially---the new West. It was
a mostly one-way stream of influence.

But now that's partly changing. [The countries of **Central** and
Eastern **Europe** are becoming more **relevant** and **inspiring**, as
their once-hardline stance on **Russia** is becoming increasingly
**mainstream**]{.underline}.

[Consider]{.underline}---in parallel to the Czech takeaways from
Kyiv---[Morawiecki's recently published **ten**-**point** **plan** to
"save" Ukraine. He focuses mainly on **restrictive** **measures**
against Russia and proposes **concrete** **steps** that can be
implemented almost immediately. They include, among other options,
cutting off all Russian banks from SWIFT, **blocking Russian ships**
from **EU ports**, **suspending** **visas** for all Russians, and a
**total** **ban** on the export of **technologies** that can be used for
war.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine has forced Central Europe to move with caution due to Russia's aggression -- they're not moving closer to Russia.

WARSAW --- The symbolism was striking. On March 12, two weeks into
Russia's brutal bombardment of Ukraine, the leaders of France and
Germany held a joint call with President Vladimir Putin. Just days
later, [**three** prime ministers]{.underline} from post-Communist
Europe --- [Polish, Czech and Slovenian --- traveled to Kyiv by train,
despite the **danger**]{.underline}.

[This divergence exposed a **sharp divide** in how Eastern and Western
NATO member states view the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. For Western
countries, not least the United States, the conflict is a disaster for
the people of Ukraine --- but one whose biggest danger is that it might
spill over the Ukrainian border, setting off a global conflict.

[For **Central** and Eastern **European** countries]{.underline}, it's
rather different. [These neighbors of Russia tend to see the war not as
a singular event but as a process]{.underline}. To these post-Soviet
states, [the invasion of Ukraine appears as a next step in a whole
series of Russia's nightmarish assaults on other countries, dating back
to]{.underline} the ruthless attacks on [Chechnya and]{.underline} the
war with [Georgia]{.underline}. To them, [it seems foolhardy to
assume]{.underline} Mr. [Putin]{.underline} [will stop at Ukraine. The
danger is **pressing** and **immediate**]{.underline}.

While the West believes it must prevent World War III, [the East thinks
that]{.underline}, whatever the name given to the conflict, [the war
against liberal democratic values, institutions and lifestyles has
already started]{.underline}. Both positions have merit. But Mr.
[Biden's visit to Poland]{.underline} on Friday, a day after an
emergency NATO summit, [is a vital opportunity to forge a common
understanding]{.underline}. Both sides, West and East, must present a
united front against Russian aggression. The alternative is disarray and
destruction.

[At the root of the divide is **history**]{.underline}. Across
centuries, Central and Eastern Europe have experienced the chilling
effects of Russian imperialism. From czarist Russia to the Soviet Union,
[many countries through the region had their **independence stamped
out**, their societies **oppressed** and their **cultures**
**marginalized**]{.underline}. The trauma caused by the cyclical loss of
territory and statehood is one of the most important elements of
collective identity across the region.

[Many Central and Eastern Europeans share]{.underline} an anxious [sense
of themselves, a **nervous sovereignty**. Their
independence]{.underline}, restored with such great effort after 1989,
[could easily be lost again]{.underline}, as the 20th century proved all
too painfully. [In the tragic fate of Ukraine]{.underline}, and earlier
of Chechnya and Georgia, [they see not only their own traumatic past but
also their **possible future**]{.underline}. "We will be next" is the
phrase on many lips.

In this febrile atmosphere, [NATO's cautious steps look to many
**Central** and Eastern **Europeans** like an **echo** of the **phony
war**]{.underline} of 1939, when France and Britain undertook only
limited military actions and did not save their eastern ally, Poland. At
that time, too, [horrible stories from bombed Warsaw and other cities
filled the media.]{.underline} Yet the allies were determined not to be
drawn in too deeply. Their military inaction temporarily delayed the
spread of the war across the globe, but did not stop it.

[The U.S. will **station** its first **permanent forces** on NATO\'s
Eastern flank]{.underline}, U.S. [Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III
announced Wednesday, as **fears** mount over a **potential war** between
Russia and the 30-member alliance.]{.underline}

In a Twitter thread detailing several new commitments from U.S.
President Joe Biden to bolster security in Europe, [Austin said that the
V Corps Headquarters Forward Command Post, an Army garrison headquarters
and a field support **battalion** will be stationed in **Poland**, which
shares a border with **non-NATO member Russia**.]{.underline}

\"[These forces]{.underline} -- [the first permanent U.S. forces on
NATO\'s Eastern Flank]{.underline} -- [will improve our **command**
**and** **control** capabilities, **interoperability** with NATO, and
management of prepositioned equipment]{.underline},\" the Defense
Department said in an accompanying fact sheet. \"[This action builds on
the **central role** Poland has played in **supporting** NATO\'s combat
**credible** **deterrence** and **defense** **posture**]{.underline}."

Officials such as Russian President Vladimir [**Putin** and]{.underline}
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry [**Peskov** have issued warnings in recent
months against **NATO** **expansion** or perceived threats from the
alliance]{.underline} that [they say could endanger Russia\'s
security]{.underline}, even as their own country continues its
monthslong assault on Ukraine.

T[he new European security commitments from Biden that Austin announced
on Wednesday]{.underline}, as well as NATO\'s invitation for Sweden and
Finland to join its ranks, [might further fuel Russia\'s **ire** and
**feelings of vulnerability** against the alliance]{.underline}.

[Putin has cited the prospect of NATO expansion as one of his reasons
for justifying the war in Ukraine]{.underline}, though the move seemed
to backfire when Sweden and Finland announced their intention to join
the alliance after Russia\'s invasion. [Russia has also **warned**
against any **direct** **NATO** **involvement** in the war, and taken
issue with the **weapons** and **supplies** some member countries have
funneled into Ukraine]{.underline}.

Mikhail [Khodorkovsky, a self-exiled Russian oligarch and Kremlin
critic, warned]{.underline} during an interview with the
France-headquartered television network Euronews last month [that Putin
could **eventually wage war** on **NATO** if Ukraine does not
win]{.underline} the current war. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky warned in a video address to NATO\'s summit in Madrid this week
that Putin\'s aggression could spread beyond Ukraine\'s borders and into
a NATO country within a year.

[Despite]{.underline} the prospect of [Russian aggression]{.underline},
some of [NATO\'s recent actions indicate that the alliance is not shying
from bolstering its own strength and assisting Ukraine.]{.underline}

[NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday that the number
of NATO troops on high readiness will increase more than
**sevenfold**]{.underline}, the [largest boost since the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. He also said that [NATO members will agree on a
\"**strengthened assistance package**\" for Ukraine that includes
**anti-drone systems** and **secure communication**.]{.underline}

[China's concerns have been **clear** this week, as]{.underline} its
Foreign Ministry pushed back on the NATO designation in regular
scheduled press briefings. "China pursues an independent foreign policy
of peace. It does not interfere in other countries' internal affairs or
export ideology, still less engage in long-arm jurisdiction, economic
coercion or unilateral sanctions. How could China be labeled a 'systemic
challenge'?" ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday. "We
solemnly urge NATO to immediately stop spreading false and provocative
statements against China," he said, adding that NATO should "stop
seeking to disrupt Asia and the whole world after it has disrupted
Europe." But [that rhetoric -- blaming NATO for "disruption" in Europe
-- is part of what is driving a **shift** in **European
perspectives**]{.underline}, analysts say, [as Beijing has **refused**
to **condemn** Russia's actions in Ukraine]{.underline}, including the
killing of civilians, [while actively blaming the US and NATO for
provoking Moscow. China "very **quickly** and very clearly **lined**
itself up]{.underline} -- at least in words, not so much in deeds --
[with Russia]{.underline}," while transatlantic partners came together
against Russia and in support of Ukraine in the wake of the invasion,
said Pepijn Bergsen, a research fellow in the Europe Program at the
Chatham House think tank in London. [The contrast between the two has
helped drive an emerging "**democracies** **versus** **autocracies**"
narrative]{.underline} in Europe, he said, adding that [internal
politics also play a role]{.underline}. "[In]{.underline} Eastern and
[Central Europe, where Russia is regarded as]{.underline} by far the
number one [security threat, relations]{.underline} (with China) [had
already been starting to fray, but the fact that China so **clearly
lined up** with Russia has **accelerated** a **shift**]{.underline},"
Bergsen said. [China]{.underline}, for its part, [appears to have
underestimated the extent to which its stance would **reverberate**
through its relationship with Europe, one]{.underline} that was [already
on shaky ground following European concerns over alleged human rights
abuses in **Xinjiang**, erosion of **freedoms** in Hong Kong and China's
economic targeting of Lithuania over the **Baltic nation**'s relations
with Taiwan]{.underline}.

### 2AC -- Cyber Thumper

#### NATO has [already increased]{.underline} cybersecurity defense with Ukraine -- thumps the DA.

In response to the Russian threat, [there have been **unprecedented
efforts** by private and government entities]{.underline} -- and even
individuals -- [to support Ukraine's cyber resilience.]{.underline}

[Responding to cyber]{.underline}-attacks [and building national cyber
resilience]{.underline} has never been -- and will never be -- the sole
responsibility of governments. It [require]{.underline}s [a
**whole-of-society approach** grounded in international
cooperation]{.underline} efforts. For the first time since its
inception, [the EU rapid cyber response team, with capabilities to
detect and respond to a variety of threats, and headed by Lithuania, was
**deployed** to help defend against **cyber-attacks** targeting
Ukraine]{.underline}. The [Romania]{.underline}n national cybersecurity
agency [and]{.underline} a cybersecurity company called [Bitdefender
launched a public-private partnership to provide pro bono **technical
support** and threat intelligence]{.underline} to Ukraine's government,
businesses and citizens for "as long as it is necessary". [**NATO**,
which has been working for]{.underline} a number of [years with Ukraine
to increase its **cyber** **defences**, signed an agreement a few weeks
before the **invasion** aimed at enhancing **cyber cooperation** with
Ukraine.]{.underline}

[The tech community leveraged]{.underline} its [**resources** and
**knowledge** to expose cyber-attacks and threats, and limit their
spread]{.underline}. Shortly [after WhisperGate]{.underline}, [Microsoft
shared tech]{.underline}nical [analysis on]{.underline} the [**tools**
and **techniques** used in the attack and recommendations for those
affected]{.underline}, and it continues to do so. The Slovakia-based
cybersecurity firm [ESET exposed the nefarious component of the
HermeticWiper malware attacks]{.underline} in February, a malware
designed with a component aimed at "wiping" the data out of systems.
This timely technical analysis provided vital information to security
experts and governments about the technical steps that should be put in
place to mitigate and protect against hacks.

At the same time, efforts within Ukraine started to materialise. In what
has been referred to as an unprecedented effort in the midst of an armed
conflict, a whole "IT army" of volunteers was assembled in response to a
request by the minister of digital transformation to support the
country's cyber-defence efforts, with reports of some even operating
from within bomb shelters.

[The **solidarity** shown so far is **unprecedented** and a testament to
the **benefits** and potential of **collective action** across sectors

Ambassador Brix, [February 24]{.underline}, 2022 [marked a change in
Europe\'s relations with Russia]{.underline}. Before that, [there was a
period of economic integration and a hope for **peaceful, prosperous**
neighbourly relations. This hope seems to have been
**destroyed**]{.underline}. How do you see the further development of
Europe\'s relations with Russia?

February 24 was a decisive turning point in the relations between Europe
and Russia. [The reason]{.underline} for this [was that it marked the
destruction of the hope that through **close cooperation** -- between
universities, civil society, but also economic partners -- we could
achieve a reasonable relationship between **Russia** and **Europe**. The
war of **aggression** is proof]{.underline} that [one side does not want
that]{.underline}. Therefore, we have to assume that a rather
impenetrable new wall is being created here in Europe between Russia and
the rest of Europe. And this also raises the question: [what does this
mean for **Central Europe**, for those states that are relatively recent
members of the European Union, that have had decades of experience with
**communism**, with the Soviet Union? To what extent have these
countries]{.underline} now [become a region]{.underline} in Europe [that
can]{.underline}, on the one hand, [help us to understand what\'s going
on; and]{.underline} on the other hand, actually [help us defend what
**European values** are]{.underline}?

Apart from Central and Eastern Europe, you were also stationed in Russia
as a diplomat, so can you assess what this ultimately means for Russia
too?

The war is a decisive turning point for the Russian side as well. [It is
to be expected that the result of this war will be a weak, isolated
Russia -- both politically and economically, but also in terms of
**cultural** and **scientific** links]{.underline}. It is true that
[many people are trying to maintain contacts as far as possible -- and
rightly so, as far as they are not politically driven -- but this will
only be partially successful, and we can expect to see even **stronger
nationalism** on the Russian side]{.underline}. The leadership in the
Kremlin in Moscow has decided to stake everything on this approach:
isolation, military strength and strong control of its own population.
Apparently, it accepts that this will bring disadvantages for the
Russian population as a whole.

What is driving Russia, and are official Russia and the Russian
population on the same page?

For years now, only the official depiction of what drives
[Russia]{.underline} and what its interests are has existed. Everything
that we understand by the term "civil society" has been systematically
dismantled and banned in recent years. If you ask me what arguments the
official leadership uses, they [see the West as an **ideological enemy**
that no longer upholds anything that remains in terms of traditional
values]{.underline}. And official [Russia casts itself as the preserver
of traditional values -- family, religion, gender roles -- and this is
currently supported by a **majority** of the Russian
population]{.underline}; the polls are quite clear on that. But this
strong focus on a \'different civilization\', a different worldview, is
certainly not undisputed in Russia. Too much has happened since the
Soviet Union in terms of modernization, opening up, and scientific
contacts. Many people have emigrated in the wake of February 24, but
many are still there. In order to avoid putting themselves in danger,
they have to stand back and wait a bit to see what can be done publicly.
However, we have opportunities to continue to work together on both
sides here. Science and culture in particular are predestined to do
this. In the long term, we need this contact -- for historical,
cultural, geographical and human reasons.

Does this mean that calls to break off academic relations and expel
Russian cultural workers are actually the wrong way to go, and these
channels should remain open?

We should maintain contacts on the cultural and scientific level as much
as possible. However, certainly not with those who have been in
solidarity with the Kremlin\'s policy explicitly and for a long time. I
am very much in favour of us taking a clear position here. That is
actually what everyone in Europe has done. Even we at the Diplomatic
Academy have suspended official contact with the leading Russian
academy. Nevertheless, we did not send the Russian students home.

Europe has shown itself to be quick and surprisingly united in its
support of Ukraine. However, there are fault lines too now; there is
disagreement even among the Visegr치d states. Do you see the danger of a
split due to these fault lines?

I would put it positively: it is actually a miracle that we have so far
managed to get far-reaching sanctions packages against Russia, against
this war, off the ground with relatively little discussion. It\'s a real
miracle that we\'ve managed to get arms financing through a resolution
in the European Union. So there\'s a lot of positives here. I think that
[perceptions of Poland, for example, which have been very **negative**
in recent years, are **changing** as we see how they deal with
**refugees** from **Ukraine**]{.underline}. Or think about
[Lithuania]{.underline}. They were the [first European state that not
only recognized the energy dependence on Russian oil and gas, but also
did]{.underline} something about it by [build]{.underline}ing [an LNG
terminal in 2014 to provide]{.underline} exactly [this **alternative**
to Russian gas]{.underline}, and today they are a role model with that.
And [it's a **Central European** state]{.underline} that has done this,
not one of the rich Western European states. That means there are very
many positive contributions that Central European states are making in
this dangerous situation.

At the same time, however, we also have Central European states that
tend to put on the brakes -- and in some cases only because of economic
considerations.

[In a state of emergency]{.underline}, as [this war is for]{.underline}
a region like [Central Europe, it is]{.underline} very
[understandable]{.underline} that [you look at your national situation
first. In **Austria**]{.underline}, we say that [security of supply is
the most important thing as far as energy issues are
concerned]{.underline}. The [Hungarians say that **national**
**patriotic** **unity** must not be endangered]{.underline} and that we
have to look after our minorities in Ukraine. So [each of the Central
European countries is directly affected]{.underline}, and most of them
are [more]{.underline} affected [than Portugal, Spain or
France]{.underline}. This means you have to understand that the
situation is really different. I don\'t think that the political climate
of opinion at the moment sees the Central European region as having a
destructive role. On the contrary, I believe that people are now
beginning to understand what the historical experience of these [Central
Europeans]{.underline}, who for decades were largely under the Soviet
yoke, actually means. Because this didn't just mean that they [had to
orient themselves]{.underline} symbolically towards the East, but that
they had to orient themselves [with pipelines and other energy supplies
towards this direction and make themselves **dependent**]{.underline}.
After all, this was not a voluntary decision in many states. And I think
[it is a **positive contribution** to European **solidarity**
that]{.underline} these [Central European states now have to engage much
more intensively with the question of how they stand between the West
and the East]{.underline}.

Does that mean that this situation also offers an opportunity?

Absolutely, [it]{.underline} also [offers an
**opportunity**]{.underline}. I\'m calling my presentation in the
upcoming panel discussion, \'Is Russia again the tragedy of Central
Europe?\' because this title is from an essay by Milan
[Kundera]{.underline} from 1984. In this essay, he [describes how
dangerous Russia can be]{.underline}, but in the end it\'s not about
Russia at all. It\'s about the fact that [on the European side, nobody
is willing to stand up for European values anymore]{.underline}; that
the [Central Europeans talk about Europe, especially]{.underline} the
[dissidents]{.underline} [before]{.underline} the end of [the Soviet
Union]{.underline}, while in (editor's note: Western) Europe these
European values are no longer talked about.

BRUSSELS --- [Russian and Ukrainian **negotiators met** on Wednesday in
an increasingly desperate effort to release huge stores of **grain**
blocked by Russian warships, yielding what the U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations secretary general [called **"a ray of
hope"**]{.underline} but no formal agreement [that could **alleviate**
rising **world hunger.**]{.underline}

[Wednesday's meeting]{.underline}, held in Istanbul with U.N.
representatives and military officials from Russia, Ukraine and Turkey,
[had **raised hopes** for a breakthrough. It ended with
**progress**]{.underline}, the U.N. official said, [but no comprehensive
deal.]{.underline}

["This was a first meeting, the progress was **extremely encouraging.**
We hope]{.underline} that [the next steps will allow us to come to a
**formal agreement,"**]{.underline} said Ant칩nio Guterres, the secretary
general, speaking to reporters in New York after the one-and-a-half hour
meeting ended.

["We still need a lot of **good will** by all parties,"]{.underline} he
said, adding, ["More technical work will now be **needed** to
materialize today's progress, but the **momentum is

Hulusi Akar, the Turkish defense minister who hosted the talks, said
that Ukrainian and Russian [negotiators would meet again]{.underline} in

interviews, more than half a dozen officials directly involved or
briefed on the plans cited obstacles to an agreement that ranged from
the mundane to the downright "Mission Impossible."

Grain Routes Out of Ukraine

[Proposed **alternatives**, such as moving the grain overland or through
the Danube River, have been deemed too **slow**]{.underline}, cumbersome
[and **small-scale**, given that more than **22 million tons** of grain
are **trapped** in Odesa and other Black Sea ports blockaded by Russian
warships.]{.underline}

[Failing to move the grain from ports and silos could]{.underline} begin
to [hamper the **summer harvest**, leaving farmers **no place** to
**store fresh crops.**]{.underline}

[The war in Ukraine is already adding to a **global food crisis** that

BRUSSELS, June 23 (Reuters) - [The European Union should stop adding
sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine and instead push for a
**ceasefire** and the start of **negotiations**]{.underline}, a senior
aide to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Thursday.

Speaking on the sidelines of a summit of EU leaders which granted
Ukraine the status of a candidate to become a member of the EU, [the
aide said the **more sanctions** the EU adopted the **more they hurt**
the bloc, while **Russia survived.**]{.underline}

\"At the end of the day [Europe will be on the losing side of this war
because of the **economic problems.** Our recommendation would be that
we should **stop** the **sanction process,\"**]{.underline} Balazs
Orban, not related to the prime minister, told Reuters in an interview.

[Hungary is]{.underline} one of the most pro-Russian EU countries,
[heavily dependent on Russian gas and oil.]{.underline} Russia is also
building a nuclear reactor for Hungary. Budapest had held up the latest
package of sanctions against Moscow that included a ban on Russian oil
imports until it negotiated an exemption for itself.

[\"Right now what we experience is that the **more sanctions** we
accept, the **worse shape** we are in. And the Russians? Yes, it hurts
them as well, but they survive. And what is even worse, they **proceed
in Ukraine,\"**]{.underline} Balazs Orban said.

[Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} on Feb.
24, [the]{.underline} 27-nation [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion has [agreed on six packages of
sanctions]{.underline} that include asset freezes and visa bans on
Russian oligarchs and officials, export controls, freezing central bank
assets, disconnecting banks from the SWIFT messaging system and a ban on
imports of Russian coal and oil.

But some [officials argue that individual oligarchs can live without
some of their yachts or Western villas]{.underline}, have probably
already moved liquid assets outside the EU and export controls might be
circumvented by China and others.

[The freeze on the Russian central bank reserves is made less painful by
the billions of dollars Russia gets every day for its oil and
gas]{.underline} still flowing to Europe, they say. Once the EU stops
buying Russian oil next year, the crude can be sold and shipped by
tankers to China or India, some officials say.

Others argue the sanctions are working, but it will take time before
their full impact on the Russian economy shows.

[Orban]{.underline}, however, [said the EU should change its
tactics.]{.underline}

[\"We reached a point when we realise that we followed the strategy for
four months, we have some achievements, but if it continues like this,
according to reasonable thinking, it will end up in a **bad** way for
**Europe.**]{.underline} So we have to think about something.
[Negotiations, ceasefire, peace. **Diplomacy**. That\'s our
**solution,\"**]{.underline} Orban said.

Food insecurity in Africa [As the war in Ukraine affects **global food
security**]{.underline}; nevertheless, [Africa is the **worst
impacted.**]{.underline} Globally, Russia and Ukraine are key commodity
producers; but, as a result of the war, global commodity prices have
skyrocketed, notably for oil and natural gas. [Russia and Ukraine
account for up to 30% of world wheat exports]{.underline} (Ashby &
Mutah, 2022). [The war has increased food shortages, blocked global
wheat supply, and forced the price raise of food, particularly in
African nations that rely on Russia and Ukraine, this should serve as a
**wake-up call**]{.underline} (IMF,2022; World Bank, 2022; Ashby &
Mutah, 2022). The contribution of these two nations to agriculture is
enormous; nevertheless, [the conflict has **reduced** worldwide
**fertilizer** supplies, resulting in low yields]{.underline} (WTO,
2022). Sacko and Mayaki (2022), declare that [Russia and Ukraine, both
known as the world\'s **breadbasket**]{.underline}, are important actors
in the sale of wheat and sunflower to Africa. North Africa (Algeria,
Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia), Nigeria in West Africa, Ethiopia
and Sudan in East Africa, and South Africa account for 80 percent of
wheat imports. [Wheat consumption in Africa is expected to reach **76.5
million tonnes** by 2025, with 48.3 million tonnes, or 63.4 percent,
imported from outside the continent.]{.underline} According to (UN,
2022; Ashby, and Mutah, 2022), Africa bought \$4 billion in agricultural
items from Russia and \$3 billion from Ukraine, respectively. [Due to
the fighting, over **20 million** people in the Sahel and West African
regions **lack** access to adequate **food**]{.underline} (UN, 2022;
Ashby & Mutah, 2022). Ashby and Mutah (2022), avow that some African
nations, notably Senegal, Cameroon, Kenya, and Ghana, rely substantially
on importing phosphorus and potassium fertilizer from Russia. However,
[as a result of the heavy **economic sanctions** imposed on Russia,
Russia\'s capacity to sell **fertilizer** abroad has
**plummeted.**]{.underline} In this view, the World Trade Organization
(2022), avers that 35 African nations buy food, and 22 import fertilizer
from Ukraine, Russia, or both. [Some people rely significantly on both
nations for critical **necessities** like wheat.]{.underline} Because of
the war, Ukraine\'s ports remain closed, preventing existing grain
supplies from being exported, and in the absence of a quick truce that
allows farmers to return to fields, the interruption to spring planting
will drastically reduce future production. [Africa and the Middle East
are the most susceptible regions since they rely on Ukraine and/or
Russia for more than half of their cereal requirements]{.underline}
(WTO, 2022). Ellyatt (2022), also asserts that [with the conflict in
Ukraine, global food security is **jeopardized.**]{.underline} Russia
and Ukraine export more than 60 percent of the world\'s sunflower oil
production. Because these two countries produce over 70 percent of
global agricultural commodities, [any disruption in supply affects
**pricing.** Sub-Saharan Africa is caught in the **crossfire** of this
conflict because the region\'s governments are yet to deal with the
shocks of the destruction of Covid-19]{.underline} (Ibid). According to
records, 85 percent of the region\'s grains, primarily wheat, are
imported from Europe, with one-third coming from Russia and Ukraine.
[The result is that **tensions in the region will rise** as food prices
soar high (Ibid).]{.underline}

#### Peace is possible BUT it requires a suspension of action that may escalate the conflict

UkraineWar,\" Just World Educational,
https://justworldeducational.org/2022/07/a-european-call-for-an-end-to-the-ukraine-war/

[Europe faces the task of **restoring** and securing peace on the
continent. This requires the development of a strategy to end the
Russian **war in Ukraine** as soon as possible. Ukraine has been able to
defend itself against Russia's brutal war of aggression for three and a
half months now, partially thanks to massive economic sanctions and
military support from Europe and the United States. However, the longer
this support continues, the less clear it becomes **which goals** are
being pursued with it. A Ukrainian victory]{.underline} with the
recapture of all occupied territories, including the Donezk and Luhansk
oblasts and Crimea, [is]{.underline} considered
[unrealistic]{.underline} by most military experts, [given
Russia's]{.underline} military [superiority and ability to]{.underline}
further [escalate]{.underline} militarily[. Al]{.underline}l western
[countries]{.underline} that provide military support to Ukraine
[must]{.underline} therefore [ask]{.underline} themselves [what
their]{.underline} precise [goal is]{.underline} and whether (and for
how long) arms deliveries continue to be the right course of action.
[Continuing the war with the aim of Ukraine's complete victory over
Russia means that thousands more victims will die for a purpose that
does not seem realistic.]{.underline} Moreover, the consequences of the
war are no longer limited to Ukraine. [Its continuation is causing
massive humanitarian, economic, and environmental distress around the
world. Rapidly rising prices, energy and food shortages have already led
to unrest in many countries. Fertilizer shortages will have a global
impact if the war lasts beyond the fall. High casualty rates, many
deaths from hunger and disease and destabilization of the global
situation are to be expected. Warnings of these dramatic consequences
are also being issued at the international political level (G7,
UN).]{.underline} All western countries must stand united against
Russia's aggression in Ukraine and further revanchist claims. However,
**[prolonging the war in Ukraine]{.underline}** is not the solution. The
current developments surrounding rail transit to the Russian exclave of
Kaliningrad and Putin's announcement to deliver nuclear-capable missile
[systems to Belarus, show]{.underline} that the danger of [escalation is
increasing]{.underline}. [The western countries must do anything they
can to ensure that the war parties reach a negotiated settlement as soon
as possible. This alone can prevent years of a war of attrition with its
fatal local and global consequences, as well as a military escalation
that could lead to the use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
[Negotiations does not mean **a surrender** of Ukraine]{.underline}, as
is sometimes assumed. A dictated [peace by Putin is **not an
option**]{.underline}. The international community must do everything it
can to create conditions under which negotiations are possible at all.
This includes a declaration that the Western actors have no interest in
continuing the war and will adjust their strategies accordingly. It also
entails a willingness [to secure the terms of a truce as well as the
results of peace negotiations internationally, which may require a high
level of commitment. The longer the war continues, the more
international pressure will be necessary to get both sides back into
negotiations.]{.underline} The West must make every effort to persuade
the governments of Russia and Ukraine to suspend combat actions.
Economic sanctions and military support have to be integrated into a
political strategy aimed at gradual de-escalation until a ceasefire is
fully implemented. So far, there has not been a joint and concentrated
effort by the international community, the major Western players in
particular, to seek negotiations. As long as this is not the case[, it
cannot be assumed]{.underline} that an understanding is impossible and
[that Putin]{.underline} in particular [does not want to
negotiate.]{.underline} In a deadlocked conflict, it is a standard
practice that war parties have maximum demands or explicitly reject
peace talks. The course of the negotiation attempts so far has shown
some initial willingness on both sides to come to an understanding by a
flexible approach to the attainment of their goals. At this point, [only
a major **diplomatic** offensive can lead out of the current
impasse]{.underline}. [The opening of negotiations is not a
justification for war crimes. We share the desire for justice.
Negotiations, however, are first and foremost a necessary means to
prevent further suffering in Ukraine and adverse consequences of the war
around the world.]{.underline} Considering the threat of humanitarian
catastrophes and the manifest risks of escalation, stability must be
restored as quickly as possible. [Only a suspension of combat
actions]{.underline} will create the time and opportunity necessary to
do this. The supreme importance of this goal demands that we rise to the
challenge and [do **everything** in our power]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} make an early [ceasefire and]{.underline} the
[start]{.underline} of [peace]{.underline} negotiations possible -- [and
refrain from doing anything **that contradicts this goal.**]{.underline}

is [looming famine in the Horn of
Africa](https://web.archive.org/web/20220714021231/https:/www.nytimes.com/2022/06/11/world/africa/somalia-drought-hunger.html),
where years of drought have devastated communities in Somalia and parts
of neighboring countries. [**Ukraine**, the world's fourth-largest
exporter of grains, is a key source for that region. Efforts to reach a
diplomatic agreement have been hampered by problems that include mines
in the Black Sea, arranging at-sea **inspection**s of the cargo, and
convincing the Kremlin that it has an interest in resolving the
blockade]{.underline}. While officials were discussing the grain crisis
in Istanbul, Ukraine's military began to punch back on the battlefield
in eastern Ukraine, striking bases and ammunition depots deep within
Russian-occupied territory with the help of new, more powerful weapons
provided by the West. Early Wednesday morning, a fireball lit up the sky
over Luhansk, the capital of a Russian-held province in eastern Ukraine.
Russian media reported that Ukraine's military had hit an antiaircraft
battery. That followed the destruction of six ammunition warehouses on
Tuesday in Russian-controlled territories in southern and eastern
Ukraine, according to Serhii Bratchuk, the spokesman for Odesa's
military administration. The strategy by Ukrainian forces was still in
its early days, and it was not yet clear whether it was allowing them to
disrupt Russian artillery attacks and offensive operations. Some
Ukrainian officials argued that the Russians were being forced to move
supply hubs farther from the front, a claim that could not be verified.

#### Negotiations are key, it's the only reliable method for stability

Charles A. **Kupchan**, 6-15-**22**
https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/06/15/negotiating-to-end-the-ukraine-war-isnt-appeasement-00039798

[As the **war** in **Ukraine** grinds through its **fourth
month**,]{.underline} defiant Ukrainians continue to bloody Russian's
invasion force. [The **U**nited **S**tates and its allies are
backstopping Ukraine's staunch **defense** of its territory through a
steady inflow of **weapons**.]{.underline} The goal, as President Joe
Biden put it in a recent essay in the [New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/31/opinion/biden-ukraine-strategy.html),
is "to work to strengthen Ukraine and support its efforts to achieve a
negotiated end to the conflict." A negotiated end to the conflict is the
right goal --- and one that needs to arrive sooner rather than later.
Ukraine likely lacks the combat power to expel Russia from all of its
territory, and the momentum on the battlefield is shifting in Russia's
favor. [The longer this conflict continues, the greater the death and
destruction, the more severe the disruptions to the global economy and
the food supply, and the higher the risk of escalation to full-scale war
between Russia and NATO.]{.underline} **[Transatlantic unity is starting
to fray]{.underline}**, with France, Germany, Italy and other allies
uneasy about the prospect of a prolonged war --- especially against the
backdrop of rising inflation. But **[if Biden is serious]{.underline}**
[about facilitating negotiations, he needs to do a better job of laying
the political groundwork]{.underline} and shaping a narrative that
prioritizes arriving at a diplomatic endgame. There is still too much
[hawkish rhetoric in
Washington](https://twitter.com/benjaminwittes/status/1532340021440696320),
with U.S. arms flowing to Ukraine "so that it can," in the [words of
Secretary of State Antony
Blinken](https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-at-a-press-availability-18/),
"repel Russian aggression and fully defend its independence and
sovereignty." Meanwhile, [Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
insists](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-100-days.html),
not surprisingly, that "victory will be ours" and [urges
Ukrainians](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3429421-zelensky-while-invaders-are-on-our-soil-we-must-beat-them-as-best-we-can.html)
to "defend every meter of our land." And Biden, even as he makes mention
of the need for diplomacy, has so far been unwilling to caution Kyiv
against those aims, instead affirming "I will not pressure the Ukrainian
government --- in private or public --- to make any territorial
concessions." "We're not going to tell the Ukrainians how to negotiate,
what to negotiate and when to negotiate," Colin Kahl, the undersecretary
of defense for policy, [reiterated this
week](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/world/europe/us-will-not-push-ukraine-to-reach-a-cease-fire-a-top-pentagon-official-says.html?searchResultPosition=2).
"They're going to set those terms for themselves." But [Washington
has]{.underline} not only a right to discuss war aims with Kyiv, but
also an o**[bligation]{.underline}**. This [conflict]{.underline}
arguably represents [the **most dangerous**]{.underline} geopolitical
moment since [the Cuban missile crisis]{.underline}. [A hot war is
raging between a nuclear-armed Russia]{.underline} and a NATO-armed
Ukraine, with NATO territory abutting the conflict zone. [This war
could]{.underline} **[define]{.underline}** the [strategic and economic
contours of **the 21st**]{.underline} century, possibly opening an era
of militarized rivalry between the world's liberal democracies and an
autocratic bloc anchored by Russia and China. These stakes necessitate
direct U.S. engagement in determining when and how this war ends.
Instead of offering arms with no strings attached --- effectively
leaving strategy up to the Ukrainians --- [Washington needs to launch a
forthright discussion about **war termination** with allies, with Kyiv,
and ultimately, **with Moscow**. To prepare the ground for that pivot,
the Biden administration should stop making claims that could tie its
own hands at the negotiating table. **Biden** insists that the
West]{.underline} must "[make it clear that might does not make
right]{.underline}." Otherwise, "it will send a message to other
would-be aggressors that they too can seize territory and subjugate
other countries. It will put the survival of other peaceful democracies
at risk. And it could mark the end of the rules-based international
order." Really? Russia has illegally held Crimea and occupied a chunk of
Donbas since 2014. But the rules-based international order has not come
to an end; indeed, it has performed admirably in punishing Russia for
its new round of aggression against Ukraine. Washington should avoid
painting itself into a corner by predicting catastrophe if Russia
remains in control of a slice of Ukraine when the fighting stops. Such
forecasts make compromise more difficult --- and risk magnifying the
geopolitical impact of whatever territorial gains Russia may salvage.
[The claim that Vladimir Putin will end his trouble-making only if he is
decisively defeated in Ukraine is another **fallacious** argument that
distorts debate and stands in the way of diplomacy. Writing in The
Atlantic, [Anne
Applebaum](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/why-ukraine-must-defeat-putin-russia/629940/)
calls for the "humiliation" of Putin and insists that "the defeat,
sidelining, or removal of Putin is the only outcome that offers any
long-term stability in Ukraine and the rest of Europe.]{.underline}"
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin [wants to weaken
Russia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/25/russia-weakened-lloyd-austin-ukraine-visit/)
"to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in
invading Ukraine." But this is wishful thinking, not strategic sobriety.
Putin is poised to remain in power for the foreseeable future. He will
be a troublemaker no matter how this war ends; flexing his geopolitical
muscle and burnishing his nationalist credentials are the primary
sources of his domestic legitimacy. Furthermore, humiliating Putin is
risky business; he could well be more reckless with his back up against
the wall than if he can claim victory by taking another bite out of
Ukraine. **[The West]{.underline}** has [learned to]{.underline} live
with and **[contain Putin]{.underline}** for the past two decades ---
[and will]{.underline} likely [continue to have to]{.underline} do so
into the next. Finally, Biden needs to start weaning mainstream debate
away from the false equation of diplomacy with appeasement. When Henry
Kissinger recently proposed in Davos that Ukraine may need to make
territorial concessions to end the war, [Zelenskyy
retorted](https://www.democracynow.org/2022/5/26/headlines/ukraines_zelensky_blasts_henry_kissinger_over_proposal_to_appease_russia):
"It seems that Mr. Kissinger's calendar is not 2022, but 1938, and he
thought he was talking to an audience not in Davos, but in Munich of
that time." Biden himself asserts that "It would be wrong and contrary
to well-settled principles" to counsel Ukraine on potential concessions
at the negotiating table. But strategic prudence should not be mistaken
for appeasement. It is in Ukraine's own self-interest to avoid a
conflict that festers for years and instead negotiate a ceasefire and
follow-on process aimed at concluding a territorial settlement. The
United States, its NATO allies, Russia, and the rest of the world have
an interest in securing this same outcome --- precisely why it is now
time for Biden to set the negotiating table.

#### EU Russia relations key to end the Ukraine war 

**Menon 22** (Rajan Menon is the Anne and Bernard Spitzer Professor of
International Relations at the Powell School, City College of New York,
and a nonresident fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible
Statecraft. He is the author, most recently, of The Conceit of
Humanitarian Intervention, June 29, 2022, "How Will the War in Ukraine
End?", https://www.thenation.com/article/world/ukraine-russia-war-end/)

Before the war, Putin pushed for a neutral Ukraine that would foreswear
all military alliances. No dice, said both Ukraine and NATO. That
alliance's decision, at its 2008 Bucharest summit, to open the door to
that country (and Georgia) was irrevocable. A month after the Russian
invasion began, Zelensky put neutrality on the table, but it was too
late. Putin had already opted to achieve his aims on the battlefield and
was confident he could. Still, Russia and Ukraine have now been fighting
for more than three months. Both have suffered heavy losses and each
knows that the war could drag on for years at a staggering cost without
either achieving its aims. The Russian president does control additional
chunks of Ukrainian territory, but he may hope to find some way of
easing Western sanctions and also avoiding being wholly dependent on
China. These circumstances might revive the neutrality option. [Russia
would retain its land corridor to Crimea, even if with some concessions
to Ukraine. It would receive a guarantee that the water canals flowing
southward to that peninsula from the city of Kherson, which would revert
to Ukrainian control, would never again be blocked. Russia would not
annex the "republics" it created in the Donbas in 2014 and would
withdraw from some of the additional land it's seized there. Ukraine
would be free to receive arms and military training from any country,
but foreign troops and bases would be banned from its territory. Such a
settlement would require significant Ukrainian sacrifices, which is why
**candidate membership in the European Union** (EU) and, more
importantly, a fast track to full membership---one of that country's key
aspirations---as well as substantial long-term Western aid for economic
reconstruction **would be a necessary part of any deal**. Expediting its
membership would be a heavy lift for the EU and such an aid package
would be costly to the Europeans and Americans, so they'd have to decide
how much they were willing to offer to end Europe's biggest conflict
since World War II.]{.underline}

#### Peace is the [best option]{.underline}

**Carment and Belo 22** (David Carment and Dani Belo; \"The war in
Ukraine shows **[it's time for a new way to ensure security in
Europe\"]{.underline}**, 6-16-2022, Carleton Newsroom,
https://newsroom.carleton.ca/story/ukraine-war-ensure-european-security/,
DOA: 7-17-2022)//sposten

[The]{.underline} ongoing political and military [standoff between
Russia and the United States is the most recent indicator that Europe's
security and economic architecture must be transformed to **harmonize**
European and Russian **strategic interests.**]{.underline}

[In other words, the path toward ending the war in Ukraine requires
**focusing on** the security priorities of those who have the most to
gain from a **diplomatic solution** --- European nations, not the U.S.
**Peaceful** co-existence is dependent upon **successful negotiations**
among European capitals and Moscow.]{.underline}

The war in Ukraine did not start on Feb. 24, 2022, but has been ongoing
since 2014. Between 2014 and 2022, more than 15,000 people have died,
creating a humanitarian disaster for Ukraine and its eastern Donbas
region.

[The protracted conflict has been riddled with missed opportunities for
**diplomatic action**, confrontation and limited strategic
thinking.]{.underline}

[European diplomacy efforts]{.underline}

On June 16, 2022, European leaders Emmanuel Macron of France, Germany's
Olaf Scholz and Italy's Mario Draghi visited Kyiv separately from U.S
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
This demonstrates Europeans have the capacity to carry out diplomacy
independently from Washington.

[Unfortunately, **pursuing action** through a **defensive** alliance
like **NATO**, rather than focusing on conflict prevention and
resolution through collective security arrangements --- via]{.underline}
the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe
([OSCE]{.underline}), [the U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations
[and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion --- [has **weakened**
the potential for a **negotiated** or mediated settlement.]{.underline}

[Security organizations that might be in a position to support a
**diplomatic process**]{.underline}, however, [have now become
increasingly **vulnerable** amid the war.]{.underline} The OSCE, for
example, no longer has any real presence in monitoring the conflict
because its representatives have been targeted, rather than viewed as
intermediaries.

We believe a key step toward peace in Ukraine is for Kyiv to relinquish
its ambition to join NATO while securing membership within the EU. This
decision would move the conflict away from one based on military
confrontation and towards building Ukraine's political and economic
resilience within Europe.

[Kyiv has been granted **EU candidate status**, putting it on a path
toward **membership** with the union]{.underline}, but its NATO
membership bid has largely fallen by the wayside.

Donbas, Crimea

In return for EU membership, [Ukraine should be prepared to **negotiate
a lasting settlement** to address the status of Donbas, Crimea and other
territories as Russia's occupation of them becomes solidified though
annexation.]{.underline}

Both Luhansk and Donetsk were the focus of a decree issued by Russian
President Vladimir Putin three days before invading Ukraine that
recognized the contested separate status of these two oblasts. As the
war grinds on, Russia is taking de facto political and economic control
of these zones.

At the same time, [the conditions needed to **reintegrate** the
Russian-occupied territories back into a highly centralized Ukrainian
state don't exist at this time.]{.underline} Therefore, at a minimum,
[decentralization must be part of the negotiation process]{.underline},
as stipulated in the Minsk Agreement of February 2015 aimed at stopping
the fighting in the region.

Committing to de-escalation

The EU and the OSCE are in better positions to support Ukraine's
decentralization since they have the ability to monitor and strengthen
minority rights among candidate and member states where political,
cultural and linguistic rights have been weakened.

When choosing between compromise or continued war, Putin and Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will need to take tangible, measurable
steps towards de-escalation.

[This would include an agreement to establish a **ceasefire
zone.**]{.underline} A ceasefire could mean further efforts to reduce
tensions, including a withdrawal of forces where possible, an increase
in the number of crossing points across buffer zones and lines of
contact, eliminating land mines and returning people to their homelands.

Beyond this important first step, [both sides must be prepared to agree
on the **sovereignty** and independence of **Ukraine**, where minority
rights are respected and enforced.]{.underline}

[EU must play big role for European Security]{.underline}

Some experts have argued that Ukrainian sovereignty should be upheld by
the five permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations
(China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States), plus the
European Union and Turkey.

This is a tall order, given that [Moscow **perceives** the **U.S.** as a
**key player** in supporting a **proxy war** in Ukraine.]{.underline}
That's why the EU and the OSCE acting as intermediaries is crucial.

[A second step on the agenda must be **negotiating** the special status
of **territories** currently under Russian control, including Donbas and
Crimea.]{.underline} Disputed [claims over Crimea should include
resolutions about **shared resources**]{.underline}, common commercial
interests and the security of the Russian fleet at Sevastopol.

[A third step is to uphold safe and free access and mobility throughout
the Black Sea]{.underline}, unimpeded by mines, blockades and embargoes.

[Normalizing relations between Russia and Ukraine would bring **regional
stability** through freedom of movement of people and
goods.]{.underline} Without the local population seeing immediate
tangible benefits, the protracted conflict will continue to erode any
confidence they might have in any lasting settlement.

[A resolution template for European Security]{.underline}

In reaching these goals, the so-called Steinmeier formula --- the
foundation of the Minsk II protocols --- offers negotiators a template
for the process.

[A gradual reduction in tensions is possible if parties take a
**systematic approach** that focuses on where there is likely to be
agreement, including the aforementioned ceasefire and creation of buffer
zones, before moving on to thornier issues like fixed
borders.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, since the onset of the conflict in February, the West's
diplomatic channels with Moscow have been reduced to a few phone calls
between Macron, Scholz and Putin. The hardened positions of both sides
has prevented any robust agreements on humanitarian corridors.

To avoid a frozen conflict --- in which the fighting has ended but no
peace treaty is in place --- sanctions on Russia will need to be lifted
according to its contribution to a constructive and lasting outcome.

[Ukraine]{.underline}, on the other hand, [must be **convinced** that a
prolonged war will only **diminish** the prospects for long-term
**economic and political stability**, with the likelihood of EU
membership **diminishing rapidly** over time.]{.underline}

Crucial negotiations

[Negotiations have intensified since the beginning of June, with Turkey
acting as **mediator** between Russia and Ukraine, which together
account for around **30 percent** of global trade in
**crops.**]{.underline}

[The talks are **crucial** insofar as **no other country** has come
forward so far able to **make up** for the **shortfall** on the market
of initially 25 million tonnes of Ukraine grain.]{.underline} And
[prices for agricultural commodities were already **high** before Russia
invaded Ukraine on February 24, notably as a result of the post-Covid
economic recovery.]{.underline}

[The war has sparked a **surge** in the **price** of grains such as
wheat and corn to levels **unsustainable** for countries **dependent**
on their import, such as Egypt, Lebanon and Tunisia.]{.underline}

In recent weeks, [prices have progressively receded again on the
**prospect** of the upcoming **harvest**, fears of recession and the
progress made in the negotiations regarding the sea
corridors.]{.underline}

[Negotiations have **accelerated** in recent days: Turkey said an
agreement in principle had been reached on creating a protected sea
corridor.]{.underline}

Russian President Vladimir [Putin said \"progress\" had been made in
discussions before telling reporters that any **deal hinged on** the
**West**\'s willingness to yield some ground.]{.underline}

[\"We will facilitate the export of Ukrainian grain, but we are
**proceeding** from the fact that all **restrictions** related to
possible deliveries for the export of Russian grain will be
**lifted,\"**]{.underline} he said.

However, [market experts say that **no sanctions** directly target
Russian **agricultural goods**, but are nonetheless **penalised** by
sanctions on the country\'s banking sector.]{.underline}

\- What is Turkey\'s role? -

[\"There\'s only a handful of countries \-- Turkey is one]{.underline},
Qatar is another \-- t[hat\'s able to kind of speak to almost everybody
and avoid major blowback,\"]{.underline} said Colin Clarke, director of
research at the US-based Soufan Group.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan has \"proven that **he can do
it** and that\'s why he\'s been a trusted broker not only by the
Russians, but I think begrudgingly NATO countries \-- that\'s the best
that they have,\"]{.underline} the expert said.

[Turkey had \"a **strong hand** to play here\"]{.underline}, Clarke
continued.

\"Erdogan gets to play the hero, he gets to tell everybody that he\'s
working to solve the global food crisis, but we know that Turkey is
doing a lot to obstruct negotiations in other areas.

\"They\'ve got their concerns, and their priorities don\'t always align
with the priorities of the international community, the priorities of
NATO, or even the priorities of their allies.\"

What sort of deal?

As much as 90 percent of Ukrainian exports of wheat, corn and sunflower
were transported by sea, mostly from the port of Odessa, which accounts
for 60 percent of all port activity in the country.

[Any agreement to resume large-scale shipping will have **several
stages**: the **de-mining** of the ports that Ukrainians mined; the
**loading of the ships**, which could be put under the supervision of
the UN; the **inspection** of the **shipments**; and the **escorting**
of the **boats**, as demanded by Russia to ensure that the cargoes do
not include weapons, said Edward de Saint-Denis, trader at Plantureux
and Associates.]{.underline}

[Diplomatic sources say]{.underline} however that [complete de-mining is
not necessary]{.underline} as safe transit routes remain in the measures
meant to protect coastal areas from invasion.

A number of other points remain very controversial: if Moscow manages to
control \-- and even seize \-- boats, will the checks be carried out in
Ukrainian or international waters? Which vessels will be authorised to
transport the shipments and what will the nationality of their crews be?

\"Russians don\'t want Ukrainians and vice versa,\" de Saint-Denis said.

At one point, Turkey suggested using its fleet, but a compromise could
be reached to use \"flags of convenience\", according to one market
observer.

What are the consequences?

\"In the very short term, agreement would bring down prices, but in
terms of the flow of grain shipments, nothing would change
immediately,\" said Edward de Saint-Denis.

\"One or two months would be needed to de-mine the ports,\" the expert
said.

And the loading areas would have to be renovated, notably in Odessa
where part of the port administration was damaged in the fighting, he
said.

Despite the various possible obstacles, agricultural market analyst,
Gautier Le Molgat said that [it was now \"in **everyone\'s interests**
that **maritime traffic resumes** on the Black Sea: first and foremost
for the Ukrainians, but also for the Russians, who have an exceptional
harvest to export\".]{.underline}

[Europe faces the task of restoring and **securing peace** on the
continent. This requires]{.underline} the development of [a strategy to
end the Russian war in Ukraine a]{.underline}s [s]{.underline}oon
[a]{.underline}s [p]{.underline}ossible[.]{.underline}

[Ukraine has been able to defend itself]{.underline} against Russia's
brutal war of aggression [for three and a half months]{.underline} now,
partially thanks to massive economic sanctions and military support from
Europe and the United States. [However, the **longer** this **support
continues**, the **less clear** it becomes which **goals** are being
pursued with it. A Ukrainian victory]{.underline} with the recapture of
all occupied territories, including the Donezk and Luhansk Oblasts and
Crimea, [is considered **unrealistic**]{.underline} by most military
experts, [given Russia's **military superiority** and ability to further
escalate militarily.]{.underline}

[All western countries that provide military support to Ukraine must
therefore **ask themselves** what their precise **goal** is and whether
(and for how long) arms deliveries continue to be the right course of
action. Continuing the war with the **aim** of Ukraine's **complete
victory**]{.underline} over Russia [means that thousands more victims
will die for a purpose that does **not** seem
**realistic.**]{.underline}

Moreover, [the consequences of the war are **no longer limited** to
Ukraine. Its continuation is causing massive humanitarian, economic, and
environmental distress **around the world.**]{.underline} Rapidly
[**rising prices**, energy and food shortages have already led to unrest
in many countries. **Fertilizer shortages** will have a **global
impact** if the war lasts beyond the fall.]{.underline} High casualty
rates, many deaths from hunger and disease and destabilization of the
global situation are to be expected. Warnings of these dramatic
consequences are also being issued at the international political level
(G7, UN).

[All western countries must stand united]{.underline} against Russia's
aggression in Ukraine and further revanchist claims. [However,
**prolonging the war** in Ukraine is **not the solution.**]{.underline}
The current developments surrounding rail transit to the Russian enclave
of Kaliningrad and Putin's announcement to deliver nuclear-capable
missile systems to Belarus, show that [the danger of escalation is
**increasing.**]{.underline} The [western countries must do anything
they can to ensure that the war parties reach a **negotiated
settlement** as soon as possible. This]{.underline} alone [can
**prevent** years of a war of attrition with its **fatal** local and
global **consequences**, as well as a military escalation that could
lead to the use of **nuclear weapons.**]{.underline}

[Negotiations does **not mean** a **surrender** of Ukraine, as
is]{.underline} sometimes [assumed.]{.underline} A dictated peace by
Putin is not an option. [The international community must]{.underline}
do everything it can to [**create conditions** under which negotiations
are **possible**]{.underline} at all. [This includes a declaration that
the Western actors have **no interest** in continuing the
war]{.underline} and will adjust their strategies accordingly. It also
entails [a willingness to **secure** the terms of a **truce** as well as
the results of peace negotiations internationally, which may require a
high level of commitment.]{.underline} The longer the war continues, the
more international pressure will be necessary to get both sides back
into negotiations. The West must make every effort to persuade the
governments of Russia and Ukraine to suspend combat actions. Economic
sanctions and military support have to be integrated into a political
strategy aimed at gradual de-escalation until a ceasefire is fully
implemented.

So far, there has not been a joint and concentrated effort by the
international community, the major Western players in particular, to
seek negotiations. As long as this is not the case, it cannot be assumed
that an understanding is impossible and that Putin in particular does
not want to negotiate. In a deadlocked conflict, it is a standard
practice that war parties have maximum demands or explicitly reject
peace talks. The course of the negotiation attempts so far has shown
some initial willingness on both sides to come to an understanding by a
flexible approach to the attainment of their goals. At this point, only
a major diplomatic offensive can lead out of the current impasse.

[The opening of negotiations is **not a justification for war
crimes.**]{.underline} We share the desire for justice. [Negotiations,
however, are first and foremost a necessary means to **prevent** further
**suffering** in Ukraine and adverse consequences of the war around the
world.]{.underline} Considering the threat of humanitarian catastrophes
and the manifest risks of escalation, [stability must be **restored** as
quickly as possible. Only a **suspension of combat actions** will
**create the time and opportunity** necessary to do this. The **supreme
importance** of this goal demands that we rise to the challenge and do
everything in our power to make an **early ceasefire** and the start of
peace negotiations possible -- and **refrain from** doing anything that
**contradicts this goal.**]{.underline}

So your recent article lays out some of concerns that you have regarding
the current situation in Ukraine affecting you know issues across the
globe. And I was just reading a dispatch from the G20 meeting in
Indonesia and I\'ll just quote from it. Briefly G20 foreign ministers
called for an end to the war in Ukraine and grain blockade on Friday as
Russia\'s top diplomat. [Walked out of a meeting and **denounced the
West** for frenzied criticism and squandering a chance to tackle global
economic problems. Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on food
security and energy dominated the meetings at the G20 summit on the
island of Bali in Indonesia.]{.underline} And the meeting ended with no
joint statement and no announcements of any agreements being reached.
Anyway, it looks like not much progress was reached there and not a good
sign for ending the war in Ukraine. That there is really not even any
discussion between. The US and Russia at this point about where this
conflict may head. Now, maybe you can summarize your concerns about
where the war in Ukraine may be headed and the different direction
you\'d like to see U.S. policy at least attempt to find a diplomatic
solution here. Yeah yeah I have a lot of concerns. Or in day I don\'t
know about 138. There\'s a certain sameness about these days. [The
Russians continue to make **incremental advances**. Very small advances
but extremely costly for Ukraine for its people, for its infrastructure,
for its it\'s villages, it\'s towns. The Russians are busy fast tracking
citizenship to Ukrainians living in eastern Ukraine, and the Donuts, and
they show no sign of backing down.]{.underline} And at the same time,
[Zelensky still feels he\'s winning and can win the war and you have too
many American officials who are at least agreeing with that
publicly.]{.underline} I don\'t know what they genuinely believe. I
can\'t believe they think that. Ukraine can actually win this war and
take back significant amounts of territory as well. So the nuclear
background is something that\'s always concerned me because the Soviets
fought a war or losing war in Afghanistan and never raised the issue of
nuclear weapons. We fought losing wars in Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan,
and [the idea of **nuclear weapons** never came up. Putin raises it as a
threat from time to time. We seem to believe he wouldn\'t do it, but who
knows what Putin will do when his **back** is **against the
wall?**]{.underline} Given the fact that he\'s already conducted the war
with such? Brutality and senselessness that it\'s hard to say what
he\'ll do and unlike Khrushchev, who had to face a. A politbureau in the
wake of the disastrous decision to put missiles in Cuba. Putin faces no
possible counter, let alone opposition, and no one who\'s probably
arguing a different point of view. And and when you mentioned the G20
meeting, I I just think it\'s wrong for Secretary of State Anthony
Blinken, who doesn\'t really impress me. In fact, you wonder where has
the State Department been during the Biden administration? [What is the
role of diplomacy?]{.underline} Or are we still active in the diplomatic
arena? Uh, he went out of his way to make it clear that he had nothing
to say to Lavrov and there was no. Point in meeting with him, you know,
[Lavrov]{.underline} is the foreign minister. But he he\'s not a power
center in the in the Moscow Arena. But he [is a voice that probably
could **reach Putin** on some level]{.underline}, and the lines of
communication I think need to be kept open. Uh, I know [the Pentagon has
**gone out of its way** to keep **lines open** to their Russian
counterparts in the defence ministry.]{.underline} And [there have been
a **couple talks**]{.underline}, not many, and I think they\'re they\'re
probably inadequate, but we have deconfliction zones in Syria between
Russian and American forces. Uh, I think [we have to talk about
**confidence building** between Russians and Americans. In Ukraine,
because as far as **Putin** is **concerned**, I think he believes now
he\'s fighting not only Ukraine, he\'s **fighting the West** and he\'s
fighting the United States.]{.underline} That\'s why I refer to what
we\'re doing as a special military operation. This is what Putin calls
his war in Ukraine. A special military operation, and he does that to
downplay the notion that there\'s going to be any need for a draft or
mass mobilization or extensive measures to get more citizens involved in
this war he\'s trying. To have it both ways, guns and butter the same
thing that Lyndon Johnson thought he could do in Vietnam, which. Became
a failure and we\'re just continuing to send more arms, more
sophisticated arms, and now the high mobility artillery rocket system.
These himars we\'re going to send four more. They have a range of 40 to
50 miles and it will be possible for Ukraine to hit targets. Inside of
Russia and there have been a couple targets hit inside of Russia. Russia
has not called any attention to that. Because I don\'t think they\'ve
decided what they\'re going to do about it, it does raise the stakes and
how this war is going to. Be thought but. I think back to really the 2nd
30 years war, which is how I define World War One and World War Two.
Because when you think about it from 1914 to 1945 with this brief.
Interruption in the 20s. There was a world. War going on. How long is
this Ukraine war going to last? What are the implications now? You
mentioned food. We could add energy to that list because. \'cause I\'m
seeing signs of war fatigue in Europe, and I certainly think we\'re
going to see more signs in the coming winter as gas and oil deliveries
get interrupted and the Germany German economy. Has some real problems
with not fulfilling its energy needs, so there\'s more unwinding that
can take place. None of it is good. None of this. Healthy and at the
same time we\'re doing this, [we\'re going out of our way to
**antagonize** both **Russia** and **China.**]{.underline} And now the
Pentagon and their military appropriations that they send up to the hill
are talking about the need to fund A2 front war. But [do they really
believe they can take on Russia and China at the same time? I played war
games]{.underline} when I was at CIA and the National War College that
involved Taiwan. [And **we didn\'t win** one of them. China always was
the winner]{.underline} in a war game that involved Taiwan, and at some
point we\'re going to have to discuss. Are we really going to defend
Taiwan militarily? UH, is Taiwan part of our national security posture?
Do we need to defend Taiwan? But if so, I think [the best way to
**defend Taiwan** is to **improve** our **relationship** with **China**
to make sure China sees some good coming out of a **bilateral
relationship** with the United States right now.]{.underline} Beijing
must think Jinping must think he has nothing to lose in worsening
relations with the United States because Biden has really followed Trump
policy with regard to China. You know the tariffs are still in place,
even though it would relieve some inflationary pressure if he drops some
of them. Uh, so the the entire international picture, the international
arena. I think is really fraught when you think of the consequences of a
war that could easily get out of hand, and then when you think that
we\'ve taken this opportunity to expand NATO to bring into Scandinavian
countries, Finland and Sweden, which will double the length of the.
Border between NATO states. And Russia then it allows Putin to make the
case that he needs Ukraine as a buffer zone because he can tell his own
people. And I think there are already signs that he has told his people
and. They don\'t need real. Convincing that it was that buffer zone that
saved them against Napoleon in the 19th century. And certainly save them
against Hitler in the 20th century. So So what [we\'ve done with our
actions is given Putin a. A car. Was to fight this war that. Will be
attractive to the Russian people.]{.underline} And the one thing I
learned in. Terms of dealing with Russians over the years both at CIA
and at the National War College. [If there\'s one area of superiority
that the Russians contend, it\'s **they feel** they can make **greater
sacrifices** than other people.]{.underline} They don\'t believe
themselves to be materialistic the way we are or the European states
are. [They can deal with setbacks. They can deal with failures. They
certainly did it in World War Two]{.underline} and. Over 25 million
Russians died. In a war. Which was overwhelmingly fought on the Eastern
Front. When you think of where most of the German army. Uh was located
and where most of the German fatalities and casualties took place, so I
don\'t[. I don\'t think time is on our side]{.underline} I, I think
[Putin can play a **long game.**]{.underline} He\'s indicated that he
can, and he seems to believe this, and I guess I take him at his word
and and we don\'t have. Any new way of looking at the problem? Whenever
there\'s an issue that needs to be addressed, [what we do is send up
**another military appropriations** to the hill.]{.underline} The last
one was for \$8 billion more. Actually, \$400 million in this increment
to raise the total value of our arms transfers just in recent months to
\$8 billion over \$50 billion. Overall. When you think of military aid
and economic aid and infrastructure aid, so it\'s a it\'s a very. We\'re
speaking with Mel Goodman this evening on counterpoint. Mel is a senior
fellow at the Center for International Policy and a former CIA analyst,
and we\'re talking about his recent article on Counterpunch that you can
read yourself, titled Moscow\'s War in Ukraine versus Washington special
military operation. [There has been some concern expressed about how the
Biden administration is fighting this war in Ukraine and what its
goal.]{.underline} Those are and. We had Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin
say a couple of months ago. [That the Biden. Administration\'s goal was
to number 1 degrade Russian military capacity and their
economy.]{.underline} If that\'s still in play now, what\'s the danger
of that goal? If if that indeed is where? If that is indeed what the
priority is of this administration, when it comes to the conflict in
Ukraine. Well, I still think there are a lot of people in the
administration who believe that, and if they had their druthers would
say it. But Austin was called on the carpet for saying it. Apparently he
did get a personal phone call from President Biden saying that that was.
A totally gratuitous statement that you made. Don\'t make it again, and
Austin hasn\'t. But I know from my contacts with general officers over
the years and I, 18 years of the war college. There there are a lot of
high-ranking officers who grow up from their training from their
experience from their exposure internationally. Thinking that Russia
must be denied any military capability to conduct this kind of military
operation. So I think what Austin was saying was sort of conventional
wisdom. Within the military, don\'t allow Russia to come out of this war
with the ability to. Fight another war in any area. In other words,
Russia would not even be in a position to defend itself, and Russia is a
country that is surrounded by adversarial interests. This is this is
part of of Russian self belief about their own history. In their own
national security situation, they envy our geostrategic. A superiority
over them surrounded by oceans east and West and friendly neighbors
North and South. They don\'t have that. They have a sensitive military
border on the southern front and they refer to that as their sensitive
border because they go back in history that Genghis Khan and various.
Muslim and insurgencies on the border that created problems for Soviet
and Russian interests and then when you think of the Caucasus, the
fighting that takes place in the caucuses where actually Russia had to
become a peacemaker between Armenia and Azerbaijan and it got very
little credit for that several months ago. And then when you think of
East Europe and the Warsaw Pact, the Warsaw Pact, I think, was not so
much a way of opposing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It was a
way of putting troops into Eastern Europe to ensure the loyalty of East
Europeans who, with the exception of Bulgarians, detested Russia. And
now Putin has made himself such a pariah, that even the Bulgarians have
joined with their other East European neighbors, in being opposed to
Russian interests. So to me we\'re playing right into. [Russia **beliefs
about** itself and **the threat to national security** that the
**U**nited **S**tates represents by **expanding NATO** by creating a
**military headquarters**]{.underline}, meaning permanent forces now
will be in Poland by increasing the number of naval combatants in Rota,
Spain. By increasing the squadrons of F. 35\'s in England. I mentioned
Sweden and Finland coming into NATO. Onshore Russia was counting on
Erdogan, Turkish President Erdogan to put up more of a fight to keep the
Scandinavian countries out because of the Kurdish issue. But actually
Biden handled that very well and heard on caved in very quickly. In
fact, Putin in terms of his assumptions about the the West, the West is
generally hung together. K now. More tightly and for a longer period of
time than I think he anticipated. Well, we\'ve run out of time now.
Thank you so much for the work you do in analyzing current crises and
for joining us tonight. And people can find your articles at
counterpunch.org. Is that right? With that counter comment

write once a week. Thank you ma\'am.

#### US-NATO-Russia relations are [zero-sum]{.underline} because of a [lack of trust]{.underline}\-\--win-wins are [impossible]{.underline}

- Ukraine invasion is more uniqueness for the loss of trust

JENS STOLTENBERG: We have suspended all practical cooperation with
Russia as a result of what we saw in Ukraine last spring. We continue to
have open channels for political contact, but [let me]{.underline} just
[address]{.underline} in a way [the fundamental question you asked in
the beginning, whether this is a zero-sum or a win-win
situation?]{.underline} I can recall when I was a student, and also
later when I worked in the Norwegian Central Bureau of Statistics and I
worked on economic theory and game theory, and there [we learned about
cooperative games and win-win situations, and non-cooperative games and
zero-sum outfalls or outcomes.]{.underline} The main message then was
that **[it all depends on the rules.]{.underline}** If you have the
right rules and you have a minimum trust, then you are able to move from
a zero-sum situation to a win-win.

[The problem now is that **we don\'t have the rules**, or actually we
have the rules, but they are **not respected.** Therefore we don't have
the trust and that\'s the reason why we are moving from a win-win
situation toward something which is more and more like a
zero-sum]{.underline}, a game, [and we **cannot go back**]{.underline}
again [to the win-win situation without enforcing **respect for
rules.**]{.underline} Because t[hat\'s a **pre-condition** for
**trust**, and trust and respect for rules is a **pre-condition** for
**win-win.** This]{.underline} actually [undermines both arms
control]{.underline}, it undermines [economic cooperation, trade,
and]{.underline} it undermines [security in Europe.]{.underline} So when
NATO is so focussed on the respect for basic rules, like respecting the
border of your neighbour -- it\'s not a very advanced, it\'s not, how to
say, difficult rule, it\'s to see the border and to respect it. Then we
focus on that because that\'s so fundamental for the idea of coming back
to a situation where we can have a win-win situation over a zero-sum
situation.

DAVID IGNATIUS: Victoria, let me ask you for a final comment here and
then I\'m going to actually take the first question from the audience
for you as well, so thoughts that you have on either the, to me, very
worrisome unravelling of arms control, in particular in the INF
dimension and then we\'ll turn to the audience.

VICTORIA NULAND: I agree with Jens that you can\'t have win-wins without
trust. We all want win-wins, that\'s what we\'ve devoted our
professional lives to, that\'s what we need for our populations, but
without trust you can\'t do it and you\'re not going to have trust if
you don't have truth. [So when you have a country **denying** that it
has **troops** in another country\'s territory, there\'s no trust. When
you have a country **denying** that it is testing a **new missile** that
may not be compliant with INF, it\'s hard to have trust.]{.underline}
Our president has wanted to do not lest arms control, but more arms
control. He has wanted to cut strategic weapons further. [I was
sent]{.underline} out [to Europe as his negotiator]{.underline} to try
to do a daughter of CFE, to do a brand new conventional treaty. We
couldn't get it done because [Russia **refused to talk** about its
forces that were stationed in Georgia, Moldova against the will of those
governments.]{.underline} So we would love to do more, but it requires
trust, truth, addressing the situation as it is.

#### Ukraine food imports key to [sustainable development]{.underline} in Africa

Africa and UN Assistant Secretary General; \"Averting an African food
crisis caused by the war in Ukraine\", 5-16-2022,

In Nigeria in the late 1960s, one million people died of starvation
during the Biafran war. A decade and a half later, food shortages and
hunger in Ethiopia triggered by a natural disaster cost the lives of 1
million Africans.

[Today, a fresh disaster --- the war in **Ukraine** --- threatens to
plunge the continent into yet another episode of **famine** and
**deprivation.**]{.underline}

[Fourteen African countries **depend** on Russia and **Ukraine** for
more than half of their **wheat** imports, while almost **half** the
continent **depends** on imports for more than a third of their
wheat.]{.underline} Apart from the looming supply constraints, [this
crisis has already pushed food grain prices up by more than 25% in a
matter of weeks. Some countries are bracing for supply
shortfalls.]{.underline}

Millions in danger

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating socio-economic
impact across Africa, [the crisis in Ukraine threatens to place an
**inordinate burden** on African households --- many of which were
already struggling to put food on the table.]{.underline} Wandile
Sihlobo, Chief Economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber of South
Africa, anticipates [critical short-term supply and pricing effects ---
a **food crisis** --- unless the **conflict** is **resolved
expeditiously.**]{.underline}

Higher food prices mean that [**fewer** African households will be able
to **afford** a single decent daily meal. **Malnourishment** will
rise.]{.underline} Africa's [food-insecure households will be left much
further **behind.**]{.underline} Their [**consumption** rates will
**fall**, savings will be **depleted**, **debt** will increase, and
assets will be **liquidated.**]{.underline}

In short, in a food crisis, [millions will be in danger of malnutrition
and deepened **poverty.**]{.underline}

Some [African countries]{.underline}, such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, and
South Africa, [have domestic **price controls** and export restrictions
in place.]{.underline} Benin has instituted an export ban. Others ---
such as Malawi, Zambia, and Uganda --- offer cash subsidies to
vulnerable groups. But [with the sharp rise in fuel and energy prices,
another consequence of the situation in Ukraine, very few African
countries will have the fiscal space to sustain such policies, even if
they wished to pursue them.]{.underline}

Food crisis and human security

[Food insecurity in Africa is not just a socioeconomic issue. It is also
a matter of **human security.**]{.underline}

Rather than wars and insurgencies, [**riots** and protests now account
for over half of violent events in Africa]{.underline}, according to
data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED). Recent
[violent protests sparked by domestic price increases in Sierra Leone
illustrate how inflationary pressures can easily **foment
instability.**]{.underline} Recall, too, how the Arab revolts in the
early 2010s sparked protests across North Africa.

[High food prices]{.underline} typically [hit the most **vulnerable**
households **hardest**, making them "**multidimensionally
poor**,"]{.underline} meaning [they lack not just income but also access
to electricity, cooking fuel, and basic social services.]{.underline}
Shrinking budgets will cause households to dispose of their assets,
eroding their ability to cushion themselves against future shocks. These
[indirect effects of the food crisis will constrain economic activity,
widen **inequalities**, and could trigger social tensions and
unrest.]{.underline}

The impacts of the war in Ukraine on food security in Africa raise three
pertinent questions: Why is the continent with 60% of the world's arable
land unable to feed itself? Why is it difficult for African regions with
food surpluses to supply those with deficits? And how did Africa go from
a relatively self-sufficient food producer in the 1970s to an overly
dependent food importer by 2022?

Answering these questions will help chart a way forward to sustained and
sustainable food security across the continent.

That [food insecurity and food crisis have dire socio-economic and
security implications for Africa's people, households, businesses, and
governments are clear --- and these could have profound regional and
**global consequences.**]{.underline}

Now is not the time for a retreat of development efforts in Africa or a
diversion of resources from the continent. Strategic investments in
development and food security at this critical juncture will lay the
foundation for sustainability and self-sufficiency.

Preserving multilateralism for development

If Africa is to withstand this global shock, [the international
community's immediate efforts should include enhanced bilateral
assistance]{.underline}, innovative multilateral initiatives including a
swift re-channeling of IMF Special Drawing Rights, and support for
domestic resource mobilization.

[The war in Ukraine **cannot** be allowed to **weaken
multilateralism**]{.underline}, and development assistance must not
become a policy tool.

Consistent support from development partners is needed to put African
countries back on track towards shared global development aspirations.
Declining multilateralism would unravel decades of significant
development progress and roll back gains made in fighting COVID-19
globally. This is why the development community must redouble its
efforts to provide adequate and timely support across the continent.

An upcoming opportunity is the 8th Tokyo International Conference on
African Development (TICAD8) scheduled for August this year, where
[African leaders and their counterparts from Japan will come together to
**strengthen partnerships** and cooperation]{.underline}, with Africa in
the driver's seat. For nearly 30 years, the TICAD platform has
recognized that for Africa to achieve sustainable development, the
continent has to find homegrown solutions to its challenges.

Among the [**cornerstones** of **Africa-Japan relations** is an emphasis
on supporting African countries in their efforts to reduce their
dependency on food imports and thus avert a future food
crisis.]{.underline} Furthermore, Japan-funded projects acknowledge that
further investment in technology and the promotion of innovative
approaches to entrepreneurship will position Africa's youth to help spur
an African food production revolution.

[A starting point should be establishing policy frameworks and a
regulatory environment that promote agriculture and remove the perennial
credit, land tenure, market, and technology barriers that have
beleaguered food production and marketing for decades.]{.underline}
Opportunities presented by the African Continental Free Trade Area
arrangement must also be seized, to scale up production and benefit from
expanded regional markets.

[African countries should]{.underline}, once again, [be regional bread
baskets and powerhouses of sustainable and self-sufficient economic
development.]{.underline}

Established in 1936 and situated just 200 kilometers (125 miles) from
the sprawling megacity of Lagos, Akure-Ofosu Forest Reserve has long
been a sanctuary for Nigeria's diverse and dwindling wildlife. Species
such as red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), putty-nosed monkeys
(Cercopithecus nictitans) and perhaps even endangered Nigeria-Cameroon
chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes ellioti), roam its woodlands. Together with
neighboring Owo, Ohosu and Idanre forest reserves, Akure-Ofosu protects
one of the largest remaining tracts of forest in the country.

Or rather, it used to. Between 2002 and 2020 [Akure-Ofosu lost **44%**
of its primary forest]{.underline}, according to satellite data from the
University of Maryland (UMD) visualized on Global Forest Watch.
Preliminary data from UMD indicate [forest loss continued at a quick
pace in 2021, and has only increased so far in 2022.]{.underline}

Satellite data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) suggest fire may have been the driving force
behind much of Akure-Ofosu's most recent spate of forest loss. NASA data
show a spike in fire activity in the reserve in late January that burned
around 5,000 hectares of land -- higher than in years past, according to
analysis from Global Forest Watch.

Previous [reporting]{.underline} by Mongabay contributor Orji Sunday
[revealed fire and associated deforestation in Akure-Ofosu was being
driven by **logging** and **farming**, which, in turn, is **driven by**
the country's high rates of **poverty.**]{.underline}

"The cocoa farms in the reserves are growing," local farmer Omotunde
Kayode told Mongabay in 2020. "There are no jobs in the cities. So many
graduates, tired of the job hunts are taking over the reserves --- the
forest has many graduates."

Nigeria's population has exploded in the last century, from 36.7 million
in 1950 to 158.3 million in 2010, according to data from the United
Nations. But sources said job creation has not kept pace, forcing people
to choose between forests and their families.

["Forest **conservation** can **never** flourish in
**poverty,"**]{.underline} primatologist and professor Babafemi
Ogunjemite told Mongabay in 2020. ["The margin of the poverty level is
so high that **anyone** can sacrifice **anything** for food ---
including the forest."]{.underline}

Ogunjemite, a professor at the Federal University of Technology in
Akure, Nigeria, studies Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees. He said that he
believes [there may still be chimpanzees in Akure-Ofosu, but that there
likely won't be for much longer if deforestation continues as it
has.]{.underline}

Ogunjemite said that in addition to habitat loss, [**poaching** is also
a huge threat]{.underline} to Akure-Ofosu's chimpanzees and other
wildlife.

"The situation of [the animals in the reserve is
**critical,"**]{.underline} Ogunjemite told Mongabay.

Enforcement of forest protection has reportedly gone by the wayside,
with sources claiming government complicity in Akure-Ofosu's
deforestation. Kayode said "de-reservation" began decades ago when
authorities started letting farmers stake claim to portions of the
reserve.

"I felt the government \[lose\] hope of taking control of the reserve
from farmers at some point," a government official told Mongabay in 2020
on the condition of anonymity. "So they decided to formalize and
monetize reserve lands."

The official said farmers who moved into the reserve illegally are
allowed to keep their plots if they pay an annual fee of 10,000 naira
(\$26) per plot.

"The government calls us temporary occupants," Kayode said, "and we
\[have\] all the freedom to use the reserves so long as the fees are
renewed when due."

[The poverty rate]{.underline} in Nigeria, already high, only [appears
to be **rising.**]{.underline} According to a 2022 report from the World
Bank, 4 in 10 Nigerians -- about 80 million people -- were living in
poverty in 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic pushing another 5 million
people below the poverty line by 2022.

Balancing the needs of people with protection of the environment is a
challenging and widespread issue, said conservation biologist Elizabeth
Greengrass.

"In many of these forest reserves, [there are very few things
people]{.underline} (surrounding communities) [can do to survive except
hunt, farm or log the protected forests,"]{.underline} Greengrass told
Mongabay in 2020. "So many [communities in Nigeria are **heavily
dependent** on the forest.]{.underline} It is [creating serious problems
for conservation not just in Nigeria but most parts of
Africa."]{.underline}

But Greengrass said livelihoods and conservation don't have to be
contradictory, saying it's possible for rural economic development and
conservation goals to go hand-in-hand to "create jobs and absorb those
whose livelihoods had always come from the forest."

#### Africa's forests are the ["lungs of the world"]{.underline}\-\--[best]{.underline} internal link to [climate change]{.underline}

**Fleshman 08** (Michael Fleshman; **[\"Saving Africa's forests, the
'lungs of the world'\"]{.underline}**, January 2008,

It is difficult to imagine that such [vast ancient **woodlands** are at
risk of **extinction.**]{.underline} But they are disappearing at an
alarming rate. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), indigenous (also known as "old-growth") forests in Africa are
being cut down at a rate of more than 4 mn hectares per year --- twice
the world's deforestation average. According to the FAO, losses totalled
more than 10 per cent of the continent's total forest cover between 1980
and 1995 alone.

[Saving **Africa's forests** from the chainsaw and axe of encroaching
humanity is **essential**]{.underline} to the health and productivity of
much of the continent's economy, experts point out. They cite [the
forests' roles as **watersheds**, defences against **soil erosion** and
regulators of local **weather conditions.**]{.underline}

Trees trap 'greenhouse gases'

[But the fate of the forests could also spell the difference between
**success** and **failure** in the race against **global warming.**
Trees]{.underline}, the dominant inhabitants of the diverse and complex
ecological systems called forests, [are]{.underline} among [the world's
largest and most efficient living storehouses of **carbon
monoxide**]{.underline}, the "greenhouse gas" most responsible for the
earth's temperature rise and changes in the planet's climate (see Africa
Renewal July 2007).

Through a chemical process known as photosynthesis, trees and many other
plants absorb carbon from the air and combine it with sunlight to
generate the energy they need for life. Trees convert the carbon gas
into solid form, store it in their trunks, branches and leaves, and
release oxygen back into the atmosphere. Because they take carbon from
the atmosphere and produce oxygen, forests are often referred to as "the
lungs of the world." Carbon dioxide is generated primarily by the
burning of oil, coal, natural gas and other "fossil" fuels for industry,
power generation and transportation.

[**Preserving** Africa's **surviving** tropical **forests** and planting
new trees to replace those lost to deforestation could help **reduce**
the severity of **climate change**]{.underline} by absorbing more carbon
from the air, and ease the local impact of climate change by regulating
local weather conditions.

But an even greater argument for protecting the forests is [the role of
**deforestation** in **causing** global **warming.**]{.underline}
According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), between [20 and 25 per
cent of all annual carbon dioxide emissions are caused by the practice
of **burning forests** to clear the land for farming]{.underline} ---
more than is caused by the entire world transportation sector. Burning
trees and brush releases the stored carbon back into the atmosphere.

[Poor forest management policies]{.underline} --- including unrestricted
logging, excessive harvesting of firewood and medicinal plants, and road
construction --- [**contribute** to the problem]{.underline}, as do
drought, flooding, forest fires and other natural disasters. The
collection of wood for heating and cooking and for making charcoal is a
particular problem in Africa, since wood supplies about 70 per cent of
domestic energy needs, a significantly higher percentage than in the
rest of the world.

Estimates of the total amount of carbon stored in the forests vary
greatly. One estimate, based on research by the UN-sponsored
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), put the total at about
1,000 bn tonnes, or about 166 years' worth of current global carbon
emissions. Africa contains about 15 per cent of the world's remaining
forests and is second only to South America in the amount of the dense
tropical forests that are the most effective in removing carbon from the
atmosphere. The vast forests of the DRC alone are estimated to contain
as much as 8 per cent of all the carbon stored in the earth's
vegetation.

[The conversion of forest land to agriculture]{.underline}, both
subsistence and commercial, [is by far the most common and most
**destructive** cause of deforestation in Africa]{.underline} and other
tropical regions. As demand for farmland grows in response to population
pressures, millions of hectares of tropical forests are being put to the
torch in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

"It is generally accepted," the FAO noted in a 2000 report on
sustainable forestry in Africa, "that the key to arresting deforestation
and to implementing sustainable forest development lies in improved
technologies for food production."

Improving the productivity of African agriculture is a top priority for
African governments and features prominently in the continent's
development agenda, the New Partnership for Africa's Development
(NEPAD). But [transforming the poorly financed and long-neglected
agricultural sector is a costly, difficult and long-term
goal]{.underline} (see Africa Renewal July 2006). [**Reform** therefore
appears **unlikely** to progress quickly enough to **prevent** further
severe **losses** to the continent's woodlands.]{.underline}

In the meantime, improving governments' ability to manage their forest
resources, expanding reforestation programmes and changing public
perceptions and economic calculations about the value of existing
forests could be the key to the survival of Africa's deep woods.

Forests and people

The challenges are formidable. Humanity has long appreciated forests for
the energy, food and medicine they provide, and as a source of wood
products for construction and other purposes. But [the role of forests
in supporting agriculture, preserving biodiversity, protecting water
supplies and moderating the impact of climate change are less well
understood.]{.underline} The UN estimated that in 2000 some 1.6 billion
people around the world, including many of the world's poorest, derived
at least part of their food, income or medical needs directly from the
forest. Of those, some [**70 million** indigenous people **depend** on
the forests for much of their livelihoods.]{.underline}

[Africa's rural poor are particularly **dependent** on its
forests.]{.underline} Although forest products, primarily unfinished
logs, account for only about 2 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's exports,
forests generate an average of 6 per cent of the region's gross domestic
product --- triple the world average. Eighteen African countries,
including Cameroon and Ghana, are among the 24 countries worldwide that
rely on forests for 10 per cent or more of their economies.

Although environmentalists and advocacy groups have brought
international attention to unsustainable, and often illegal, logging in
Central and West Africa, about half of all the wood extracted from
Africa's forests is used domestically as fuel. Despite the enormous
losses to deforestation, the region is a net importer of processed wood
products.

The perception of indigenous forests as a reservoir of unused land and a
safety net for bad times is understandable, UNEP forestry expert
Christian Lambrechts told Africa Renewal. "People have to rely on the
forest to gain access to specific products they can't buy on the
market," he says. "They have no cash. They can't go to the chemist. They
have to go to the forest to extract medicinal plants."

[Such "subsistence" exploitation of the forests is **inevitable** in
areas of high **poverty** and causes no damage when done
sustainably]{.underline}, Mr. Lambrechts notes. But [when large numbers
of people are forced to use forests for food and fuel, "it has a local
impact on the degradation of the forests."]{.underline}

TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY AUTO MANUFACTURING CLUSTERS: BATTERIES, CHIPS, AND
FACTORY UPGRADES

[Motor vehicle production in the United States has created **clusters**
of economic activity. O]{.underline}riginal [e]{.underline}quipment
[m]{.underline}anufacturer (OEM) [assembly plants and those that make
core parts **attract** and support **suppliers**---from tier one
suppliers that produce significant components]{.underline} like
suspensions and chassis [to tier two and tier three suppliers that
produce less complex components.]{.underline} Local
[universities]{.underline} can [play a]{.underline} pivotal [role as
**talent pipelines**, innovation **centers**, and testing locations for
**AV** research and development of **smart vehicles.**]{.underline} Key
examples of this include the Ohio State University\'s Center for
Automotive Research and the University of Michigan\'s Mcity, which each
collaborates with industry partners in Detroit and Columbus to [target
**resources** toward the exploration and testing of advanced automotive
technologies and the cultivation of a highly skilled and engaged future
workforce. These clusters]{.underline} have [generated]{.underline}
three **[benefits]{.underline}**: intra-industry benefits like access to
specialized workers and a pool of supporting goods and services;
inter-industry spillovers stemming from the spread of knowledge across
industries; and spinoffs, or new firms created by former employees from
the industry.

[Automakers expect that]{.underline} within five years, [electric
vehicles will cost the **same amount** to produce as internal combustion
vehicles.]{.underline} Industry trends suggest that the vast majority of
level four and five autonomous vehicles will be battery-powered electric
vehicles.1 Given the right regulatory environment, [**electrified AVs**
would likely quickly achieve scale. Widespread adoption of **EVs** is
generally considered a **natural step** toward widespread **AV
deployment**. The EV architecture provides the power, voltage, and
energy storage required by AVs that internal combustion engine vehicles
cannot. Estimates of]{.underline} the [power]{.underline} requirements
for AVs [vary widely]{.underline}---from 200 watts to over 2,000
watts---based on variables like chip design, algorithm efficiency, and
types and volume of sensors used. There is concern that the amount of
power required for autonomous functions would reduce vehicle range.
However, [models suggest that **power demand** from autonomous functions
can be **mitigated** and eventually **offset** by designing more
aerodynamic vehicles, lighter vehicles, and improving route efficiency
via automation.]{.underline}

Utilities will need to invest in improving grid capacity and the ability
to meet higher energy demand to serve electric vehicles and ultimately
AVs. Required investments to manage the EV transition will vary by
region. In some states, overall capacity is less of a concern compared
to the ability to meet rapid demand spikes---for instance, in the
evening when commuters return home from work and charge their vehicles.
Charging during off-peak hours for electricity use would ease the
transition. Utilities could also incentivize customers to charge at
certain hours or locations to smooth demand spikes. Further, energy
demand in the United States has hardly grown over the past 10 years
while capacity has grown by roughly 12 gigawatts (about 1 percent of the
1,100 gigawatts of total installed generation capacity in the United
States in 2020) a year, roughly enough capacity to service six million
new EVs, according to the Department of Energy. The EV transition will
occur over decades, not years. This suggests that the current pace of
energy production expansion is sufficient to meet demand required by the
transition to EVs and ultimately AVs.

The impending shift to EVs and AVs has generated two primary concerns
with regard to the U.S. workforce. First, EVs, being less mechanically
complex than internal combustion vehicles and composed of more modular
parts, will require less labor and fewer workers to build, and core
components will be imported. The long-term trajectory of automotive
production clusters in the Midwest and Southeast is only starting to
take shape amid the accelerating transition to EVs and AVs. Second,
there is a risk that [the technology required for large scale deployment
of EVs and AVs will be manufactured **outside** the **U**nited
**S**tates. **Shortages** of **semiconductors** owed to **chokepoints**
in global supply chains slowed automobile production in early
2021.]{.underline} China now has the edge in lithium-ion battery
manufacturing and maintains dominant positions throughout the supply
chain, from raw material refining to component manufacturing.

However, the right policy environment and effective use of existing
advantages and relationships within the U.S. automotive industry should,
in turn, create an opportunity for a manufacturing renaissance in the
United States that brings with it new jobs in the industry. Further,
[the transition to AVs composing the majority of the U.S. automotive
fleet will take decades]{.underline}, particularly for level five
autonomous vehicles. [This gradual transition will **smooth
disruptions** to the workforce and provide time for the labor pipeline
to adjust to the new automotive supply chain.]{.underline}

Investment in domestic capacity to produce EVs, and eventually AVs,
appears poised for a breakout, and early signs suggest that automakers
will improve existing facilities to produce EVs and AVs, keeping the
anchors of automotive production clusters in place. The United States is
home to some of the top global early-stage battery research and research
into the technology that underlies autonomous vehicles. However, the
United States does not offer the same level of support to those
industries as offered by other countries, such as China and, to a lesser
extent, the European Union.

That is likely to change. The Biden administration has made clear it
intends to use an array of government levers to juice battery production
in the United States and catalyze major manufacturing revitalization.
Political pressure is growing to employ measures that will encourage
domestic production of semiconductors. Government policy will also
likely encourage U.S. manufacturing and the use of U.S. labor in
developing and producing EVs and AVs. While the current regulatory
environment for AVs does not provide a path to large-scale manufacturing
and deployment, the Trump administration laid the groundwork for AV
development and manufacturing to create U.S. jobs. The United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement requires that 75 percent of a passenger
vehicle's value originate in North America for it to receive duty-free
treatment, and that 75 percent of "core parts," including advanced
batteries, originate in North America.

The Biden administration is poised to take further steps to ensure key
EV, and by extension AV, parts are made in the United States. The
president's executive order will undertake a review of supply chains in
key industries and focus on advanced batteries, semiconductors, and rare
earth minerals, all building blocks of electric and autonomous vehicles.
Additionally, Biden lorplans to replace the government's 600,000 vehicle
fleet with EVs, generating significant predictable demand over the
coming years. In 2019, the government owned less than 3,000 EVs.

If adopted, a combination of government incentives and regulatory
changes to encourage EV and AV adoption---including through investments
in underlying technologies and infrastructure such as critical minerals,
semiconductors, and other next generation technology---is estimated to
create over 220,000 U.S. jobs and support another 425,000 over one to
five years, according to a study from Keybridge Public Policy Economics.
The study assumes four sets of incentives are provided for the
manufacturing and purchase of EVs along with the buildout of charging
infrastructure; three programs to support the creation of critical
mineral supply chains outside of China's control; a domestic
semiconductor and telecommunications manufacturing package; and the
modernization of federal regulations to support AV adoption.

While powertrain simplicity in EVs may result in fewer labor
requirements for production, production will drive new employment
opportunities in advanced manufacturing, including battery assembly,
electric motors, advanced driving systems, and semiconductors. To that
end, automakers have already announced billions of dollars' worth of
upgrades to existing manufacturing facilities, and parts suppliers
estimate thousands of dollars' worth of new opportunities around
electrification and automation.

To maintain and improve the workforce, pipeline automakers, other
industry actors, government stakeholders, and education and training
institutions continue to cooperate on curriculum development, internship
and apprenticeship opportunities, and other paths to reskilling and
upskilling. New components and systems, including advanced driver assist
systems below full level five automation, will require upskilling
workers throughout the supply chain---from engineering and design to
software development to those on the factory floor and in repair shops.

EVs and AVs will require infrastructure investment to meet their full
potential. A massive buildout of charging stations and upgrades to the
electrical grid will be necessary as EV sales continue to grow, creating
thousands of jobs. Finally, [cities and states will invest in smart
infrastructure to improve vehicle connectivity, which will not only
create jobs but create long-term **economic** and **environmental
benefits** as a result of reduced congestion, travel time, and more
efficient movement of goods and people.]{.underline} These factors will
encourage [industry to continue to **tap into** U.S. **manufacturing**
and the U.S. workforce as the EV and AV transitions unfold.]{.underline}

#### AVs key to a new wave of [creative jobs]{.underline}

Societal Benefits of AVs

When we consider a future in which every car on the road is connected
and driving is fully automated via the cloud, it's easy to jump to the
dystopian conclusion that driverless cars will put close to 5 million
truckers, cabbies and other drivers out of work. The immediate threat to
jobs is a reality that we need to confront. One solution to the job loss
from automation is Universal Basic Income.

[However, in the long run, AVs could be **profoundly beneficial** to
society in various ways. To **offset** the several **jobs** that the
**driverless** world will **destroy**, it will **create** many **new,
exciting ones.** These new jobs are likely to involve more **human
interaction** or **creativity.**]{.underline} For instance, [new
companies will]{.underline} emerge that provide customer service for AVs
or that analyze and [process the large amounts of data]{.underline}
extracted from AVs. Similarly, as more companies enter the AV industry,
[jobs will open up to **design**, **innovate**, **program** and
**further automate** vehicles for the future.]{.underline}

It seems beyond debate: [Technology is going to **replace
jobs**]{.underline}, or, more precisely, the people holding those jobs.
Few industries, if any, will be untouched.

Knowledge workers will not escape. Recently, the CEO of Deutsche Bank
predicted that half of its 97,000 employees could be replaced by robots.
One survey revealed that "39% of jobs in the legal sector could be
automated in the next 10 years. Separate research has concluded that
accountants have a 95% chance of losing their jobs to automation in the
future."

And for those in manufacturing or production companies, the future may
arrive even sooner. That same report mentioned the advent of "robotic
bricklayers." Machine learning algorithms are also predicted to replace
people responsible for "optical part sorting, automated quality control,
failure detection, and improved productivity and efficiency." Quite
simply, machines are better at the job: The National Institute of
Standards predicts that "machine learning can improve production
capacity by up to 20%" and reduce raw materials waste by 4%.

It is easy to find reports that predict the loss of between 5 and 10
million jobs by 2020. Recently, space and automotive titan Elon Musk
said the machine-over-mankind threat was humanity's "biggest existential
threat." Perhaps that is too dire a reading of the future, but what is
important for corporate leaders right now is to avoid the catastrophic
mistake of ignoring how people will be affected. Here are four ways to
think about the people left behind after the trucks bring in all the new
technology.

In Oz, the wizard is shown to run the kingdom through some complex
machine hidden behind a curtain. Many executives may think themselves
the wizard; enthralled by the idea that AI technology will allow them to
shed millions of dollars in labor costs, they could come to believe that
the best company is the one with the fewest people aside from the CEO.

Yet the CEO and founder of Fetch Robotics, Melonee Wise, cautions
against that way of thinking: ["For **every robot** we put in the world,
you have to have **someone** maintaining it or **servicing** it or
taking care of it."]{.underline} The point of [tech]{.underline}nology,
she argues, [is to **boost productivity**, not cut the
workforce.]{.underline}

McKinsey has been studying what kind of work is most adaptable to
automation. Their findings so far seem to conclude that the more
technical the work, the more technology can accomplish it. In other
words, [machines skew toward **tactical applications.**]{.underline}

On the other hand, [work that requires a **high degree of imagination**,
creative analysis, and **strategic thinking** is **harder** to
**automate.**]{.underline} As McKinsey put it in a recent report: "The
hardest activities to automate with currently available technologies are
those that involve managing and developing people (9 percent automation
potential) or that apply expertise to decision making, planning, or
creative work (18 percent)." Computers are great at optimizing, but not
so great at goal-setting. Or even using common sense.

When technology comes in, and some workers go away, there is a residual
fear among those still in place at the company. It's only natural for
them to ask, "Am I next? How many more days will I be employed here?"
Venture capitalist Bruce Gibney explains it this way: "Jobs may not seem
like 'existential' problems, but they are: When people cannot support
themselves with work at all --- let alone with work they find meaningful
--- they clamor for sharp changes. Not every revolution is a good
revolution, as Europe has discovered several times. Jobs provide both
material comfort and psychological gratification, and when these goods
disappear, people understandably become very upset."

The wise corporate leader will realize that post-technology trauma falls
along two lines: (1) how to integrate the new technology into the work
flow, and (2) how to cope with feelings that the new technology is
somehow "the enemy." Without dealing with both, even the most automated
workplace could easily have undercurrents of anxiety, if not anger.

Technology will replace some work, but it doesn't have to replace the
people who have done that work. Economist James Bessen notes, "The
problem is people are losing jobs and we're not doing a good job of
getting them the skills and knowledge they need to work for the new
jobs."

For example, a study in Australia found a silver lining in the
automation of bank tellers' work: "While ATMs took over a lot of the
tasks these tellers were doing, it gave existing workers the opportunity
to upskill and sell a wider ranges of financial services."

Moreover, the report found that [there is a **growing range** of new job
opportunities in the fields of big **data analysis**, **decision
support** analysts, remote-control **vehicle operators**, **customer
experience** experts, **personalized preventative health helpers**, and
**online chaperones**]{.underline} ("managing online risks such as
identify theft, reputational damage, social media bullying and
harassment, and internet fraud"). Such jobs may not be in your current
industrial domain. But there may be other ways for you to view this
moment as the perfect time to rethink the shape and character of your
workforce. [Such new thinking will generate a whole **new** human
**resource development agenda**, one quite probably **emphasizing**
those **innate human capacities** that can provide a renewed strategy
for success that is both technological and human.]{.underline}

As Wise, the roboticist, emphasized, [the technology itself is just a
**tool**, one that leaders can use how they see fit. We can choose to
use AI and other emerging technologies to replace human work, or we can
choose to use them to augment it.]{.underline} "Your computer doesn't
unemploy you, your robot doesn't unemploy you," she said. "The companies
that have those technologies make the social policies and set those
social policies that change the workforce."

There is no denying that [the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the
challenges faced by many cities across the globe.]{.underline} From
digital connectivity to safety and security, education and work, we have
already seen some sections of society progress in leaps and bounds,
whilst the challenges for others have been laid bare. [As we emerged
from a turbulent 18 months, the case for smart cities appears to be
stronger than ever.]{.underline}

[A smart city]{.underline} is a place [where traditional networks and
services are made more efficient with the use of digital]{.underline}
and telecommunication [technologies for the benefit of its
inhabitants]{.underline} and businesses. Insights gained from that data
are used to manage assets, resources and services efficiently; in
return, that [data is used to improve operations]{.underline} across the
city.

It means smarter [urban transport networks, upgraded water supply and
waste disposal]{.underline} facilities [and more efficient
ways]{.underline} to light and heat buildings. [It also means a more
interactive and responsive city administration and safer public spaces.
Smart cities are a "system of systems".]{.underline} These can include
smart lighting systems, [building automation systems,]{.underline}
emergency [management systems]{.underline}, security and access control
systems, intelligent grids, renewable power, [water treatment and
supply]{.underline}, transportation, [and more.]{.underline}

#### Otherwise, loss of [megacities]{.underline} is an inevitable [existential risk]{.underline}\-\--increased technological efficiency is key to solve

CLIMATE CHANGE: AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO URBAN CIVILIZATION

The Birds o f Canada (Earl, 1966) lists Anna's hummingbird (Calypte
anna) as a California breeder, merely 'hypothetical' in Canada. Yet,
through winter o f 2018-19. three Anna's jousted daily for position at
my backyard feeder in Vancouver, Canada, and by spring were nesting
somewhere in the neighbourhood.

The [climate change]{.underline} that has shifted birds\' ranges
northward is real, but its [effects]{.underline} not always so benign.
In 2017 and 2018. British Columbia [experienced]{.underline} two
back-to-back 'worst ever' **[wildfire seasons]{.underline}**; the
deadliest wildfires on record torched California in 2018, destroying
thousands of buildings and killing 85 people; [**droughts** are becoming
**longer** and **more severe**]{.underline}, **[storms]{.underline}**
more intensely energetic; and record temperatures arc destroying
wildlife and livestock, property and people on every continent. Indeed,
extreme weather events o f all kinds are rcllcctcd in the economic costs
o f climate-related disasters globally S89S billion (in 2017 dollars)
between 1978 and 1997; S2.25 trillion between 1998 and 2017, a 151
percent increase (McCarthy, 2018).

The main anthropogenic driver o f climate change is carbon dioxide, the
greatest metabolic waste by weight of industrial economics and an
inevitable cntropic by-product of fossil-fuel combustion. Atmospheric
CO? readings in April 2018 averaged over 410 parts per million (ppm) for
the entire month for the first time on record (US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration \|NOAA\], 2018). This is a human-induced
increase o f 46 percent above prc-industrial levels o f -280 parts per
million and elevates atmospheric carbon to Us highest levels in 800 000
years. CO, is still climbing by 2-3 parts per million (ppm) annually and
concentrations o f other GHGs are increasing as fast or faster.
(Atmospheric CO; averaged 417 ppm during May 2020 \[US National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration \[NOAAJ 2020\].)

One result is that mean global temperature has climbed by approximately
1춿C, mostly since 1980. A statistically improbable 17 o f the 18 warmest
years in the instrumental record have occurred in this young century
(National Aeronautics and Space Administration \[NASAJ, 2017); 2016 was
the warmest year; 2017 was second followed by 2015 and 2018 - 'the past
five years arc, collectively, the warmest years in the modem record'
(NASA. 2019). When the world was last this warm (the Ecmian period 130
000 115 000 years ago) sea levels eventually rose 6-9 metres (20-30
feet), sufficient to inundate most o f today's coastal towns and
mcgacitics. (For an outstanding summary of climate change, likely
outcomes, and policy implications, sec Hansen, 2018.)

The Inadequate 2015 Paris Climate Agreement

Our best science tells us that the world is currently on track to
experience 3 5춿C warming. There is no dispute that 5춿C
[warming]{.underline} would be catastrophic, likely fatal to civilized
existence. Even a \'modest' 3춿C implies disaster - enough to destroy
economies, [destabilize]{.underline} **[geopolitics]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[empty megacities]{.underline}**. Parties to the
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change therefore
committed in the 2015 COP21 Paris Agreement to hold the rise in global
average temperatures to 'well below 2춿C above pre-industrial levels and
pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5춿C above
pre-industrial levels' (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
\|IPCCJ, 2018).

Regrettably, the voluntary commitments (nationally determined
contributions or NDCs) made in Paris constitute only one-third o f the
reductions needed to limit warming to 2춿C; even if fully met. they put
us on track for 3+춿C. System dynamics confounds the issue. There is a
-40-year lag between causc and effect bccause of ocean thermal inertia
(the seas absorb 90 percent o f accumulating heat but warm slowly).
Present GHG concentrations, if held constant, commit the world to an
additional 0.3 0.8춿C warming, enough to overshoot the l.5춿C limit
(Hansen, 2018; Marshall, 2010).\* Ominously, CO, and other GHG emissions
are still increasing. It is therefore particularly conccming that the
parties to the Paris Agreement discussed or endorsed mainly
capital-intcnsivc technological solutions from green energy (e.g.. wind
and solar), through unproved approaches to carbon capture and storage
and even nuclear fission and fusion, that is, any techno-solution that
would contribute to investment and growth Reductions in energy/resource
use, fair income redistribution and population controls were not on the
table. In short, the real commitment of the international community is
to technological solutions that will sustain growth and not jeopardize
the current social and economic system. This is the status quo by other
means. Perversely, climate disaster policy is being designed to serve
the capitalist growth economy 'so the latter becomes the solution to
(not the cause of) the \[problem\]' (Spash, 2016, p. 931). There is
another problem recent analysis suggests that:

> biogcophysical fccdback processes (e.g., permafrost melting, methane
> hydrate releases, tropical and boreal forest die-hack\] within ihc
> Earth System coupled with direct human degradation of the biosphere
> may play a more important role than normally assumed. . .there is a
> significant risk that these internal dynamics, especially strong
> nonlineantio in feedback processes, could become an important or
> perhaps, even dominant factor (Steffen ct a!., 2018. p. 8253)

Indeed, 'even if the Paris Accord target o f a 1.5- 2.0춿C rise in
temperature is met, we cannot exclude the risk that a cascade o f
feedbacks could push the Earth System irreversibly onto a 'Hothouse
Earth' pathway (ibid., p. 8254).7

To neutralize this risk, Rockstrom ct al. (2017) assert that the world
community must cut fossil fuel use in half each decade until 2050, as
well as extract gigaionncs (Gt) o f carbon out o f the atmosphere, all
while shining society to alternative green energy. Similarly, an IPCC
Special Report on l.5춿C warming and possible emissions pathways found
that in 'model pathways with no or limited overshoot o f 1.5춿C, global
net anthropogenic CO, emissions decline by about 45 percent from 2010
levels by 2030.. .reaching net zero around 2050\* (IPCC, 2018, p. C l).
All such pathways require 'the use o f carbon dioxide removal (Cl)R) on
the order of 100 1000 Gt CO, over the 21st century' (ibid., p. C3).

Significantly for megacities, limiting warming to 1.5춿C would require
rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and
infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial
systems'. The scale o f the needed transition is unprecedented and
implies 'deep emissions reductions in all sectors, a wide portfolio of
mitigation options and a significant upscaling o f investments in those
options' (IPCC, 2018, p. C2). So far, no city has taken up the IPCC
challenge.

[**ENERGY**: THE **ACHILLES' HEEL** OF EVERY MEGACITY]{.underline}

The technological outlook for a transition to renewable 'green' energy
is superficially encouraging. 'Solar photovoltaic and wind power arc
rapidly getting cheaper and more abundant - so much so that they arc on
track to entirely supplant fossil fuels worldwide within two decades'
(Blakcrs and Stocks. 2018); and do not worry about solar arrays and wind
farms despoiling the countryside: 'if we cover an area of the fcarth 335
kilometers by 335 kilometers with solar panels\...it will provide more
than 17.4 TW power\... That means 1.2 percent of the Sahara Desert is
sufficient to cover all o f the energy needs o f the world in solar
energy' (Moalcm, 2016). Jacobson et al. (2015, p. 2093) propose a set o
f 'roadmaps for converting the energy infrastructures of each o f the 50
United States to 100% wind, water, and sunlight (WWS) for all purposes
(electricity, transportation, heating/cooling, and industry) by 2050\'.
This conversion, allegedly both technologically and economically
feasible, would virtually eliminate energy-related pollution and GHG
emissions while creating jobs, stabilizing energy priccs and minimizing
land requirements.

Such [ebullient scenarios generate **unwarranted confidence** in human
techno-prowess]{.underline} and have convinced many that the necessary
energy transition is easy and already well underway. This is not so. The
transition to renewables is a politically loaded, economically
formidable and technologically daunting challenge framed in confusion
and contradiction. Opposing narratives on prospects for a 100 percent
green energy system by 2030/50 abound (e.g.. Energy Watch Group, 2018;
Mills 2019). In a well-known dispute. Clack ct al. (2017, p. 6722)
condemn the buoyant Jacobson ct al. (2015) study for significant errors,
inappropriate modelling methods and implausible, ill-documcntcd
assumptions that ovcrpromise and potentially '(impede\] the move to a
cost-cffcctivc decarbonized energy system' (see also Bryce, 2017).
(icrmany's much-lauded but faltering energy transition (
'Energiewemie\') serves as a practical cautionary tale: investment in
renewable rcachcd 464 billion euros by the end o f 2015 without
significantly reducing German carbon emissions or dependence on fossil
fuels (FerToni, Guckos and Hopkirk, 2017; Shcllcnberger, 2019).

The reality is that, in 2019. the world remains hooked on fossil fuels.
Renewables (wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and waste) did sec the
highest rate o f growth in 2017 but together supplied only onc-quartcr
of a 2.1 percent increase and only 3.6 percent of total energy demand;
wind and solar just 2.2 percent (British Petroleum \[BP\], 2018;
International Energy Agency \[IEA\|, 2018). Similarly, energy demand was
up by 2.3 percent in 2018, with fossil fuels accounting for 70 percent o
f the increase (IEA, 2019). (The corresponding numbers in BP, 2019 are
2.9 percent and 66.5 percent, respectively.) The installed capacity o f
wind and solar electricity, particularly solar, is rising rapidly and in
2018 produced 1270 tcrawatt hours (TWh) and 585 TWh, respectively. I
lowcvcr, the increase in global demand for electricity was 938 TWh. 70
percent more than the total generated by all existing solar photovoltaic
installations. Just two years o f global demand increase would swallow
the entire contribution from more than three dccadcs o f wind and solar
power development (data from BP, 2019). In 2019, wind and solar
generation increased spectacularly by 12.6% and 24.3% respectively,
contributing an additional 300 Twh to the world's electricity grid.
Nevertheless, although global electricity demand growth at 352.5 Twh
(1.3%) in 2019 was less than half the ten year average growth rate, it
was sufficient to outpacc the growth from all non-hydro renewables
combined (data from BP, 2020). Moreover, there is concern that green
investment has been essentially flat sincc 2011. It actually fell
substantially in several major countries in 2017 (36 percent in Europe
overall) as subsidies were reduced. Only China's 26 percent expansion
helped bump global investment up by 3 percent in 2017 (Frankfurt School
o f Finance & Management, 2018; Gorcham, 2018). Analysts agree that 'the
current level o f investment \[S300\* billion a ycar\| is\...too low to
support a global transition to renewable electricity' (Andrews, 2018a).
(The SARS-CoV-2 pandcmic has added another layer o f uncertainty to
global energy investment of all kinds.)

In any ease, green power generation 'will not on its own deliver the
emissions reductions demanded by the Paris climate agreement' (Renewable
Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, p. 6). Electricity is not
yet a viable substitute for fossil fuel in key areas accounting for 80
percent of urban society's energy consumption including mining, various
industrial processes, heavy construction, inter-city transportation (air
or highway) and agriculture. Investment in green energy technologies
will have to increase multifold if it is to keep up with growing demand
and capture a greater share of the total energy market (Club o f Rome.
2018). Securing that investment will become more difficult with reduced
government subsidies, particularly if substantial subsidies remain for
fossil fuels\' and global interest rates keep increasing.

There are also significant systemic problems. Recent simulations show
that, even if investment in renewables increased by 2030 to the present
total investment in new energy (approximately \$1.8 trillion in 2017),
fossil fuels would still be providing more than 50 percent o f primary
energy and emissions would be increasing again after 2035 - and this
assumes an optimistic non-declining 'energy return on energy invested'
(ERoEI or EROI) for renewables of 15:1. 'In this case, as renewables
still require some fossil fuel energy to construct, it is essentially
impossible for the cconomy to meet its energy demands and remain below
the emissions ceiling' (Scrs and Victor, 2018, p. 14). Scrs and Victor
call this 'the cncrgy-cmissions trap'.

More realistically, the ERoEI o f renewables is lower than 15:1 and
likely declining, so 'the long run conscqucncc o f transitioning to
renewables.. .at sufficient pace to avoid transgressing cumulative
emissions limits is a decline in the net energy available to society'.
At 17 percent of GDP and an ERoEI o f 3:1, 'the redirection of
investment from the secondary productive sector to the primary energy
sector leads to a constraint on the productive capacity o f the cconomy
and a commensurate decline in output\' (Scrs and Victor, 2018. p. 17).
That is, the economy implodes - hardly the future anticipated by
mainstream analysts.

EKoF.I and Megacitics

The F.RoF.I concept is central to energy analysis yet remains mired in
controversy. Most ERoEI studies estimate the ratio o f the energy
produced by a project divided by the sum of the direct (i.e.. onsite)
and indirect (i.e., offsitc energy needed to make the products used
onsite) energy used to generate that output. This measure gives a
satisfying global average FRoEl for coal of 46:1; for important liquid
and gaseous fossil fuels and wind, about 20:1; solar 10:1 (Hall. Lambert
and Balogh. 2014).

Controversy blooms when analysts 'extend' (ERoEItu) their assessments
beyond on-site requirements. Kcrroni and Hopkirk (2016) and Fcrroni ct
al. (2017) considered the energy expended on materials, labour, and so
forth, for the manufacturing, transportation, installation. operation,
decommissioning, integration o f the intermittent photovoltaic (PV)
generated electricity into the Swiss and German grids (including the
energy demand for auxiliary storage capacity) and for obtaining and
servicing the required capital. Result? An ERoEItxi o f only 0.82 (+/-
15 percent). This implies that an electrical supply system based on
today\'s PV technologies in cool northern countries may turn out to be
an energy sink, not a source.11 Spain - arguably Europe\'s best
insolatcd country actually is not doing much better. Prieto and Hall
(2013) found an ERoEIct( o f only 2.45:1 for that country's extensive
centralized PV system. Most recently De Castro and Capcllin-Pcrcz (2020)
demonstrate that the global average ERoEIsetl for onshore wind (2.9:1),
offshore wind (2.3:1), solar Photovoltaic (PV) (1.8:1), and solar
Concentrated Solar Power (\< l: I ) arc well below that of
fossil-fuelled electricity generation (and. we might add, insufficient
to run modem civilization).

What docs all this mean for mcgacities? First, consider that the
standard ERoEI o f major fuels is steadily declining as source quality
declines and extraction costs increase - it is only 5:1 to 4:1 for tar
sands and less for shale oil, for example. Second, if the more dismal
results o f ERoEIrti for solar PV prove correct, today\'s green energy
cannot substitute fo r fossil fuels. Question: at what point will it
become impossible to sustain megacitics? (Hall ct al., 2014 suggest that
'fuel' requires an ERoEIfi\| of 3:1 to be minimally useful to society.)
Falling F.RoEIs and rising energy costs are already being implicated in
everything from the doubtful promise o f electric vehicles (Gochring and
Rozcncwajg. 2018) to Brexit and the so-called yellow-vcst protests in
France (Ahmed, 2018).

Can We Make the Transition?

There are additional political and technical barriers to meeting even
the 2춿C warming limit. We need an unprecedented level of cooperation
among major governments but in today\'s fractious world, with major
emitters like the US 'dropping out' and others like Canada bent on
developing their fossil-fuel reserves, this prerequisite will almost
certainly not be met.

Even if world governments were to align in common purpose, the sheer
momentum of industrial society is formidable. Driven by exponential
growth, half the fossil energy and other key resources ever consumed
have been used in ju st the past 30-35 years (see graphs in Steffen ct
al., 2015). Thus, most of the infrastructure and equipment involved in
electricity generation, manufacturing, transportation, communications,
construction, spacc/watcr heating, food systems, and so on, across the
modem world arc fuelled by coal, oil or natural gas. And, as noted, the
addiction persists. After flattening for three years, carbon emissions
increased by almost 1.5 percent in 2017 and 1.7 percent in 2018 (IEA,
2018, 2019; Le Qucrc et al., 2018). In these circumstances, it stretchcs
credulity to think the world can organize to reduce fossil fuel use by
nearly 50 percent (-7 percent per year) in just 10 years.10

A fu ll transition to green alternative energy - the 100 percent
substitution o f fossil fuels by renewable sources (wind, solar,
biomass, hydro) while meeting a projected doubling of demand over the
next several decades - implies at least a 50-fold increase in net
renewable energy generation capacity, particularly of wind and solar
electricity. Clearly, this will not happen without global unity,
universal commitment to the Paris targets and massive redirection o f
investment and subsidies (all o f which might still leave us energy poor
and collapse the economy; Sere and Victor, 2018) and cannot happen if
the dismal F.RoF.I\^ results for solar electricity arc confirmed.

This last point is pivotal. Consider the ultimate extended net energy
analysis (ERoEI\^). To replace fossil fuels, green energy must be
sufficiently intense and abundant to produce all the equipment and
machinery used in the mining, refining, transportation, manufacturing,
and so forth, of the materials used to produce wind and solar
installations, plus all the roads, other supportive infrastructure and
labour needed to manufacture, install and operate those facilities.
before it can address the bulk of society's energy needs. So far. fossil
fuel stands alone as the only energy source with the intensity both to
produce itself, literally from the ground up. and provide the much
larger surplus required to supply all the other energy needs o f society
(and keep in mind the anticipated 35 percent growth in energy demand by
mid-century). Tellingly, fossil fuels currently provide most o f the
energy used to manufacture the materials, equipment and infrastructure
for wind and solar electricity. (And are these alternatives really
'renewable' if essential equipment must be replaced every 20 25 years,
repeating the original energy investment?)

A major technical barrier to wind and (particularly) solar energy is
relatively low 'density' and intermittency compared to fossil fuels.
Techno-optimists believe that these barriers can be surmounted through
improved energy capture and storage technologies, but this is energy
intensive and expensive today's batteries, for example, can increase
costs by a factor o f ten or more (Andrews, 2018b; Temple, 2018). Even
modest fixes increase 'integration costs' and contribute to notably
higher consumer prices for renewable electricity (Hirth, Ucckcrdt and
Edcnhofcr, 2015). The added capital baggage also reduces the ERoEI o f
wind and solar below viable levels in many parts o f the world. Even at
low-but-viablc ERoEls, many countries would not have enough land for
solar or wind installations sufficient to supply even their electricity
needs (which are typically only 20 percent of all primary energy
consumption).

THE CLIMATE ENERGY CONUNDRUM: THE FUTURE IS NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE

It has long been recognizcd that the Darwinian struggle for existence
is. in effect, a competition for available energy. Building on Lotka
(1922), ecologist Howard Odum formulated what is now known as the
\'maximum power principle': successful systems are those that evolve to
maximize power - that is, their use o f available energy per unit time -
in the performance of useful work (self-maintenance, growth and
reproduction) (sec Hall, 1995). 'Maximum power' is a fundamental
organizing force in living nature.

Certainly, by this measure, //. sapiens is the most successful
vertebrate species ever to walk the earth. Modem industrial civilization
is an emergent phenomenon birthed at the intersection o f abundant cheap
fossil energy and human ingenuity. Fossil fuels enable societies to
acquire and transform all the other low-entropy resources they need to
grow and complexify. The megacity of 10 or 20 million people is
certainly the greatest far-from-(thcrmodynamic)- equi!ibrium dissipative
mega-structure ever created by humans and arguably modernity's most
remarkable icon.

The problem is that the enormous metabolic appetites of hundreds of city
and megacity super-organisms can be satisfied only through the
consumption (i.e., entropic dissipation) of prodigious quantities o f
energy, to date mostly fossil fuels.\" Urban civilization therefore
confronts a conundrum o f its own making. If we are unable to replace
fossil fuels with equivalent substitutes in the next couple o f dccadcs,
our urbanizing world will remain substantially reliant on coal, oil and
natural gas (at least while supplies Iasi). Atmospheric CO, and other
GHG concentrations will increase and global warming will exceed the 2춿C
limit. Our current trajectory implies 3 4춿C warming.

Three-degree warming spells widespread disaster by late ccntury - more
and longer heat waves and droughts, accelerating desertification,
melting permafrost, methane releases, water shortages, disrupted
agriculture, possible famine, rising sea levels, the flooding (and
eventual loss) o f many coastal cities, mass migrations, civil unrest,
and so on. Many **[cities]{.underline}** [would be]{.underline} **[cut
off from food-lands]{.underline}** and other essential resources with
the breakdown of local and marine transportation networks (sec

**[geopolitical conflict]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} almost

crossing tipping points (irreversible positive feedbacks) leading to
runaway climate changc and [the]{.underline} **[end of anything passing

On the other hand, if the world attempts to avoid climate disaster
through vastly increased investment in green energy or serious
conservation (phasing out of fossil fuels) we could face energy
shortages and shrinking economies even as global population and demand
for everything increases. Reduced goods production, [declining

President Vladimir V. [Putin will visit Tehran next week for
**meetings** with the leaders of Iran and Turkey, taking him into
**challenging diplomatic terrain** as he seeks to burnish
ties]{.underline} with two nations sometimes aligned, and sometimes
sharply at odds, with Russia and with each other.

Mr. [Putin]{.underline}, who radically limited his travel during the
pandemic, [has been engaging in a spree of **recent diplomacy**, seeking
to shore up military and economic backing with non-Western countries to
counter the West's military assistance to Ukraine and its sanctions
against Russia.]{.underline}

On a visit to Central Asia last week, his first foreign trip since
Russia invaded Ukraine, Mr. Putin --- who had recently compared himself
to Peter the Great --- held court among his close allies and insisted
that the war was going according to plan.

Mr. Putin's latest diplomatic push comes as President Biden prepares to
travel to the Middle East this week to meet the leaders of Saudi Arabia
and other Gulf States.

Mr. [Biden's national security adviser said on Monday that Russia was
**seeking drones from Iran**, including those capable of **firing
missiles**, to make up for its scarcity of unmanned, armed surveillance
aircraft on the battlefield.]{.underline} Analysts say that [Russia also
sees Iran as a newly important **economic partner**, offering a trade
route and expertise in **circumventing sanctions** and exporting
oil.]{.underline}

But Mr. [Putin may also have to soothe relations with Iran as Russia
eats into its share of the global oil market]{.underline}, while trying
to find common ground with Turkey, a NATO member. Over Moscow's
objections, Turkey recently lifted its objections to the alliance
expanding along Russia's borders.

High fuel prices have buoyed Russia's revenues as it has made gradual
military gains in Ukraine, but [Western sanctions have still **wounded
its economy** and restricted its ability to build or buy technology for
military use.]{.underline}

In Tehran, the Iranian capital, Mr. [Putin will also hold peace talks on

faction.]{.underline} Mr. Putin will meet with President Ebrahim Raisi
of Iran and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, as well as holding
separate meetings with each, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesman,
told reporters on Tuesday.

Mr. Erdogan, whose country shares the Black Sea coast with both Russia
and Ukraine, has emerged as the most active mediator between Mr. Putin
and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Turkey has been in talks to try to
overcome [Russia's blockade of more than 20 million tons of Ukrainian
grain exports, which has been intensifying a global food
crisis.]{.underline}

Turkey will host delegations from Ukraine, Russia and the United Nations
in Istanbul on Wednesday for negotiations on resuming grain shipments,
Turkey's Defense Ministry said.

[Iran, long a Russian ally in its confrontation with the West, is
becoming even more **central** to Mr. Putin's **diplomacy** because of
the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} Mr. Putin met with Mr. Raisi on the
sidelines of a regional summit in Turkmenistan last month, and spoke to
him on the phone in early June, according to the Kremlin.

noting that trade between the two countries was up 81 percent last year.

#### US-Iran conflict causes [infinite war]{.underline}\-\--*"but we won't go extinct"* does [not matter]{.underline} and only serves to prop up [incoherent]{.underline} foreign policy

**Kristian 20** (Bonnie Kristian; \"Iran can\'t conquer America. But we
can still lose.\", 1-3-2020, Week,

DOA: 7-17-2022)//sposten

[When Americans imagine losing a war, this is our default imagery. Our
mental stage is set with props from World War II]{.underline} --- where
the Axis powers potentially could have conquered the United States had
things gone very differently --- and the Cold War --- which, had it
turned hot, could have [seen **Soviet nukes** decimating major American
cities]{.underline} (and vice versa). Pondering defeat takes us to The
Man in the High Castle, a compelling alternate history precisely because
its fanciful premise is still plausible, just as the idea of Iran
accomplishing a comparable conquest is utterly implausible. (Iran\'s
entire GDP, \$440 billion as of 2017, is less than the Pentagon\'s
annual budget; and even though it began breaching terms of the nuclear
deal following Trump\'s withdrawal from the agreement, Iran does not
have nuclear weapons. The power disparity between Tehran and Washington
is immense.)

[The trouble is conquest is **not the only negative outcome of
war.**]{.underline} And I suspect [failure to add that realization to
recognition of America\'s near-total imperviousness to traditional
conquest accounts for much of the **stupidity in our foreign policy.**
Because we know **one bad consequence isn\'t possible**, we **invade**,
airstrike, **assassinate**, and **sanction** at will as if **no bad
consequences are possible.**]{.underline}

[This habit]{.underline} is not original to the Trump administration,
but it i[s exacerbated by the president\'s ignorance, petty pride,
changeability, and impulsivity.]{.underline} He seems unable to think
with clarity about any moment but the present, and that makes him extra
susceptible to reckless advice and shortsighted choices. The Soleimani
strike may prove the most destructive of his choices yet.

A rudimentarily prudent foreign policy would always consider at least
two sets of consequences before any military action. [First, what will
be the human cost?]{.underline}

Civilian deaths in the war in Afghanistan are estimated in the tens of
thousands and in Iraq in the hundreds of thousands. [U.S. intervention
in Yemen has helped produce the world\'s most acute humanitarian crisis
--- an estimated 85,000 Yemeni children younger than 5 starved to death
between 2015 and 2018.]{.underline} American civilians are comparatively
safe from the violence of war and terror, but we are not invulnerable,
nor are military casualties to be dismissed from our accounting. [War
with Iran would have enormous human costs, and killing Soleimani is a
major step in that direction (if not a functional declaration of war
itself).]{.underline}

[The second consideration is the **path to conclusion.**]{.underline}
Here is a lesson Washington ought to have learned once and for all in
Vietnam but which has been demonstrated anew by our misadventures of the
last two decades: It is much easier to begin a war than to end one.

[We are not at risk of foreign subjugation, but that does not mean we
are not at risk of losing. What are the United States\' **perpetual
wars** if not losses? Is there any way to describe]{.underline} what
we\'re doing in [**Afghanistan** as victory? Is participating in the
starvation of **Yemen** a triumph?]{.underline}

For a superpower, [defeat]{.underline} doesn\'t look like conquest. It
[looks like **fighting forever**, **killing** and being killed for
**nothing**, funding **corruption** and calling it **\"building
democracy,\"** wasting **trillions** and calling it **strength**,
creating **terrorists** and **calling it counter-terrorism**,
**assassinating** national heroes and **insisting** the act will be met
with mass **gratitude.**]{.underline}

[Defeat looks like **death**, **dissipation**, and **self-delusion**.
It\'s time we **cleared** out our **World War II scenery** and made way
for this **modern set.**]{.underline} It\'s time to recognize that [if
we go to **war with Iran**, this type of **defeat** is all but a
foregone **conclusion.**]{.underline}

[EU-Russia relations]{.underline} have [reached an

continue to worsen in the foreseeable future. [A few potential crisis

and relations between the key EU capitals and Russia constrained, [these

Europe, this is not a bad configuration at all. [It means, however, that
Russian-European relations will revert to being a **function of
U.S.-Russian relations**, reminiscent of the Cold War
model.]{.underline}

On the military security side, this has long been a reality. With [the
principal danger now rooted in **misperception**, **miscalc**ulation,
and **escalation**, the proper guardrails in the U.S.-Russian
confrontation are]{.underline} not weapons limits established under arms

are reliable [communications channels]{.underline}, personal contact
between top military and security officials, [and]{.underline} various

contacts, and measures [are]{.underline} essentially [the business of
Russia and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates: either directly
or through NATO.

In the meantime, [the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [and
Russia can still do something useful]{.underline} together. Areas for
EU-Russia collaboration may be few and far between, but they do exist.
One is [**public health**, the other is **climate**. Russia]{.underline}

COVID-19 pandemic is the first truly global pandemic of recent times,
not the last. [Given their geographical proximity and the level of
**transborder contacts**, EU-Russia cooperation in this field certainly
**makes sense**.]{.underline} As for [climate change]{.underline}, this
[is an issue of **genuine interest** to Russia, given that global
warming is not only making much of the Arctic ice-free, but also
disrupting infrastructure in Siberia as a result of melting
permafrost.]{.underline} Neither of these tracks will have much impact
on the overall relationship, but [each could bring **real benefits** to

[United Nations and Turkey-led negotiations with Moscow and Kyiv to
allow Ukrainian grain exports to resume in the Black Sea are moving
**forward.**]{.underline} But even if a deal is signed, its impact to
alleviate the food crisis could take months.

[The UN had been **working for weeks** behind the scenes to find a way
to safely export the 22 million tons of grain trapped in Ukrainian silos
and ports]{.underline} -- enough to cover the annual consumption of the
world\'s least developed economies, according to The EconomistExternal
link . Guterres said that a"broad agreement" had been reached on
many"substantive aspects" of the operation but stressed that"more
technical work" was needed for a formal agreement.

[Turkish defence minister Hulusi Akar was even more optimistic and said
a **deal could be signed this week.**]{.underline} His comments were
echoed on Monday by European Union chief diplomat Josep Borrell who said
that he too hoped an agreement would be found before Sunday.

The exact details of the deal remain unknown, but an agreement is likely
to cover issues such as mines clearance, naval escorts, and cargoes
inspections. The date when the four delegations will meet again is not
yet known.

So far, Ankara has said it would ensure the safety of export routes
while warring parties would jointly inspect shipments before they enter
Ukrainian ports. A coordination centre with Russia, Ukraine, and the UN
would be established in Turkey.

But experts caution that even if a deal was signed today, it would
likely take weeks or months before countries hardest hit by the global
food crisis feel the relief, while the deal itself could prove fragile.

Food crisis

[Ukraine produces enough grain to feed hundreds of millions of people
and is a **major exporter of wheat**, corn, and sunflower oil. Before
the war, most food exports used to leave Ukraine on ships out of Black
Sea ports. But Ukrainian mines and Russian warships have closed sea
export routes.]{.underline}

["Failure to open those ports in the Odesa region will be a declaration
of **war** on **global food security.**]{.underline} And it will [result
in **famine**, destabilisation, and mass migration around the
world,"]{.underline} UN World Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley
warnedExternal link the UN Security Council in May.

[The Black Sea blockade is adding to a global food crisis fueled by
Covid-19 disruptions and climate change. Low supplies of Ukrainian grain
and high food prices have been **bad news** for African and Middle
Eastern countries that rely heavily on food imports from Ukraine. The
**Horn of Africa**, which faces its fourth consecutive failed rainy
season, has been hit particularly hard.]{.underline} UN agencies have
warned that in Somalia, which used to import all its wheat from Ukraine
and Russia, hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of famine.

[A deal allowing Ukraine to **resume its grain exports** is **urgently
needed.**]{.underline} The harvest season starts in July, but storage
facilities are still full of last winter\'s grain. [There are fears that
this grain may now **rot away.**]{.underline} On top of that, [if
farmers cannot sell their crops, they may not be able to afford to plant
or harvest in the future.]{.underline} On Tuesday, Ukraine\'s
agriculture minister speaking to the Financial Times, warned farmers
will plant two-thirds less this year unless a deal is agreed. [Such a
reduction would threaten future **global food output**, as Ukrainian
wheat accounts for 10% of all exports.]{.underline} Food security
experts fear that a failed harvest in Ukraine next year could turn the
current food prices crisis into a food availability crisis in
lower-income countries.

The heads of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank Group (WBG), the World
Food Programme (WFP), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) issued a
joint statement last week calling for urgent action now but also
longer-term reforms to tackle the global food crisis. Recommendations
include boosting food production across the world and investing in
climate-resilient agriculture.

A deal, then what?

But reaching a deal this week would not mean that grain exports would
resume immediately. The shipping industry must reorganise itself and the
Black Sea needs to be de-mined.

"The ships that sail the seas are not all at the entrance to the
Bosphorus and the Dardanelles waiting for Ukraine to open," says
Florence Schurch, secretary general of the Swiss Trading and Shipping
Association (STSA)."They continue to work, the trading companies
continue to send their ships left and right. International trade
continues."

Schurch says that even if an agreement was found as soon as this week,
it would still take months for the shipping industry to reorganise, and
for the first vessels to enter the Black Sea.

"On top of that, ports and shipping lanes need to be cleared of mines,
traders need to be assured that their captains and crew are safe, and
insurers need to agree to insure all these ships and their cargoes at
non-prohibitive prices," says Schurch.

According to Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis
Group in New York, the UN has anticipated such issues by reaching out
to"an unusually wide range of contacts" that include shipping insurers.
Gowan also points out that Guterres has an"amazingly detailed grasp of
issues like de-mining".

Still, clearing mines to open up a safe corridor for ships to sail
through could take time -- from weeks to months, depending on how many
de-mining ships are mobilised and the number of mines in the water, a
naval expert told The New York TimesExternal link .

The UN plan

["I think **Turkey wants the UN involved in this process**, as it offers
both political legitimacy and technical expertise to the discussions,"
says Gowan. **"Having the UN creates some additional transparency** as
**the UN can act as a sort of neutral \'umpire\'** over the terms of any
agreement," he adds.]{.underline}

T[he lack of trust between Kiev and Moscow has so far been a **major
impediment** to reaching a diplomatic agreement.]{.underline} Ukraine
does not want to remove the mines it placed in ports without guarantees
that Russia will not attack them, while Russia has asked to inspect the
cargoes of ships entering Ukrainian ports to ensure they do not carry
weaponry.

Moscow also asked for sanctions on Russia to be lifted if a deal was
found, which Western countries oppose. The UN and Turkey-led deal could
include measures to support Russian fertiliser and grain exports.
Russian grain is not under sanctions, but many traders and banks have
stayed away from dealing with Russia out of fears they may be exposing
themselves to fines.

Schurch confirms that grain traders have stopped working with Russia.
According to her, the European Union sanctions, which Switzerland
adopted, are too vague. She calls on Brussels and Bern to clarify their
position so that traders can work without risk.

According to Gowan, if an agreement is reached, the deal could still be
questioned in the future. He points to the UN cross-border mechanism
that allows humanitarian convoys to enter rebel-held parts of Syria from
Turkey. Earlier this month, Russia threatened to put an end to the
mechanism by vetoing a 12-month extension of its mandate before
eventually agreeing to a 6-month extension, which will make planning aid
deliveries more difficult.

"I am sure that even if a Black Sea grain export mechanism is created,
Russia will frequently question how it is managed and threaten to cut it
off. The Russians know how to play games with humanitarian aid," says
Gowan.

If all fails

If the current negotiation process fails, Gowan suspects that the United
States, the United Kingdom, and France will raise the issue at the UN
Security Council, where the three countries sit as permanent members
together with Russia and China.

He says the three countries could table a resolution demanding that
Russia allows grain exports to resume out of Black Sea ports, which
Moscow would most likely veto. Russia would then need -- under a
resolution adopted last spring that aims to increase accountability for
permanent members using their right of veto -- to explain its decision
in front of the General Assembly in which, unlike the Security Council
and its 15 members, every member state has a seat.

"Western diplomats will want to make the Russians explain to African and
Arab countries why Moscow is cutting off their food," says Gowan.

#### Putin [can't be trusted]{.underline} by his words

**RFE 22** (\"Putin Claims Russia Will 'Guarantee' Peaceful Export Of

Russian President Vladimir [Putin **denied accusations**]{.underline}
his armed forces are blocking Ukrainian grain exports from the Black Sea
and said his government would "guarantee\" peaceful passage to ships
leaving Ukraine\'s ports.

In an interview with Russian state television on June 3, [Putin tried to
put the blame on Ukraine for the trapped grain]{.underline}, saying Kyiv
has mined the Black Sea and sunk vessels, preventing grain ships from
leaving.

Ukraine carried out those steps after Russia launched a massive,
unprovoked invasion by land and air on February 24, sparking fears it
could seek to use its navy to storm the key Black Sea port of Odesa.

"I have already told all our colleagues many times: let them clear the
mines and let the ships loaded with grain leave the ports. We guarantee
their peaceful passage into international waters without any problems,\"
Putin said.

[The Russian president said his armed forces would **not use** the
**removal** of mines "to launch any attacks \[on Ukraine\] from the
sea."]{.underline}

Glen Howard, a military analyst and president of the Washington-based
Jamestown Foundation, said history shows [**Putin can't be trusted** to
abide by his word.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin **repeatedly** said Russia had **no intention** of invading
Ukraine in the months leading up to its attack.]{.underline}

Howard said Ukraine now has anti-ship missile systems to defend its
coast from invasion, including several delivered late last month by
Denmark.

However, [he said that grain **ships leaving Ukrainian ports** would
have **no escort** if they set sail and thus would be **"trusting the
Russians at their word."**]{.underline}

Putin's comments came after he met with Senegal\'s President Macky Sall,
who is also the current head of the African Union, to discuss surging
food prices.

Africa is heavily dependent on grain supplies from Russia and Ukraine
and any disruptions could lead to social unrest on the continent.

The surge in food prices triggered by the conflict is already putting
pressure on African governments and, in some countries, leading to
protests.

Amid isolation from the West, Putin has been seeking to build his ties
with African nations, many of whom have significant historical ties to
Moscow dating back to Soviet times.

\"President Putin has expressed to us his willingness to facilitate the
export of Ukrainian cereals,\" Sall wrote on Twitter after meeting
Putin.

The war has blocked as much as 25 million tons of Ukrainian grain at
local ports, Howard said.

[Putin sought to **downplay** the significance of the **issue**, saying
Ukrainian grain only represents about 2.5 percent of total world grain
production.]{.underline}

However, Ukrainian grain makes up a significant percentage of global
exports and thus has outsided influence on world prices.

[Putin also **blamed the U**nited **S**tates for rising food prices,
saying the **U.S.** central bank **stimulated inflation** by printing
too much money.]{.underline}

But wheat and corn prices have surged more than a quarter since Russia
began massing its troops along Ukraine's border in late October amid
fears over grain exports while the United States has taken steps to
curtail inflation by raising rates.

Russia also cut back on gas exports to Europe leading up to the war to
gain leverage in talks with the West over Ukraine, driving prices to
record highs. Natural gas is a key component in fertilizers used by
farmers.

Putin suggested Ukraine could export grain via the Baltic Sea by
shipping its products by rail through Belarus.

[The West would have to **lift sanctions** against Belarus to do
so.]{.underline}

Howard dismissed Putin's suggestion as impractical, saying [there is
**not nearly enough rail capacity** to move Ukraine's
grain.]{.underline}

[Rail is also more **expensive** and shipping from the Baltic ports to
Africa would **extend the sea route** by thousands of
miles.]{.underline}

Howard said time is running out to export [the grain]{.underline},
adding it [will]{.underline} begin to [**rot** by July.]{.underline}

[Diplomats from the world's major industrialized nations **failed** on

and energy markets.

[Russia's foreign minister **walked out**]{.underline} of two sessions
held by diplomats from the Group of 20 (G20) [amid **criticism** of the
war]{.underline} on Ukraine [and amid calls for Russia to allow Kyiv to
ship **grain** out to the world.]{.underline}

The July 8 meeting in Bali, Indonesia, was intended to lay the
groundwork for a summit of G20 leaders later this year. [The war and
**soaring** global food and energy **prices** that have resulted from it
topped the agenda.]{.underline}

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov walked out of the morning meeting
after German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock criticized Moscow for
the war.

The vast majority of [representatives at the meeting had **condemned**
\"Russia\'s brutal war of aggression,\"]{.underline} Baerbock said.
\"The appeal of all 19 states was very clear to Russia: This war must
end.\"

Lavrov left the afternoon session before Ukrainian Foreign Minister
Dmytro Kuleba's scheduled virtual speech. Kuleba told ministers to
\"remember about 344 families who have lost their children when
listening to Russian lies.\"

Lavrov told reporters the discussions \"strayed almost immediately, as
soon as they took the floor, to the frenzied criticism of the Russian
Federation in connection with the situation in Ukraine.\"

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Lavrov was in
the room when the meeting began and \"about two hours later he began to
hold bilateral talks with colleagues in the same forum in the next
room.\"

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also condemned the Russian
invasion.

\"What we\'ve heard today already is a strong chorus from around the
world\...about the need for the aggression to end,\" Blinken said.

During a closed-door session of officials, Blinken, who refused to hold
one-on-one meetings with Lavrov, demanded Moscow allow grain shipments
out of Ukraine.

\"To our Russian colleagues: Ukraine is not your country. Its grain is
not your grain. Why are you blocking the ports? You should let the grain
out,\" Blinken said, according to a Western official present.

Zakharova said [Lavrov was **not present** to hear Blinken\'s
comments.]{.underline}

Members of the G20, whose countries account for about 80 percent of the
world\'s economic output and about two-thirds of the world\'s
population, had much to address as prices for meat, cereals, vegetable
oils, dairy products, and sugar have soared in recent months, due
largely to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine is not a member of the G20 but is one of the world's largest
exporters of corn and sunflower oil, but Russia's invasion halted most
of that flow. Millions of tons of Ukrainian grain are stuck in silos,
unable to be exported due to Russia's naval presence in the Black Sea.

Those disruptions threaten food supplies for many developing countries,
especially in Africa.

But the meeting ended with no group photo taken nor a final communique
issued as has been done in previous years. It also exposed further
evidence of an East-West split driven by China and Russia on one side
and the United States and Europe on the other.

In closing remarks, Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said
[\"participants expressed **deep concern** about the **humanitarian**

ISTANBUL---[Negotiators, having reached the outlines of a deal
for]{.underline} Ukraine to export [grain]{.underline} from seaports
amid the war with Russia, [face **challenges** to getting it done, from
the **demining** of ports to **persuading shippers** they can operate

Russian, Ukrainian, Turkish and United Nations officials are expected to
resume negotiations this week on a framework that would establish a
grain export corridor in the Black Sea and potentially help alleviate a
hunger crisis in some developing countries.

U.N. Secretary-General Ant칩nio Guterres planned to fly to Istanbul on
Thursday evening, a U.N. spokesman said. The announcement of the trip
raised hopes that a deal could be signed in the coming days, although
the spokesman said the situation remained fluid.

Turkey's and Russia's presidents have sounded positive about the talks,
as has a senior Ukrainian official. Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan, whose government has brokered the negotiations with the U.N.,
expressed optimism Wednesday that Russia and Ukraine would soon sign a
deal.

investigation reveals [how Russia has **quietly institutionalized** the
**theft** of hundreds of thousands of metric tons of it out of newly
occupied areas of Ukraine and into Russian-allied countries in the
Middle East.]{.underline} Photo illustration: Adele Morgan

"This week, we want to put this agreement into writing. And we wish that
this plan will start to be implemented in the coming days," Turkey's
state-run news agency quoted Mr. Erdogan as saying, a day after he met
with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

An agreement could potentially free up about 18 million tons of wheat,
corn and other supplies that war has prevented Ukraine from exporting,
with the Russian invasion contributing to a rise in global food prices
that U.S. officials said has sparked protests in 17 countries.

[**Substantial differences** still need to be **bridged** among the
warring parties]{.underline}, said Western officials. [Should the
governments reach a deal, privately owned freighters, insurers and sea
crews might be **reluctant** to handle cargoes from Odessa and other
war-zone ports, given the **threat** of further **attacks**, according
to the officials, grain traders and other industry experts.]{.underline}

Ukraine faces the challenge of how to store or export its coming summer
harvest.

[Both Russia and Ukraine have laid **sea mines** in the Black Sea that
pose a hazard to the movement of any ships in the area. Military
delegations from Russia and Ukraine **disagreed** in the talks in recent
weeks over how the **demining** would take place]{.underline}, a U.S.
official said.

[Ukraine has **also increased** the number of mines]{.underline} near
its ports in recent weeks to defend against possible Russian attacks,
the official said.

[Safe passage for ships]{.underline} handling food cargoes [and
**procedures** for **searching** private vessels to ensure they aren't
carrying military equipment are among the issues to be
resolved]{.underline}, officials said. Beyond that, [**Ukraine** has
**demanded international security** guarantees to prevent a Russian
attack once mines are removed.]{.underline}

["You **still** have to get the **parties to address the demining** and
the unfettered access and movement for the vessels
themselves,"]{.underline} said the U.S. official.

[Russia is still seen as a **potential spoiler**]{.underline}, U.S. and
other officials said, with Washington and Ankara trying to pressure the
Kremlin to reach a deal and implement it.

"Turkey is pressing Russia to say this can't be a zero nothing forever.
And [Russia, you're not going to like the look if you make your own navy
guys take back their own mines. That's an **admission of
guilt,"**]{.underline} the official said.

Mr. Putin, meeting Mr. Erdogan on Tuesday, thanked him for his mediation
and said that the talks had made progress. "Not all issues, however,
have been resolved. But the fact that we have moved forward is already
good," Mr. Putin said, according to remarks shown on Russian television.

Meanwhile, skeptical U.S. officials this week pointed to recent Russian
attacks on Ukrainian ports and grain-storage facilities as part of its
war strategy.

["We are hoping for the best, but we have seen how **Putin weaponizes
food,"**]{.underline} Jose Fernandez, the U.S. undersecretary of state
for economic growth, energy and the environment, said on Wednesday.

To nudge the talks forward, the U.S. and the European Union have in
recent days clarified that financial sanctions against Russia don't
pertain to food and agricultural trade. Clearing a path for Russia's
food and fertilizer exports is part of the framework for a broader deal
on grain exports put forward by Mr. Guterres.

The stakes of a potential agreement are high for the poorer nations that
were Ukraine's biggest customers. Much of the grain formerly exported
via the Black Sea went to Asian countries and to Egypt, the world's
largest importer of wheat.

While grain prices have fallen from the highs they reached in the
aftermath of the invasion, an increase in Ukrainian supply would ease
pressure on prices.

[**Grain traders** working in the region also **expressed doubt** that
Russia would allow the grain exports while its **military campaign**
continues to **destroy Ukraine's farms**, roads, grain-storage
facilities and other **vital infrastructure** necessary to **export
grain.**]{.underline}

"To me, [their objective is **strangulation**, somehow or another, of
Ukraine. They've been stealing grain from the occupied
areas,"]{.underline} said Jonathan Grange, a partner at Sunstone
Brokers, an agricultural-commodities brokerage working in Ukraine and
the Black Sea region.

Ukraine exported about two million metric tons of grain in June overland
and via smaller ships leaving the Danube River into the Black Sea,
according to Ukrainian officials. That maritime route opened up this
month after Ukraine's military retook strategic Snake Island from
Russia, which occupied it soon after the invasion began in February.

In addition to up to 18 million tons of grain currently trapped in
Ukraine as a result of the invasion, there is also the challenge of how
to store or export the country's coming summer harvest of an estimated
65 million tons, according to Mr. Grange.

"We are desperately looking at those negotiations," said Ivan Kriuchkov,
a director at Ukrainian agribusiness IMC. "If the ports don't open,
where do we put all our grain?"

Despite modest gains in east Ukraine, [June was **not a good month** for
Russia.]{.underline} Within a single week, [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [leaders offered Kyiv candidacy for membership, NATO
reached an agreement to bring Sweden and Finland into the alliance and
Great Britain's defense secretary, Ben Wallace, called for a **20
percent hike** to his budget.]{.underline}

[These historic developments are sure to rile Kremlin officials, but the
future of Western support to Ukraine's fight remains **uncertain.** As
**public interest** in the war continues to **dwindle**, appeasing
Russia's extortionate demands could become more
**desirable.**]{.underline} Such [**concessions** would do more than
disfigure Ukraine and impose devastating **new realities** on Western
**security** institutions --- they would **declare** to the world that
**imperialism is negotiable.**]{.underline}

[The debate over policy]{.underline} toward Ukraine [has split experts
into two camps]{.underline}. One side believes this war will end only
when Russia is humiliated and exhausted militarily by a stream of
Western arms packages. Until now, the Biden administration has pursued a
strategy along these lines.

The other camp sees that option as far-fetched and too costly, and
instead seeks diplomatic solutions to Russia's war. Proposed remedies
typically include allowing Russia to expand its borders into Ukraine and
insisting that Kyiv amend its constitution by swearing never to join
NATO. These conditions echo Moscow's demands to the letter. In exchange,
Russia might stop leveling Ukrainian cities. While this bargain is
clearly an example of political extortion, it tends to moonlight under
the cover of various euphemisms.

Among them are [the terms "diplomacy," "negotiations" and "realist
international relations theory."]{.underline} Veteran diplomat Henry
Kissinger, scholars John Mearsheimer and Barry Posen and the New York
Times editorial board have all argued for solutions in line with such
euphemisms. Admittedly, as the war wears down the pocketbooks and
attention spans of Western governments, even some Russia hawks have
crept slowly into the appeasement camp. French President Emmanuel
Macron, who only months ago reminded Putin slyly that France too was a
nuclear power, has since said that Russia must not be humiliated in
Ukraine.

[These **arguments** have merit, but they **miss** the **underlying
question** that **appeasement** poses to the world: If **Ukraine** is
**not worth saving** from an **overestimated** and supposedly
**crumbling** power, **who is?**]{.underline}

Such [inquiries give shape to the type of **global power competition**
described in U.S. strategic documents of the last two presidential
administrations. The question is **essential** not only to resolving the
war in **Ukraine**, but also to enabling the Biden administration's
integrated deterrence concept aimed at competing with powers such as
**Russia**, **China**, **Iran** and **No**rth **Ko**rea --- **each** of
which **jockey** for **leverage** over the West.]{.underline}

For them, [this jockeying process involves **convincing** observers that
the U.S.-led **security** infrastructure established after the Cold War
is in a **twilight** and can no longer sustain the existing
international order. **Fear** plays a role in **driving** the point
**home.**]{.underline}

[Bringing Finland and Sweden into NATO might strengthen the alliance,
but their desire to join after seven decades of neutrality is proof that
nations external to NATO feel remarkably **vulnerable.**]{.underline}
Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's political party won a super majority
in Japan shortly after his July 8 assassination. He was perhaps most
famous for his role as architect of the informal Quad alliance, what
some consider the early phase of an Indo-Pacific NATO.

[Aside from its **paternalistic** nature, appeasement fails to see the
bigger picture. The idea of the **free world** as a **conglomerate** of
nations that share liberal democratic values has **animated** political
campaigns and national security policies for
**generations.**]{.underline} This concept is [**rooted** in the
**assumption** that a rules-based international order **prevents
tyrants** from doing exactly what Putin is doing. If the existing order
**cannot serve** this purpose, it will suffer a **severe blow** to its
credibility, especially]{.underline} in places [where
diplomats]{.underline} and military advisers such as myself [work to
assure foreign partners]{.underline} of our commitment to those
principles.

[Condoning Russia's extortion further **undermines** the diplomatic
process because it **corrodes** the legitimacy of existing **treaties**
upon which many countries rely for materiel and political
support.]{.underline} Clearly, [Moscow has thrown out the
**Russo-Ukrainian Treaty**]{.underline} of 1997. But [the]{.underline}
1994 **[Budapest Memorandum]{.underline}** -- bearing the signatures of
the United States, Russia and United Kingdom -- offered Western-backed
security guarantees in exchange for Kyiv relinquishing its nuclear
arsenal. If that parlay ultimately contributes to Ukraine's
disintegration, [the West could face a **credibility crisis** in future
diplomatic exchanges. Putin's statements amplify]{.underline} this
[**erosion of trust** and nest it]{.underline} conveniently with[in the
**twilight narrative.**]{.underline}

[Realists want the West to shake off the war in Ukraine and focus on
China]{.underline}, even as Belarusian president and Putin ally
Alexander Lukashenko uses terms like "moral cleansing" to describe his
vision of Europe's future. [But if Moscow can **leverage** its
**atrocities** in Ukraine to **bludgeon** the **free world** into
**conciliation**, it will signify a terrifying new beginning, not the
end of a war.]{.underline}

As argued by Lt. Gen. James Dubik in these pages[, forcing Ukraine to
the **negotiating table** in a position of **weakness** is a **recipe
for disaster.** Considering the]{.underline} 2014 [annexation of
Crimea]{.underline}, the ongoing use of [genocidal tactics]{.underline}
in Ukraine [and the likelihood of a protracted insurgency]{.underline}
in Russian-occupied territories, [it is folly to assume that a
sacrificial land offering will produce anything resembling
stability.]{.underline}

[Russia's incursion presents to the world a **troubling question** that
it must answer collectively: Is imperialism negotiable? Outside Ukraine,
appeasement is an easy option because it creates the **mirage of
reconciliation**]{.underline} while demanding nothing from those
conjuring the illusion. [On the other hand, **generating the political
will** to explore new frameworks of burden sharing in support of
Ukraine's fight is much **hard**]{.underline}er, [but it is the **only
solution** that clearly answers the question of how much imperialism
Europe will tolerate this century.]{.underline}

[If the answer is anything **more** than **zero**, then Moscow is at
liberty to continue **exploiting** that **ambiguity** with its
**imperial interests.** Public officials]{.underline} from Washington to
Canberra [must consider the **long-term** effects of Russia experiencing
anything less than **abject failure** in Ukraine.]{.underline}

#### "Do not humiliate Russia" is a [dumb]{.underline} idea and only [bolsters]{.underline} Russia's stance\-\--we are [past]{.underline} the point of [return]{.underline}

\"Don't humiliate Russia! Or how to repeat past mistakes at the cost of
European security\", 7-15-2022, Friends of Europe,

Last month, French President Emmanuel [Macron suggested that Europe
**"must not humiliate Russia**]{.underline} so that the day the fighting
stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels," contesting
that diplomacy must consistently be considered to address violent
conflicts. Problematically, Macron simultaneously implied that
negotiations could only take place if Russia can escape any form of
shame or humiliation.

This gave rise to mixed reactions from other Western leaders. The United
States Ambassador to the European Union, Mark Gitenstein, declared that
Russian President Vladimir Putin had "humiliated himself" by his conduct
in the war and that the West wanted to see him defeated on the
battlefields of Ukraine. Similarly, former US ambassador to Moscow,
Michael McFaul, claimed: "Putin will only negotiate when his army can't
keep marching forward, humiliated or not. Macron should focus on
creating that condition." The strongest European reactions came from the
head of the Estonian parliament's Foreign Affairs Commission, Marko
Mihkelson, who stated that Macron was "still looking for ways to save
war criminal Putin from humiliation," and Lithuanian Foreign Minister
Gabrielius Landsbergis claimed Macron's comments risked jeopardising the
unity and security of the EU. Most notably, Ukrainian Minister of
Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said that allies should "better focus on
how to put Russia in its place" and that "calls to avoid humiliation of
Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call
for it."

By contrast, no reactions emerged from the German and Italian
governments. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Mario Draghi have
previously hinted that resolving the conflict might require Ukraine to
comply with Russian claims on certain territories. The four-point plan
Draghi put forward in late May included a bilateral agreement between
Russia and Ukraine to clarify the future of Crimea and Donbas, which
would, in this scenario, have almost complete autonomy. The Italian
plan's proximity to core Russian demands had led many to describe it as
'classic appeasement'. For his part, Scholz has avoided non-committal or
conflicting public announcements, refraining from affirming that Ukraine
should recapture all lost territory, settling instead to comment that
Putin could "not win" the war.

[Calls to avoid Russia's humiliation do not guarantee Europe's security,
but rather **strengthen Russia** and **weaken the EU** in the long
run]{.underline}

[The notion that the EU would be well advised to spare Russia prevails
within the Union]{.underline}, not least among the leaders of three
member states. [This stance is not only disrespectful to Ukraine, but
its strategic thinking is fundamentally erroneous and short-sighted, and
even **endangers Europe** in the long term.]{.underline} Recent history
reveals that [indulging a Putin-led Kremlin is not only an impractical
and reckless policy, but prone to placing many European nations in a
position of **dependency** vis--vis Russia, creating **divisions**
between EU member states]{.underline}, and thus, [making the Union
**vulnerable** to Putin's intimidations and pressures]{.underline}.
Calls to avoid Russia's humiliation do not guarantee Europe's security,
but rather strengthen Russia and weaken the EU in the long run.

[Macron's posture relies on the **precedent** set by **post-WWI
Germany**]{.underline}, a nation whose humiliation caused by the
Versailles Treaty is often cited as a driving factor for its return to
the battlefield 20 years later. The takeaway behind this is that deeply
humiliated countries make for bad partners in peace. In this case,
[Macron's phrase reflects an attempt to avoid 'making things
worse']{.underline} and antagonising Russia to an extent that would be
critical for Western democracies.

[However, Russia has undermined Western objectives **even in the
absence** of any **provocation** or **humiliation.**]{.underline} The
[Russian management of the **Syrian issue**, even before]{.underline}
its 2015 [intervention, and its **illegal annexation** of Crimea are
just two illustrations of this reality.]{.underline}

Moreover, [Moscow has repeatedly shown its tendency to use **compromise
frameworks** to leverage **permanent interference** in its neighbours'
affairs]{.underline}, rather than to seek conflict resolution. This was
displayed most recently by the 2014-2015 Minsk agreements, signed as a
means to reunite Ukraine, but distorted by the Kremlin to enshrine a
process that would see Russian-aligned administrations emerge in Luhansk
and Donetsk. Making **[concessions]{.underline}** that [could be used by
an **adversary** to **maximise** its **influence** and further
**escalate destabilisation** abroad is evidently **not** a **clever**
diplomatic strategy -- and not one that Europe should rely
on.]{.underline}

[Putin's demands **contradict** the very nature of what **cooperation
with Europe might entail**]{.underline}

[Behind this appeasement rhetoric lies a **flawed**]{.underline} and
ineffective [strategy for peace]{.underline} that is [based on the
premise that Russia still **adheres** to the post-Cold War status quo
and **seeks to integrate** the European and Western circle.]{.underline}
While this could have been true in the 1990s and the beginning of
Putin's first term as president, [the perspective for improved relations
suffered]{.underline} from the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, the pro-Western
democratic changes in Georgia, Ukraine and to a lesser extent Kyrgyzstan
between 2003 and 2005, and Russia's attack on Georgia in 2008. Any
prospects whatsoever ceased to exist after Putin's 2012 re-election.
Macron's belief in a functioning appeasement strategy for Europe is
effectively ten years outdated.

[Nowadays, Putin's demands **contradict** the very nature of what
**cooperation** with Europe might entail, as made clear by recent
**draft agreements** with the US and NATO. With demands such as **NATO
withdrawal**]{.underline} from eastern Europe [or]{.underline}
officially [**closing the door** on Ukraine]{.underline}'s membership,
[these documents **reinforce** the Russian president's obsessions with
the survival of his regime and the country's geopolitical
might.]{.underline} As seen with Ukraine, [Putin is clearly **willing**
to engage in **hostile actions** and even go to war when he believes
these objectives are threatened or that Russia risks being
humiliated.]{.underline} Here lies the core problem with trying to
appease or indulge Putin's Russia: [as the protagonist, Putin **defines
the rules** of the game.]{.underline} The practice of [**appeasement**
leaves Europe in a position of **weakness**, **vulnerability** and
**ill-preparedness**.]{.underline}

[Rather than passively react]{.underline} to Russia's demands, [the EU
must fortify its voice and **set its own terms** to Russia, even if the
Kremlin will **reject them.** The point is not to get Russia to accept
European terms, it is to **stop playing by Russian rules.**]{.underline}

[This will require European nations to **considerably bolster** their
**stance** vis--vis Russia. This is already being done through NATO,
which]{.underline} significantly [**reinforced** its military
posture]{.underline} on its eastern flank and prepares to welcome Sweden
and Finland to its ranks. But the greatest change needs to occur within
the European Union.

A sense of urgency alone cannot sustain a common sense of purpose and
unify all member states over time

A more secure Europe can emerge only with an EU that is better prepared
to deter -- or face -- Russia politically, economically and militarily.
The Union will thus need to take actions in all three of these domains.

First, it is essential that the EU abandon ambiguity and adopt more
unified rhetoric when addressing foreign policy issues. The relative
speed at which the EU27 managed to agree on sanctions against Russia
following its invasion of Ukraine constitutes grounds for hope; however,
a sense of urgency alone cannot sustain a common sense of purpose and
unify all member states over time. The EU now needs to prioritise its
unity on the international stage.

Second, the EU must be willing and able to protect its interests and
oppose any adversary seeking to undermine its objectives through the use
of economic instruments. Although limited in scope, the EU has only just
started to leverage gas imports to pressure Russia following the
invasion of Ukraine, despite medium and long-term costs for the Union.
The EU must hold its ground and further integrate economic instruments
in its foreign policy toolbox to compel opponents. The fact that the EU
needs Russian gas more than Russia needs European cash is not immutable.

Finally, the EU must endorse its willingness to militarily defend itself
against any potential aggressor. While the military aspect of defence is
and will remain in the hands of NATO, the EU and its member states
should clearly express and demonstrate the will to take up arms if
needed. Moreover, Europe must prove its determination and ability to
defend itself alone; the US cannot, and will not, fight Russia in a
full-scale war at a time when its greatest strategic threat comes from
the Pacific. In its recent 'The Case for EU Defense' report, the Center
for American Progress proposed that the EU must now "focus on developing
and acquiring new capabilities that can enable Europe to act without the
involvement of the U.S. military." Accordingly, the report called for
American leaders to stop opposing EU defence integration initiatives,
maintaining that the current approach encouraged unnecessary
redundancies among EU countries.

[Only with a long-term, coordinated, intensified and complementary
**rearmament strategy** will the EU component of NATO be able to **play
its part** within the alliance]{.underline}

While many EU member states have already increased defence spending in
reaction to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, these efforts will now need
to be elevated to the EU level to ensure close coordination between
member states -- an objective also shared by NATO. Only with a
long-term, coordinated, intensified and complementary rearmament
strategy will the EU component of NATO be able to play its part within
the alliance as an effective deterrent force against Russia.

[Instead of debating if it should or shouldn't humiliate a belligerent
nuclear power, the EU must **strengthen itself** to **keep** Russia from
ever **crossing** the **line** as it did with Ukraine not but six months
ago.]{.underline} After all, as John Chipman of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) put it: [**"Humiliation** is a
**mild punishment** for **war crimes."**]{.underline}

[The war in Ukraine has been underway for over four months.]{.underline}
What began as [a European conflict has had **global

the destroyed cities and infrastructure are as high as \$750 billion.

During 2020-21, most economies that could afford to, provided generous
financial support to its citizens in the form of direct payments and
subsidised food to tide over the economic hardships caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic. Supply chains suffered disruptions, aggravated by
politics. Economic recovery has generated demand, creating inflationary
pressures. Today, [inflation rates are rising]{.underline} across the
world and in the largest economies have reached levels not seen since
the early 1980s. As these countries tighten money supply, [fears of
recession loom large. The war in Ukraine has aggravated the situation
for the poorer countries by creating food and fertilizer
shortages.]{.underline} The sharp surge in energy prices threatens the
prospects of economic recovery. Prospects of collective global action to
deal with these challenges appear remote, given growing tensions among
major powers.

Inflation rates are rising across the world and in the largest economies
have reached levels not seen since the early 1980s.

And so, the war grinds on, with no end in sight.

The inevitable conflict

It is a fact that Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, 2022 in gross
violation of the United Nations Charter and international law; it is
equally true that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is not
an innocent bystander. In 2022, Russia is the guilty one but NATO's
folly was to forget that the cost of its expansion goes up as it gets
closer to the Russian border. Its strategic error was in concluding that
Russia was in terminal decline and adopting an 'open door' policy.

By 2005, 11 former East European and Baltic states had joined NATO.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Russian President
Vladimir Putin described NATO's decision of moving eastwards and
deploying forces closer to Russian borders, "a serious provocation". The
warning was ignored. At the NATO summit in early 2008, the United States
pushed for opening membership for Ukraine and Georgia. France and
Germany, sensitive to Russian concerns, successfully blocked a
time-frame for implementation. As a compromise, it was the worst of both
worlds. It convinced Russia of NATO's hostility and dangled prospects
for Georgia and Ukraine that NATO could not fulfil.

NATO continued to strengthen its relationship with Ukraine by providing
it training and equipment, formalising it in 2020 by making Ukraine a
NATO Enhanced Opportunity Partner.

Later that year, Russia intervened in Georgia on the grounds of
protecting the Russian minorities, taking over the neighbouring
provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In 2014, following the
Euromaidan protests in Kiev against President Viktor Yanukovych, who was
pro-Russian, Russia annexed Crimea and pro-Russia separatists, assisted
by Russian mercenaries, created autonomous regions in eastern Ukraine.
The fuse, lit in 2008, was now smouldering.

Post-2014, NATO continued to strengthen its relationship with Ukraine by
providing it training and equipment, formalising it in 2020 by making
Ukraine a NATO Enhanced Opportunity Partner. The presence of warships
from Britain and the United States began to increase in the Black Sea.
In 2019, the United Kingdom entered into a cooperation agreement with
Ukraine to develop two new naval ports, Ochakiv on the Black Sea and
Berdyansk on the Sea of Azov, a move that Russia saw as potentially
threatening. The die was cast.

Liberalism trumps realism

[**Neither side wanted war.** NATO members insist that Ukraine would not
be joining NATO]{.underline} but remains unable to walk back from its
2008 statement. [This would be **seen as 'appeasement'**. In diplomacy,
appeasement had long been accepted as an honourable route to ensuring
peace]{.underline}, practised by the British since the mid-19th century
in its dealings with European powers and especially the U.S. as it
sought to enforce the Monroe Doctrine. Neville Chamberlain too used
appeasement to negotiate "peace in our times" in 1938 but Winston
Churchill employed it to pillory him and the term never regained
respectability thereafter.

An equivalent term surfaced --- sensitivity for each other's core
interests --- practised during the Cold War to prevent the U.S. and the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from getting into conflict.
With the end of the Cold War, this became history. The liberal school,
having vanquished the Marxist school of thought, was now convinced of
the righteousness of its cause. If only the rest of the world could be
made to see reason, democracy would flourish, free markets ensure
prosperity and a western-led rule-based order prevail. The triumph of
liberalism led the neo-con believers towards interventionism (Kosovo,
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, the Colour Revolutions, Syria); others,
attracted by the prospects of the Chinese and Russian markets, deluded
themselves that economic growth would lead to political openings.

The realist school of thought cautioned against military interventions
backed by a one-size-fits-all democratic prescription and the risks of
excessive economic dependence on China but these voices were dismissed.
Many U.S. scholars and strategic thinkers cautioned against NATO
enlargement, warning that Russia may be weak but it would be reckless to
ignore its security interests; they were charged with 'appeasement'.
Liberalism was upholding 'moral values'; amoral realism was easy to
reject as immoral.

The realist school of thought cautioned against military interventions
backed by a one-size-fits-all democratic prescription and the risks of
excessive economic dependence on China but these voices were dismissed.

French President Emmanuel Macron talked in February of the
Finlandisation model as an option for Ukraine. Austrian neutrality
imposed by the U.S., the USSR, the U.K. and France in 1955, enshrined in
its constitution was mentioned. But these solutions had found acceptance
in a war-weary Europe when politics was frozen by the Cold War. Finland
had accepted limited sovereignty and just two Presidents guided it ---
Urho Kekkonen (1956-82) and Mauno Koivisto (1982-94) and both also
served as Prime Ministers. In 2022, such stability is impossible with
power politics in flux, rivalries sharpening and populism on the
upswing.

In early March, in an interview to Russian media, the Ukrainian
President, Volodymyr Zelensky, declared that Ukraine was not pressing
for NATO membership but wanted neutrality to be guaranteed; he even
talked of autonomy for Donbas as a compromise and a period of 10 years
for talks on Crimea. But that interview was soon forgotten.

How wars end

[Wars often develop their own momentum and the Ukraine war is no
exception. Russia possibly **anticipated** a **short**, sharp conflict,
a **collapse** of the Kiev regime]{.underline} (perhaps similar to what
happened in Kabul last August), and a lack of NATO cohesion. [It has had
to readjust its aims as it has settled down to a long and brutal
war.]{.underline} The G-7, the European Union (EU) and NATO have
displayed unusual cohesion and Ukrainians have shown exemplary grit and
motivation. Russia is in a bind. Even its limited war aims of
controlling Donbas and the Black Sea coast have been a slog. Finland and
Sweden joining NATO will squeeze it further in the Baltic Sea.
[Ukraine's ability to fight **depends on** how long **western funds**
and military hardware keep flowing.]{.underline}

In a moral world, there is a right and wrong and Russia should be held
to account. But in the real world, other factors come into play. A blame
game or establishing the root cause will not help end the crisis.
Eventually, talks will need to take place, between Ukraine and Russia
and with NATO and the U.S. playing an outsize role behind the scenes.
This means acknowledging Russia's security interests in its
neighbourhood.

The G-7, the European Union (EU) and NATO have displayed unusual
cohesion and Ukrainians have shown exemplary grit and motivation.

The problem is that the [war is now being cast in **binaries** --- a
battle between **freedom** and **tyranny**, between democracy and
autocracy, a choice between rule-based order and brute force. This makes
compromise **difficult.**]{.underline} And [Russia **cannot be
defeated** unless NATO wants to engage in a **full-scale
war.**]{.underline}

[The longer the war continues, the greater the suffering
for]{.underline} the [Ukrain]{.underline}ians. [The more territory
Ukraine loses, the **weaker** will be its **bargaining position** at the
table.]{.underline} And the longer the war continues, [the greater the
risk of an **inadvertent escalation.** History tells us that when faced
with choices, major powers have a propensity to **double
down.**]{.underline} The nuclear taboo has held since 1945; sane voices
need to ensure that it is not breached. The sooner the war ceases, the
better it is for Ukrainians, Russians and the world. [It is an
**imperfect world**, but we do not have another.]{.underline}

[Russia will **struggle** to maintain its military campaign and Ukraine
may be able to **hit back**]{.underline}, the head Britain\'s foreign
intelligence service says.

MI6 chief Richard Moore said [Russia had seen ***\"epic fails\"*** in
its initial goals; removing **Ukraine\'s president**, capturing **Kyiv**
and **sowing disunity** in the West.]{.underline}

He was speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, in a rare public
appearance.

He called the invasion \"the most egregious naked act of aggression\...
in Europe since the Second World War.\"

He said recent [Russian gains were \"tiny\" and that Russia was \"about
to **run out of steam\".**]{.underline}

\"Our assessment is that [the Russians will increasingly find it
**difficult** to find **manpower** and materiel over the next few
weeks,\"]{.underline} Mr Moore told the conference in Colorado. [\"They
will have to pause in some way and that will give the Ukrainians the
**opportunity** to **strike back.\"**]{.underline}

That view may be seen as optimistic and [Ukraine\'s ability to
counter-attack may well **depend on** greater supplies of **Western
weaponry**, which its officials say has often been **too slow in
arriving.**]{.underline}

The MI6 chief said some kind of [**battlefield success** would be an
**\"important reminder** to the rest of Europe that this is a **winnable
campaign\"** - particularly ahead of a winter which was likely to see
pressure on **gas supplies.**]{.underline}

[\"We are in for a **tough time,\"**]{.underline} he said. [A further
reason to maintain **support** to help the Ukrainians win, or \"at least
**negotiate** from a **position** of **significant
strength\"**]{.underline}, he said, was [because China\'s leader **Xi**
Jinping was **\"watching** like a hawk\".]{.underline}

\"There\'s no evidence that \[President Vladimir\] Putin is suffering
from ill-health,\" he replied when asked, echoing comments from his US
counterpart CIA Director William Burns at the Forum yesterday.

Around 400 Russian intelligence officers operating under cover have been
expelled across Europe, he said, reducing Russia\'s ability to spy in
the continent by half.

\"Our door is always open,\" he said when it came to recruiting
disaffected Russian officials to spy for Britain.

MI6 puts most effort on China

On China, he said MI6 had \"never had any illusions whatsoever about
Communist China\".

He revealed MI6 now devoted more effort to China than to any other
single subject - the effort in this field having just moved past that
devoted to counter-terrorism.

He said it was \"too early to tell\" what lessons China would draw from
Putin\'s actions in Ukraine, but there were lots of signs officials in
Beijing were going into overdrive to work out what they thought. \"It is
quite difficult to read at the moment,\" he said.

He said [it was \"important\" to **remind China\'s leadership** of how
an **invasion of Taiwan** could go wrong.]{.underline} He said [China\'s
leadership **underestimated US resolve** and power and this might **lead
them to miscalculate.**]{.underline} \"I don\'t think it is
inevitable,\" he said when asked about a major conflict.

On Iran, he said a nuclear deal was \"absolutely on the table\", but he
was sceptical that Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wanted
to sign a deal.

For all the limitations, he said the previous deal was still the best
means available to constrain the Iranian nuclear programme.

Asked if the Western withdrawal from Afghanistan last year made it
harder to deal with threats, he acknowledged \"this was a reverse for us
when it happened and it is now more difficult\". He said it would
require finding \"different ways\" to deal with the Islamist terrorist
threat, including working with partners who MI6 may not normally deal
with.

Asked to reflect on the state of politics and violence in the United
States, the MI6 chief sidestepped the question, but stressed his \"huge
affection\" for the US, where he had studied and taken his first paid
job as a teenager.

He corrected the interviewer to say this job had been as a beach
attendant rather than a lifeguard. \"I didn\'t have the body for that,\"
he said to laughter from the audience.

#### China-Taiwan war goes nuclear. Deterrence is key. It's fast and more probable than European war.

Taiwan Could Go Nuclear," *Foreign Affairs*,

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, as Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his
nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned that any
effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result in
"consequences you have never seen." [Such saber-rattling has
understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. But if
China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United
States came to Taipei's aid, [the **threat of escalation could
outstrip** even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}. A recent war game, conducted by the Center for a
New American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027, with the aim of
examining how the United States and China might act under a certain set
of conditions. The game demonstrated that [China's military
modernization and expansion of its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with Taiwan---[mean
that, in the real world, a fight between China and the United States
could very well go nuclear]{.underline}. [Beijing views Taiwan as a
breakaway republic. If the Chinese Communist Party decides to invade the
island, its leaders may not be able to accept failure]{.underline}
without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy. [Thus, the CCP might
be willing to take significant risks to ensure that the conflict ends on
terms that it finds acceptable]{.underline}. That would mean convincing
the United States and its allies that the costs of defending Taiwan are
so high that it is not worth contesting the invasion. While China has
several ways to achieve that goal, [from Beijing's perspective, using
nuclear weapons may be the most effective]{.underline} means to keep the
United States out of the conflict. China is several decades into
transforming its People's Liberation Army (PLA) into what the Chinese
President Xi Jinping has called a "world-class military" that could
defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense. China's
warfighting strategy, known as "anti-access/area denial," rests on being
able to project conventional military power out several thousand miles
in order to prevent the American military, in particular, from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing
nuclear arsenal provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as
potentially new warfighting capabilities, which could increase the risks
of war and escalation]{.underline}. China has historically possessed
only a few hundred ground-based nuclear weapons. But last year, nuclear
scholars at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the
Federation of American Scientists identified three missile silo fields
under construction in the Xinjiang region. The Financial Times reported
that China might have carried out tests of hypersonic gliders as a part
of an orbital bombardment system that could evade missile defenses and
deliver nuclear weapons to targets in the continental United States. The
U.S. Department of Defense projects that by 2030, China will have around
1,000 deliverable warheads---more than triple the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that
as early as five years from now the PLA will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it could fight and win a war to
unify with Taiwan. [Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members
of Congress, former government officials, and subject matter experts
assumed the roles of senior national security decision makers in China
and the United States---[illustrated that a U.S.-Chinese war could
escalate quickly]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that [both
countries would face operational incentives to strike military forces on
the other's territory]{.underline}. In the game, such strikes were
intended to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both sides tried to walk
a fine line by attacking only military targets. But [such attacks
crossed red lines for both countries, and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle
of attacks that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict**]{.underline}. For instance, in the simulation, China launched
a preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region.
The attacks targeted Guam, in particular, because it is a forward
operating base critical to U.S. military operations in Asia, and because
since it is a territory, and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed
striking it as less escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In
response, the United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and
surrounding facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese
mainland. Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on
their home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii. A NEW ERA One particularly alarming finding from the war game is
that China found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was
repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland China had been
attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would
back down from the fight received greater attention by the China team
than the invasion of Taiwan itself. But China had difficulty convincing
the United States that its nuclear threats were credible. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its
smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making
nuclear threats. This may push China to preemptively detonate a nuclear
weapon to reinforce the credibility of its warning. [China might also
resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because of constraints on
its long-range conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years
from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch
conventional attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in
the Pacific; namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland
with conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
first use of a nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a
response. The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between
the United States and China are different from those that were most
likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States
feared a massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would
precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over
Taiwan, however, Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited
way to signal resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the
battlefield. It is unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of
limited nuclear use and whether the United States could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives. AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
[The clear lesson from the war game is that the United States needs to
**strengthen**]{.underline} its [**conventional capabilities** in the
Indo-Pacific to ensure that China **never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move**]{.underline}. To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks. Moreover, [the United States
needs to]{.underline} develop an integrated network of partners willing
to **[contribute to Taiwan's defense]{.underline}**. Allies are an
asymmetric advantage: the United States has them, and China does not.
[The United States should **deepen strategic and operational planning**
with key partners to **send a strong signal of resolve** to
China]{.underline}. As part of these planning efforts, the United States
and its allies will need to develop war-winning military strategies that
do not cross Chinese red-lines. The game highlighted just how difficult
this task may be; what it did not highlight is the complexity of
developing military strategies that integrate the strategic objectives
and military capacities of multiple nations. Moving forward, military
planners in the United States and in Washington's allies and partners
must grapple with the fact that, in a conflict over Taiwan, China would
consider all conventional and nuclear options to be on the table. And
[the United States is **running out of time** to strengthen deterrence
and keep China from believing an invasion of Taiwan could be successful.
**The biggest risk** is that Washington and its friends choose not to
seize the moment and act: **a year or two from now**, it might already
be too late]{.underline}.

[As the world looks on while Ukrainians fight for their lives and their
freedom, many feel a **burning desire** to do more to support them. The
problem is not a lack of forces or resources---it is **fear** of
provoking a wider, perhaps **nuclear**, war with Russia.
That]{.underline} fear [is why]{.underline} U.S. President Joe [Biden
and other NATO leaders have consistently made **clear** that they will
**not intervene** directly in the conflict]{.underline}, instead
limiting their help to weapons, money, intelligence, and sanctions. As
devastating as events in Ukraine are today, a nuclear war with Russia
could kill more people than Ukraine's entire population of roughly 44
million.

[NATO leaders understand that they must walk this **fine line** between
aiding Ukraine and risking war with Russia, but they have **no theory**
of **how** to do it.]{.underline} The German and French [governments hem
and haw about whether to provide Ukraine with tanks. When Poland
proposed a]{.underline} plan to transfer [MiG-29 fighter
aircraft]{.underline} to Ukraine, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[refused.]{.underline}** U.S. Defense Department
spokesperson John [Kirby warned that it "raises **serious concerns** for
the entire NATO alliance"]{.underline} and therefore was not "tenable."
[Yet the United States was already shipping Javelin antitank missiles
and Stinger surface-to-air missiles. Soon after, it began sending other
weapons, including M777 howitzers and now HIMARS multiple rocket
launchers. **What is the difference?** Those weapons **do more** to
strengthen Ukraine's combat power]{.underline} than MiG-29s, so the
theory cannot be that Russia reacts more strongly to policies that do
more harm to its interests. Why, then, missiles and artillery but not
planes? [The answer is that there is **no answer**. It is simply
**arbitrary.**]{.underline}

[NATO needs a **strategy** predicated on a theory of what it can do to
aid Ukraine]{.underline} without widening the war to a direct conflict
between it and Russia. [Lessons from past crises point to the
**principles** that should guide such a strategy.]{.underline} History
shows that [NATO would recklessly risk war only by crossing **two**
Russian **redlines**: openly **firing on Russian forces** or **deploying
organized combat units under NATO-member flags** into Ukraine. As long
as NATO stops short of]{.underline} unmistakably crossing [those lines,
it can do more to help Ukraine at an acceptable risk of
war.]{.underline}

[Arms transfers and sanctions are both wholly **consistent** with this
approach]{.underline}, so it is tempting to conclude that [NATO
members]{.underline} are doing all they can. They are not. They [should
**build on current policies** by dispensing with arbitrary limits on the
types of conventional weapons they are providing Ukraine and expanding
sanctions.]{.underline} Moreover, there is a third way to support
Ukraine besides arms and sanctions---one that NATO is neglecting. It is
time for NATO to encourage, organize, and equip its soldiers to
volunteer to fight for Ukraine.

WALKING THE LINE

[NATO should pursue a strategy of **going as far as possible** in
Ukraine **without plainly crossing Russia's
redlines**]{.underline}---meaning refusing to openly attack Russian
forces or send combat units into the country. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**prevailed** in the gravest crises of the Cold
War by using this approach.]{.underline}

The Cold War's first major showdown---the Berlin blockade of
1948--49---evinced this strategy. Although easily able to overwhelm
U.S., British, and French troops in what would become West Berlin---an
enclave deep inside Soviet-occupied East Germany---Soviet leader Josef
Stalin did not seize the territory. To do so would have meant attacking
those troops and thus provoking war. Instead, he imposed a blockade that
choked off food and coal for two million Berliners. When Soviet troops
blocked the roads and railways, [Western leaders declined to attack them
to reopen supply corridors. They resorted to an airlift instead, betting
that Stalin would not attack defenseless transport
aircraft.]{.underline} In the end, the vaunted Berlin airlift succeeded.

More than a decade later, American leaders decided to impose a blockade
in lieu of launching an open attack---this time, during the Cuban
missile crisis in 1962. Angered by the Soviet Union's attempt to sneak
nuclear missiles into Cuba and Moscow's lies about it, U.S. President
John F. Kennedy was initially inclined to destroy the missiles with
airstrikes. He and others around him, however, decided the risks were
too great. Director of Central Intelligence John McCone deemed
airstrikes too risky, writing in a memo that the "consequences of action
by the United States will be the inevitable 'spilling of blood' of
Soviet military personnel." He went on: "This will increase tension
everywhere and undoubtedly bring retaliation against U.S. foreign
military installations." Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev recognized
this, too. According to a transcript of his remarks at a Soviet
Presidium meeting, he feared that a U.S. attack would spark a war: "The
tragic thing---they can attack, and we will respond. This could escalate
into a large-scale war." [Kennedy chose neither to attack nor to accept
the missiles as a fait accompli. He instead **blockaded** Cuba. In
history's gravest nuclear crisis, **neither** leader ordered an
**attack.**]{.underline}

One attack did occur, however, when Soviet generals on the ground in
Cuba decided to launch surface-to-air missiles to shoot down an American
U-2 spy plane that had entered Cuban airspace. The attack killed U.S.
Major Rudolf Anderson, Jr., the pilot. Khrushchev's fears of war peaked
at that moment, and Moscow chastised the generals who carried out the
attack. Before retaliating, Kennedy gave diplomacy one last chance.
Shared fears about the implications of that shootdown led both sides to
make concessions that helped resolve the crisis. In the end, the United
States prevailed by taking risks without attacking.

The United States and the Soviet Union also engaged in proxy wars to
avoid attacking each other directly and starting World War III. Both
countries used large-scale arms shipments and sometimes soldiers
fighting as volunteers to support local forces. Designed to avoid
escalation, such covert wars are a common tactic in international
politics. During the Korean War, Soviet pilots secretly fought in the
Chinese air force. Soviet arms equipped North Vietnam, and Soviet
soldiers even operated surface-to-air missile batteries against U.S.
aircraft. Despite its losses, the United States decided to tolerate this
Soviet participation rather than widen either war. The Soviets also
allowed similar behavior from the United States on other battlefields.
When the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, for example, the United
States armed and financed the mujahideen resisting it. The Soviet Union
eventually withdrew. As recently as 2018, Russian Wagner Group
mercenaries in Syria unsuccessfully attacked U.S. forces operating
alongside Kurdish forces. The United States did not treat it as an
attack by the Russian government.

HOW FAR CAN NATO GO?

[These examples underscore that pushing as far as possible without
openly attacking is often the **best way** to **compete** while managing
escalation risks. **Creative policymaking** can **engineer options**
that achieve **objectives** without crossing redlines]{.underline}, thus
preventing a wider war. [Providing **intel**]{.underline}ligence [that
Ukrainian forces use]{.underline} to kill Russian [soldiers is **not the
same** as NATO openly attacking Russia, **nor is support in
cyberspace.**]{.underline} Lithuania's restrictions on Russia's use of
its territory to ship goods to Kaliningrad meet this standard. [Even
enlarging NATO]{.underline} to include Finland and Sweden and deploying
forces eastward to defend NATO members bordering Russia [entail
**acceptable risks**]{.underline}; such [actions do **not constitute**
an **attack** on Russia. In fact, there is good reason to think that
**NATO** can **do even more** in Ukraine without provoking a wider
war.]{.underline}

[Some believe that Russia's nuclear weapons]{.underline} and greater
interests in Ukraine [give it the advantage over NATO. This is
**mistaken.**]{.underline} It is true that [NATO leaders prioritize
avoiding war with Russia over aiding Ukraine, but it is just as true
that **war with NATO** would **cost Russia far more** than would abiding
most forms of aid to Ukraine.]{.underline} After all, [Russia is already
struggling mightily against Ukraine.]{.underline} It cannot
simultaneously win a conventional war with NATO. [And no one would win a
nuclear war.]{.underline}

Interests alone do not determine who has the advantage when both sides
wish to avoid war. Instead, [the **advantage** goes to the **side** that
puts the **other** in the **difficult position** of choosing whether to
**escalate** or accept a limited **defeat.** The side that must

Needs to Negotiate With Putin,"

RES

"It's not that I want to talk to Putin," Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky said last week about Russia's president. "I need to talk to
Putin. [The world **needs** to talk to Putin. There is **no other way to
stop this war**]{.underline}." [The United States should heed this
plea]{.underline}. Ukraine's resistance to Russia's unprovoked and
illegal invasion has been both heroic and effective, but its situation
is precarious. [For all their flaws, Russia's armed forces may yet
prevail in a prolonged conflict, and there is still a real danger that
much of Ukraine will become a Russian vassal state under a puppet
government]{.underline}. Moreover, even if Ukraine can hold off Russian
forces indefinitely, the prospect of forcibly evicting them from its
territory---particularly in the south---is daunting. All the while,
Russia is slaughtering Ukraine's citizens ever more indiscriminately.
But as Zelensky's statement suggests, Ukraine's plan to end this war is
probably not to vanquish the invading forces. Rather, its goal appears
to be to make the prospect of continuing the war, and the occupation
that could follow it, exceptionally painful for Russia---so painful that
Putin comes to view a settlement agreement that preserves Ukraine's
independence as the lesser of two evils. Putin may already be feeling
the pain. The United States believes that Putin embarked on this war
seeking to conquer most or all of Ukraine. Today, Moscow has implicitly
recognized Zelensky's government by demanding, in return for an end to
the war, that Kyiv agree to Ukrainian neutrality, acknowledge Crimea as
Russian territory, and recognize Donetsk and Lugansk as independent
states. If Ukrainian forces continue to perform well, Putin will have to
settle for still less and may even have to pay Ukraine reparations.
(Conversely, if Russian forces achieve breakthroughs, Putin will be able
to drive a harder bargain.) Even in the best case, [if Zelensky wants a
negotiated settlement, he will likely have to make significant
concessions to Russia---as he has acknowledged]{.underline}. Any such
concessions will probably be bitterly opposed by many in the United
States and Europe. Ultimately, though, it is not their call. The
democratically elected government of Ukraine should get to decide what

As the forces of Russia and Ukraine continue to engage in the ravaging
war, [US National Security Council (NSC) coordinator John Kirby stated
that it\'s **not Washington\'s role** to press Kyiv to engage in peace
talks with Moscow]{.underline}. "It's time for the United States to
continue to support Ukraine, and that's what we are doing," Kirby told a
journalist on Fox News Sunday. [He went on to say that the decision of
whether and when to pursue a diplomatic settlement with Russia would
**always** be made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
\"President Zelenskyy gets to determine how victory is decided and when
and on what terms. And what we're going to do is continue to make sure
that can succeed on the battlefield so that he can succeed at the
table.]{.underline} But even President Zelenskyy will tell you that the
time is not now for those discussions,\" the US NSC coordinator added.
According to reports, Russian troops continue to make steady progress in
Ukraine\'s eastern region and launched recent strikes on Kyiv and other
cities in the country. Kirby also commended Ukrainian forces, saying
that they have resisted Russian invaders far more successfully than
anyone anticipated.

# Germany-Russia Relations

## 1NC -- Germany Relations

### 1NC -- German Economic Collapse Scenario

#### German-Russia relations are high [despite]{.underline} the Ukraine War -- lack of draw towards NATO [solidifies]{.underline} Russian influence

Stefan **Meister '22**, Head of Program, International Order and
Democracy, DGAP, "Germany's Russia problem", Wilson Center, 2/1/22,
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/germanys-russia-problem

[In the framework of Russia's military buildup near Ukraine and the
Kremlin's calls for a new security order for Europe, Germany has become
the weak spot for the West]{.underline}. [It is the major entry point
for the Kremlin to divide Europe and upset transatlantic
relations]{.underline}. With the departure of Angela Merkel, however,
Germany finds itself without an adequate Russia policy and irresolute in
its defense of Ukraine. **[The new governing coalition in
Germany]{.underline}**, which sees the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz as
chancellor, Annalena Baerbock of the Green Party as foreign minister,
and the Liberal Christian Lindner as minister of finance, **[lacks a
common Russia and Eastern Europe policy]{.underline}**. [This leads to
disagreements on how to respond to the substantial security challenge
Europe is facing now]{.underline}. **[The new coalition's agreement had
no clear statement on Russia]{.underline}**. [Nord Stream 2, a
particular point of contention for the EU and the United States, was not
mentioned at all]{.underline}. The text said only that Germany's energy
policy is to be regulated at the EU level. **[Chancellor Scholz seems
unwilling to deal with the Russia challenge and allows the leftists in
his own party to undermine Germany's and Europe's sanction and
deterrence efforts]{.underline}**. The governing coalition appears to
lack leadership on the current crisis with Russia. **[German politics
and society are divided over Russia]{.underline}**. [There is still a
strong legacy of guilt linked to the Nazi regime and the more than 20
million deaths in the Soviet Union; Ostpolitik has also had a long tail
affecting current sentiment in Germany]{.underline}. Former chancellor
Willy Brandt's decision to open relations between the former West
Germany and the Eastern bloc, which became known as his administration's
Ostpolitik, is a solid part of the identity of the Social Democratic
Party (SPD) and important segments of German society. [Many talk about
Russia, but few people in the Bundestag today really understand the
logic of Putin's regime]{.underline}. **[There are wings in both the
Green Party and the SPD that are opposed to supplying weapons to Ukraine
or challenging nuclear deterrence]{.underline}**. Relevant parts of the
SPD want to see Nord Stream 2 operational, and Frank Walter Steinmeier
(also of the SPD) a year ago was still arguing that Nord Stream 2 and
Germany's energy policy were probably the last bridges to Russia. **[The
rhetorical ambiguity with regard to Nord Stream 2 and possible sanctions
supports the perception in the Kremlin that there will be again no tough
sanctions imposed by the West, just as no tough sanctions were imposed
in 2008, in response to the Russo-Georgian War, or in 2014, with the
Russian occupation of eastern Ukraine]{.underline}**. Key politicians
from the biggest opposition party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
have made it clear they will not support the international banking
system SWIFT sanctions and argue that sanctions levied against Russia
should not harm Germany too much, especially in a time of high energy
prices. Several key actors in the governing coalition, including those
from the (neo)liberal Free Democratic Party, support this position.
Crisis of Communication **[Germany, with its history of Nazi rule, has
credible grounds for its refusal to supply weapons to
Ukraine]{.underline}**. **[But with the changing security situation in
Europe, Germany needs to engage in a responsible debate on this topic, a
debate nobody is willing to lead]{.underline}**. [At the same time, it
is incomprehensible that Germany should try to prevent NATO partner
Estonia from supplying older East German뇶rigin weapons to
Ukraine]{.underline}. **[The unwillingness of Chancellor Scholz to
clarify Germany's position has created a communication crisis for the
German government]{.underline}**. He does not provide leadership for
Germany on Russian bellicosity, and Germany is not leading Europe in
addressing the current crisis. In this light it becomes ever clearer how
important Angela Merkel was in providing leadership to Europe with
respect to Russia after the annexation of Crimea and the start of the
war in the Donbas, and in maintaining a direct channel of communication
with the Russian president. [The current lack of a strong German
presence weakens Europe even more at a time when Moscow has made clear
that only talks with Washington are relevant in discussing the future of
Ukraine and European security]{.underline}. The U.S. president Joe
**[Biden took political risks when he made a deal with Angela Merkel on
Nord Stream 2. He further supported Germany in the U.S Congress by
preventing, at the time, additional sanctions against Russia. But
Germany is not returning the favor]{.underline}**. **[Lower gas prices
and finalization of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline seem to be more important
than a united transatlantic front. Germany now receives more than 50
percent of its gas from Russia, making it even more
vulnerable]{.underline}**. **[This dependence weakens the Western
sanctions policy and Ukraine]{.underline}**. Germany under Angela Merkel
had become the main political partner for Ukraine after Poland pivoted
to focusing on historical and domestic policy issues.

#### German relations with Russia are increasing due to lack of a cohesive NATO vision for European security -- the plan flips that

While many Central and Eastern European countries, as well as the three
Baltic republics, view Russia as their key geopolitical challenge, [many
Western and European allies are predisposed to see both Russia and China
more from a geoeconomic than geopolitical perspective]{.underline}.
**[While they feel quite concerned about the challenges that China and
Russia pose to the roots of the liberal international order, the Western
European allies seem to share the view that adopting a tough
geopolitical approach toward Russia and China would likely diminish any
hope left to help revitalize multilateral global
governance]{.underline}** in the years to come. [From a European
perspective, it would not be possible to achieve long-term peace and
stability across the European continent if Russia were to be excluded
from the European security architecture as a legitimate
player]{.underline}. **[Indeed, pushing Russia further into a corner
would endanger European security]{.underline}**. **[A similar situation
prevails in the context of the Europeans\' relations with
China]{.underline}**. China offers Europe immense opportunities to tap
into. **[It is quite notable that Germany is not buying into American
pressure to stop cooperating with Russia in the Nord Stream II project,
nor are many European allies heeding the American warning that they
would do well to prevent China from building the 5G telecommunication
infrastructure]{.underline}** across the continent.

**[Given that the U.S. is no longer as committed to European defense at
it was in the past and does not want to act as the sole leader of the
liberal international order any longer, it behooves the European allies
to develop their own capabilities to survive as an herbivorous actor
among such carnivorous powers as Russia, China and the
U.S]{.underline}**. **[The willingness of the European allies to mantle
such a role in the emerging global order is now more evident than
ever]{.underline}**, and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von
der Layen has underlined that the EU will have to evolve into a
geopolitical actor. [This seems to explain why the EU has recently
mentioned China in its documents as a systemic rival while signing off
on NATO\'s latest communique in late 2019 that the rise of China and
Russia now offer both opportunities and challenges]{.underline}.

[European members of NATO would likely invest in building up their hard
and soft power capabilities if this were the only way for them to
protect their decades-old achievements alongside the EU-integration
process]{.underline}. They need to acquire a more geopolitical vision in
order to survive in the emerging great power competitions. **[It remains
to be seen, however, whether they will build up their geopolitical
identity within a NATO]{.underline}** or an EU
**[framework]{.underline}**. **[It is also uncertain whether they view
the U.S. as a committed believer in the liberal international
order]{.underline}**\--**[or as a rouge global power that adopts a
zero-sum perspective toward international politics and sees the world
from a sphere of influence mentality]{.underline}**. It **[is an
open-ended question whether the transatlantic allies will be able to
refashion NATO as a credible global security actor]{.underline}** that
meets the challenges of the emerging century.

#### Relations with Russia are [key]{.underline} to the German economy -- underpins the [entire]{.underline} EU economic system

Evgeny **Tugolukov 7/13**/22, investor, founder of the Medscan group of
medical companies., "Evgeny Tugolukov: Germany's prosperity is fueled by
Russia, and the Siemens story suggests the penny may be dropping in
Berlin", RT, 7/13/22,
https://www.rt.com/news/558883-germanys-prosperity-fueled-by-rus/

[Since its historic reunification in 1990, Germany has secured its
prosperity with advanced industry and technologies]{.underline}, which
in turn has been driven by the hard work and creative spirit of its
people. **[However, to a large extent, the success of German industry
was ensured by energy and raw materials from Russia, which made its
goods more competitive on the global market]{.underline}**. **[This
informal alliance]{.underline}**, in many ways, **[allowed Berlin to
become the locomotive of the entire economy of the European Union, and
enabled Russia to overcome the crisis of the 1990s that followed the
collapse of the USSR]{.underline}**. In the days of Gerhard Schr칬der's
chancellorship, **[Russian-German relations were a model of mutually
beneficial cooperation]{.underline}**. From a philosophical point of
view, the fate of the two countries is an example of an historical
paradox, when how things are contradict how they should be. Right now,
we are not in direct conflict, but clearly Berlin, along with its
Western allies, has engaged in a proxy fight with Russia. One that has
been building since shortly after Schr칬der left office and his
successor, Angela Merkel, agreed to a number of measures which set the
course for a confrontation. The "Iron Chancellor" Otto von Bismarck, the
founder of the united German state, once prophetically said: "A war
between Germany and Russia is the greatest stupidity. That's why it's
bound to happen." From the point of view of objective logic, a strategic
alliance between the two great continental powers could be a guarantor
of peace and prosperity in Europe. Sadly, now it is difficult to discuss
the perspectives of a partnership, but the Germans, as practical people,
always think -- and indeed talk -- about what will come the day after
some tumultuous event. Severing ties that have developed over decades is
fraught with hardship. Thus, there is still hope that among the elites
of Western countries there will prevail not only the instinct of
self-preservation, but also a rational approach, which is usually so
characteristic of the Germans. In this sense, the outcome of the Siemens
gas turbine story can be considered a landmark event. Of course, the
company produces far more than turbines. [The exchange of knowledge,
experience, technology, equipment, and pharmaceuticals plays a huge
role]{.underline}. **[Thus, attempts to isolate Russia will not only
lead to human suffering, which is immoral, but also slows down the
development of research in many areas]{.underline}**. Such as in
medicine, for example, where -- as the COVID-19 pandemic has recently
shown -- every day counts. [Cooperation in humanitarian areas such as
healthcare can pull our relationship out of the hole where it currently
exists]{.underline}. **[The revival of interaction in such cases, there
is no place for confrontation, will help develop both economies, and
restore trust]{.underline}**. Do not forget that a native of Lower
Saxony, Baron Karl von Munchausen, who served as an officer for the
Russian empresses and even took part in one of the Russo-Turkish wars,
was able (if, of course, we can believe his stories) to pull himself,
along with his horse, out of a swamp by his own hair. **[Germany needs
Russia and Russia needs Germany]{.underline}**. More importantly, **[a
safe, secure, and prosperous Europe needs them both working in
harmony]{.underline}**. **[The alternative will benefit neither
side]{.underline}**.

#### Collapse of EU economy results in [cascading economic warfare]{.underline} that draws in all countries in the region -- on the brink [now]{.underline} due to Ukraine

Amanda **Cooper 7/12**/22, freelance journalist, "As \'economic
warfare\' threatens to break out in Europe, the euro finally crumbles
below \$1 for the first time since 2002", Yahoo! News, 7/12/22,
https://www.yahoo.com/news/economic-warfare-threatens-break-europe-102400479.html

[The euro hit exactly \$1 for the first time in 20 years on Tuesday,
after Russia\'s decision to shut off a major natural gas pipeline
threatened to wreak havoc across the region and business sentiment in
Europe\'s economic powerhouse hit a 10-year low]{.underline}. The euro
has lost around 12% in value against the dollar already this year, in
part because of an expectation for the Federal Reserve to raise US rates
more quickly than the European Central Bank will raise eurozone rates,
even though both are racing to contain surging inflationary pressures.
Behind the drive towards the buck this week has been Russia closing the
Nord Stream 1 natural gas pipeline for 10 days this month for seasonal
maintenance. While closures for maintenance are routine on refineries or
pipelines, the fear among European governments is that Moscow will not
reopen it, which could pave the way for an epic surge in energy prices.
\"T**[his scenario will also create massive gas shortages in the region,
prompting authorities to implement fuel rationing and, in the worst
case, order brief shutdowns of factories to reduce energy consumption
heading into the winter season, paving the way for what could be a deep
recession]{.underline}**,\" Diego Colman market analyst at Daily FX,
said. \"**[The threat of economic warfare will be on every trader\'s
mind and depress the euro in the coming days until market participants
have a better idea of what Russia plans to do next]{.underline}**,\" he
said. The final catalyst arrived on Tuesday, when an index of German
businesses showed confidence hitting a 10-year low in July of -53.8,
marking a sharp deterioration from June\'s -28. \"**[The experts assess
the current economic situation significantly more negatively than in the
previous month and have further lowered their already unfavorable
forecast for the next six months]{.underline}**,\" Achim Wambach,
president of the ZEW institute, which produces the survey, said. The
euro briefly hit a session low in Europe of \$0.9999, before recovering
modestly to \$1.00377, flat on the day. The last time it went below \$1
was December 2002. **[Europe relies on Russia for 40% of its natural gas
needs, most of which arrive via pipeline]{.underline}**. [Russia was
already piping gas at around 40% capacity through Nord Stream 1 in
retaliation for Western sanctions on its financial and energy sectors
over its war in Ukraine]{.underline}. With regional natural gas prices
now showing a 380% increase compared with last year and little prospect
of shoring up inventories ahead of the winter, EU governments are
scrambling to find alternative sources of fuel, firing up idled coal and
even nuclear plants, and some have even considered rationing. [Wholesale
inflation in the eurozone is running at an eye-watering 36.3%, largely
because of energy prices, while that in the United States is just
10.8%]{.underline}. The ECB has not yet raised interest rates, which are
at 0%, while the Fed has raised rates to 1.75% from 0.25-0.50% at the
start of the year and more large hikes are in the works. [Another
unwelcome surge in natural gas prices could force manufacturers and
businesses across the region to slow, or shutter activity altogether,
which could keep the euro below \$1.00 for some time]{.underline},
analysts said. \"**[I fear that once this dam is broken, the euro could
settle below that level]{.underline}** for the time being, until we
(hopefully) know at the end of next week whether the gas is flowing
again,\" Commerzbank strategist Antje Praefcke said in a note.

#### Multiple scenarios for extinction

Final Domino for the European Union?", Paste Magazine, December 15,
2016,

For many Americans reading this, there is no doubt a sense of remove
from the relevance of the European project. Think of it this way: [for
centuries Europe was the Middle East of the world. It was a war-hungry,
dysfunctional, violent, chaotic piece of the globe that could barely go
a decade without a barbaric, usually pointless blood-letting conflict.
Since World War II]{.underline} and the **[economic and political
integration]{.underline}** that [brought]{.underline} former
nation-state rivals into mutually beneficial [coexistence]{.underline},
the continent has been a region of [remarkable prosperity and
stability]{.underline}. Keep in mind, this has never happened before in
human history: a set of political leaders and their constituents
voluntarily chose to cede elements of sovereignty in order to form a
better, stronger union. The United States and Great Britain, often
mentioned as democratic ideals, were two empires won by violent conquest
in which wealthy elites only begrudgingly allowed democracy to sift down
to the most impoverished and brutalized citizens.

The parochial movements of the last five to ten years---from the EU's
troubles to the Scottish independence vote to the surge of American
nationalism that brought us such phenomenon as the go-it-alone war in
Iraq and now Donald Trump---have different roots and causes but they do
share a common thread. [We live in an increasingly complex and
interdependent world where the greatest threats to peace, individual
well-being, and human flourishing are largely **transnational**.
**Climate change**, **infectious disease**, **nuclear proliferation**,
**financial crisis**, **cyber insecurity**]{.underline}---these [are all
borderless phenomenon]{.underline} that do not care if their victims are
French, British, American, or Syrian. Their worst consequences do not
care about our flags, languages, religions, or skin colors. And [yet at
a time when transnational peril necessitates a greater need for
cooperation, tolerance, and unity, Western liberal democracies are
taking a hard turn into fragmentation, arrogance, self-pity, and denial.
The break-up of the **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
brought on by a wave of selfish, quasi-authoritarian nationalism [would
be a **staggering blow** to the economic and political security of what
remains of the increasingly precarious free **world**]{.underline}.

President Vladimir [Putin has been intensifying Russia's aggressive
stance for years, with the Georgian war in 2008 and the annexation of
Crimea in 2014]{.underline}. **[Even so, Berlin's ties with Moscow have
remained strong]{.underline}**. According to Germany's Federal
Statistical Office, **[trade with the Russian Federation increased in
January 2022 compared with January 2021]{.underline}**. [German exports
to Russia increased by 30.7 percent while imports grew by 57.8 percent
compared with the previous year]{.underline}. [Since the war began in
Ukraine, Berlin has begun phasing out its trade relations by imposing
sanctions against Russian oligarchs and businesses and supporting a
proposed European Union ban on Russian oil]{.underline}. **[But some
German officials continue to maintain a close relationship with the
Kremlin]{.underline}**. Former German Chancellor Gerhard **[Schr칬der has
kept key positions at Russia's oil firm Rosneft and energy giant
Gazprom]{.underline}**. While he has participated in efforts to broker
peace, his bond with Putin has been criticised. "[For a long time,
German decision-makers were under the illusion of a 'change through
trade' policy approach]{.underline}. However, Gerhard **[Schr칬der in
particular has also lost his 'democratic compass' towards Russia by
turning his close ties with Putin into a personal benefit for himself
and by refusing to dissociate from the Russian leader]{.underline}** --
**[despite Russia's aggression in Ukraine]{.underline}**," Stefan
Scheller, an associate fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations
told Al Jazeera. But, according to Ischinger, the former chancellor's
relationships and business affairs are a private matter. "Germany has a
system, which is a system based on freedom. The former chancellor can
conduct whatever business he wishes to do, just like anybody else. He
does get criticised every day by almost everyone because people don't
like his close association with the Kremlin. But that's his problem and
not the problem of the German government," he told Al Jazeera. Scholz

Steinmeier would not be welcome in the capital because of his close
relations with Putin]{.underline}**. But the president has admitted to
"getting Putin wrong" and that the now-halted Nord-Stream 2 project,
which he advocated, was a mistake. Referring to Scholz, Ukraine's
ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, said his ostensibly retaliatory
refusal to visit doesn't sound very "statesmanlike". [This was not the
first time Ukraine has called out a German chancellor's
actions]{.underline}. In early April, Ukrainian President Volodymyr
[Zelenskyy referred to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision to block Ukraine's NATO
application bid as a "miscalculation" that led to "the most horrific war
in Europe since World War II]{.underline}".

[Moscow]{.underline} on Tuesday [announced that some of the more than
100,000 troops and hardware amassed along Ukraine's border were
returning to their bases at the end of planned exercises]{.underline}.
Western leaders have accused Moscow of positioning the troops in advance
of a possible invasion of pro-Western Ukraine, warning that any attack
would be met with severe economic sanctions. Speaking at a press
conference after talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow,
**[Scholz said Russia was a crucial player in maintaining security in
Europe and that Russia must remain a partner in ensuring stability on
the continent.]{.underline}** \"**[For Europeans it is clear that
lasting security cannot be achieved against Russia but only with
Russia]{.underline}**,\" he told reporters. "**[The diplomatic
possibilities are far from being exhausted]{.underline}**," Scholz said.
"[That we hear now some troops have withdrawn is a good sign, we hope

situation seems to be, I refuse to say it is hopeless.]{.underline}"

committed to ensuring gas transit in Europe works through Ukraine,
Belarus, Poland and Nord Stream 1 according to the agreements we have.

intent on ensuring that a confrontation did not occur in Ukraine, if
that were to happen, there would be consequences. [The controversial
Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which bypasses Ukraine in bringing Russian
energy to Germany, has emerged as a sticking point in Berlin's relations
with Washington and Kyiv. Many observers in Europe are concerned over
Germany's increasing reliance on Russian energy]{.underline}. Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that Russia would use the
pipeline as leverage. "[We have certain disagreements in our
assessments" of the Russia-Germany energy link, Zelensky said after

[The escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine at the beginning
of 2022 raises the question of Germany\'s reliability with its
partners]{.underline} - [within the Atlantic Alliance or the European
Union]{.underline} (EU) . **[In this crisis, Germany first appears as
the \"weakest link\" of Europe, even the \"Trojan horse\" of Russia
within]{.underline}** the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[NATO]{.underline}**). **[This Russian-Ukrainian crisis
has]{.underline}** **[had the effect of \"testing both the cohesion of
the new \'\'traffic light\'\' coalition]{.underline}**, the authority of
Chancellor Scholz and the adaptability of German foreign policy
postMerkel1 \". [Within the Chancellor\'s party, the Social Democratic
Party of Germany]{.underline} (SPD), [there are a large number of "
Ru륿and-Verstehers ", who have a measured, even complacent attitude
towards Vladimir Putin]{.underline}. The case of former Social Democrat
Chancellor Gerhard Schr칬der (1998-2005) is the most symptomatic. **[The
\"personal friend\" of Vladimir Putin sits on the boards of Russian
energy companies such as Nord Stream AG and Rosneft, and is due to join
that of Gazprom in June 2022]{.underline}**. After his controversial
remarks on the \"threatening attitude\" of Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf
Scholz had to clarify his position on Gerhard Schr칬der2. The former
Chancellor has today, despite the pressure, still not resigned from his
post, but he is increasingly isolated. Green MEP Reinhard B칲tikofer
spoke of personal sanctions against him, and most of his close aides
resigned in early March. Gerhard Schr칬der is certainly an extreme case
within the SPD in terms of his position on Russia, but opposing camps
have existed for a long time on this subject. This is why the party\'s
new co-president, Lars Klingbeil, wanted to put an end to the
dissonance. **[This position within the SPD has, however, marked German
foreign policy in recent years]{.underline}** -- especially since the
Social Democrats have occupied the Foreign Ministry for twelve years out
of the sixteen that have passed. **[This ambiguity vis--vis Russia is
shared by other political parties, such as Angela Merkel\'s Christian
Democratic Party]{.underline}** (CDU). **[Admittedly, the former
Chancellor was known for her cordial]{.underline}** --
**[reciprocal]{.underline}** -- **[intimacy with Vladimir
Putin]{.underline}**, but it had always refused to characterize the Nord
Stream 2 project as anything other than a "purely economic" project. She
had also refused to put this project in the balance during the balance
of power with Russia in August 2020 -- when she welcomed the opponent
Alexe칦 Navalny in Berlin. **[Finally, within the army, certain officials
also adopted an ambiguous attitude, which may have sown doubt as to
German intentions]{.underline}**. [The head of the German Navy, Admiral

[The unfolding crisis in Ukraine **reveals** that reality **cuts** both
ways]{.underline}.

[Germany's allies hoped]{.underline} Olaf [Scholz's
coalition]{.underline}, which includes the Russia-critical Greens,
[would back away from]{.underline} the accommodative policies toward
[Moscow]{.underline} that marked the Angela Merkel era. Recent days have
shown such optimism to be misplaced.

[As Washington has tried to present a united Western front against
Russian intimidation in recent weeks, Germany has been a **conspicuous**
**outlier**. Under the influence of a potent cocktail of **energy** and
commercial interests, and a political culture laced with good
old-fashioned **anti-Americanism**, Germany]{.underline} has
[**strayed** from the West]{.underline}ern fold.

To outward appearances, Berlin is far from AWOL on Ukraine.

"After years of rising tensions, staying silent isn't a sensible
option," Chancellor Scholz said on Wednesday in reference to Russia's
amassing of troops on the Ukrainian border, stressing that Germany was
committed to Ukraine's territorial integrity.

"It's hard not to see this as a threat," Foreign Minister Annalena
Baerbock said of the border buildup on a trip to Moscow this week.

But [when the cameras are turned off, Germany's **tone
changes**]{.underline}.

While the U.K. scrambles to deliver tanks, rocket artillery and other
weaponry to the Ukrainians, [Germany has refused to send even
rifles]{.underline}.

And [instead of locking arms with]{.underline} the U.S. and other
transatlantic [allies to help Ukraine]{.underline} prepare for an
attack, [Germany has sought to **placate Russia** by taking]{.underline}
some of [the West's most powerful deterrents off the table]{.underline}.

[As the crisis has **intensified**, German officials]{.underline} and
politicians [have strenuously opposed using the threat of suspending
Russia]{.underline} from SWIFT, the Belgium-based international payments
system, [a step that would make it **extremely difficult**
for]{.underline} Russian [**entities** to **engage in international**
commerce.]{.underline}

Even Germany's conservative opposition cautioned against using SWIFT as
a bargaining chip. Friedrich Merz, leader of the center-right Christian
Democrats, said suspending Russia's access to the network would be the
financial market equivalent of dropping an "atomic bomb."

While Scholz has signaled that halting Nord Stream 2, a natural gas
pipeline between Germany and Russia awaiting final regulatory approval,
would "have to be discussed" if Russia invades Ukraine, he has stopped
well short of pledging to do so.

So what's Berlin's plan? Germany's big idea for resolving the Ukraine
crisis is to revive a dormant diplomatic process known as the Normandy
Format that includes Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine but, notably,
not the U.S. (That same gathering came up with the so-called Minsk
accords, a failed effort to halt the fighting in eastern Ukraine.)

Out of sync

[**Pipeline politics** and the **affinity** many German elites hold for
Russia are often cited to explain Berlin's steadfast refusal to take a
harder line toward Russia.]{.underline}

For German policymakers today, **[Russia's readiness to have an
adversarial political relationship with Germany and disrupt its
alliances while continuing to sell it gas and buy its goods is
disturbingly counter-intuitive]{.underline}**. To them, [it makes no
sense for Russia to turn away from Europe and sacrifice a relationship
with Germany that brought it clear advantages in the past.]{.underline}
**[After all, Germany lobbied for the G7 to expand to include Russia. It

its allies to show sensitivity to Russia]{.underline}**. For example,
[it played a key role in 2008 in blocking the US proposal in NATO to
give Membership Action Plans to Georgia and Ukraine]{.underline}. It
also took on the burden of justifying the Nord Stream pipelines designed

progress towards becoming a more responsible stakeholder in Europe,
especially since Russia's 2014 invasion of Crimea. Foreign-policy
officials and eventually even former German Chancellor Angela erkMel had
come to understand that Russian revisionism had teeth. [Berlin had
started to tack away from a na칦ve view of Germany-Russia relations and
toward a more hawkish stance. **The last few weeks have undermined
German credibility among allies and partners**]{.underline}---from Kyiv

[If the German political class today has fewer illusions about Russia,

gas pipeline is a monument to Germany's undimmed desire to use economic
relations as a tool to stabilize Europe's ties with Moscow and to
prevent Russia's isolation]{.underline}**. Although Merkel is believed
to have privately hoped that the pipeline was in breach of EU
competition law and would not go ahead, she has made no effort to stand
in its way. [Merkel has belatedly accepted that Nord Stream 2 is not
just a commercial project, and the German government is now trying to
agree a formula with the US that will incentivize Russia to continue the
transit of gas through Ukraine and limit the Kremlin's ability to use
the pipeline for geopolitical purposes]{.underline}. **[Germany's
instincts towards Russia are shaped in large measure by the
contradictory and violent history between the two countries in the
twentieth century.]{.underline}** **[Germany fears Russia but admires it
at the same time]{.underline}**. **[It senses that Europe is incomplete
without Russia firmly anchored within it, but cannot reconcile itself to
the fact that today's version of Russia is not compatible with today's
Europe]{.underline}**. **[At the same time, Germany tries to avoid
confrontation and struggles to resist aggressive Russian
behavior]{.underline}**. It cannot countenance supplying defensive
weapons to Ukraine. Its historical narrative about "the east" gives
little space to the Belarusian and Ukrainian lands, a reflection of its
discomfort with the murderous devastation carried out there by Hitler's
armies. Instead, Germany transfers its sense of guilt about Nazi crimes
inflicted on the peoples of the USSR exclusively to modern Russia. Its
academic expertise on Belarus and Ukraine is strikingly underdeveloped
compared to that on Russia. [With her East German background, Merkel has
a clear understanding of Russia and is far from indifferent to
Ukraine]{.underline}. For all her limitations, she has provided vital
support to Kyiv since 2014. [Her successor is unlikely to bring the same
insight and confidence to dealing with Germany's eastern
neighborhood]{.underline}.

influence in Germany", Germany\'s Russia problem, Published by

**[German discussion of Russian influence in Germany focuses almost
exclusively on disinformation, cyber vulnerabilities and the
susceptibility of the Russian German community to the AfD
message]{.underline}**. Clearly, these should all be factors of concern
for German policymakers, but they pale in comparison to the significance
of Russia's well-established networks in Germany across the worlds of
politics, business, media and NGOs. **[These make Germany an easy target
for Russian influence operations]{.underline}**. [There has been no
in-depth research on the political connections of the CDU/ CSU and SPD
in Russia]{.underline}. For example, [it is surely significant that the
East German head of the CDU's political foundation office in Moscow has
close personal ties with the Kremlin party, United
Russia.]{.underline}61 **[Yet, in an article discussing foreign
political influence in Germany, the head of counter-intelligence at the
domestic intelligence agency did not even refer to these
relationships]{.underline}**62 -- an indication perhaps of their
sensitivity. The registration of the DOC and the lack of restrictions on
the professional activities of former officials point to further
alarming gaps in Germany's counterintelligence defences. **[In addition,
Russia's influence-building activities benefit from another factor in
Germany, which is unavailable elsewhere in Europe]{.underline}**.
**[Despite tensions in bilateral relations, the combination of trauma
about Russia and gratitude for reunification require the political class
to think in terms of reconciliation with Moscow and to pursue dialogue
and cooperation]{.underline}**. **[This creates multiple opportunities
across different fronts to build relationships and project Russian
views]{.underline}**. Some journalists and businesspeople who have
served for long periods in Moscow and have 'gone native' provide
valuable channels for projecting pro-Russian views. For example, the
Spiegel journalist Benjamin Bidder, who spent ten years in Russia,
caused controversy in late 2019 after writing a story casting doubt on
the veracity of Hermitage Capital's account of the agonising death of
its lawyer Sergey Magnitsky in a Moscow jail in 2009. As noted in
Chapter 6, Andrea von Knoop, the official representative of Germany
business from 1993 to 2007, is another example of an outspoken critic of
western policy towards Russia. In 2016, Putin granted her Russian
citizenship in recognition of her contribution to building business
ties. She has lived in Russia for over thirty years.63 Germany's deep
respect for Russian culture is another significant advantage that
facilitates the process of conditioning Germans to a Russian message.
Currently, 158 members of Parliament (Die Linke and the AfD combined out
of a total of 709) whose parties have clearly pro-Russian positions on
sanctions, for example, provide Moscow with a much larger influence
platform than it has in any other major European country. Finally, a
further benefit for Russia in Germany is that public opinion has marked
pacifist tendencies and does not support significant investment in
defence. For now, Russia can remain sure that Germany's bark will be
worse than its bite. [At the same time, in the face of pressures aimed
at societal disruption, Germany has proved resilient thanks to its
strong institutions, including its media, and its relatively low levels
of inequality compared to the UK and the USA]{.underline}. **[However,
past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future since Russia
has so far deployed some of its 'harder' instruments sparingly possibly
because it does not want to alienate irreversibly its once strongest
advocate in the EU and NATO]{.underline}**. For example, Moscow chose
not to deploy the data it stole from Parliament and government servers
in the run up to the federal 2017 election. This would have risked
moving beyond managed disruption and damaging the bilateral relationship
beyond repair. [In the case of its interference in the US presidential
election in 2016, Russia appeared to conclude that it had more to gain
than to lose, while in Germany the calculation was possibly the
reverse]{.underline}. [There is speculation that a high-level German
warning beforehand persuaded Putin to refrain from interference in the
election]{.underline}. In addition, [it is uncomfortable for Germany to
discuss the dangers posed by Russian 'soft' power without calling into
question the guiding principle of seeking maximum contact with Russia to
prevent conflict and as redemption for the past.]{.underline} **[To this
extent, Russia does not need to use the 'harder' instruments of power as
robustly as in many other countries to achieve its desired levels of
influence. This situation may change if Germany's Russia policy hardens
further]{.underline}**. [Some of Russia's established influence-building
advantages are in any case already starting to erode]{.underline}. The
Ostpolitik generation is leaving the scene. Their successors, born in
the 1980s, have less awareness of the Second World War and the division
of Germany. They were still children when the Wall fell and have less
instinctive sympathy for Russia. **[Over time, Moscow will need to find
new tools and messages to ensure that Germans remain conditioned to
respond to its voice]{.underline}**. **[Yet for now, Russia's influence
in Germany remains strong and of a qualitatively different nature to
that in other major European countries]{.underline}**.

[Where the price of oil will go as a result is anyone's guess, but what
is certain is that all energy importing countries will suffer from
unprecedented economic stress]{.underline}. Many economies may cease
functioning entirely and effectively exit the modern world system. **[As
well as the Global South, this shock will profoundly affect the European
Union, itself overwhelmingly dependent on imported
energy]{.underline}**. Bafflingly, Brussels seems only half satisfied
with ending its oil imports from Russia, roughly 25% of its total needs.
[Of far greater significance is the nearly 40% of European energy
imports from Russia in the form of natural gas, that Brussels, with
enthusiastic encouragement from Washington, has declared its intent to
phase out.]{.underline} [With the Russo-Ukrainian conflict devolving
into a protracted war of attrition, the EU leadership is more
aggressively pushing for an immediate end to gas imports as well,
cutting off Moscow's single largest income stream]{.underline}. Among
the few opposing voices has been Irish MEP Clare Daly, who noted that
further sanctions would not only cause huge privation to ordinary
Russians but would fuel already rampant inflation and a historic decline
in living standards within Europe. Whether the EU embargoes Russian gas,
whether Moscow pre-empts this with its own embargo against Europe, or
whether Ukrainian forces begin targeting pipelines from Russia that
transit their territory, Daly's warning may prove to have been overly
conservative. **[For Germany alone to completely lose access to Russian
energy would be a crisis on par with the hyperinflation of the
1920s]{.underline}**. Contingency plans have been activated to prepare
for fuel rationing, signaling the choice Berlin will soon have to make
between heating and electrifying the homes of its citizens and keeping
its industries alive. **[If the vast petrochemical facilities of western

[North Korea's continued progress on its nuclear and missile programs
remains one of the most significant challenges to the international
community]{.underline}. This is why the adoption of a new UN Security
Council resolution that closes an important sanctions loophole and
imposes closer scrutiny of North Korea's diplomatic activities sends a
strong, if late, message of unity and international resolve. [But what
comes next?]{.underline} There are a variety of options: [Diplomatic
normalization]{.underline}? [This could trigger a **regional arms
race**]{.underline}. Military intervention? [This could **plunge**
Northeast Asia into **chaos**]{.underline}. Unfortunately, prospects for
negotiations are bleak, and unofficial discussions between North Korea
and the United States are unlikely to succeed as in previous rounds.

World peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts
proportionate to the dangers which threaten it. ---Schuman Declaration,
May 9, 1950

I recently argued that North Korea isn't the only actor responsible for
the international community's fatigue in addressing a dangerous security
dilemma. In fact, [the Six-Party Talks--only framework may have
undermined prospects for exploring other types of
negotiations]{.underline} when these talks failed. [Such a situation is
counterproductive as it **convinces** North Korea to **continue its
destructive behavior** to achieve a new outcome. By contrast,
introducing **more actors**]{.underline} into the talks
[could]{.underline} potentially [reduce tensions]{.underline} between
the main parties [and]{.underline} could [help]{.underline} Washington,
Seoul, and Tokyo [reframe the discussion]{.underline}. Mongolia,
Singapore, Malaysia or the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) could be potential participants, but what about the European
Union and its member states? While the European Union will never be the
main actor in resolving the North Korean crisis, there is an argument
for Europe's increased participation in the debate.

The European Union's Potential Added-value on North Korea

[The **E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion's
[multiple-layered diplomatic approach represents a **unique tool** for
placing pressure on troublesome countries: besides members states'
bilateral channels, the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [is also a vehicle aimed at undertaking
coordinated action once political consensus has emerged.
Twenty-six]{.underline} out of twenty-eight EU [members maintain
diplomatic relations with the]{.underline} Democratic People's Republic
of Korea [(DPRK)]{.underline}, six of which have diplomatic offices in
Pyongyang (France only has a humanitarian and cultural office). [These
bilateral ties are diverse]{.underline}, with some dating back to the
Cold War. [They are of **crucial importance** to the North Korean
regime]{.underline}, as part of its narrative on legitimacy and its
appetite for international recognition, which may be attractive to them.
[Washington would certainly benefit from having the
**E**]{.underline}uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion and its members [more
proactively using their own diplomatic influence on the regime and its
clients]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [EU **expertise** in proliferation crises is often
underrated]{.underline}. The European Union was a party to the
negotiations with Iran, as was France, the United Kingdom, and Germany.
Most member states actively take part in the Proliferation Security
Initiative (PSI), intercepting illicit trade flows across the
Mediterranean. Moreover, the European Union has implemented one of the
most comprehensive restrictive measures regimes against North Korea,
which has evolved into a comprehensive strategy directly targeting the
civil and military proliferation chain, as well as strategic economic
sectors. Finally, the 2016 decision to put an end to hosting the DPRK's
overseas workers also represents a laudable attempt to tackle financial
flows that indirectly support proliferation activities, which sets a
precedent for the activities of Russia, China, and several of North
Korea's clients in Africa and the Middle East. However, outreach among
the United States, South Korea, Japan, and the European Union on these
practices has been limited so far, preventing full harmonization of
national policies among the like-minded.

[As an **external actor** to the region, the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [could play a particular role in unlocking
negotiations. First, it has a better record on implementing restrictive
measures than]{.underline}, for example, some potential [new Asian
players]{.underline}, whose stance is more ambiguous. [Second, it is a
bureaucratic machine that has the **unique capacity** to **build
consensus** among partners **even when** their interests are at
odds]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [the ability to observe]{.underline}
North Korea [from afar might give the **E**]{.underline}uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion [an advantage]{.underline} over the participants
of the Six-Party Talks where the six countries have different vital
interests at stake. In this regard, the European Union is detached just
enough to dare to make innovative proposals.

#### Nuclear war

Timothy **Graves 17**, Master's Degree in Creative Writing from
Birkbeck, University of London, "Is The World On The Brink Of Nuclear
Armageddon?", Huffington Post,
http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/timothy-graves/nuclear-armageddon_b_14789678.html

Since Donald Trump's presidential inauguration last month, sales of
dystopian fiction have soared. Novels that have flown off the shelf, or
recently made it into Amazon's top ten best-selling books chart, include
George Orwell's 1984, Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale and Huxley's
Brave New World. The resurgent interest in fiction that depicts a bleak
totalitarian and authoritarian society reflects the fact that we are now
living in a much more volatile and dangerous world. I do not think it is
scaremongering to say that [in recent years humanity has faced a number
of]{.underline} catastrophic or even **[existential
threats]{.underline}**. From climate change and the rise in
international terrorism to the prevalence of biological and chemical
weapons, our capacity for warfare and destruction, and what the poet
Robert Burns called 'man's inhumanity to man', is self-evident.

But I believe [the **most pressing and immediate threat** is that posed
by the arsenals of **nuclear weapons** that have been stockpiled by the
nuclear-armed states of the world who take false refuge in]{.underline}
the Mutually Assured Destruction doctrine [(MAD)]{.underline}. In light
of President Trump's comments about nuclear weapons, last month atomic
scientists in Chicago moved the hands on the Doomsday Clock to the
closest it has been to midnight for sixty four years. Midnight
represents global nuclear war.

With the ushering in of what some are already calling The New World
Order, [there are]{.underline} currently several [**flashpoints** across
the globe which could **trigger a nuclear war**]{.underline}. With a
realignment in U.S.-Russian relations and Trump's commitment to NATO in
question, if Putin were to invade one or more of the Baltic States the
situation could easily escalate and potentially trigger a nuclear
strike. Russia itself is preparing for nuclear conflict. In October last
year, the Russian government launched a nationwide nuclear training
exercise with forty million people. It also unveiled Russia's latest
'super-nuke', aptly dubbed 'Satan 2', which has the power to wipe out
most of Britain, Northern France, the Netherlands and Belgium in a
single strike. This month Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian air force
to prepare for a 'time of war'.

Other potential [geo-political flashpoints include North
Korea]{.underline} and the Pakistan/Indian dispute over Kashmir. [A few
days ago, in violation of **U**]{.underline}nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations [resolutions, North Korea successfully
test-fired a new type of medium to long-range ballistic
missile]{.underline}. Kim-Jong-[Un]{.underline}, supreme leader of the
Democratic People's Republic of North Korea, has warned the West that he
[will soon have nuclear weapons capable of targeting the
U.S.]{.underline} Whether this is true or not, [it seems highly likely
that North Korea already has the capacity to put a nuclear warhead on a
medium range missile which would be in **easy striking distance** of
South Korea or Japan. This, in turn, **increases the risk of nuclear
proliferation** in the region]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- EU Economy Impact -- AT: Defense

#### German economic decline collapses EU and US economies 

**Ewing 19** (Jack Ewing writes about business from New York, focusing
on the auto industry and the transition to electric cars.Before
relocating to New York in late 2021, Mr. Ewing spent more than two
decades reporting from Europe. He joined The International Herald
Tribune, now the international edition of The New York Times, in 2010 as
European economics correspondent, based in Frankfurt. Previously, he
worked for a decade at BusinessWeek magazine, where he was European
regional editor, August 16, 2019, "Germany Has Powered Europe's Economy.
What Happens When Its Engine Stalls?",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/business/eu-economy-germany-recession.html>)

When a debt crisis slammed the eurozone nearly a decade ago, Germany's
powerhouse economy helped lift troubled neighbors like Greece, Portugal
and Spain above the turmoil. The question that Europe faces now is
whether those countries are strong enough to return the favor.
[**Germany is on the brink of recession** after its economy declined in
the year's second quarter]{.underline}. Spain, by comparison, is
experiencing brisk growth, and even the Portuguese and Greek economies
are expanding. Buoyed by tourism, booming construction and steady job
growth, the southern European countries are helping to offset Germany's
weak performance. [But will it be enough? As the **United States economy
appears to slow**, **China loses momentum and Brexit looms, can Europe
dodge a downturn**?]{.underline} The question may be decisive for
Europe, and crucial for the United States. [The **European Union and the
United States are each other's biggest trading partners**, and a
**slowdown in Europe would be another drag on America's economy** at a
time when bond markets are already flashing warning signs.]{.underline}
Most economists are not yet predicting a Europewide recession, but they
are worried about the prospect. There is little chance that the European
Union can thrive when Germany is sickly. "If the largest member state is
affected," said Katharina Uterm칬hl, senior economist at the German
insurer Allianz, "this will also start to weigh on the euro area as a
whole because of the close economic relations." Should Europe sustain
more economic body blows, like a no-deal Brexit, a debt meltdown in
Italy or an escalation of the trade war, Ms. Uterm칬hl said, "[the **risk
of a recession is rather high**."]{.underline} Some economists are more
pessimistic. "Euroland is headed for a recession," Carl Weinberg, the
chief international economist at High Frequency Economics, a research
consulting firm in White Plains, N.Y., said in an email Friday. "All the
writing is on the wall." Mr. Weinberg cited numerous indicators of
trouble: less production at eurozone factories, surveys showing
increasing gloominess among business managers and a contraction in
global trade. The perilous state of the eurozone economy will be an
early test for Christine Lagarde when she succeeds Mario Draghi as
president of the European Central Bank in October. Mr. Draghi is
expected to announce a new package of stimulus measures next month, but
Ms. Lagarde will have to consider what the central bank can do if the
situation gets worse. When Germany's official statistics office reported
on Wednesday that the economy shrank 0.1 percent in the second quarter,
shock waves rippled through stock markets around the world. The reaction
reflected the degree to which Germany sets the tone for the Continent.
[**Germany has the eurozone's biggest economy**, accounting for more
than a quarter of the bloc's output. It has the most people, 83 million,
**and the most workers**, who help stoke nearly every other country's
economy. The list of European Union countries that count Germany as
their No. 1 trading partner is long. It includes France, Italy, the
Netherlands, Belgium, Slovakia and Sweden.]{.underline} The
relationships sometimes border on dependency. Germany accounts for 27
percent of Poland's foreign trade. Britain, Poland's No. 2 trading
partner, accounts for only 6 percent, according to World Bank data.
Suppliers throughout Europe earn much of their revenue by selling to big
German manufacturers like Daimler, Siemens and ThyssenKrupp. But those
companies are struggling. Daimler, the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, has
issued three profit warnings since October. Siemens, whose products
include high-speed trains and equipment for oil and gas producers, this
month reported a 6 percent decline in net profit. And the ratings firm
Moody's downgraded ThyssenKrupp's debt further into junk territory this
week, an indication that the giant steel maker is considered a default
risk. As it strains against the German downdraft, Europe is battling a
host of other woes. High on the list is Italy, which has a stagnant
economy, an unstable government and one of the highest debt burdens in
the world, giving it the potential to touch off another financial
crisis. Another risk is that Britain will leave the European Union
without a deal with Brussels, creating chaos in the flow of goods across
the English Channel. And car sales are plunging around the world,
threatening an important source of jobs in countries like Italy, France
and Slovakia. The biggest squeeze comes from the trade war. President
Trump's tariffs on a range of Chinese imports and on European steel and
aluminum have disrupted supply chains and profoundly unsettled managers
who make decisions about how much money to invest in new factory space
and how many people to hire. [Germany is especially vulnerable to trade
tensions because exports account for almost half of the country's gross
domestic product. And it is most sensitive to the downturn in the auto
industry because vehicles are the country's biggest export. Sales of
German cars have slumped as Chinese buyers pull back.]{.underline} It
can be difficult to gauge how deeply other individual economies are
rattled by the trade war, but the latest numbers across Europe, released
on Friday, contained troubling signs. Eurozone exports fell 5 percent in
June, the European Union's official statistics agency reported. Trade
accounts for about one-third of the bloc's gross domestic product.
[**Eurozone growth has already been meager this year**. The 19 countries
in the currency bloc collectively grew 0.2 percent from April through
June. The European Union, which includes the eurozone plus nine other
countries, recorded the same rate.]{.underline} Spain was one of the
best performers, registering a growth rate of 0.5 percent compared with
the previous quarter, which helped balance out Germany's 0.1 percent
decline in output. But Spain and other fast-growing countries like
Denmark and Finland are not big enough to replace Germany as Europe's
economic locomotive. Even if Europe manages to avoid two consecutive
quarters of declining output, the technical definition of a recession,
no one expects growth to be particularly impressive. ["The **slowdown in
growth is everywhere in the eurozone**, more or less," said J칬rg Kr칛mer,
the chief economist at Commerzbank. "**There is no
decoupling."**]{.underline}

#### Economic decline causes great power war and extinction 

**Liu 18** (Qian Liu is an economist based in China, November 13, 2018,
"From Economic Crisis to World War III",
https://www.neweurope.eu/article/from-economic-crisis-to-world-war-iii/)

[The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: in the current social,
political, and technological landscape, a **prolonged economic crisis**,
combined with rising income inequality, could well **escalate into a
major global military conflict**.]{.underline} The 2008-09 global
financial crisis almost bankrupted governments and caused systemic
collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back from the
brink, using massive monetary stimulus, including quantitative easing
and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates. But [monetary stimulus
is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an arrested heart; it can
revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure the
disease]{.underline}. Treating a sick economy requires structural
reforms, which can cover everything from financial and labour markets to
tax systems, fertility patterns, and education policies. Policymakers
have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite promising to do so.
Instead, they have remained preoccupied with politics. From Italy to
Germany, forming and sustaining governments now seems to take more time
than actual governing. Greece, for example, has relied on money from
international creditors to keep its head (barely) above water, rather
than genuinely reforming its pension system or improving its business
environment. The lack of structural reform has meant that the
unprecedented excess liquidity that central banks injected into their
economies was not allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it
raised global asset prices to levels even higher than those prevailing
before 2008. In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than
they were at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the
property website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which
measures whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is
now higher than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great
Depression in 1929. [As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities
in the real economy, the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger
another economic crisis -- one that could be even more severe than the
last, because we have built up a tolerance to our strongest
macroeconomic medications. A decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the
form of ultra-low interest rates and unconventional monetary policies,
has severely depleted their power to stabilise and stimulate the
economy.]{.underline} If history is any guide, the consequences of this
mistake could extend far beyond the economy. According to Harvard's
Benjamin Friedman, [**prolonged periods of economic distress** have been
characterised also by public antipathy toward minority groups or foreign
countries -- attitudes that can help to **fuel unrest, terrorism, or
even war**.]{.underline} For example, during the Great Depression, US
President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,
intended to protect American workers and farmers from foreign
competition. In the subsequent five years, global trade shrank by
two-thirds. Within a decade, World War II had begun. To be sure, WWII,
like World War I, was caused by a multitude of factors; there is no
standard path to war. But there is reason to believe that high levels of
inequality can play a significant role in stoking conflict. According to
research by the economist Thomas Piketty, a spike [in **income
inequality is often followed by a great crisis.** Income inequality then
declines for a while, before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new
disaster. Though causality has yet to be proven, given the limited
number of data points, this correlation should not be taken lightly,
especially with wealth and income inequality at historically high
levels. This is all the more worrying in view of the numerous other
factors stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension, including
technological disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety
over globalisation, political polarisation, and rising nationalism. All
are symptoms of failed policies that could turn out to be trigger points
for a future crisis.]{.underline} Voters have good reason to be
frustrated, but the emotionally appealing populists to whom they are
increasingly giving their support are offering ill-advised solutions
that will only make matters worse. For example, despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed, as countries -- most notably, Donald J. Trump's US -- pursue
unilateral, isolationist policies. Meanwhile, proxy wars are raging in
Syria and Yemen. [Against this background, we must take seriously the
possibility that the **next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale
military confrontation.** By the logic of the political scientist Samuel
Huntington, considering such a scenario could help us avoid it because
it would force us to take action. In this case, the key will be for
policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have long
promised while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible
and respectful global dialogue.]{.underline}

A [**major gas pipeline from Russia to Germany shut down** for annual
maintenance on Monday]{.underline}, as Berlin grew concerned that Moscow
may not resume the flow of gas as scheduled. The Nord Stream 1 pipeline,
Germany's main source of Russian gas, is scheduled to be out of action
until July 21 for routine work that the operator says includes "testing
of mechanical elements and automation systems". The operator's data
showed the gas flow dropping as planned on Monday morning. [But **German
officials** are **suspicious about Russia's intentions**, particularly
after Russia's Gazprom last month reduced the gas flow through Nord
Stream 1 by 60 percent.]{.underline} Gazprom cited technical problems
involving a gas turbine powering a compressor station that partner
Siemens Energy sent to Canada for overhaul. That turbine could not be
returned because of sanctions imposed over Russia's war on Ukraine.
Canada said over the weekend that it would allow the part to be
delivered to Germany, citing the "very significant hardship" that the
German economy would suffer without a sufficient gas supply. [**German
politicians have dismissed Russia's technical explanation** for last
month's reduction in gas flows through Nord Stream 1, **saying the
decision was a political gambit** to sow uncertainty and push up
prices.]{.underline} German Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck had said he
suspects that Russia may cite "some little technical detail" as a reason
not to resume gas deliveries through the pipeline after this month's
maintenance. [However, a spokesperson for the economy ministry said that
while **Germany is in a serious situation when it comes to its gas
supply,** the security of supply is currently guaranteed. The Nord
Stream 1 pipeline transports 55 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year of gas
from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The head of Germany's
network regulator, the Bundesnetzagentur, said "no one can say exactly"
whether the gas will be switched back on.]{.underline} "As expected,
Nord Stream 1 is at zero since this morning," Klaus Mueller, head of the
Bundesnetzagentur, told Reuters on Monday. "What happens at the end of
the maintenance, nobody is able to say at this moment. We won't know any
time sooner than a day before its scheduled end." Mueller said that gas
consumers have lobbied Bundesnetzagentur for priority treatment in the
event of potential gas rationing later in the year. The regulator would
base allocation decisions on their social and economic impact and
consequences for delivery chains, Mueller said. Such decisions would be
taken in October with the help of an IT platform, he added. [Ukraine and
its allies accuse Moscow of using spurious pretexts to strangle gas
flows in retaliation for sanctions over the invasion, which **Russia
describes as a "special military operation**". The Kremlin denies the
manipulation of gas flows or using energy as a political weapon.
Meanwhile, **Germany** and the rest of Europe are **scrambling to fill
gas storage** in time for winter and reduce their dependence on Russian
energy imports. Germany, **home to Europe's biggest economy**, has been
getting about **35 percent of its gas to power industry and generate

In just thirty minutes on Sunday, Chancellor Olaf **[Scholz put Germany
on a radical new path]{.underline}**. **[In an extraordinary speech made
during a special session of the German parliament on Sunday, Scholz
ended the decades-long Ostpolitik of his Social Democratic
Party]{.underline}** (SPD), [**with immense ramifications for Europe and
NATO**. Ostpolitik, or "eastern policy," was forged in the early 1970s
and intended to bring the Soviet Union politically and economically
closer to Europe]{.underline}. One major component was building a gas
pipeline, which the United States opposed, that West Germany hoped would
bring confidence, stability, and predictability with the USSR. [But
Ostpolitik also meant that Germany's ruling left wing had little
sympathy for dissident movements in communist Eastern Europe, as these
movements upset the Cold War status quo.]{.underline} **[That belief in
having a special relationship with Russia persisted even when President
Vladimir Putin invaded Georgia in 2008 and annexed Crimea in
2014]{.underline}**. Germany's powerful and influential business lobbies
and pro-Russia left-wingers preferred to protect their interests with
Russia, despite the Kremlin's crackdown on human rights, press freedom,
and civil society. **[Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Thursday was the
last straw for Scholz]{.underline}**. **[He became convinced that
Germany could no longer hedge its bets with Russia]{.underline}**. In
his speech to legislators, he laid out his vision for the country's
radical shift. [Scholz said German defense spending would increase to 2
percent of gross domestic product, meeting the target set in 2014 during
NATO's summit in Wales]{.underline}. [In addition, he announced a
special 100 billion euro]{.underline} (\$113 billion) [fund to provide
much-needed basic equipment for the German armed forces. Scholz also
said Germany would send weapons to Ukraine, ending a long-held policy
that it would not deliver weapons to a conflict
zone]{.underline}---hardly a plausible argument when Germany supplies
weapons to authoritarian regimes. [Finally, the country would move
quickly to reduce its dependence on oil and gas. This means sharply
cutting back its imports of Russian energy, which account for 55 percent
of its gas imports]{.underline}. Apart from mapping out an ambitious new
course for Germany, it was Scholz's impassioned support for Ukraine that
won him rapturous applause. "The twenty-fourth of February 2022 marks a
watershed in the history of our continent," he said. "With the attack on
Ukraine, Russian President Putin has started a war of aggression in cold
blood." But **[what does Scholz's speech mean in
practice?]{.underline}** First, **[Russia has lost one of its most
important supporters in Europe, and Germany no longer sees Armenia,
Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine through the prism of
Russia.]{.underline}** The time when the SPD tacitly acknowledged
Russia's sphere of influence over these sovereign, independent countries
is over. In addition, Germany's relations, particularly with Poland and
the Baltic states, will markedly improve. [These countries were highly
critical and distrustful of Berlin's commitment to Nord Stream 2, the
\$11 billion project to bring Russian gas directly to Europe that was
finished and awaiting certification when Scholz halted it last
week.]{.underline} **[They, along with Ukraine, believed the pipeline
would increase their vulnerability in terms of energy supplies and make
Germany more dependent on Russia for its energy, pushing Germany to lean
more Russia-friendly inside the EU and NATO]{.underline}**. **[Expect a
thaw in relations]{.underline}**. [Scholz's announcement to send weapons
to Ukraine will also boost Germany's standing in this part of
Europe]{.underline}. Early last month, Germany faced widespread ridicule
over its promise to supply Ukraine with 5,000 helmets, as other NATO
members sent weapons, and it blocked Estonia's move to send German-made
weapons to Kyiv. This policy change ends the long-held suspicion that
Berlin did not want to antagonize Russia. In addition, **[these
decisions are a boost for NATO, with Germany now fully committed to the
defense of Europe via the U.S.-led military alliance]{.underline}**.
[The change shows that Germany no longer wants to be seen as a "free
rider," always relying on the United States to be Europe's security
guarantor without paying much for that security umbrella]{.underline}.
Germany was repeatedly criticized for its unwillingness to spend 2
percent of its gross domestic product on defense, and this raised
questions among allies if Germany was taking America's protection for
granted. One caveat to the increase in defense spending. The 100 billion
euro "special fund" will kickstart a long overdue modernization of
Germany's armed forces. This is no joke: German soldiers were sent
recently to the Baltic states lacking thermal underwear and other basic
clothing. But spending more over the next few years will not be useful
if it leads to more duplication of equipment among allies instead of
focusing on adapting weapons systems to cyber attacks, modern aircraft
fighters, and the changing nature of warfare. **[Germany could now shape
the future direction of EU foreign policy]{.underline}**. **[The war in
Ukraine has shown how the EU, pushed by Germany, needs a revamped
"Eastern Partnership" policy that entails not only reducing Russian
interference, especially by pro-Russian and local oligarchs in politics
and the economy, but also strengthening the state institutions and
combating corruption]{.underline}**. Georgia, Moldova, and
Ukraine---countries in which Russia has consistently meddled---want to
join the EU, or failing that, some special relationship that will make
their trade, economy, political, and social structures more closely tied
to Europe. **[Scholz's policy change indicates that Germany will no
longer stand in the way of these changes, and could even lead
them]{.underline}**.

A protest note was handed to the German military by the Russian Defense
Ministry in response to comments about deterring Russia's nuclear
capabilities. [Germany especially had been coming out with statements
about the pressing need to focus on Russia and reducing their nuclear
capabilities, causing Russia to deliver the note.]{.underline} According
to Reuters, Russia announced it would break off existing
institutionalized contacts with NATO and the alliance agreed on a new
plan to defend against any potential Russian attack. In an interview
last Thursday, incumbent Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
stated that "[**We have to make it very clear to Russia that in the
end** --- and that is also the deterrent doctrine --- **we are ready to
use** such means \[**nuclear weapons\] so that it has a deterrent**
effect beforehand and nobody gets the idea..."]{.underline} It is
alarming that Germany is quick to state that they would put to use such
weapons against Russia. The spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign
Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said that ["there are level-headed people in
the German leadership who can prevent their defence minister from
recklessly wanting to test our armed forces." It is unknown what the
note from Russia stated, but it introduces a possible strife between the
two nations over nuclear power.]{.underline} [Janis Kluge, an expert at
the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, views the
**current relationship between Berlin and Moscow as at an all-time low
in post-Soviet history**. Germany-Russia relations have always been
complicated with shifts from alliances to total warfare. The recent rise
in negative relations stemmed from Russia's seizure of Crimea from
Ukraine in 2014. Within NATO, Germany was quick to impose multiple
rounds of harsh sanctions against oil and other Russian industries. This
**leaves Germany and Russia with unstable relations today**, meaning the
note is **indicative of a possible major conflict between the two**.
**Germany** has **made** an **aggressive threat towards Russia by
stating that they would go as far as to use nuclear weapons in acts of
deterrence**]{.underline}. This puts hundreds of millions of people at
risk, as a deadly conflict would arise if Germany took such severe
action. Germany's initial comments and responses to the situation are
intended to make Russia fearful of an attack and be cautious with their
nuclear program. Weapons of mass destruction like the ones in question
are obviously catastrophic, which pushes the common reaction to often be
the use of them as it is the only way to counter such a massive threat.
It is ironic that many nations choose to fight the problem with further
use of the same weapons. However, nations may not see many alternatives
to preventing the spread of nuclear power as they have to put forth a
large enough and credible type of threat.

week after Russia halted gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria,]{.underline}
offering a foretaste of what the region might have in store. But [even
without the energy rationing such a move might provoke, the outlook
looks ominous, underscored by weaker-than-expected growth reported
Friday.]{.underline} European Weakness Inflation and war are weighing on
economic output across the region European Central Bank Chief Economist
Philip Lane insisted after the data that there's "still a lot of
momentum" in the recovery. Even so, [European factories are signaling
distress amid record inflation and a stubborn supply squeeze, aggravated
by strict lockdowns in China]{.underline}. Meanwhile any catch-up on
leisure and travel by Covid-liberated consumers may fade, not least as
price increases eat into incomes. The coronavirus itself could return
with a vengeance. [**European financial markets reflect the gloom**, and
economists at Morgan Stanley are among those seeing a "meaningful
slowdown" in the second half. Corporate giants including Germany's BASF
SE are bracing for "serious disruptions," and the OECD is warning that
governments underestimate the impact of the war in Ukraine.]{.underline}
What that suggests is that a year that began with the region extending
its growth beyond pre-Covid levels, and offered the prospect of further
tailwinds from European Union fiscal aid, now risks becoming another
sorry episode in the single currency's history of frustrating setbacks
to growth. "[The economy may show resilience in the coming quarters, but
the problem is, what will happen at the end of the year]{.underline}?"
said Anatoli Annenkov, an economist at Societe Generale SA in London.
"[We don't know what will happen with wage growth and fiscal stimulus in
2023, there's as much concern over China as there is over energy costs,
and it's easy to become pessimistic in light of the war."]{.underline}
Given the backdrop, [Europe's main equity benchmark has struggled to
find its footing this year and widening bond spreads are feeding
concerns that fragmentation will return to the 19-nation euro
zone.]{.underline} First-quarter gross domestic product data didn't
offer cause for hope. [The euro area grew only 0.2%, less than
economists anticipated, hurt by a contraction in Italy, stagnation in
France and weaker-than-expected growth in Spain.]{.underline} Indicators
since then aren't much better. Factory output and new orders are close
to grinding to a halt, and business confidence across major economies
has declined since the start of the year. That's left services to
shoulder the burden, undermined by waning consumer confidence.
["**Manufacturing will be very weak** in the coming months and quite
likely contract in the second quarter]{.underline}," said Veronika
Roharova, an economist at Credit Suisse International, who predicts
euro-area growth of 2.8% this year. Still, "services are strong and
household savings high, the labor market continues to look healthy and
fiscal support is ensuring we won't see a spending slump." Lane of the
ECB, interviewed by Bloomberg Television after the growth data, observed
that it was "not very high admittedly, but still positive." "We know
from the near-time indicators, from what's going on right now, that
there still seems to be reasonable activity right now here at the end of
April," he added. Even so, [**economic forecasts for this year are being
slashed**. The International Monetary Fund cut 1.1 percentage point off
its projection this month and now sees growth of 2.8%. The Institute of
International Finance anticipates just 1% expansion.]{.underline} ECB
officials acknowledged this month that growth risks have increased
"substantially," but they remain optimistic they can deliver an
accelerated exit from crisis-era stimulus to combat inflation at a
record 7.5% in data on Friday. Some policy makers are touting the first
interest-rate increase since 2011 as soon as July, and even Russia's
complete halt of gas deliveries to Poland and Bulgaria and the prospect
that euro-zone countries could also be shut off next doesn't seems to
deter them. While "this would definitely have a more negative, stronger
immediate effect" Governing Council member Madis Muller said on
Wednesday, he added that "the risk of an economic contraction in the
euro area on the whole is more likely to be small." [The **effect in
Germany, the region's biggest economy, might be more significant**.
First-quarter growth of 0.2% matched expectations, but the Bundesbank
sees a risk of it shrinking nearly 2% this year if the war escalates and
an embargo on Russian coal, oil and gas leads to restrictions on
industry.]{.underline} Scores of companies including BMW AG and
ThyssenKrupp AG have warned earnings could be affected, and utility
Sniper SE said Wednesday that the economic toll of any stoppages in gas
supplies would be "dramatic." German Economy Minister Robert Habeck
insisted this week that a full embargo on Russian oil would be
"manageable." Meanwhile the EU has been discussing new sanctions
targeting the commodity, and Emmanuel Macron's victory in French
presidential elections may reinforce the bloc's cohesion in addressing
challenges together. The ECB also highlighted this month that fiscal
measures to help households cope with surging inflation are helping. The
prospect of such policies being extended, particularly in the event of a
Russian energy shut-off, could provide a cushion for the economy, though
at a cost to public finances. "Fiscal measures, including at EU level,
will help shield the euro area from the impact of the Russian invasion
of Ukraine," ECB President Christine Lagarde told the IMF meetings last
week. The central bank's next policy decision is on June 9.

[The **CEOs** of several European blue chip companies have told CNBC
that they **see a significant recession coming down** the pike **in
Europe**.]{.underline} The continent is particularly vulnerable to the
fallout from the Russia-Ukraine war, associated economic sanctions and
energy supply concerns, and economists have been downgrading growth
forecasts for the euro zone in recent weeks. [The euro zone faces
concurrent **economic shocks from the war in Ukraine and a surge in food
and energy prices exacerbated by the conflict**, along with a supply
shock arising from China's zero-Covid policy. That has **prompted
concerns about "stagflation**" --- an environment of low economic growth
and high inflation --- and eventual recession]{.underline}. ["For sure,
**we see a big recession in the mak**ing, but that's exactly what we see
--- it's in the making. There is still an overhanging demand because of
the Covid crisis we just are about to leave," said Stefan Hartung, CEO
of German engineering and technology giant Bosch.]{.underline} "It's
still there and you see it heavily hitting us in China, but you see that
in a lot of areas in the world, the demand of consumers has already even
been increased in some areas." In particular, Hartung noted lingering
consumer demand for household appliances, power tools and vehicles, but
suggested this would dissipate. ["That means for a certain amount of
time, this demand will still be there, even while we see the interest
increase and we see the pricing increase, but at some point in time, it
won't be just a supply crisis, it will also be a demand crisis, and then
for sure, **we are in a deep recession**," he added. Inflation in the
euro zone hit a record high of 7.5% in March]{.underline}. So far, the
European Central Bank has remained more dovish than its peers, such as
the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve, both of which have
begun hiking interest rates in a bid to rein in inflation. However, the
ECB now expects to conclude net asset purchases under its APP (asset
purchase program) in the third quarter, after which it will have room to
begin monetary tightening, depending on the economic outlook. Berenberg
Chief Economist Holger Schmieding said in a note Friday that near-term
risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside in Europe.
["Worsening Chinese lockdowns and cautious consumer spending in reaction
to high energy and food prices could easily cause a temporary
contraction in Eurozone GDP in Q2," Schmieding said.]{.underline} "[An
immediate embargo on gas imports from Russia (highly unlikely) could
turn that into a more serious recession]{.underline}. If the Fed gets it
badly wrong and catapults the U.S. straight from boom to bust (unlikely
but not fully impossible), such a recession could last well into next
year. Yet Schmieding suggested that the euro zone is likely to enter
recession only "if worse came to worst," and that it isn't a base
expectation. Mark Branson, president of German financial regulator
BaFin, said [any military escalation in Ukraine or further energy supply
disruption could pose serious risks to growth in Europe's largest
economy, with industrial sectors particularly vulnerable.]{.underline}
["We're already seeing that growth is down to around zero in many
jurisdictions, including here, and it's vulnerable. It's also vulnerable
from the ongoing Covid-related shocks," he said. "**We've got inflation
that's going to need to be tackled**, and it's going to need to be
tackled now, so that's a cocktail which is difficult for the

[Merkel left office of her own will, the only postwar chancellor to do
so]{.underline}. She was popular at home and she was admired worldwide
as one of Germany's greatest postwar leaders. **[Now, Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24 has cast a dark backwards
shadow over her tenure]{.underline}**. [Should she not have paid more
attention to Putin's repression of civil society and murders of
political opponents in Russia]{.underline}? His poisoning of European
politics by means of disinformation and corruption? [His careful weaving
of a continent-wide web of dependency on Russian gas]{.underline}? His
stationing of intermediate-range missiles in Kaliningrad? **[His
increasingly evident imperial ambitions]{.underline}**? [Should she not
have seen a connection between the assault on Chechnya, with which Putin
began his reign at the turn of the millennium, the war with Georgia in
2008 which resulted in that country's dismemberment at Russian hands,
the annexation of Crimea in 2014, and eight years of proxy war in Donbas
with 14,000 dead]{.underline}? But those who expected a self-critical
examination of her record were disappointed. "I don't see that I should
now have to say, that was wrong. And I will therefore not apologize."
The literal English translation is clunky, but then so is Merkelish in
the original German. The point of the former chancellor's remarks to a
Berlin theatre audience was clear enough: she had nothing to regret.
[Merkel contended that she always saw through Putin: "I always knew he
wanted to destroy Europe." **Yet she insisted**]{.underline} --- in a
phrase redolent of Bismarckian Realpolitik --- **[that it was important
to maintain "a trade connection" with "the world's second largest
nuclear power."]{.underline}** One commentator branded her comments as
appeasement. A second seized on her description of Putin's war as "a
great tragedy" as evidence of fatalistic determinism. Others suggested
that Merkel had simply been "the perfect chancellor for a system that
had reached its limits." None of these explanations is entirely off the
mark. **[What matters, however, is that Merkel's signature approach to
dealing with problems]{.underline}** --- comprehending them fully, but
choosing to manage rather than to resolve them --- **[was shared not
just by her various coalition partners, but by the German business
community and by voters]{.underline}**. It is in line with a
longstanding postwar tradition of German leaders framing strategic
choices as strategic constraints, thereby evading the appearance of
agency or responsibility. **[As a recipe for grappling with an unchained
totalitarian Russia]{.underline}** --- and with a future of permanent
upheaval and disruption --- **[it is not just futile but
reckless]{.underline}**.

# Greece-Russia Relations

### 1NC -- Oil Scenario

#### Greece-Russia relations are [warm]{.underline} right now -- cautious optimism

Nice, Director of EU-China Programmes, Senior Fellow at the Hellenic
Foundation for European and Foreign Policy and the Begin-Sadat Center

https://russiancouncil.ru/en/analytics-and-comments/analytics/what-is-next-for-russia-and-greece/

**[The new year starts with cautious optimism for the Greek--Russian
relations]{.underline}**. [The meeting between President Vladimir Putin
and Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Sochi in December, 2021 was
significant for two reasons]{.underline}. **[It has confirmed the
willingness of Russia and Greece to leave the diplomatic crisis of 2018
behind and bring the bilateral relationship back to
normalcy]{.underline}**---after three years of arduous efforts. [More
importantly, it has outlined their joint interest in placing this
bilateral relationship into the general international environment and
its contradictions]{.underline}. The two leaders thus used several
adjectives to illustrate the nature of the Sochi discussions---such as
'productive', 'constructive', 'substantive', 'open', 'direct', and
'sincere'. **[Greece's membership in the EU and
NATO]{.underline}**---the cornerstone of its foreign policy---**[does
not allow illusions about the future course of the Greek--Russian
relations, which could deviate from the Western
framework]{.underline}**. **[This reality, however, makes both countries
keen on rather being pragmatic and setting realistic goals they can
possibly fulfil]{.underline}**. [President Putin, for instance, has
expressed the belief that Greece would always advocate for a balanced
and objective position on a number of issues pertaining to the
interaction between Russia and the EU]{.underline}. Premier Mitsotakis,
for his part, has considered Russia to be essential to the architecture
of European security, making a reference to the Ukraine crisis. At the
meeting, he was talking about the need of the Minsk agreements (among
other accords) to be respected and implemented, and he concluded that
the Greek government could not but be interested in a settlement as well
as in non-aggravation, since many Greeks also live the region. [Although
tensions between Russia and NATO over Ukraine go beyond the capacity of
Greece to influence these developments, the latter considers the
preservation of communication channels essential]{.underline}. In the
words of Mitsotakis during the press conference, 'the absence of
communication does not lead to anything good'. **[Amid the ongoing
debate in Europe, Greece belongs to the countries interested in Russia's
engagement in a dialogue with the EU]{.underline}**. This position is
shared by core member states of the EU, namely Germany, France and
Italy. [As far as the Eastern Mediterranean is concerned, Russia is
continuously reiterating its standard position about such a resolution
of the Cyprus issue that ought to be built on the UN
framework]{.underline}. The Greek Prime Minister publicly thanked the
Russian President for this firm position. From another prism, the
changing Eastern Mediterranean dynamics have brought Moscow and Ankara
quite close in the last years, which is a source of concern for Athens.
**[This is another reality that has rendered Greece determined to mend
ties with Russia]{.underline}**. **[The rapprochement also serves the
interests of Russia in the Eastern Mediterranean, which has certainly
found a modus vivendi with Turkey while Moscow does not always agree
with Ankara]{.underline}**. In that regard, **[the principal advantage
of the ties between Greece and Russia is their historical
longevity]{.underline}**. It is symbolic that the visit of Kyriakos
Mitsotakis to Russia, the first in his capacity as Prime Minister as he
had already visited the country in February 2019 (then the leader of the
main opposition New Democracy party), took place during the 200th
anniversary of the Greek Revolution. Emotional celebrations and Russia's
active participation in them have facilitated the forging of a new type
of understanding between the two countries. Looking towards the future,
the Joint Plan of Action for 2022--2024 offers an institutional umbrella
for common actions where tourism will certainly play a critical role.
[President Putin has commended relevant bilateral collaboration during
the coronavirus crisis, saying: 'We are grateful to the Greek
authorities for the decision to recognize Russian Sputnik V vaccination
certificates.' Synergies in the handling of taxation issues, science,
high technology, finance, and maritime security are expected to
continue]{.underline}. [This is also the case for closer cooperation
between Greek and Russian universities, think tanks and research
centers]{.underline}. **[Greek-Russian discussions are not always easy.
Russian appetite for new investments in Greece, for example, often turns
into a complex and time-consuming process due to strict European
regulations.]{.underline}** Besides, energy talks do not automatically
result in agreements on prices in accordance with the requests made by
the one or the other side---however, these talks are taking place in
good climate. One day before the meeting of the two leaders in Sochi,
Kostas Skrekas, Greek Minister of the Environment and Energy, met with
Gazprom Chairman, Alexey Miller, in St. Petersburg. **[On the whole,
challenges did not prevent bilateral trade from growing by 56 per cent
in the first nine months of this year as President Putin
said]{.underline}**. **[Notwithstanding the policy of sanctions, there
is still room for Greek exporters to reach the Russian
market]{.underline}**. **[The warm meeting between President Putin and
Premier Mitsotakis marks the beginning of a new chapter in the
Greek--Russian relations under the existing circumstances, where both
sides raise expectations that they are able to meet]{.underline}**.
There was no better way to launch this new chapter than with the
announcement of President Putin to transfer the archives of its Jewish
communities to Greece, which the Nazis moved to Germany during World War
II and which have been in Moscow since 1945. This is another emotionally
significant development in a special year. Following the Sochi meeting,
Premier Mitsotakis and his Russian counterpart Mikhail Mishustin had a
telephone conversation to discuss the Joint Action Plan 2022--2024.
Moreover, **[President Putin sent a letter to the Greek Prime Minister
wishing 'peace and prosperity to our friends, the Greek people.' This
good climate is beneficial for Russia and Greece, which are both
striving for stability, continuity and progress in the bilateral
relationship]{.underline}**.

#### However, relations are on the [brink]{.underline} now -- lack of trust in NATO unity [solidifies]{.underline} mutual desire in the Greek-Russo relationship, but plan flips it -- [new]{.underline} security cooperation [fully]{.underline} puts Greece in the West's court

**National Herald '22**, is the paper of record of the Greek Diaspora

Stage, Divided Greeks", The National Herald, 3/23/22,
https://www.thenationalherald.com/russias-ukraine-invasion-put-greece-on-world-stage-divided-greeks/

ATHENS -- [Initially applauded for expressing "full solidarity" with
Ukraine and sending small arms to help its people fend off a Russian
invasion, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis suddenly finds
himself under fire for going too far]{.underline}. The New Democracy
leader told Parliament when the invasion began that he was standing by
Ukraine -- and ethnic Greeks there, 10 of whom were killed in the early
stages and scores of thousands still trapped in the besieged city of
Mariupol. [In breaking with a history of Greek government being
reluctant to be involved in foreign wars, his was among the first off
the bloc to offer more than tweets of support, shipping arms and backing
European Union sanctions]{.underline} -- even if still buying Russian
oil and gas and letting shipping continue between the countries. **[But
most Greeks don't agree with what he did, and not just the major rival
SYRIZA, which came to power in 2015 on a promise to take Greece out of
NATO and not send troops to Afghanistan but reneged on both
promises]{.underline}**. Still, [with most of the EU fiddling about what
to do, NATO saying it won't get involved, the United States not
supporting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's request for a
No-Fly zone over his country, Greece was an outlier]{.underline}. **[In
a feature on the ambivalence if not outright opposition to Mitsotakis'
tough stance, the site POLITICO noted that a just-released survey found
that 70 percent of Greeks said his hard line against
Russia]{.underline}**, a close Orthodox country, **[was a
mistake]{.underline}**. In another survey, 63 percent said the decision
may prove dangerous for Greece, especially if, as expected, Russian
President Vladimir Putin may see most or all of his demands met in
return for ending the war -- and target those against him. [That would
be Greece, which relies on Russian oil and gas and has tried to keep
tight relations with Putin, a volatile character who had rejected SYRIZA
overtures for a bailout, leaving the Leftists to embarrassedly turn to
international lenders]{.underline}. Even Mitsotakis is apparently
feeling a big sheepish and trying to mediate his opposition to Putin's
War, his government turning down Ukraine's request teo send Soviet-era
TOR-풒1 and Osa-AK missile systems, saying enough was enough. **[The war
has seen his government tilt even further toward the United States, with
which it renewed a military defense cooperation agreement and said would
allow a greater US military presence in the country]{.underline}**,
including more bases. SIDING WITH PEACE When he first talked to
lawmakers, the site noted, he stood up boldly and said his government
was all-in on the side of Ukraine and that, "There can be no equal
distances. You are either with peace and international law or against
them." [Turns out most are against them and in Putin's camp with the
same kind of fervor still seen among former US President Donald Trump's
near-religious fervor zealots who believe he can do no
wrong]{.underline}. **[What Mitsotakis did was take Greece out of a
neutral act and balancing role to get involved in international
intrigue, a path many Greeks don't want, especially with the country
having a hard-core sector of Russian sympathizers]{.underline}**. The EU
sanctions that bar Russian airlines will also cost Greece Russian
tourists and Mitsotakis' government got into open undiplomatic spat with
the Russian Embassy, neither side backing off and with worries hard
feelings will remain. The feature by Nektaria Stamouli pointed out that
many Greeks were caught by surprise but his initial decision to jump
into the battle with both feet as Russian sentiments remain in parts of
Greece. **[And there are centuries of religious, military, economic and
cultural ties between the two countries, with SYRIZA also seizing the
chance to snipe again from the sidelines and attack him]{.underline}**
-- while supporting his call to back Ukraine, up to a point. [Unlike the
EU, which during the war has fumbled over a response and limited
sanctions, likely in anticipation of hoping a post-war Putin won't take
some kind of political revenge, Mitsotakis wasn't timid about taking on
the Russian leader]{.underline}. "[Greek society also has historical
ties to Russia, a fellow Christian Orthodox nation that helped the
Greeks fight off Ottoman rule in 1821]{.underline}. More recently,
**[Moscow has been viewed as a protector in Greece's long-running
rivalry with neighbor Turkey]{.underline}**," the story noted.
Mitsotakis met with Putin in December, 2021 and Foreign Minister Nikos
Dendias was among the last to meetRussian foreign chief Sergei Lavrov
days before the invasion but no reports he asked him to help save ethnic
Greeks in Mariupol. "Greece," Mitsotakis declared in the Greek
Parliament, "is the last outpost of the West," sidelining its
relationship with Russia -- and Putin -- and leading to wonder if it
marked a bigger shift in Greece's role on the world stage. That's as it
still tries to recover from a near-decade long economic and austerity
crisis that required 326 billion euros (\$358.75 billion) in three
international bailouts after generations of wild overspending and
runaway patronage. [Constantinos Filis, Director of the Institute of
Global Affairs and a professor of international relations at the
American College of Greece, described the shift as "two choices," to
POLITICO]{.underline}. TAKING A STAND First, he said, **[Greece decided
"it cannot depend on the EU and NATO to secure itself from
Turkey"]{.underline}** -- **[it also needs bilateral military deals to
boost its own capacity]{.underline}**. Second, he added, "Greece under
the current government has decided to get more deeply involved and put
its hand in the fire, even with boots on the ground." Turkey -- which
started now-stalled EU accession talks in 2005 -- opposes EU sanctions
but isn't, like Serbia which allowed Russian airlines, taking any heat
for it and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has emerged as an unlikely
peace broker. While defying the EU he wants to join, sending drones to
help Ukraine fight Russian forces, he's also bought Russian-made S-400
missile systems that undermine NATO and could be used against Greece,
but it drawing applause for trying to mediate a settlement to the war,
leaving Greece out of the equation. When he authorized sending arms to
Ukraine, Mitsotakis said he thought it would help Greece's national
interests although most Greeks feel otherwise now, even more as the war
continues. "With what moral standing would we ask for similar assistance
if we found ourselves in the same position?" he told the site in an
interview. "[We have an additional reason, compared to other European
countries, to be on the right side of history," he added, making a clear
reference to Greece's tense relationship with Turkey]{.underline}. But
**[there's belief in Greece that NATO]{.underline}** -- which has
refused to intervene over Turkey sending fighter jets and warships into
Greek airspace and waters and plans to drill for oil and gas off Greek
islands -- **[would leave Greece on its own in a
conflict]{.underline}**. [In a poll conducted after Russia's invasion,
71 percent condemned the invasion, but 65 percent said Greece should
remain completely neutral]{.underline}. And in a POLITICO poll, 60
percent said Russian invasion was unacceptable, the lowest figure among
the six countries polled. After giving support to the decision to
support Ukraine, SYRIZA leader Alexis Tsipras, trailing Mitsotakis'
party in polls up to 14 percent, said that shouldn't have included
sending weapons, his party having strong Communist ties. George
[Katrougalos, Syriza MP and a former foreign minister, told the site
that, "The subversion of the old doctrine ... that Greece has a
political home in Europe but also wants to have a bridge role with the
other political powers, and its replacement with the Cold War mantra
that 'Greece is a Western outpost,' does not benefit our
country]{.underline}." [Several retired senior army officers have also
gone on TV in Greece to vehemently oppose the Greek arms shipments to
Ukraine]{.underline}. "Harmful, unnecessary and silly," said one. Added
Filis: "**[Greece has to follow a multidimensional foreign policy, act
as a bridge between politicians and state]{.underline}**. **[It cannot
close its door to]{.underline}** China, **[Russia]{.underline}** and
other emerging powers." But it may just have.

#### Greece-Russia relations are key to maintain Russia oil exports flowing

**Reuters '22**, international news agency, "Greece turns into new hub
for Russian ship-to-ship fuel oil exports", Daily Sabah, 5/20/22,
https://www.dailysabah.com/business/energy/greece-turns-into-new-hub-for-russian-ship-to-ship-fuel-oil-exports

**[As sanctions on Moscow drive traders to find new ways to export
Russian oil via ship-to-ship]{.underline}** (STS) **[loadings, fuel oil
arrivals offshore Greece jumped to record levels in
April]{.underline}**, data showed and sources said. [Trading Russian
crude and oil products remain legal for now as the European Union is yet
to fully agree on a proposed embargo, but banking and other financial
sanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 have
made it increasingly more difficult to do so]{.underline}. [In April,
shipments of Russian fuel oil with Greece as a destination reached
nearly 0.9 million tons, about double March levels and could reach new
records in May]{.underline}, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. **[The
bulk of this was shipped from Russian ports to Greece's Kalamata
port]{.underline}**, the data showed. The Greek energy ministry declined
to comment on what it said was private companies\' business. **[Traders
said the fuel oil]{.underline}** -- a by-product of refining crude oil
into lighter, cleaner products like auto fuels -- **[is being stored and
blended offshore onboard tankers and being loaded via ship-to-ship
transfer for re-export]{.underline}**. **[While it is not uncommon for
fuel oil to load offshore Greece for exports to other destinations, the
level of activity was very high compared to normal April
levels]{.underline}**, one industry source said. [The Evridiki tanker,
which has the capacity to load 130,000 tons, loaded a Russian fuel oil
cargo in mid-April off Kalamata]{.underline}, two shipping sources said.
[The tanker then made its way to the United Arab Emirates oil hub of
Fjairah]{.underline}, Refinitiv data shows. **[Russia has been
increasing fuel exports to the hub, with arrivals set to jump to about
2.5 million barrels according to data]{.underline}** from oil analytics
firm Vortexa. **[Another tanker, Okeanos, with the same capacity, loaded
fuel oil via STS off Kalamata earlier this month and is currently
heading to India]{.underline}**, the data shows. [The Kriti King, which
loaded a 130,000-ton fuel oil cargo offshore Kalamata in early May, is
currently heading to China]{.underline}, according to Refinitiv data.
[Shipping sources told Reuters that Russian oil sellers have restored
STS operations in Rotterdam and near Spain\'s Ceuta, after EU sanctions
and activist protests derailed such operations in Denmark]{.underline}.

[The shock of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has upended politics around
the world and posed a key question: Should the rest of the world shun
Russian oil to avoid paying money to the Putin regime? The Biden

Russia, expanding on the sweeping economic sanctions already in

#### Economic decline causes great power war and extinction 

**Liu 18** (Qian Liu is an economist based in China, November 13, 2018,
"From Economic Crisis to World War III",
https://www.neweurope.eu/article/from-economic-crisis-to-world-war-iii/)

[The next economic crisis is closer than you think. But what you should
really worry about is what comes after: in the current social,
political, and technological landscape, a **prolonged economic crisis**,
combined with rising income inequality, could well **escalate into a
major global military conflict**.]{.underline} The 2008-09 global
financial crisis almost bankrupted governments and caused systemic
collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back from the
brink, using massive monetary stimulus, including quantitative easing
and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates. But [monetary stimulus
is like an adrenaline shot to jump-start an arrested heart; it can
revive the patient, but it does nothing to cure the
disease]{.underline}. Treating a sick economy requires structural
reforms, which can cover everything from financial and labour markets to
tax systems, fertility patterns, and education policies. Policymakers
have utterly failed to pursue such reforms, despite promising to do so.
Instead, they have remained preoccupied with politics. From Italy to
Germany, forming and sustaining governments now seems to take more time
than actual governing. Greece, for example, has relied on money from
international creditors to keep its head (barely) above water, rather
than genuinely reforming its pension system or improving its business
environment. The lack of structural reform has meant that the
unprecedented excess liquidity that central banks injected into their
economies was not allocated to its most efficient uses. Instead, it
raised global asset prices to levels even higher than those prevailing
before 2008. In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than
they were at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the
property website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which
measures whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is
now higher than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great
Depression in 1929. [As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities
in the real economy, the collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger
another economic crisis -- one that could be even more severe than the
last, because we have built up a tolerance to our strongest
macroeconomic medications. A decade of regular adrenaline shots, in the
form of ultra-low interest rates and unconventional monetary policies,
has severely depleted their power to stabilise and stimulate the
economy.]{.underline} If history is any guide, the consequences of this
mistake could extend far beyond the economy. According to Harvard's
Benjamin Friedman, [**prolonged periods of economic distress** have been
characterised also by public antipathy toward minority groups or foreign
countries -- attitudes that can help to **fuel unrest, terrorism, or
even war**.]{.underline} For example, during the Great Depression, US
President Herbert Hoover signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act,
intended to protect American workers and farmers from foreign
competition. In the subsequent five years, global trade shrank by
two-thirds. Within a decade, World War II had begun. To be sure, WWII,
like World War I, was caused by a multitude of factors; there is no
standard path to war. But there is reason to believe that high levels of
inequality can play a significant role in stoking conflict. According to
research by the economist Thomas Piketty, a spike [in **income
inequality is often followed by a great crisis.** Income inequality then
declines for a while, before rising again, until a new peak -- and a new
disaster. Though causality has yet to be proven, given the limited
number of data points, this correlation should not be taken lightly,
especially with wealth and income inequality at historically high
levels. This is all the more worrying in view of the numerous other
factors stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension, including
technological disruption, a record-breaking migration crisis, anxiety
over globalisation, political polarisation, and rising nationalism. All
are symptoms of failed policies that could turn out to be trigger points
for a future crisis.]{.underline} Voters have good reason to be
frustrated, but the emotionally appealing populists to whom they are
increasingly giving their support are offering ill-advised solutions
that will only make matters worse. For example, despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed, as countries -- most notably, Donald J. Trump's US -- pursue
unilateral, isolationist policies. Meanwhile, proxy wars are raging in
Syria and Yemen. [Against this background, we must take seriously the
possibility that the **next economic crisis could lead to a large-scale
military confrontation.** By the logic of the political scientist Samuel
Huntington, considering such a scenario could help us avoid it because
it would force us to take action. In this case, the key will be for
policymakers to pursue the structural reforms that they have long
promised while replacing finger-pointing and antagonism with a sensible
and respectful global dialogue.]{.underline}

#### Greece [reveres]{.underline} Putin -- pushes the nation's politics to maintain relations

Diet **Simon '22**, is a freelance journalist having spent 50 years

Greece", Neos Kosmos, 4/3/22,
https://neoskosmos.com/en/2022/04/03/sport/sport-opinion/why-putin-has-so-many-fans-in-greece/

**[As far as Putin's war against Ukraine is concerned, Greece is deeply
split]{.underline}**. **[The Russian president has many fans in the
country]{.underline}**. Part of the reason are historical roots.
**[There's probably no other EU country where as many people as in
Greece revere Vladimir Putin]{.underline}**. **[The war against Ukraine
has not damaged the friendship with Russia that many Greeks
feel]{.underline}**. The affection has religious, historical and
ideological roots. "Murderer Putin" was written on placards held up by
demonstrators recently in Thessaloniki in northern Greece. But where
Putin and his war are concerned Greeks are deeply split. [Opinion polls
have found 65% of men and women thinking that Greece should stay neutral
about the conflict. 39 per cent said Greece should not join the EU's
sanctions against Russia. 67% oppose Greece supporting Ukraine by
supplying weapons. More than a third even expressed "understanding" for
the Russian invasion]{.underline}. [The government of the conservative
prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, supports Ukraine with weapons and
humanitarian aid]{.underline}. Mitsotakis declared: "There can be no
neutrality. Either one favours peace and international law or one is
against." **[But when on Thursday President Volodymyr Zelensky addresses
the Greek parliament by live video link from Kiev a number of seats will
probably remain empty]{.underline}**. **[The Greek communist party KKE
has already announced it won't take part in the session]{.underline}**.
**[All but one member of the left wing Mera25 party of the former
finance minister Yanis Varoufakis will also stay away]{.underline}**. It
will be interesting to see whether deputies of the left alliance Syriza
of former premier Alexis Tsipras will also boycott. Like the majority of
the leading Syriza politicians Tsipras hails from the Stalinist KKE. A
few weeks after the Russian annexation of the Crimean the then
opposition leader Tsipras went to Moscow in May 2014 where he
flagellated the "neo-fascism" in Kiev. A year later as premier Tsipras
continued his snuggle-up course with Vladimir Putin. Just hours after
being sworn in as premier he received the Russian ambassador Andrey
Maslov as the first foreign diplomat. One of the first congratulatory
telegrams came from Putin. A little later Panos Kammenos, Tsipras'
coalition partner of the right wing-nationalist Independent Greeks, the
new defense minister and also a Putin fan, brought into play the option
that Greece should ask Moscow for loans to cut the umbilical cord to the
financial support from the EU. When the Greek financial crisis peaked in
summer 2015 and Tsipras flirted with withdrawal from the Euro zone. He
is said to have asked Putin to help him print new drachma notes. The
then French president Fran칞ois Hollande reports in a book Putin had told
him this in a telephone conversation. Tsipras denies this episode. [Less
than three months after being elected the new Greek Prime Minister
Tsipras went to Moscow. Putin returned the visit the following year. As
part of his official state visit agenda the Kremlin chief made a side
trip to the sacred Mount Athos, the monks' republic in northern Greece.
The reason for the pilgrimage was a celebration of the 1,000th year of
Russian monks joining the others on the mount]{.underline}. **[In the
perception of many Greeks the common religion is a strong bond between
the two countries]{.underline}**. The Orthodox Christianisation of
Russia started from Byzantium in the 10th century. [In both Greece and
Russia the Orthodox faith remains a major driver of
nationalism]{.underline}. [That explains the affinity to Russia of large
sections of the Greek right and clergy]{.underline}. **[But the
attraction also has historical roots]{.underline}**. Early in the 19th
century the Russian czarist empire supported the Greeks in their war of
liberation from Ottoman occupation. In 1827, in the sixth year of the
Greek uprising, Russian warships, jointly with French and British units,
demolished the Turkish fleet in the Battle of Navarino (Navarino Bay
(modern Pylos), is on the west coast of the Peloponnese). **[That was
the turning point that secured independence for the Greeks. For that
reason Russia already then had many fans among them.]{.underline}** From
1827 to 1865 there was even an influential "Russia Party" in Greece, a
collection point for conservative-absolutist forces. In 2021 both
countries celebrated the "귳ear of History of Greece and Russia",
commemorating the 200th year of the Greek revolution. Hence many Greeks
still regard Russia as a natural ally of their country, including
because of the historical Russian rivalry with Turkey for control of the
maritime straits of the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles as well as the
spheres of influence in central Asia. [Among leftist politicians like
the former communist Tsipras an ideological, antifascist elective
affinity resonates that links back as far as the era of the Greek civil
war from 1946--49. Then the mainly KKE-comprised left popular front
fought with support from Albania, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union for
Greece to join the Eastern Bloc. But now the war on Ukraine puts the
love for Russia of many Greeks to a severe test, because in the Ukraine
there are about 150,000 ethnic Greeks]{.underline}. Most live in
Mariupol and Odessa. Many have already been killed in the Russian
attacks. **[Yet a poll found only 26 percent of Greeks willing to
actively help Ukraine. 68 percent are dissatisfied with the government's
stance regarding the conflict]{.underline}**. **[That is likely to
include many followers of the governing party, Nea Dimokratia (ND).
Since 2011 the ND has been in a partnership with Putin's party United
Russia]{.underline}**.

the great savior in the east is strongly anchored in Greek
culture]{.underline}**, the political scientist at the University of
Thessaloniki told DW. [Many people with right-wing convictions, also
members of the conservative party, still believe that for some magical
reason the Russians are going to take Istanbul, formerly the Orthodox
stronghold of Constantinople, liberate it and give it to Greece,
fulfilling the dream of a new Byzantine Empire]{.underline}, he says.

strategy of the Orthodox Commonwealth.]{.underline}**\" That hasn\'t
been as easy in Greece, Grammenos notes. The Greek Orthodox Church
recognized the autocephalous church of Ukraine in 2019, clearly acting
against the wishes of Russian Orthodox Church leaders. \"[In Greece,

economic cooperation, the Russian-Greek forums of civil society and
more. Russian-Greek cooperation is developing in the framework of the
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI): the Union of Greek Chambers of
Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Athens,
the Piraeus Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Chamber of Commerce
and Industry of Thessaloniki and Kozani and the Federation of Greek
producers, the Greek Organization of Small and Medium Enterprises, the
Center of Inter-Balkan cooperation \"HELEKSPO\" organization.
Cooperation with Greek partners is also carried out within the Euro
Chambers and the Business Council of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation
(BSEC). In September 2016 the Russian delegation, which includes more
than fifty companies from different regions of the country, participated
in the largest exhibition in the Mediterranean area, the 81st

the same time the International Forum \"The RussianGreek Business
Dialogue\" was held. It consisted of Russian-Greek business in a forum
in which the development of cooperation in the field of agriculture, the
prospects for regional cooperation, cooperation in the sphere of science
and education, for the exchange of technology capabilities and more were
discussed; in addition the Russian-Greek Forum on Renewable Energy and

Empirical Grounds of the Research [The downgrading of the Russian-Greek
relations observed since 2009 fits into the general trend of world
development: in the context of globalization the mutual trade and
investment is highlighted, whereas stability and positive dynamics of
bilateral cooperation depends on the availability of sufficient economic
basis]{.underline}. In [the case of trade relations between Russia and
Greece in the period before 2009 the economic potential has not been
implemented adequately, even in 2008, which was the peak point of trade
cooperation, while trade turnover between Russia and Greece gave way to
trade turnover between Russia, Bulgaria and Romania, not to mention
investments]{.underline}7 . **[The causes for the decline of economic
relations development will be divided into three groups]{.underline}**:
In th[e first group, the national-ethnic causes, which are expressed in
the actual disappearance of the Russian lobby in Greece and the Greek
lobby in Russia, are included. Currently, you can only talk about
individual initiators of the development of Russian-Greek relations
among businessmen.]{.underline} Despite the fact that among the major
Russian businessmen there are a lot of people of Greek origin, their
role in the economic relations between the two countries is
insignificant. In addition, they have to withstand the tough competition
with pro-Turkish and pro-Serbian lobby in Russia, because of its
economic content of Russian-Greek, Russian-Turkish and Russian-Serbian
relations which are very close. We have to admit a landslide reduction
of contingent media ideas and supporters of maintaining the dialogue
between the two countries, its practical implementation in the trade and
mutual investment. [In the second group, the historical-ideological
causes, which consists of a slowdown in the Russian approach to the
possibilities of relations with Greece, due to the fact that their
current state and prospects are assessed mainly through historical and
ideological stereotypes, are included]{.underline}. The current angle
approach to Russian-Greek relations should be recognized as outdated,
inconsistent with the global trend, the growth and the strengthening of
economic integration in international relations. **[In the third group,
the domestic economic and social causes, which are the sharp
deterioration of the situation in the Greek economy, the change in its
foreign policy priorities, its strengthening policy and its dependence
on creditors, are included]{.underline}**. [The crisis has not forced
the Greek leadership to pursue a more diversified foreign policy so
far]{.underline}. **[On the contrary, it has led to greater coherence in
economic]{.underline}** (including foreign trade) **[Greece\'s policies
with those of the European Union, and in the field of international
security policy]{.underline}** - **[with a common vector of
NATO]{.underline}**. And **[these factors are negative from the
standpoint of the development of Russian-Greek economic
relations]{.underline}**, a fact that is necessary to take it into
account as long as Greece does not come out the crisis.

#### Greek-Russian relations are [driven by]{.underline} perception of Greece being an active member of NATO -- only the action of the [plan]{.underline} results in a decrease in Russia's willingness to pursue the relationship -- empirics prove that [only]{.underline} security cooperation, not harsh words impact the relationship

[The Greek government has dialled down its rhetoric since the
expulsions, releasing official statements in favour of
rapprochement]{.underline}. But **[the Russian leadership now appears to
see Athens as a long arm of Washington: at the height of the dispute in
July, Russia blamed the United States for the deterioration in

common denominators), **[Russia needs to maintain a
balance]{.underline}** -- **[with both Greece and Cyprus]{.underline}**
-- **[in securing its enhanced position in the eastern
Mediterranean]{.underline}**. The mood in Greek-Russian relations has
therefore shifted from neutral-positive to neutral-negative, but prime
minister, Alexis Tsipras's visit to Moscow in December is already
creating a more positive atmosphere. The recent resignation of the
foreign minister, Nikos Kotzias, should also alter things; the July
crisis had begun to take on the nature of a campaign between Kotzias and
Russia. After the expulsions, Kotzias publicly accused Russia of being
Turkey's 'comrade-in-arms' and of betraying the level of Greek-Russian
friendship attained over the past 190 years, insinuating that Moscow and
Ankara were joining forces against Athens. [Despite the obvious
limitations in Greek-Russia relations, a further deterioration would
serve no purpose, particularly at a time of general fluidity and in the
midst of Greece's attempt to return to normality and attract
investment]{.underline}. Athens needs to be careful to avoid finding
itself part of opportunistic joint ventures that Russian might perceive
as aggressive in nature, be it against Russia itself, or Iran. That
said, **[even in Kotzias's harshest words he alluded to a supposed
closeness between Greece and Russia]{.underline}**. **[Under certain
circumstances Athens may still find it difficult to take a firm stance
against Moscow, given the latter's assertiveness and the confrontational

#### Cutting off oil leads to economic decline 

**Associated Press 22** (May 4, 2022, "EXPLAINER: What\'s the Impact if
Europe Cuts off Russian Oil?",
<https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-05-04/explainer-whats-the-impact-if-europe-cuts-off-russian-oil>)

The European Union\'s executive commission has proposed phasing out
imports of Russian oil within six months. It is part of Europe\'s
struggle to stop paying Russia \$850 million a day for energy and hit
the Kremlin\'s finances over its invasion of Ukraine. [But **reversing
decades of dependence on Russian oil and natural gas is not a simple
matter** for the 27-nation bloc. For one thing, **Hungary says it won\'t
go along with a boycott**, while Slovakia and Czech Republic are seeking
a multiyear transition period. All are landlocked and big users of
Russian oil.]{.underline} Here is what the oil sanctions could mean for
people in Europe and the rest of the world: HOW MUCH DOES EUROPE PAY
RUSSIA FOR ENERGY? [Gas and oil have kept flowing even as governments
denounce the war. The **EU sends \$450 million a day to Russia for oil**
and \$400 million per day for natural gas, according to calculations by
analysts at the Bruegel think tank in Brussels.]{.underline} That means
energy revenue is bolstering the Kremlin\'s budget, adding to foreign
currency reserves that could help Russia support the ruble and partly
make up for Western sanctions that froze much of Russia\'s foreign
currency reserves held outside Russia. HOW MUCH RUSSIAN OIL GOES TO
EUROPE? Europe is the biggest purchaser of Russian crude, receiving 138
million tons in 2020 out of Russia\'s total exports of 260 million tons
--- or 53%, according to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy.
Europe, which imports almost all of its crude, gets a quarter of its
needs from Russia. Oil is refined into fuel for heating and driving as
well as being a raw material for industry. WHY IS THE FOCUS ON OIL
INSTEAD OF NATURAL GAS? [It's **harder to find alternative sources** of
natural gas because it comes mainly by pipeline. It would be easier to
find other sources for oil, which mostly moves by tanker and is traded
globally. So a natural gas boycott is off the table for now. **Heavy gas
users like Germany say an immediate cutoff could cost jobs**, with
industrial associations warning of shutdowns in glass **and** metals
**businesses. Cutting off both natural gas and oil would likely cause a
recession in Europe, economists say.**]{.underline} WHAT COULD HAPPEN
WHEN RUSSIAN OIL SUPPLIES STOP? Europe imported 3.8 million barrels a
day from Russia before the war. In theory, European customers could
replace those barrels from suppliers in the Middle East, whose exports
now mostly go to Asia, as well as from the United States, Latin America
and Africa. Meanwhile, cheaper Russian oil could take the place of the
Middle East shipments to Asia. [But it would take time to make that
adjustment. New supplies would have to be found elsewhere. Several large
refineries in central and Eastern Europe rely on oil from a Soviet-era
pipeline and would have to find another way of getting oil to make
gasoline and other products.]{.underline} Bruegel analysts say that
means European countries should be ready to impose measures to reduce
fuel use, such as making public transport free and incentivizing
car-sharing. If those measures don\'t work, tougher ones such as
odd-even driving bans based on license plate numbers would be needed.
Similar measures were taken during the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, when
Germany imposed car-free Sundays. [Russia is a major supplier of
Europe's diesel fuel for trucks and farm equipment, meaning its **price
affects those for a wide range of food and goods**.]{.underline} EU
governments also are gambling that Russia will not respond by turning
off natural gas supplies to Europe. Russia has already cut off Bulgaria
and Poland, ostensibly for refusing to pay in rubles. WHAT COULD HAPPEN
TO THE GLOBAL OIL MARKET? [Chances are that **oil prices would go up for
everyone because oil is a global commodity.** That would mean higher
prices at the pump and for home heating, less disposable income for
consumers and be a drag on the economic recovery from the COVID-19
pandemic.]{.underline} Russia would probably produce and export less oil
after losing its biggest customer, Europe. That\'s because all of
Russia\'s exports can\'t simply be redirected from nearby Europe to
far-off Asia due to shipping and logistical constraints. It would mean a
major reshuffling of the world\'s crude oil flows. Buyers in India and
China might avoid Russian oil if it means possible sanctions trouble
with the West. And Western customers are already shunning Russian oil
because they don't want to be associated with the country or can\'t find
insurers or banks willing to handle dealings with Moscow. On the other
hand, some Asian customers might jump at the chance to snap up
discounted Russian oil. Especially if the sales are off the books, as
appears to be happening in some cases. The OPEC oil cartel led by Saudi
Arabia --- which sets production levels along with allied non-members
like Russia --- has made it clear it won't increase output to make up
for any supply loss from Russia due to a boycott. They meet again
Thursday. Rystad Energy expects a loss of 1.5 million to 2 million
barrels per day and oil reaching \$120 to \$130 per barrel by year\'s
end. A milder scenario, in which most Russian oil shunned by Europe is
snapped up in other energy-hungry countries not taking part in the
sanctions, would see a loss of 1 million barrels per day. Oil prices
would drop below \$100 by June and keep falling to \$60 by year\'s end.

PARIS --- [One factor has long underpinned pushback by European
governments and business over sanctions on Russia: **concern for their
own pocketbooks**.]{.underline} But in the wake of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, the continent has seen a rapid about-face and has already begun
to feel the effects. [When Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014
and backed separatists in Ukraine's east, European **business groups
were among the most vocal skeptics** of the E.U. sanctions that
followed]{.underline}. Just weeks ago, a major German business
association was celebrating a "gratifying" surge in trade with Russia,
while Italian CEOs met virtually with Russian President Vladimir Putin
to discuss stronger ties even as the crisis was heating up. In a matter
of days, the tone has changed. [Since the invasion began last week,
Russia, facing a flurry of sanctions, has become an economic pariah.
Even Putin's defenders among European businesses, especially in Italy
and Germany, have rallied behind what France's finance minister this
week called an "all-out economic and financial war" against
Russia]{.underline}, the European Union's fifth-biggest trading partner.
(He later apologized for saying "war.") "It is beyond any discussion
that the German business world supports the imposed sanctions," read a
statement by the chairman of the German Eastern Business Association, a
trade group in long-standing favor of robust ties to Russia. [The
widespread support for sanctions has already **begun to come at an
economic cost**, on top of those borne from the turmoil of war,
affecting energy prices, inflation and the cost of raw
materials.]{.underline} Experts warn that backlash could follow. [Many
of the effects, including higher gas, electricity and food prices, have
either set in or could hit in the next six weeks]{.underline}, said
Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, a
research consultancy. [That spans the final stretch of the French
presidential election campaign, potentially playing into the hands of
the crowded field of populist candidates running against President
Emmanuel Macron.]{.underline} In a written address to parliament last
Friday, Macron prepared voters for volatile weeks and months ahead.
"This major crisis will have consequences on our lives, our economy," he
said. [Prime Minister Jean Castex has said the government would
intervene to shield companies and citizens "as well as
possible."]{.underline} **[Sanctions "will have dramatic long-term
implications and, relatively soon, very strong price implications,
starting first with energy but then trickling down through the entire
economy,"]{.underline}** said Georg Zachmann, a senior fellow at
Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. While much of the continent seems
willing to bear the price for now, such effects could drive division,
especially if Europe targets Russian gas and oil exports, or if Russia
decides to withhold supplies. Even in the absence of such moves, [the
international oil benchmark surged beyond \$110 a barrel on Wednesday,
as buyers refrained from purchasing Russian crude amid financial
uncertainty and the prospect of supply chain disruptions]{.underline}.
European natural gas --- of which some 40 percent comes from Russia ---
hit an all-time high this week. ["We will need gas, we will need oil.
And if that doesn't keep coming, then **political unity in Europe will
be difficult to maintain**,"]{.underline} Zachmann said. Germany, which
imports more than 50 percent of its natural gas from Russia, will be
hard-pressed to find alternatives. The country has already suspended the
newly built Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which was built to convey
gas from Russia, last month. [Some see **nuclear energy** as a possible
lifeboat. **The crisis has reawakened one of the country's most divisive
debates**]{.underline} --- and one that appeared to have been settled,
with all remaining nuclear power plants set to be taken off the grid
this year. But speaking on Sunday, Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck, whose
Green Party is rooted in the country's anti-nuclear movement, was no
longer willing to rule out an extension. "Nothing is a taboo," he said,
also raising the possibility of more reliance on coal. In the aftermath
of the invasion, [European leaders seemed to set economic concerns
aside, agreeing to disconnect seven Russian banks from
SWIFT]{.underline}, the world's most important payment mechanism.
European companies and banks with subsidiaries or strong links to
Russia, including British multinational oil and gas company BP and
French bank Societe Generale, are expected to bear the initial brunt.
Countries including Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which have
significantly reduced their dependency on Russia but remain more exposed
than many other European nations, could also be among the first to feel
the hit. The E.U. has yet to impose import bans on some of the most
lucrative Russian exports --- including oil, gas and raw materials. But
[experts say it will be impossible for the E.U. to fully disentangle
desired sanctions targets from **broader economic effects** that will
rebound on Europe.]{.underline} Trade with Russia and Ukraine has
already been disrupted enormously. Key Russian banks will be cut off
from SWIFT within days, major shipping companies have said they would
stop most cargo deliveries to and from Russia, and flight bans are
preventing some goods from reaching their destinations. German carmaker
Volkswagen said this week that it would suspend production in two
electric car plants because of supply chain disruptions linked to the
conflict. Meanwhile, a major Russian steel exporter, Severstal, said it
was redirecting exports "to alternative world markets" after its main
shareholder was sanctioned by the E.U. [For European consumers, **the
most noticeable impact could be surging inflation**, which was already
up.]{.underline} A potential "[2 percent reduction in purchasing power
doesn't sound much, but those households who have lower incomes and high
heating and fuel costs will be much worse affected]{.underline},"
Kenningham said. [As inflation rises, **inequality could
deepen**]{.underline} --- and consumers in countries including Spain and
Germany, where governments have largely refrained from freezing gas and
electricity prices, could be hit more severely than consumers in France,
for example, where policymakers intervened early. A senior French
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid, said the
European Commission is already in contact with countries that could "if
necessary, divert part of their production to the European Union." The
official cited Qatar and the United States, along with Algeria, Nigeria
and other exporters, as possible options. [The prospect of energy
shortages --- and a full halt in Russian deliveries --- could
**overshadow European politics through the rest of the
year**.]{.underline} In the long-run, [the disruptions could be a
**boost for supporters of renewable energy**.]{.underline} But in the
short run, the urgent need to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas
is likely to have the opposite effect.

taken similar steps in response to accusations of atrocities committed
by Russian forces against civilians in Ukraine. The Foreign Ministry
said the decision was made in line with the Vienna Convention on

### 2NC -- AT: Oil Impact

#### The EU has [already adopted]{.underline} large sanctions--they are [working now]{.underline}--it hasn't [collapsed]{.underline} the economy

**Borrell 7-16** (Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European
Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the
European Commission, 7-16-22, "The sanctions against Russia are
working",
<https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/sanctions-against-russia-are-working_en//BVN>
SC)

Since Russia brutally invaded Ukraine, [**the EU has adopted six
packages of sanctions against Moscow** -- and we are about to finalise a
"maintenance and alignment" package to clarify a number of provisions to
strengthen legal certainty for operators and align the EU\'s sanctions
with those of our allies and partners of the G7.]{.underline} Our
measures already now target nearly 1,200 individuals and almost 100
entities in Russia as well as a significant number of sectors of the
Russian economy. [These sanctions were adopted in close coordination
with the G7 member, and the fact that over forty other countries,
including traditionally neutral countries, have also adopted them or
taken similar measures enhances their effectiveness.]{.underline}
Sanctions require strategic patience because it may take a long time for
them to have the desired effect. Now, as the war drags on and the costs
of energy rises, people in Europe and elsewhere ask whether these
sanctions are working and/or whether the side effects are too great.
Without underestimating different problems that could occur, including
attempts made to bypass them, sanctions remain an important instrument
of political action. But for sure [we need to use them in a well
targeted manner, and, above all, **they require strategic patience
because it may take a long time for them to have the desired
effect.**]{.underline} [One of the main sanctions adopted is to stop
buying 90% of EU oil supplies from Russia by the end of 2022, depriving
Moscow of corresponding revenues.]{.underline} Yes, Russia is able to
sell its oil to other markets, however this benefit is limited by the
fact that Russia is forced to give high discounts on each barrel
(Russian oil is sold at around \$ 30 less than the global average). In
addition, and this is perhaps the most important point, [this gradual
oil embargo and the scaling back of the import of gas, liberates Europe
from its energy dependence on Russia.]{.underline} We have discussed
this issue at the EU level for years, but now we are implementing it.
[Cutting our structural energy dependence on Russia matters a lot
because **this dependence has been an obstacle to developing a strong
European policy** towards Moscow's aggressive actions.]{.underline}
Cutting our structural energy dependence on Russia matters a lot because
this dependence has been an obstacle to developing a strong European
policy towards Moscow's aggressive actions. This dependence probably
played an important role in Putin\'s initial calculations in Ukraine. He
may have believed that the EU would never sanction Russia seriously
because it was too dependent on energy. This is one of his most
important blunders when launching this war. [Of course, this rapid
detoxification from Russian energy involves significant costs for a
number of countries and sectors that we will have to face. However, it
is the price to pay to defend our democracies and international law. We
have to handle these consequences by **reinforcing our internal
solidarity** and that is what we are doing.]{.underline} By breaking its
energy dependence, in line with its climate ambition, the EU is learning
that interdependence is not always a neutral instrument that is
beneficial to all or a mean to guarantee peaceful international
relations. The Ukraine war confirmed that interdependence can be used as
a weapon. This rapid detoxification from Russian energy involves
significant costs for a number of countries and sectors that we will
have to face. However, it is the price to pay to defend our democracies
and international law. Are the sanctions really hurting the Russian
economy? Some observers have argued they are not very effective because
the exchange rate of the Russian currency is very high. But this
interpretation is dubious. [**The exchange rate of the Rouble simply
reflects the fact that Russia has a massive imbalance between the high
volume of oil and gas exports and the parallel collapse of imports that
has followed the sanctions.** This trade surplus is not a sign of good
economic health, especially for an economy like Russia. While exporting
unprocessed raw materials, Russia must import many high-value products
that it does not manufacture.]{.underline} For advanced technology
products, Russia depends on Europe for more than 45%, the United States
for 21% and China for only 11%. Russia may of course try to limit the
effects of sanctions by substituting imports through domestic products.
This was done, not without success, in the agricultural sector after the
2014 sanctions. However, for high-tech products, import substitution is
much more difficult to achieve. [**Russia will try to substitute imports
through domestic products.** This was done, not without success, in the
agricultural sector after the 2014 sanctions. However, for high-tech
products, it is much more difficult to achieve.]{.underline} Sanctions
on semiconductors imports for instance have a direct impact on Russian
companies that produce consumer electronics, computers, airplanes, cars,
or military equipment. In this field, which is obviously crucial in the
war in Ukraine, sanctions limit Russia\'s capacity to produce precision
missiles. On the ground, the Russian army is not making much use of this
type of precision-guided missiles, not out of moderation, but out of
necessity, as it does not have enough of them. In addition, the Russian
air force has underperformed in Ukraine, also because it lacks
precision-guided munitions. The automotive sector is another sector that
is very much feeling the effects of the sanctions. Almost all foreign
manufacturers have decided to withdraw from Russia and production was
last May down by 97% compared with 2021. In addition, the few cars that
Russian manufacturers still produce will not have airbags or automatic
gearboxes. The Russian oil industry will suffer Russia as the world's
second largest oil producer is still earning large sums from selling its
oil worldwide, notably to Asian customers and this helps it to keep
financing the war. But over time, [the Russian oil industry will suffer
not only from the departure of foreign operators but also from its
**increasing difficulty in accessing sophisticated technologies** such
as horizontal drilling. In fact, the capacity of Russia to put new wells
in production will be limited, which will lead to a drop in
production]{.underline}. Finally, there is the airline industry, which
plays a very important role in such a vast country. Around 700 of
Russia\'s 1,100 civilian aircraft are of foreign origin. Russia will
have to sacrifice a large part of its fleet, to find spare parts, so
that the remaining aircrafts can fly. Even the Russian-produced
aircrafts are dependent on technologies and material from western
countries. As Alexander Morozov, the head of the research department of
Bank of Russia recently wrote: "[**The restrictions will lead to
decreases in technological and engineering sophistication** and in
labour productivity in the sanctioned industries. Industries that rely
on the most advanced foreign technologies and those with highly
digitalized business processes risk being hit harder than
others]{.underline}". The list could go on with other important factors:
the loss of access to financial markets; the disconnection of Russia
with the major global research networks such as CERN for example; the
massive brain drain of Russian elites with thousands of highly qualified
professionals having left the country. The effects of such moves are not
immediately visible. However, the scientific, economic and technological
isolation of Russia is a major loss for the country in the medium term.
The scientific, economic and technological isolation of Russia is a
major loss for the country in the medium term. Moscow may claim that its
relations with many countries remain intact. However, in reality,
[**sanctions against Russia are also hurting its trade** with
non-sanctioning countries like China. The alternative offered by China
to the Russian economy remains indeed limited.]{.underline} Although
Beijing seems to want to make ideological gestures by siding with
Moscow; refusing to condemn its invasion; or taking up the Russian
narrative on the threat of NATO, it is overall rather careful regarding
helping Russia circumvent the sanctions. While its imports from Russia
have risen (mainly through greater energy imports), Chinese exports to
Russia have decreased in proportions that are comparable to those of
Western countries. Even if it does not admit it publicly, China is
probably worried that this war could strengthen the position of the
United States not only in Europe but also in Asia, with the strong
involvement of countries such as Japan and South Korea in responding to
Russia's aggression. This is not exactly what China is aiming at. As a
result, [the latest Russian figures released by Bank of Russia show that
transactions through **the Russian payment system are down 7.2%** in
June compared to the first quarter of 2022. This is a real-time
indicator of the important slowdown in the Russian economy]{.underline}.
Of course the biggest question of all is this: will the sanctions and
the real effects they have, lead Putin changing his strategic
calculations and if so when? Here we need to be cautious and recognise
that his actions have always been disconnected from economic
considerations. Putin believes in the magical power of political
voluntarism. However, this cannot last forever. Hence Europe must show
strategic patience. The war will be long and the test of strength will
last. We have no other choice. [**Allowing Russia to prevail would mean
allowing it to destroy our democracies** and the very basis of the
international rules-based world order.]{.underline} Europe must show
strategic patience. The war will be long and the test of strength will
last. Allowing Russia to prevail would mean allowing it to destroy our
democracies and the very basis of the international rules-based world
order. [Even if sanctions do not change the Russian trajectory in the
short-term, that does not mean they are useless for they do affect sheer
amount of resources it has to wage its war.]{.underline} Without
sanctions, Russia would 'have its cake and eat it', as the expression
goes. With sanctions, [it **will be forced to "choose between butter and
guns"** locking Putin in a vice that is gradually
tightening.]{.underline} Finally, let me raise here as well the issue of
the alleged or real impact of our sanctions on third countries,
particularly African countries, which depend on Russian and Ukrainian
wheat and fertilisers. Here it is very clear where responsibility lies
for the food crisis. Our sanctions do not target Russian wheat or
fertiliser exports. And it is until now Russia's aggression and its
blockade of the Black Sea that is preventing Ukraine from exporting its
wheat. We hope however that the negotiations led by the Secretary
General of the United Nations will enable this issue to be resolved
quickly. I have informed my African counterparts that we are ready to
assist them with any difficulties they may encounter related with our
sanctions while urging them not to be fooled by the Russian
authorities\' lies and disinformation regarding this subject. I have
informed my African counterparts that we are ready to assist them with
any difficulties they may encounter related with our sanctions while
urging them not to be fooled by the Russian authorities\' lies and
disinformation regarding this subject. There is a "battle of narratives"
going on internationally over who is responsible global food and energy
crisis as was clear at the last G20 Foreign Ministers' Meeting. [But the
real answer is to **bring an end to the war and this can only be
achieved by Russia\'s withdrawal from Ukraine.** I keep reminding all
our international partners that respect for the territorial integrity of
states and the non-use of force are not Western or European
principles.]{.underline} They are the basis of all international law and
Russia is blithely trampling on them. To accept such a violation would
open the door to the law of the jungle on a global scale. Europe must
become a real power The war in Ukraine makes clear that, contrary to
what many thought rather naively just a few years ago, economic
interdependence does not automatically guarantee peaceful international
relations. This is why Europe must become a real power, as I have been
calling for since the beginning of my mandate. Faced with the invasion
of Ukraine, we have moved from debates to concrete actions, showing
that, when provoked, Europe can respond. [Since we do not want to go to
war with Russia**, economic sanctions and the support of Ukraine are at
the core of this response**. And our sanctions are beginning to have an
effect and will do so even more in the months to come.]{.underline}

[Relations between Washington and Tehran have deteriorated since the
onset of the Syrian conflict and even more so since]{.underline}
President Donald [Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear
deal]{.underline}. At the same time, **[Russia and Iran have grown
closer through military cooperation in Syria]{.underline}**. **[Moscow's
expanding influence in Syria suggests that a conflict between the United
States and Iran could advance Russia's power and reputation in the
region]{.underline}**. At the very least, **[Russia will be able to
paint the United States as an erratic aggressor, leading regional actors
and international allies to question cooperation with
Washington]{.underline}**. **[Russia has helped the Assad regime
maintain control in Syria, even as the U.S. and its NATO allies demanded
Assad's ouster]{.underline}**. As the U.S. pulls back from Syria, Assad
and Russia remain in control. **[Russia's backing of Assad began as a
quest to undermine U.S. interests and gain influence in the Middle
East]{.underline}**. More than four years later, **[Russia's triumphs
from that conflict include drawing Turkey away from its NATO allies,
building a reputation as a valuable foreign backer, and emerging as a
kingmaker]{.underline}**---**[all at the expense of the United
States]{.underline}**. Poorly reasoned U.S. foreign policy decisions,
such as, most recently, abandoning Kurdish partners in Syria, helped
create a power vacuum that Russia has stepped in to fill. Friday's
strikes --- and every Trump administration action taken since --- will
likely improve Russia's position in Syria and the broader region. Iraq's
government is outraged by what it views as a U.S. violation of its
sovereignty, with the Iraqi prime minister calling the strike a
"flagrant violation of the conditions authorizing the presence of U.S.
troops." Iraq could soon expel U.S. forces from the country in response.
With no troops in Iraq, the United States will find it hard to sustain a
presence in Syria. That [void would create more maneuverability for
Moscow in the region --- essentially, cementing its position as a
regional power broker. **Beyond strengthening Russia's position, the
Soleimani strike contributes to Russia's goals of driving a wedge
between Washington and its partners and advancing global perceptions of
the United States as volatile and belligerent**]{.underline}. **[Moscow
has already succeeded in undermining U.S. relations with Middle Eastern
allies. The prime example is Turkey]{.underline}**: Although Russia and
Turkey were on opposite sides of the conflict in Syria, they now jointly
control operations in the north of the country after a remarkable
October 22 agreement between Washington and Ankara to establish a "Syria
Safe Zone" and the withdrawal of U.S. troops. In reaction to Soleimani's
death, Turkey released a statement that it opposes "foreign
interventions, assassinations and sectarian conflicts in the region."
**[Moscow could also benefit if the U.S.]{.underline}** strikes
**[create more disunity between Washington and its European
allies]{.underline}**. **[Numerous U.S. decisions in the Middle East
have frustrated allies, particularly its withdrawal from the nuclear
deal]{.underline}**. Reports suggest that the Trump administration even
failed to warn Britain and other allies ahead of the strikes on
Soleimani. **[If Washington does not heed its allies' calls for
immediate de-escalation, the United States could find itself further
isolated on the world stage]{.underline}**. Washington could incur
additional damage to its relationships with European allies if Iran now
hastens its pursuit of a nuclear weapon as a result of the strikes. Iran
announced Sunday it would stop obeying all restrictions imposed by the
Iran deal on its nuclear activities. Russia has been a vocal critic of
the U.S. decision to withdraw from the deal and instead mount a "maximum
pressure" campaign against Iran. In fact, [Moscow's position has placed
it on the same side as European powers like France and Germany opposing
the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions. Russia has worked with France
and Germany to sidestep U.S. sanctions to keep Iran in the
deal]{.underline}. Consequently, **[Russia is ideally situated to
emphasize its efforts to maintain the agreement and blame Washington for
pushing Iran toward a nuclear bomb.]{.underline}** Of course, there are
major downsides for Russia from a U.S.-Iran conflict in the Middle East.
A proxy conflict could stress Russian forces in Syria, especially if
Israel escalates its strikes against Iranian-backed groups like
Hezbollah, which vowed to revenge Soleimani's death. Furthermore, any
Iranian progress toward nuclear breakout surely would destabilize the
region, complicating Russia's ability to control the situation in Syria.
Finally, if Russia cooperates too closely with Iran, it will attract
criticism from other Middle Eastern partners. For a while it seemed that
Trump was trying to fulfill his campaign promise of a reduced U.S.
presence in the Middle East. Now, it seems as if he's trying to draw the
country into another prolonged quagmire --- whether as a distraction
from impeachment proceedings or to force Iran to the negotiating table,
it is too early to tell. [Russia]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is
left with the enviable position of capitalizing on the turbulent
behavior of the United States in the Middle East, regardless of whether
the United States and Iran go to war]{.underline}. Ultimately, [U.S.
actions will strengthen Russian leadership: first, by removing American
competition, and second, by turning regional and global sentiment
against the United States.]{.underline} Provided Moscow continues
cooperating with all regional states and maintains stability in Syrian
territory where Russian forces are present, **[Russia stands a good
chance of supplanting U.S. influence in the Middle East --- no matter
what happens next.]{.underline}**

**[Vacillating between cooperation and contention, the Russian--Iranian
partnership has long been riddled with contradictions]{.underline}**.
For scholars, Moscow's mercurial manoeuvrings have made it challenging
to decipher the nature of the partnership. One Iranian analyst qualified
Moscow's interactions with Tehran as a 'run with the hare, hunt with
hounds' approach. **[Following its 'zigzagging'
trajectory]{.underline}**, he argued that **[the degree of expansion or
contraction in Russian--Iranian cooperation depended on whether
relations between the US and Russia were amicable or
hostile]{.underline}** at the time. [Evidence of this was the
construction of the Bushehr power plant and the delivery of the sale of
Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile systems]{.underline}.
**[Russia stalled for years]{.underline}**, **[especially
during]{.underline}** Russian President Dmitri **[Medvedev
and]{.underline}** US President Barack **[Obama's dalliance with the
idea of a 'reset' in relations]{.underline}**. What was underplayed was
the fact that while Russia delayed, it did deliver in the end. This
point cannot be emphasised enough -- for an isolated Iran, with more
foes than friends, what ultimately mattered was that (some) of its needs
were being met. In the end, Russia delivered on its matrimonial
promises. **[Curiously, the Russian--Iranian partnership has proven to
be steady]{.underline}**. [What explains the durability of the
partnership despite conflicting interests in different geopolitical
theatres? Syria, for example, is regularly singled out as the arena in
which the Russian--Iranian partnership is bound to unravel]{.underline}.
Tehran and the Kremlin are aligned in that they both support Bashar
al-Assad's leadership, but they pursue very different approaches when it
comes to post-conflict Syrian governance, state-building and military
reform. [In fact, tensions have been brewing for years over
reconstruction and investment opportunities]{.underline}. Vying over
lucrative government contracts, both states expect dividends. 'We have
probably paid \$20--30 billion to Syria, and we have to take that money
back', Heshmatollah Falahatpisheh, a member of the Iranian parliament's
national security committee said in an interview with the state-run news
website Etemad Online. [There was also speculation that tensions would
flare up between the two states when]{.underline} on 8 July, [Iran and
Syria signed a bilateral pact to strengthen military and defence
cooperation]{.underline}. **[Analysts were quick to predict that the
Iranian military deployment]{.underline}** (two batteries of
surface-to-air missiles) **[authorised in the military deal would
challenge the partnership]{.underline}**. **[However, as long-term
patterns of engagement suggest, the Russian--Iranian partnership will
likely pass this litmus test as it has others]{.underline}**. Iranian
analyst, Shuaib Bahman, corroborates this view. Speaking to the Mehr
News Agency, he explained that **[although Russia and Iran have
disagreements over Syria, they are not competitors]{.underline}**.
Bahman maintains that that [while other actors and coalitions in Syria,
including Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia
and the US have disbanded over discrepancies and disputes, Tehran and
Moscow have been able to successfully manage their differences in
Syria]{.underline}. **[Russia and Iran]{.underline}**, he argues,
**[will continue cooperating in Syria and beyond.]{.underline}** In the
past month alone, [Tehran and the Kremlin have reaffirmed their
commitment to bilateral cooperation in several ways]{.underline}. On 20
July, Iranian Foreign Minister, Javad [Zarif]{.underline}, who visited
Moscow for the third time in six months, [confirmed that Tehran was
planning to extend a 20-year agreement with Russia]{.underline}. The
agreement is set to expire in March 2021. [In turn, Moscow expressed its
willingness to help Iran complete work on their nuclear power
plant]{.underline}. On 2 August, [Zarif reaffirmed]{.underline} to
Leonid Slutsky, Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of
Russia's State Duma, [Iran's readiness to ramp up parliamentary
relations to a strategic level]{.underline}. [Russia recently came to
Iran's defence in the UNSC over the controversial vote over the Iranian
arms embargo]{.underline}. On 14 August, Russian President, Vladimir
Putin [proposed a seven-way online summit of UNSC permanent members,
along with Germany and Iran, in a bid to avoid 'confrontation and
escalation' at the UN]{.underline}. The US lost the bid to extend a UN
arms embargo, set to expire on October 2020. **[How can we explain the
durability of the partnership despite ups and downs, clashes and
discord?]{.underline}** In my research**[, I have identified a unique
ideational synergy binding Moscow and Tehran despite asymmetrical
approaches and conflicting interests]{.underline}**. **[Both states
espouse a similar political logic and understanding of the international
system]{.underline}**. **[This shared geopolitical vision has developed
organically along deeper lines of convergence]{.underline}**, including
civilisational peculiarities, historical experiences, normative values
and social identities, cultural orientations, **[and a similar
discursive genealogy in relation to the West]{.underline}**. While
Russia and Iran may clash in different regional theatres, their
alignment is buttressed by several ideational pillars. [Russia and Iran
are both anti-hegemonic, opposing the idea of a single state or a
constellation of states being able to impose particular normative values
and power structures as universal]{.underline}. [Both states have
demonstrated a commitment to building alternative integrative networks,
and multilateral institutions on a regional level in order to create a
counterweight to US unipolarity]{.underline} (the Shanghai Cooperation
Council, the Eurasian Economic Union, or Iran's recent 25-year agreement
with China, for instance). Both have a common security threat
perception, strongly opposing the universalist normative aspirations of
the international system, which they deem as a threat to their unique
civilisational identities. **[Moscow, in particular, opposes the US-led
Atlantic]{.underline}** ideological and power **[systems that gained
traction at the end of the Cold War]{.underline}**, when Russia and the
West entered the era of 'Cold Peace'. **[As a countermeasure, Russia's
overriding strategic goal has been to advance what Trine Flockhart
refers to as a 'multi-order' in which different 'inter-orders' of
sovereign states are nested within an overall international
system]{.underline}**. **[In this pursuit, Tehran has been a reliable
partner]{.underline}**. Iran and Russia are firmly ensconced as an
'inter-order' within this emerging 'multi-order' international system.
In order to better understand the paradoxes and contradictions of this
partnership, it is useful to conceptualise two separate levels that
define Moscow--Tehran relations: on the top plane there are both common
or clashing realpolitik interests that are held down by a gravitational
pull onto a foundational level, comprised of common principles and
perceptions of the international system. **[It is this crucial
foundational level that accounts for the paradoxes of this most
peculiar, but permanent, partnership.]{.underline}**

and goals in many regional and international issues. However, their
joint efforts have **[so far succeeded in achieving substantial results

threat to Russian interests.]{.underline} Several months ago, during an
interview with Russian news agency TASS, Israel\'s Moscow envoy asserted
that Israel was satisfied with Russia\'s stance on Iranian military
presence on the Israeli-Syrian border. He pointed out that Israel and
Russia are engaged in intensive discussions on this issue while
stressing that the presence of Iranian forces in the region is
\"targeting Israel.\" According to the report of the Israeli \"Politics
and Strategy\" Institute, the undeclared war between Tehran and Tel
Aviv, which has been continuing since the beginning of the Syrian
crisis, does not worry Russia, at least, as long as the parties are wary
of harming Moscow\'s interests in the process. However, the competition
between the Kremlin and Tehran for control, influence and for
determining Syria\'s future is fast becoming a problem. Israel\'s
frequent attacks on Iranian locations inside Syria, in addition to
pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on Iran, increase Iran\'s need
to have a good relationship with Russia, which makes Moscow stronger
than before when confronting Tehran in Syria. **[It cannot be ignored
what many observers have said, that the invitation of Iran to
participate in Astana talks in 2017 was an attempt by Ankara and Moscow
to push Tehran to fulfill its obligations because it is difficult to
control groups affiliated with Iran in Syria, and unlike Tehran, Russia
has managed to build bridges with the Syrian political and armed
opposition through Saudi Arabia and Turkey]{.underline}**.

The [war unleashed by Turkey's invasion of Syria]{.underline}, targeting
formerly US-backed Kurdish forces, **[escalated out of
control]{.underline}** this weekend [as the Syrian **army** and **Iran**
moved to **counterattack**. With Turkish **troops** and allied Al Qaeda
**militias** advancing]{.underline} deep into Kurdish-held
[territory]{.underline} in Syria, the [Middle East is]{.underline} only
**[days away]{.underline}** [from an **all-out war**
between]{.underline} the **[major regional powers]{.underline}** [that
could trigger]{.underline} a **[global]{.underline}**
**[conflict]{.underline}** [between **nuclear-armed** world]{.underline}
**[powers.]{.underline}** UN reports show that 130,000 Syrians have fled
their homes in the region amid the Turkish offensive, and Turkish
officials claim they had "neutralized" at least 415 Kurdish fighters.
Turkish troops seized the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, amid heavy
fighting including ongoing Turkish air raids, and seized a road crossing
that cut off US and Kurdish troops in Kobani. Turkish troops also fired
artillery at US troops near Kobani in what former US envoy Brett McGurk
said was "not a mistake," although Turkish officials later denied this.
Turkey's [Syrian "rebel" allies]{.underline}, the Islamist Syrian
National Army (SNA, formerly the Free Syrian Army), [are executing
Kurdish civilians]{.underline} in areas they hold, according to multiple
reports. Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf was executed; her
bullet-riddled car appeared in a video surrounded by SNA fighters.
Beyond Al Qaeda-linked calls to destroy infidels, the British Daily
Telegraph noted, the SNA's main outlook "is sectarian: they are
anti-Kurdish and they are Arab chauvinists." Yesterday evening, the
Syrian army announced it would march on the area. The official Syrian
Arab News Agency (SANA) reported: "Syrian Arab Army units began moving
north to confront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\... The
movement comes to confront the ongoing Turkish aggression on towns and
areas in the north of Hasaka and Raqqa provinces, where the Turkish
forces committed massacres against locals, occupied some areas and
destroyed infrastructure." The Syrian army has reportedly reached an
agreement with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia,
whose alliance with the United States was broken by Washington a week
ago. Under this agreement, Syrian army troops would reach the city of
Kobani near the Syrian-Turkish border in 48 hours. On Saturday,
President Donald Trump had authorized the remaining 1,000 US troops in
Kobani to withdraw, and US forces were in full retreat across northern
Syria this weekend to avoid being cut off by advancing Turkish troops.
Iran, which has deployed tens of thousands of troops as well as drones
to Syria in recent years to back the Syrian regime against a NATO-led
proxy war, indicated it would support the Syrian army. Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei's Advisor for International Affairs Ali Akbar
Velayati met with Syrian Ambassador to Iran Adnan Mahmoud yesterday in
Tehran. He gave Iran's "full support to Syria's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, calling for the withdrawal of the Turkish
forces," SANA reported. Velayati added, "The principled policy of Iran
is based on supporting the people and government of Syria and defending
their righteous stances in a way that entails continuing joint
cooperation until terrorism and terrorist organizations are completely
eliminated." At the same time, [military tensions between Iran and Saudi
Arabia are surging amid mutual attacks]{.underline} on tankers carrying
Persian Gulf oil supplies that are critical to the world economy. Last
month, the US and Saudi governments blamed a September 14 missile attack
on Saudi oil facilities that caused a sharp rise in world oil prices on
Iran, without providing any evidence. Then on October 11, two missiles
hit the Iranian tanker Sabiti off Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast. Ali
Shamkhani, the secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security
Council, said yesterday that Iran would retaliate against unnamed
targets for the attack on the Sabiti. "A special committee has been set
up to investigate the attack on Sabiti\... Its report will soon be
submitted to the authorities for decision," Shamkhani told Fars News.
"Piracy and mischief on international waterways aimed at making
commercial shipping insecure will not go unanswered." Saudi officials
declined to comment on the Sabiti attack, and officials with the US
Fifth Fleet in the Gulf sheikdom of Bahrain claimed to have no
information on it. But there is widespread speculation in the
international media that the attack was carried out by Saudi Arabia or
with its support. The **[conflicts erupting]{.underline}** between the
different capitalist regimes [in the **Mid**]{.underline}dle [East pose
an **imminent threat**]{.underline} not only to the population of the
region, but **[to the entire world.]{.underline}** Workers can give no
support to any of the competing military plans and strategic appetites
of these reactionary regimes. [With **America**,
**Europe**,]{.underline} [**Russia** and **China** all **deeply
involved** in the **proxy war** in Syria,]{.underline} a [large-scale
Middle East war could strangle the world **oil supply** and escalate
into war between **nuclear-armed powers.**]{.underline} The [working
class is coming face to face with the real possibility of a Third World
War.]{.underline} The Kurdish-led SDF militias in Syria, vastly
outgunned by Turkish forces and vulnerable to air strikes, warned US
officials in talks leaked by CNN that they would appeal for Russia to
attack Turkey and protect SDF and Syrian army forces. As Turkey is
legally a NATO ally of Washington and the European powers, such [an
attack could compel the United States and its European allies
to]{.underline} either break the 70-year-old NATO alliance or [go to war
with Russia to protect Turkey.]{.underline} "You are leaving us to be
slaughtered," SDF General Mazloum Kobani Abdi told US officials in a
meeting last Thursday. "You are not willing to protect the people, but
you do not want another force to come and protect us. You have sold us."
Mazloum dismissed US officials when they replied by demanding that the
SDF not cut a deal with Russia, but instead keep taking huge casualties
from Turkish air raids. He said, "I need to know if you are capable of
protecting my people, of stopping these bombs falling on us or not. I
need to know, because if you're not, I need to make a deal with Russia
and the regime now and invite their planes to protect this region." US
forces across Syria were in full retreat, however, and US Defense
Secretary Mark Esper told US television news yesterday that the
Turkish-Kurdish conflict "gets worse by the hour." Given the attempts by
the Kurds to work out an alliance with Syria and Russia, he added, Trump
"directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern
Syria." Esper said he would "not place American service members in the
middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. This
is not why we are in Syria." Esper said the Turkish army was rejecting
the Pentagon's appeals for a ceasefire with the Kurds and instead
expanding its war aims inside Syria. "In the last 24 hours, we learned
that they likely intend to expand their [attack]{.underline} further
south than originally planned, and to the west," he said. Esper added
that "all the exact things" US officials warned their Turkish
counterparts [would]{.underline} likely happen if they invaded Syria
were now taking place, including the [release]{.underline} of [tens of
thousands of]{.underline} Islamic State (**[ISIS]{.underline}**)
[fighters held in prison camps by Washington's former Kurdish
allies.]{.underline}

#### Cooperation is [high]{.underline}. 

Maziar **Motamedi 22**, a Tehran-based journalist who covers Iran,
1/21/2022, "What next for Iran and Russia ties after Raisi-Putin
meeting?,"
<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/1/21/what-next-for-iran-and-russia-ties-after-raisi-putin-meeting>,
RES

[Tehran, Iran -- Prior to his departure for Moscow this week, Ebrahim
Raisi expressed hope that the visit, the first by an Iranian president
in almost five years, would lead to a **"turning point**" in his
country's relations with Russia.]{.underline} In the Russian capital,
[both Raisi and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, supported
**improving bilateral ties** during a three-hour meeting on Wednesday in
which they also discussed regional and international
issues]{.underline}. For their part, Iran's petroleum and economy
ministers who accompanied Raisi said their talks with their counterparts
exceeded expectations. Without disclosing many details, the ministers
said agreements were made in trade, energy, transportation and banking
sectors and promised that the results would be felt in the foreseeable
future. Following the two-day visit, [analysts said Iran and Russia were
on track to improve their bilateral ties **across the board** -- but the
scale and timing were complicated by a number of factors.]{.underline}
As in previous years, comprehensive United States sanctions on Iran are
sure to complicate any commitments, for as long as they persist.
Meanwhile, the record figure of [Iran-Russia bilateral trade that
exceeded \$3.5bn in 2021]{.underline}, according to Iran's ambassador in
Moscow, still falls far short compared with the levels reached between
Russia and several other regional actors. "The visit seems more
ceremonial than a substantive turning point in bilateral relations,"
Nicole Grajewski, a research fellow with the International Security
Program at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, told
Al Jazeera. For one, she said, a new and improved 20-year cooperation
agreement between Iran and Russia has yet to be finalised, and Raisi
only handed over Iran's proposed draft during his trip. "[That being
said, Russia-Iran relations are significantly stronger today than they
were the last time an Iranian president visited Russia in
2017]{.underline} under \[Hassan\] Rouhani," Grajewski added, referring
to Raisi's predecessor, whose term ended in August 2021. Nuclear deal
[The fate of the ongoing intensive talks in Vienna aimed at restoring
Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers will still play a major role
in the future of Iran's ties with Russia.]{.underline} Russia, a
signatory, has been actively trying to facilitate the revival of the
landmark accord that the US unilaterally abandoned in 2018, and has been
a mediating force between Iran, the European signatories and the US. "It
is very important for me to know your opinion on the JCPOA," Putin told
Raisi on Wednesday, referring to the deal by its formal name, the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action. All sides have attested that some real
progress has been achieved in recent weeks in the Austrian capital, but
resolving outstanding political issues appears to hinge on concessions
by both Iran and the US. "The Iranian nuclear issue has historically
affected Russia-Iran relations but it has been variable in its impact
across certain issues," the Belfer Center's Grajewski said. "[The Vienna
talks are a central aspect of the Russia-Iran relationship today. Moscow
has historically adopted a constructive position on Iran's nuclear
programme even during low points of US-Russia relations after
Ukraine]{.underline}." However, Grajewski pointed out that if the talks
fail because Iran refuses to tone down some of its demands, different
aspects of the two countries' relations could be affected. Arms deal For
instance, the two have been discussing the possibility of Iran
purchasing advanced arms -- especially the top of the line S-400 air
defence systems and Su-35 fighter jets. Such a prospect is made possible
by the lifting of a United Nations embargo on conventional arms sales to
Iran in 2020 as a result of the nuclear deal, something Russia
supported. At the moment, Iran may not have the funds to pay for such a
major deal as tens of billions of dollars of its money are frozen abroad
and its revenues have been slashed due to US sanctions. Moreover, the
Iranian establishment may not be eager to face potential local criticism
of an arms deal when its population is under the enormous strain of
rampant inflation amid an ailing economy. According to Samuel Ramani,
associate fellow at the Royal United Service Institute, Russia may not
be eager to sell the arms to Iran at the moment either. "Russia's
overall policy in the Middle East is to be friends with all, allies of
none, enemies of none, so selling arms to Iran might disrupt its efforts
to balance closer ties with Israel and the UAE, in particular, as
tensions are heightened between these countries and Tehran right now and
Saudi Arabia," he told Al Jazeera. [But that does not mean Iran and
Russia are disinterested in boosting military cooperation, as the two
held a joint trilateral naval drill with China in an area north of the
Indian Ocean on Friday. Regional cooperation]{.underline} Observers say
Iran and Russia have shared interests across the region that will be
maintained or improved regardless of others factors, such as the Vienna
talks -- something that was also apparent in the two presidents'
meeting. Both Raisi and Putin praised "successful" joint efforts in
Syria, where the two countries support President Bashar al-Assad in the
country's 10-year war. They agreed that "combating terrorism" in Syria
is a shared goal. Iran and Russia have a shared concern about the fate
of Taliban-controlled Afghanistan after the chaotic US exit in August.
Both have been active in organising talks to find solutions on a number
of issues. Alo[ng with China, Iran and Russia have repeatedly denounced
US "unilateralism". And Moscow and Beijing recently supported Tehran's
successful bid to become a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation. Putin on Wednesday also expressed his support for Iran to
gain a larger foothold in the Eurasian Economic Union, and said both
sides are working to create a free-trade zone.]{.underline} Lastly,
Russia has been vocal about its interests in being increasingly engaged
in mediating efforts on Persian Gulf and regional security. On Friday,
Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said [Russia wants to organise a
conference to resolve regional issues through dialogue]{.underline}.
Lavrov described it as "a conference that would bring Iranians and Arabs
together where Iran would not be the subject of discussion and where
each side would lay their concerns on the table" and would address
issues with Yemen, Syria and Iraq as well.

**[Iran and Russia are likely to renew their "20-year agreement", which
expires in March 2021]{.underline}**, Iran's Foreign Minister Javad
Zarif said during his official visit to Moscow on Tuesday. Speaking to
Iranian media in Moscow, **[Zarif said another "long-term deal" with
Russia is "on the agenda", terming the relations between the two
all-weather allies as "strategic."]{.underline}** Zarif, accompanied by
Deputy Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araqchi, left for Moscow early on
Tuesday for talks with the Russian officials, including President
Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. [It is the second
visit by the Iranian foreign minister to Moscow in a month]{.underline},
and coincides with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi's first
official visit to Tehran. Zarif had visited Baghdad on Sunday. While it
was not immediately clear which "20-year agreement" Zarif was referring
to, according to reports it pertains to a series of petrochemical and
weapons deals signed by the two sides in 2001. The long-term deals were
signed in Kremlin in March 2001 between then Iran's President Mohammad
Khatami and Russia's President Vladimir Putin, when Putin agreed to sell
Russian conventional arms to Iran after a gap of six years. [In what was
the first meeting in four decades between the top political
functionaries of the two countries, Moscow had also expressed its
willingness to help Iran complete work on the country's only nuclear
power plant in the Persian Gulf region.]{.underline} Since 2001, **[the
relations between the two countries have strengthened while Iran's
relations with the US have gradually deteriorated]{.underline}**.
Extension of arms embargo **[Pertinently, Russia is one of the countries
that have opposed the US' demand for extending the UN arms embargo on
Iran]{.underline}**, which is slated to expire in October this year.
**[The US government officials have upped the ante]{.underline}** in
recent weeks, **[calling for extension of arms embargo on Iran, and
threatening to invoke sanctions snapback]{.underline}**. Commenting on
why he chose to visit Moscow just a month after his last visit, **[Zarif
said "continued dialogue with Russia]{.underline}** and other friendly
countries such as China **[is essential given the major international
developments."]{.underline}**

exports, Moscow and Tehran **are taking measures to intensify trade and
economic cooperation**, as evidenced by intensive negotiations between
the parties.]{.underline} A delegation of Iranian businessmen will visit
Moscow in early April to present industrial and investment potential.
Notably, Russia and Iran are working on the issue of combining financial
message transmission systems bypassing the SWIFT international system
for transferring interbank payments. Tehran is also considering
recognising the Russian payment system "Mir" cards. Moreover, Eurasian
Economic Union member states are preparing an agreement to establish a
free trade zone between them and the Islamic Republic of Iran
(Russia-Iran entente on Eurasian current issues and dynamics). [Iran --
Russia's potential **cooperation in agribusiness, industry and
trade**]{.underline} On March 18th, 2022, a working meeting was held in
Moscow between the Deputy Head of Rosselkhoznadzor Konstantin Savenkov
and the Head of the Iranian Plant Protection Organization (IPPO) Jahpur
Jamshid Alai Moghadami and the Head of the Iranian Veterinary
Organization (IVO) Seyyed Mohammad Aghamiri. The event was attended by
senior officials of the Iranian Embassy in Moscow and the Ministry of
Agriculture of Russia. [The parties confirmed their intention to develop
bilateral trade and business relations intensively, adhere to the
principles of openness and trust, and build a direct dialogue to resolve
emerging issues promptly]{.underline}. [The Iranian side said that it is
interested in increasing the volume of imports of grains and oilseeds
from Russia from the current 7 million tons per year to 12 million tons.
In addition, Iran plans to consider opening its market for Russian
poultry, lamb and other meat products in the near future]{.underline}.
Shortly, Iranian specialists will come to Russia to inspect poultry
processing enterprises. [As for Iranian food exports to Russia, the
talks discussed Iran's ability to supply up to 2 million tons of
vegetables, such as tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, peppers, greens and
apples.]{.underline} [The volume of imports of these crops to Russia by
the Iranian side is estimated at 570,000 tons]{.underline}. The parties
discussed in detail the existing quarantine and plant protection systems
in Russia and Iran, the mechanisms for ensuring phytosanitary and
veterinary safety, which allow for strict control over the supply of
products for export. [During the meeting, an agreement was reached to
promptly complete work on two agreements that will regulate the
interaction of the parties in the field of the safe use of pesticides
and agrochemicals and allow for the establishment of electronic document
management for traceability of trade processes]{.underline}. A separate
topic of the dialogue was the [export of dairy products from
Iran]{.underline}. Rosselkhoznadzor reported that after the
reconstruction, the international checkpoint "Yarag-Kazmalyar" (Republic
of Dagestan) is starting to work, the import of products through which
will significantly simplify logistics between countries. [The Russian
department noted that Iranian enterprises certified for export
consistently supply Russia with a wide range of dairy products in
consumer packaging, including cheese, butter, and cream]{.underline}. In
a short time, the Rosselkhoznadzor will send detailed explanations to
the Iranian Veterinary Service regarding the situation with frozen
concentrated cream, the import of which to Russia is temporarily
limited. A few days after the talks in Moscow, on March 23th, 2022, a
working meeting was held between the Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan
Jagaryan and the head of the Trade Development Organization, Deputy
Minister of Industry, Mines and Trade of Iran A. Peymanpak. Rustam
Zhiganshin, Trade Representative of Russia in Iran, reportedly took part
in the meeting. At the talks, [the Iranian side confirmed the growing
interest of the country's business circles in expanding trade and
economic cooperation with Russia]{.underline}. It was announced that a
delegation of Iranian businessmen is scheduled to visit Moscow in early
April to present industrial and investment potential. [More than forty
companies producing food products, seafood, cosmetics, household
chemicals, construction and sanitary materials, leather and textile
products, accessories, polymers, plastics, medicines have already
expressed their readiness to hold meetings at the site of the Chamber of
Commerce and Industry of the Russian Federation]{.underline}. During the
conversation, A. Peymanpak spoke about the demand for Russian mining
equipment and machinery, buses and minibuses, locomotives, ships,
agricultural raw materials in Iran and expressed the seriousness of
intentions to implement joint investment projects in the automotive
industry, medicine and agriculture. Rustam Zhiganshin informed the
Deputy Minister of Industry, Mines and Trade of Iran about the increased
number of proposals from Russian companies for cooperation with Iranian
partners. In turn, the Head of the Trade Development Organization, A.
Peimanpak, assured that [the Iranian side would provide the necessary
assistance in expanding foreign economic relations with
Russia]{.underline}. Against the backdrop of the negotiations held in
March, it became known that Russia and Iran are working on the issue of
combining financial message transmission systems bypassing the SWIFT
international system for transferring interbank payments. Kazem Jalali,
Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran (IRI) to Russia, told
journalists. "We are making efforts in this direction (connecting
Iranian banks to the SPFS) to hold good events in this area in the
future," Jalali said. As the Iranian ambassador noted, his country is
also discussing with Russia the recognition of the cards of the Russian
payment system "Mir". "This issue is also on the agenda. We discussed it
with our Russian colleagues," the ambassador said. Notably, the
integration of the Iranian payment system Shetab with the Russian MIR
was announced in 2017 when a corresponding agreement was signed between
the countries. In August 2017, much technical work began, but the US
withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 partially created sanctions risks for
certain Russian banks planning to integrate with the Iranian Shetab
system. The Financial Message Transfer System (SPFS) of the Bank of
Russia was created in response to the risks of a possible disconnection
of Russian banks from SWIFT, an international interbank system for
transmitting information and making payments. Conclusion In conclusion,
one more important event that took place in Tehran in March should be
noted. On March 14th-16th, 2022, the second round of negotiations was
held to prepare an Agreement on the establishment of a free trade zone
between the Eurasian Economic Union and its member states and the
Islamic Republic of Iran. The event was attended by representatives of
the Eurasian Economic Commission and the Trade Development Organization
of Iran, the Russian Foreign Ministry, the Russian Ministry of Economic
Development, the Russian Ministry of Industry and Trade, various
departments of the EAEU member states joined via videoconference. As a
result, the parties agreed to hold the next round of talks in Moscow.
[Recall that the Interim Agreement leading to forming a free trade zone
with Iran was signed on May 17th, 2018 and entered into force on October
27th, 2019]{.underline}. As a result, [the countries of the Eurasian
Economic Union (EAEU) and Iran are increasing the volume of mutual
trade]{.underline}. Thus, according to the Iranian customs service data,
the trade turnover between Iran and the EAEU countries for 11 months of
the current Iranian year (March 21st, 2021 -- February 19th, 2022)
increased by 48%, amounting to more than \$5 billion.

TEHRAN (Tasnim) -- [Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi hailed the **high
level of the ties between Tehran and Moscow** but said there is still
**great potential for developing the relations**.]{.underline}
"[Relations between the two countries in the field of trade and energy
cooperation are at a high level, but given the existing fields in the
two countries, these relations still have great potential for
**expansion**]{.underline}," Raisi said in a Wednesday meeting with his
Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Turkmenistan\'s capital, Ashgabat.
The two presidents had traveled to Ashgabat to take part in the sixth
summit of the Caspian littoral states. "After my (recent) visit to
Russia, several reciprocal visits have been made by the relevant
officials in order to follow up on the agreements between [the two
countries, and the implementation process of these agreements is at a
good pace]{.underline}," Raisi said. The Iranian president had paid a
two-day visit to Moscow at the head of a delegation in January and met
Putin. [He described the visit as a **\"turning point\" in bilateral
relations** between the two countries, saying they could boost their
security and trade through maintaining close dialogue.]{.underline} Last
week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Tehran where he met
Raisi, confiding that Moscow was adapting to what he called the West\'s
aggressive policies. "[In all the countries experiencing the negative
influence of the selfish line taken by the United States and its
satellites, there arises the objective need to **reconfigure their
economic relations** so they can avoid relying on the whims and vagaries
of our Western partners]{.underline}," Lavrov said. Last month [Moscow
said Russia and Iran, which are both under Western sanctions and sit on
some of the world's largest oil and gas reserves, had discussed
**swapping supplies for oil and gas** as well as establishing a
**logistics hub**.]{.underline} On Wednesday, [Raisi stressed the need
for the two countries to support strengthening of the North-South
corridor, saying Iran and Russia have also good capacities for
cooperation in the field of energy, including swaps. The International
North-South Transport Corridor (**INSTC**) is a multimode network of sea
and rail routes that links the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf to
Iran, India, Russia and North Europe. The Iranian president also
stressed the need for mechanisms to strengthen banking and monetary
relations between Iran and Russia, stating that financial exchanges
between the two countries should be carried out within an independent
framework outside the Western financial exchange system so that no
country can manipulate it for pressure.]{.underline} Putin expressed his
satisfaction with meeting his Iranian counterpart again, saying [trade
and economic relations between the two countries have increased in
recent months, adding the path must continue]{.underline}. [The Russian
leader also welcomed Raisi\'s proposal to increase energy cooperation
between the two countries, including swaps.]{.underline} Putin also
asked the Iranian president to convey his warm greetings to Leader of
the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei. [The two countries
have been working to sign a new and improved **long-term bilateral
cooperation agreement**. Iranian officials have said they have been
making headways on banking cooperation, most importantly on foreign
currency transfers. Bilateral trade surged **80% percent last year**,

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) --- [Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived Tuesday
in Iran for a visit intended to **deepen ties** with regional
heavyweights as part of Moscow's challenge to the United States and
Europe amid its grinding campaign in Ukraine.]{.underline} In only his
second trip abroad since Russian tanks rolled into its neighbor in
February, [Putin is scheduled to hold talks with Iran's President
Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the
pressing issues facing the region, including the **conflict in Syria**
and **a UN-backed proposal to resume exports of Ukrainian grain to ease
the global food crisis**.]{.underline} A[s the West heaps sanctions on
Russia and the costly campaign drags on, Putin is seeking to bolster
ties with Tehran, a fellow target of severe US sanctions and a potential
military and trade partner. In recent weeks, Russian officials visited
an airfield in central Iran at least twice to **review Tehran's
weapons-capable drones** for possible use in Ukraine, the White House
has alleged.]{.underline}

#### [Ties]{.underline} are increasing.

[Russian state news agency TASS said Lavrov will meet Iranian President
Ayatollah Seyed Ebrahim Raisi and Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir
Abdollahian during his two-day visit]{.underline}. [Lavrov is expected
to discuss with Iranian officials a full range of issues spanning
**economic cooperation, and political consultations on bilateral and
international issues**.]{.underline} The visit is noteworthy for two
major reasons: First, it is Lavrov's first visit to Tehran since
Ayatollah Raisi assumed the presidency in August 2021. Second, [the
visit comes amid growing economic sanctions by the West against Russia
over the Ukraine war and uncertainties over the talks in Vienna over
reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal]{.underline}. During Lavrov's visit,
"[issues around the signing of a **long-term cooperation agreement** and
work to expand bilateral economic contacts amid the West's tightening
sanctions will be discussed. **Cooperation in regional
security**]{.underline}, concerning Syria and Afghanistan, [will also be
key]{.underline}," according to TASS. Russia is facing blanket Western
sanctions over the Ukraine war and it has overtaken Iran as the most
sanctioned nation in the world, according to press reports. [Exploring
avenues for cooperation against sanctions is on the agenda of the
visit]{.underline}, according to Al Araby Al Jadeed. Citing Iranian
sources, the Qatari-owned newspaper said Lavrov and Iranian officials
will discuss "**[the intensification of Iranian-Russian cooperation in
the face of U.S. sanctions]{.underline}**." The newspaper pointed out
that Russian officials visited Iran secretly and publicly in recent
months to "benefit from its experience in facing sanctions." Deputy
Prime Minister Alexander Novak paid a visit to Iran on May 25. The
Russian official met Iranian Petroleum Minister Javad Owji and First
Vice President Mohammad Mokhber in Tehran. Earlier in January, President
Raisi visited Russia and met with President Vladimir Putin. This
exchange of visits is part of President Raisi's foreign policy agenda of
fostering relations with neighboring countries and major non-Western
powers. [The policy, known as the **Neighborhood Policy**, saw Iran
strengthening its relations with central Asian countries, China, Russia,
and some Arab states.]{.underline} [A major part of this policy is to
**boost ties** with countries under Western sanctions such as Venezuela,
Syria, and Russia in what came to be known as the club of sanctioned
countries]{.underline}. To this end, Iran signed long-term cooperation
documents with China and Venezuela. It is in the process of signing
another one with Russia. Officials and experts of the sanctioned
countries have voiced support for this kind of cooperation. Marco
Fernandes, a researcher at Tricontinental Institute for Social Research,
has said that the BRICS group of nations needs to focus on creating an
alternative to the U.S. dollar's hegemony in global transactions, which
gives Washington leverage over its opponents, according to TASS.
Fernandes added, "After reserves and assets worth tens of billions of
dollars were confiscated from countries like Venezuela, Iran, and
Afghanistan, the U.S. and EU decision to freeze Russian reserves worth
over \$300 billion raised alarms all over the world, underscoring the
need to find an alternative to the dollar's dominance." [Overcoming the
dominance of the U.S. dollar over bilateral trade between the sanctioned
countries is a major goal of the efforts to found the club of sanctioned
countries.]{.underline}

[Russia said it's **strengthening trade** with Iran, boosting the
economies of both nations as they contend with heavy US
sanctions.]{.underline} "[We agreed to accelerate the preparation of
agreements on a free trade zone, and discussed cooperation in the
nuclear area in detail]{.underline}," Deputy Prime Minister Alexander
Novak said in Tehran after meeting with the co-chairman of the
Russian-Iranian intergovernmental commission. [Also discussed were oil
and gas supply swaps and increasing joint investments in hydrocarbon
projects]{.underline}, he said. [Novak]{.underline}, who co-chairs the
intergovernmental commission from Russia's side and oversees the
nation's energy affairs, [is visiting Tehran as both nations seek to
galvanize economic ties. Trade between the nations rose 81% to a record
\$3.3 billion in 2021, but Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said that
level was "not acceptable" and vowed to increase two-way commerce to
**\$10 billion a year**.]{.underline} On Wednesday, top officials set
even more ambitious target. [Iran and Russia plan to raise trade to
**\$40 billion a year by 2025**]{.underline}, said Iranian Oil Minister
Javad Owji, who co-chairs the commission from the Iranian side,
according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. [Bilateral
trade will be conducted in the countries' own currencies]{.underline},
according to Owji. The energy industries of both countries are
sanctioned by the US \-- in response to Vladimir Putin's invasion of
Ukraine, and following America's withdrawal from the 2015 Iranian
nuclear deal. "[We're on track to raise trade, economic, logistics,
investment, financial, banking **cooperation**, despite the
unprecedented pressure that Russia is experiencing]{.underline}," Novak
said at a meeting with businesses in Tehran earlier, as reported by news
service Interfax. [Trade between Russia and Iran rose by more than
**10%** in the first quarter]{.underline}, he said. "We are ready to
continue the implementation of already-initiated projects and to launch
new ones," Novak said. Among those is the expansion of the Russian-built
Bushehr nuclear plant. Talks with Moscow continue on the second and
third phases of the facility, which will require "a lot of investment,"
said Behrouz Kamalvandi, a spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organization
of Iran, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. Moscow is also
interested in developing the long-delayed North-South Transport
Corridor, a rail cargo route from Russia to India that would boost trade
from the Caspian and Persian Gulf regions, according to Novak.

RES

[Russia has abandoned a recent attempt to exploit the Vienna talks to
gain sanctions relief beyond what was guaranteed in the 2015 Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). However, there are **no** signs
that Tehran is walking away from its relationship with Moscow despite
Russia's actions toward Iran and its invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}
Any improvement in Iran's relationship with the West has always been a
concern for Russia. Its March 5 demand for a written guarantee from the
United States that trade with Iran not be affected by new US sanctions
imposed on Russia for the invasion is the latest example of Moscow
playing the Iranian card and jeopardizing Tehran's interests to secure
its own interests. This isn't the first time that Russia has used
nuclear talks in such a manner. Former Iranian Foreign Minister,
Mohammad Javad Zarif, said in March 2021 during a leaked interview about
Russia's destructive role in the Iran nuclear talks: "The Russians have
been trying to prevent the nuclear deal (JCPOA)since 2015 and \[Foreign
Minister\] Sergei Lavrov wanted to disrupt everything on the night of
the agreement. After the JCPOA, when Lavrov returned to Russia, he was
attacked by the Russian media. Why did you allow this agreement to be
reached and Iran to get closer to the West?" On the other hand, [Russia
doesn't want Iran to become a nuclear weapons state or be subjected to
sanctions, since this would undermine trade and technical relations with
Iran. Russia's policy is to maintain crises that can be controlled and
hinder the improvement of Iran-West relations.]{.underline} As Ali Vaez
of the International Crisis Group said in December 2021: "Russia is
seeking to revive the agreement because alternatives to Russia are not
attractive at all. If Iran goes to nuclear weapons, it is possible that
some other actors and Russia's neighbors, such as Turkey and even
Azerbaijan, want to go in this direction, or the Arab countries of the
Persian Gulf, and this will be a real big problem for Russia." However,
Rajab Safarov, a former member of the Russian Federation Presidential
Political Council and head of the Iran Commission at the Moscow Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, said in March that a pro-Western Iran is far
more dangerous to Russia than a nuclear Iran. [Russia fears that a
further expansion of Iran's nuclear program could lead to new conflict
in the region and a bigger US military presence.]{.underline} It's also
in Russia's interest that sanctions against Iran be lifted to expand
trade relations in the form of a twenty-year cooperation document, while
preventing Iran from improving relations with the West. Moscow also
seeks Iran's membership in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) (Iran's membership process in
the SCO takes about two years and, after the technical and legal process
concludes, Tehran will formally join this organization). "We are working
on a draft of a new agreement between the two countries, which defines
the principles of our cooperation in the international arena," said
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on March 15. "This document has
increased the volume of economic relations with Iran by 82 percent
during the sanctions period. No illegal sanctions can stop the
escalating growth of Iran and Russia." Still, the Iran-Russia agreement
hasn't had much economic benefit for Iran so far. Trade with Russia
currently accounts for only 4 percent of Iran's imports and 2 percent of
Iran's exports---only about \$4 billion a year. Tehran plans to increase
its trade volume with Russia to \$25 billion, but that goal seems overly
ambitious. Iran also sees the twenty-year agreement to strengthen its
security cooperation with Russia and obtain new weapons. On January 21,
Iran held a tripartite maneuver with the Russian and Chinese navies.
Tehran is reportedly seeking to purchase Russian Sukhoi-5 fighter jets
and the S-400 missile defense system. The government of President
Ebrahim Raisi also seeks to utilize a twenty-five-year cooperation
agreement with China to bolster a "look to the East" policy first
introduced by the administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during an
earlier bout of US-led sanctions. Additionally, a February 27-published
document on the transformation of the government of Raisi in Iran's
foreign relations doesn't mention North America. This document does seek
lifting sanctions but doesn't view the nuclear deal as a basis for
improving relations with the West. Iran's political elites see the
future of the international order as belonging to the East. They argue
that cooperation with the West on issues such as Afghanistan and Iraq
didn't improve relations, as the George W. Bush administration labeled
Iran an "axis of evil." The Raisi position isn't universally shared in
Iran. Reformists and even moderate conservatives as well as the middle
class and many ordinary people have reacted negatively to the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. Domestic opponents see Iran's long-term agreements
with Russia and China as unilateral concessions comparable to the
treaties of Golestan and Turkmenchay, in which imperial Persia gave up
important territories in the Caucasus to tsarist Russia. Accordingly,
the content of these agreements has been kept secret, leading parliament
speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf to comment on January 26 that "a contract
has not been legally concluded, otherwise the parliament would have been
informed." Russia did abandon its effort to hold the Vienna talks
hostage after Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian visited
Moscow on March 15, but Iran appears to have granted concessions. During
the visit, the two countries discussed cooperation in the Caspian Sea,
the EAEU and the acceleration of Iran's membership in the SCO. It should
be noted that Russia views its policy towards Iran as a package. In
other words, Russia connects different issues and makes the support of
one issue conditional on receiving concessions on another. For example,
Russia has linked its support in the Vienna talks to the Iranian
ratification of a Convention on the Legal Regime of the Caspian Sea,
signed on August 2018 at the Fifth Summit of the Caspian littoral states
in Aktau, Kazakhstan. Tehran had previously considered Iran's share in
the Caspian Sea to be 50 percent, citing a 1921 Treaty of Friendship and
1940 Soviet--Iranian Trade and Navigation Agreement, but then agreed to
a 20 percent share. Per the median lines formula, Iran's share is
actually about 13 percent. However, based on the Aktau agreement, it
would be 11 percent, according to former Iranian member of parliament
Mahmoud Sadeghi. The agreement benefits Russia by making Moscow the de
facto naval power in the Caspian Sea, granting Russian warships the
right to operate unhindered and barring the US from any military
presence. Russia uses the Iran card to create balance and gain points.
[Whenever Iran's relations with the West improve, Moscow balances with
gestures towards Iran's rivals. On the other hand, **whenever Iran's
relations with the West is bad, Russia approaches Iran and seeks closer
ties.**]{.underline} Despite extensive Iranian-Russian cooperation in
Syria, Moscow doesn't want Iran to have widespread influence in Syria.
Allied Iranian forces stationed near the Golan Heights have retreated
under Russian pressure. Moscow also gives the green light to Tel Aviv
for freedom of action in Syria. Days after Israeli Prime Minister
Naftali Bennett traveled to Moscow and met with President Vladimir
Putin, Israel assassinated two senior IRGC officers on the outskirts of
Damascus in early March. Recent Israeli attacks on the
Iranian-controlled port of Latakia reportedly include covert
Russian-Israeli cooperation in Syria. [Despite Russia's attempts to use
relations for its own benefit and widespread international condemnation
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, **Iran isn't walking away from its
relationship with Moscow**. Iranian officials have refrained from
condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and blamed the crisis on the
United States and expansion of NATO.]{.underline} Raisi, for example,
said on February 24 that he understands Russia's security concerns;
"NATO expansion is a serious threat to the stability and security of
independent states in different regions," the Iranian president told
Putin. In the United Nations General Assembly, [Iran abstained from
voting on a resolution condemning Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. The Raisi government appears committed to the
"look to the East" policy, whatever happens with the JCPOA. [It sees
Russia as a **strategic partner** that is both a **counterweight** to
Western pressure and a pillar for the survival of the Iranian political
system.]{.underline}

in a show of deepening ties between the two nations, united in their
isolation from the West. **Putin met with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's
supreme leader**]{.underline}, and Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi soon
after arriving in Tehran, and then with Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan. Later in the evening, he held talks with both Raisi and
Erdogan, part of his first trip outside the former Soviet Union since
the start of the Ukraine war in February. [Khamenei said the West did
not want Russia to be strong, **describing the United States as
"cunning" and NATO as "dangerous,"**]{.underline} according to Iranian
state media. ["As regards Ukraine, if you did not take the initiative,
the other side would have initiated the war,"]{.underline} IRNA quoted
Khamenei as saying, echoing a common talking point from Putin. [Putin
also **discussed trade, energy, transportation and the conflict in
Syria** in his meeting with Raisi, who is emerging as a key ally of
Moscow.]{.underline} Putin admitted Monday in a meeting with government
officials that Western sanctions had created "colossal" difficulties for
the Russian economy. He has sought to expand trade with China, Asia and
the Middle East to make up for plummeting imports from the West.
[Putin's **only other international trip** since February was late last
month when he flew to Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.]{.underline} In his
meeting with Raisi, he extolled growing trade ties with Iran, sending a
message to his Russian audience that while Western companies have left
the country in droves, Moscow still has reliable friends. "We can boast
of record figures in terms of trade growth," Putin said. [Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia and Iran were used to Western
sanctions, which he called the price of their independence.]{.underline}
"Iran has been under sanctions of various sorts for decades ... which,
as we should point out outright, we view as absolutely illegitimate from
the standpoint of international law," Peskov said in comments to Iranian
media broadcast on Russian state television. He said that [**improving
relations with Iran was "a long-term line of our foreign policy,"**
adding that a strategic cooperation deal will probably be signed in the
coming months.]{.underline} The White House has claimed that Russia
wants to acquire surveillance drones from Iran for use in Ukraine, but
Peskov said this was not on the agenda in Tehran. [The presence of
Erdogan]{.underline}, who has tried to position himself as a mediator
between Moscow and Kyiv, [raised hopes that he **could help build on

Iran\'s nuclear plants. If a nuclear deal is inked, Iran and Russia will
be free to continue building nuclear sites. Sanctioned Russia ships also
have been caught in recent months ferrying illicit Iranian oil,

#### Russia and Iran are working closely together now, the threat of Tehran is magnified by any form of US influence

[This January, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and his Iranian
counterpart Javad Zarif signed a cooperation
[agreement](https://tass.com/politics/1248963) on **cybersecurity** and
information and communications technology (ICT). The agreement
[includes](https://www.c4isrnet.com/thought-leadership/2021/02/08/russia-iran-cooperation-poses-challenges-for-us-cyber-strategy-global-norms/)
cybersecurity cooperation, technology transfer, combined training, and
coordination at multilateral forums, like the United Nations. Although
the cooperation with Moscow outlined in the agreement could
[upgrade](https://www.ynetnews.com/business/article/rk005B5FeO) Tehran's
offensive cyber capabilities, the agreement is largely defensive,
motivated by the countries' shared
[animus](https://carnegie.ru/2016/08/18/russia-and-iran-historic-mistrust-and-contemporary-partnership-pub-64365)
toward the United States and U.S. influence in the Middle East as well
as a desire to reduce dependence on Western technology.]{.underline}
There are limits, however, to how closely the two sides can be expected
to work together. The relationship between Russia and Iran has long
suffered from mutual suspicion, ideological differences, and
competition. Moreover, in the past, Russian and Iranian operators have
operated at cross purposes. For example, in October 2019, British and
U.S. officials
[revealed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-idUSKBN1X00AK)
that the Russian threat actor
[Turla](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/turla) had
[hijacked](https://www.cfr.org/cyber-operations/hijacking-iranian-hacking-infrastructure)
Iranian hacking infrastructure as part of a false-flag operation. Due to
suspicion and conflicting objectives, Cyber cooperation between Moscow
and Tehran is likely to be focused on intelligence sharing and improving
cyber defenses, rather than sharing offensive capabilities. Nonetheless,
[the agreement could pose]{.underline} four [challenges to U.S.
cybe]{.underline}r operations. First, [Russia could help
Iran]{.underline} obtain stronger cyber defense systems. Harvard's
Belfer Center's [National Cyber Power Index
2020](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/2020-09/NCPI_2020.pdf)
\[PDF\] lists Iran as the lowest-scoring nation for cyber defense
capabilities, with Russia ranked in the middle of the countries
surveyed. If **[Tehran addresses these]{.underline}** defensive
deficiencies with the help of Russian technology and training, it could
make U.S. initiatives like [defend
forward](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF)
\[PDF\] more challenging and costly. Second, Iran-Russia cyber
cooperation could entail Russian cyber teams deploying to Iran to
monitor Iranian networks in order to collect insights and identify U.S.
malware, similar to U.S. Cyber Command's "[Hunt
Forward](https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/2433245/hunt-forward-estonia-estonia-us-strengthen-partnership-in-cyber-domain-with-joi/)"
operations. Acquiring and analyzing Cyber Command or National Security
Agency hacking tools and techniques could help improve Russian and
Iranian defenses, thwart future U.S. cyber operations, and force U.S.
hackers to develop new exploits sooner than they hoped. Third, if able
to access Iranian defense systems, Russian hackers could acquire and
**[reverse engineer U.S]{.underline}**. or Israeli
**[malware]{.underline}** that has been used against Iran. This occurred
with **[the Stuxnet worm]{.underline}**, which targeted Iran's nuclear
facilities in 2010 and was attributed to the United States and Israel.
Since then, numerous cyber actors have developed over [22
million](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/stuxnet-returns-striking-iran-with/)
pieces of malware that used Stuxnet's blueprint to target organizations
around the world. Stuxnet eventually infected thousands of networks
globally, so hackers had access to lots of samples, but an attack that
did not become as widely known could still be repurposed if Russia is
able to access Iranian networks. Fourth, technologies and techniques
that Iran acquires from Russia could be provided to Iran's proxies
around the Middle East, including Hezbollah and militias in Iraq and
Yemen. [Some of these groups have already shown considerable hacking
capabilities. In January, security firm ClearSky
[revealed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hezbollahs-cyber-unit-hacked-into-telecoms-and-isps/)
that a Hezbollah-affiliated hacking group named Lebanese Cedar was
involved in an extensive campaign that targeted telecoms and internet
service providers in the **United States, Europe, and Middle East**.
Equipping Iranian proxies with advanced Russian cyber capabilities could
allow them to threaten government agencies, businesses, and U.S.
operations in the Middle East. It could also hamper investigations into
cyber operations conducted by Iranian proxies and lead to misattributing
them to Russia, possibly causing unintended **escalation**. Although the
agreement between Moscow and Tehran could pose challenges for U.S. cyber
strategy, some of its disruptive implications can be mitigated. To
minimize the risk of their hacking]{.underline} tools being repurposed
for use against them, the United States and its allies should establish
a unified vulnerability disclosure mechanism to share vulnerabilities,
including those that have already been exploited, with each other and
vendors. While the United States already has a [vulnerability equities
process](https://www.wired.com/story/vulnerability-equity-process-charter-transparency-concerns/),
other allies seem to have only varying degrees of similar processes, if
at all. Because victims are likely to patch vulnerabilities once they've
been targeted, the attacking country can disclose the vulnerabilities it
used after they've been exploited without weakening its offensive
capabilities. Furthermore, the United States could promote the
responsible development of offensive capabilities by adding
[self-destruct code
modules](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2727776/flame-authors-order-infected-computers-to-remove-all-traces-of-the-malware.html)
to prevent them from being analyzed by adversaries. These modules have
been
[deployed](https://www.neowin.net/news/a-new-virus-will-self-destruct-when-analyzed-by-researchers/)
as part of highly sophisticated malware campaigns in the past and are
designed to overwrite their own file data in order to prevent forensic
analysis. Bottom of Form Establishing a standardized vulnerabilities
disclosure mechanism could take place as part of a broader effort to
strengthen intelligence sharing and security ties between the United
States, Israel, the Gulf States, and possibly other actors in the
region. As cyber cooperation between Russia and Iran grows, leaving it
unchallenged could pose new threats to U.S. security and strategy in the
Middle East.

doctrine](https://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/official_documents/-/asset_publisher/CptICkB6BZ29/content/id/2563163)
encompasses **not only cyber** but information and communications
technology (ICT) more broadly. Such cooperation will help these
authoritarian regimes to continue suppressing internal dissent and to
expand joint efforts to counter the Western goal of preserving an open
and free internet. [According](https://tass.com/politics/1248963) to
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, the deal will allow Russia and
Iran "to coordinate \[their**\] activities** given the growing
importance of cyber issues and their increasing impact on" both
"international relations" and "situations in various countries." Andrei
Krutskikh, Moscow's lead diplomat on information security,
[elaborated](https://iz.ru/1116475/2021-01-26/mid-raskryl-detali-soglasheniia-irana-i-rossii-ob-informatcionnoi-bezopasnosti)
that the agreement stipulates **broad cybersecurity cooperation**,
including coordination of actions, exchange of technologies, training of
specialists, and coordination at the United Nations and other
international organizations. Calling the deal "a milestone" in
Russian-Iranian cyber cooperation, Iran's Foreign Ministry
[said](https://en.mfa.ir/portal/NewsView/625777) that the agreement
envisions "international cooperation including detection" of cyber
intrusions and "coordination ... to ensure national and international
security." This statement suggests that Moscow and Tehran may share
intelligence about U.S. cyber operations, posing new challenges for U.S.
Cyber Command as it seeks to "[defend
forward](https://media.defense.gov/2018/Sep/18/2002041658/-1/-1/1/CYBER_STRATEGY_SUMMARY_FINAL.PDF)"
against foreign cyber threats. Moreover, **stronger Iranian defenses**
may complicate America's ability to use [cyber

did. Last week's agreement follows a preliminary Russian-Iranian cyber
[deal](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2015/06/13/768309/iran-russia-agree-on-cyber-defense-cooperation-official)
in 2015, which the head of Iran's Civil Defense Organization
[said](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2015/06/13/768309/iran-russia-agree-on-cyber-defense-cooperation-official)
was necessary because the two countries face common enemies in
cyberspace. In 2017, Moscow and Tehran signed a [memorandum of
understanding](https://digital.gov.ru/ru/events/36659/) for cooperation
on ICT-related issues, including "internet governance, network
security," and "international internet connection." Under the new
agreement, **Tehran stated**, the two countries will cooperate against
"crimes committed with the use of" ICT, which these authoritarian
regimes define as including political dissent. As with Tehran-Beijing
[cooperation](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-china-national-internet-system-censorship/30820857.html)
on Iran's national internet, Tehran will likely seek to learn from
Moscow's efforts to develop the Russian [surveillance
state](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Web-Struggle-Dictators-Revolutionaries/dp/1610395735)
and so-called "[sovereign
internet](https://dgap.org/sites/default/files/article_pdfs/dgap-analyse_2-2020_epifanova_0.pdf)."]{.underline}
The latter is designed to expand Moscow's [censorship and

cooperation, for example, Moscow offered to help Iran emulate Russia's

project, which allows authorities to track citizens through technologies
such as facial recognition --- something Moscow specifically offered to
provide to Iran. Tehran will also likely seek insights --- and
potentially technology --- from Russia as both nations seek to reduce
their dependence on Western technology. [In 2016, the countries
[agreed](https://digital.gov.ru/ru/events/35486/) to cooperate on
"demonopolizing software" to end "unilateral Western domination" in the
field. For example, Iran may be interested in a Russian

[offered](https://digital.gov.ru/ru/events/36389/) to provide Tehran
with Russian servers built on Russian processors. The new agreement also
builds on existing collaboration in the information sphere. In 2018, at

have converged since the COVID-19 crisis began. In August 2020, that
convergence culminated in a Russian-Iranian
[agreement](https://www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/international_safety/disarmament/-/asset_publisher/rp0fiUBmANaH/content/id/4282475)
to counter what Russia's Foreign Ministry called "increasing information
pressure from the West" designed "to discredit Russia and Iran," as well
as alleged Western discrimination against Russian and Iranian media
abroad. For Russia, last week's agreement is part of a broader effort
that has seen Moscow sign over 30 international [cyber

Western interference**. As analysts at the Institute for the Study of
War (ISW) have
[documented](http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/kremlin-leverages-cyber-cooperation-deals),
Moscow uses these deals to expand its human and institutional networks,
cultivate Russia's image as a trustworthy information security partner,
and promote Kremlin-friendly outlets, narratives, and global information
security norms while countering perceived Western "digital
neocolonialism" and destabilization. The ISW analysts warn that

that U.S. cyber "capabilities are meant to complement, not replace"

for its poor interagency coordination and inefficiency. In a report
released last week, the GAO
[concluded](https://www.gao.gov/assets/720/712040.pdf) that as currently
structured, the State Department may not be able to "effectively set
priorities and allocate appropriate resources to achieve its intended
goals." Given this assessment as well as the expanding cooperation among
U.S. adversaries, the Biden administration and Congress should work
together to better resource and organize the State Department to defend
U.S. values and interests in cyberspace.

MOSCOW --- Sitting across a long table from President Vladimir V. Putin
at a Covid-conscious distance, [President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran reminded
his Russian counterpart on Wednesday that Tehran had been **"resisting
America for 40 years."**]{.underline} And now that Russia was plunging
deeper into its own confrontation with the United States, [Mr. Raisi
told Mr. Putin in televised remarks, **it was time to take on "the power
of the Americans with an increased synergy between our two countries."**
It was a bit of geopolitical theater at the Kremlin at a critical moment
for Washington and its adversaries.]{.underline} Mr. Raisi[, the
hard-line Iranian leader, started a two-day trip to Moscow on Wednesday
designed to showcase **tightening bonds between two countries** with
often-diverging interests and a history of strained
relations]{.underline} --- but, increasingly, along with China, a single
adversary: the United States[. For Mr. Putin, embroiled in a dispute
with the United States over spheres of influence and facing harsh
sanctions if he follows through on a threatened invasion of Ukraine, it
was a chance to show that **Russia has friends it can call on in its
battles with the West.**]{.underline} In keeping with that message, the
visit will include an address by Mr. Raisi to Russia's lower house of
Parliament, a rare honor for a visiting leader. Image Ukrainian soldiers

sanctions, is involved in delicate negotiations to revive the 2015
nuclear accord. [Mr. Raisi nevertheless voiced tacit support for Mr.
Putin in Ukraine, and Iran's foreign minister emphasized that the two
presidents had agreed on the "framework" of an agreement governing
increased economic and military cooperation.]{.underline} Dig deeper
into the moment. Special offer: Subscribe for \$1 a week. No deals were
signed publicly, however, and the extent of the Kremlin's willingness to
sell to Iran more of the modern Russian weaponry that Tehran has long
sought remained unclear. But along with an upcoming naval exercise
combining warships from Russia, Iran and China, the Kremlin appeared
intent on sending a message that it was continuing to foster new ties
that could serve as a counterweight to the West. Iran, too, is signaling
that it also has alternatives if Western sanctions are not lifted. ["On
the international arena, we are cooperating very closely," Mr. Putin
told Mr. Raisi, noting the crises in Syria and Afghanistan, and pledging
to bring Iran closer to the Russia-led trade bloc known as the Eurasian
Economic Union.]{.underline} Russia and Iran still have a host of
differences. Despite years of sanctions, Russia's economy, unlike
Iran's, remains closely integrated with the West. Mr. Putin has worked
to foster close ties with Israel, which Iranian leaders see as an enemy.
And in Vienna, Russia has been working with the United States and Europe
to try to resuscitate faltering negotiations over restoring the deal
restricting Iran's nuclear program. But as Russia's conflict with the
West intensifies, Russian officials are increasingly willing to look
past those differences. Grigory Lukyanov, an international relations
specialist at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said that
Russian officials had grown more aligned in recent years with the more
strident anti-Western stance of some Iranian counterparts. And Mr.
Raisi, an ultraconservative cleric who became president in August, has
spoken out in favor of closer ties to Russia despite skepticism in the
Iranian public. ["This visit is oriented not so much toward the domestic
audience in both countries but, most of all, toward the West," Mr.
Lukyanov said of Mr. Raisi's trip to Moscow.]{.underline} "There are now
more supporters in the Russian leadership of adopting Iran's radical
course, which used to be considered unacceptable in Russia." Russia has
massed some 100,000 troops around Ukraine, while demanding guarantees
that the NATO alliance not expand into Ukraine or elsewhere in Eastern
Europe. Western officials say Mr. Putin could launch an invasion of
Ukraine at any time, and have threatened crushing sanctions against
Russia and new military support to Ukraine if he does so. [Mr. Raisi, in
the public portion of his meeting with Mr. Putin]{.underline}, did not
bring up Ukraine, but [echoed the Kremlin's longtime disdain for the
Western military alliance.]{.underline} Image A Ukrainian soldier on the
front line of Zolote, in the Luhansk province of eastern Ukraine. A

influence under any pretext in the Caucasus and Central Asia is a threat
to the mutual interests of independent countries,"]{.underline} Mr.
Raisi said, according to the Iranian government's account of the
meeting. He was referring to two other regions that were once within the
Soviet Union and that the Kremlin still sees as part of Russia's
rightful sphere of influence. Mr. Raisi's presidency consolidated the
power of a hard-line faction that had criticized the previous centrist
government of President Hassan Rouhani as too accommodating to the West,
aligning Iran more closely with Mr. Putin's stance. Mr. Putin met with
Mr. Raisi despite the Kremlin's intense efforts to shield Mr. Putin from
the coronavirus, with the omicron variant coursing through Moscow. The
two leaders sat some 20 feet apart, and Mr. Putin's spokesman later told
the Russian news media that the seating arrangement was due to "measures
of sanitary necessity." "Neither video conferences nor phone calls can
replace in-person contact --- even like this," Mr. Putin told Mr. Raisi,
pointing at the long table between them. After Wednesday's meeting at
the Kremlin, the Iranian foreign minister, Hossein Amir Abdollahian,
posted on Twitter that the two presidents had "agreed on the framework
of a long-term agreement." In his remarks Wednesday, Mr. Raisi said the
document had been "delivered" to Mr. Putin. "Tehran and Russia relations
entered a new, fast-paced and dynamic path," Mr. Amir Abdollahian said.
["Excellent cooperation will begin in this new phase of relations." The
20-year agreement discussed by Mr. Putin and Mr. Raisi, Iranian
officials said, focuses on technology transfers from Russia, the
purchase of Russian military equipment and Russian investments in
Iranian energy infrastructure. Iran has said the agreement would be
modeled after a sweeping economic and security deal signed in September
between Iran and China.]{.underline} Under that agreement, China will
invest nearly \$400 billion in a wide range of projects in Iran in
exchange for discounted oil for two decades. "We are definitely pursuing
a long-term agreement with Russia because it is a necessity," Mahmoud
Shoori, deputy director of the Institute for Iran and Eurasian Studies
in Tehran, said in a phone interview. ["More important than economic
partnership with Russia is a military and intelligence
alliance."]{.underline}

[Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, which triggered Europe's first
major conflict since the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, marks a watershed in
the continent's post-Cold War history. The conflict poses significant
security challenges for countries throughout Eurasia and
beyond,]{.underline} and has given rise to unexpected changes in
long-established European foreign and security policy paradigms toward
autocracies, as the case of Germany illustrates. Iran is by no means
immune to the geopolitical changes underway. Before the war on Ukraine
broke out, after almost a year of back-and-forth diplomatic efforts in
Vienna, the Iran nuclear negotiations seemed poised to revive the 2015
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). [The invasion, which caught
many in the West by surprise, initially led Tehran and Moscow to
seemingly modify their positions, giving rise to widespread uncertainty
over the talks and even fears of their collapse.]{.underline} As of late
March, however, the talks appear to be back on track and are expected to
lead to a deal soon. Beyond the JCPOA, the New Cold War pitting Vladimir
Putin's Russia against the transatlantic alliance has also re-energized
debates within Iran about its implications for the country's standing in
the world order. [In this context, it is crucial to analyze Iran's
domestic discourse about its powerful Russian partner --- some might say
overlord --- and its relationship with the leadership in
Tehran.]{.underline} Iranian reactions to Russia\'s invasion and Moscow
acting as overlord Tehran's geopolitical hopes [The Islamic Republic of
Iran's official reaction to the Russian invasion, both by state media
and officials, echoed Moscow's war propaganda, all while paying lip
service to "the preservation of the territorial integrity and national
sovereignty of all countries" (in the words of President Ebrahim
Raisi).]{.underline} In most cases, the invasion was described as a
Russian "special operation" provoked by the eastward expansion of the
U.S.-led NATO alliance. From this viewpoint, Russia is simply
safeguarding its security in the face of decades of destabilizing
Western expansionism. This narrative has been promoted by key Iranian
media outlets (affiliated with the state and the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps or IRGC) and representatives (including the supreme leader,
president, minister of intelligence, and the Tehran Friday prayer imam).
[Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they argue, constitutes a necessary act
of resistance against Western/NATO aggression, so blame for the present
escalation lies squarely with the latter. By defending Russia, they
implicitly justify Iran's own offensive regional posture, known as
"forward defense," which Tehran similarly likes to portray as a
legitimate reaction to equally destabilizing U.S. expansionism in its
near abroad.]{.underline} From this elite group's perspective, [Russia's
move against Ukraine in the face of Western hesitation is in line with
Tehran's own interests and overlaps with an Iranian grand strategy of
confronting the U.S. and projecting power in the Middle East and
beyond.]{.underline} Western reluctance to intervene, especially
militarily, poignantly signals the decline of U.S. power. The image of
America's military prowess had already been undermined by the fiasco of
the Afghanistan withdrawal last fall and other West Asian quagmires in
which the U.S. and its allies failed to overcome Iran-allied groups. In
sum, these misadventures left Washington bereft of its superpower status
in international relations.

[The significant escalation in the Ukraine crisis comes as consequential
talks in Vienna to restore Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers
have entered their "**endgame**", according to diplomats]{.underline}.
[The United States in 2018 unilaterally abandoned the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known,
imposing harsh sanctions. In response, Tehran has since 2019
significantly advanced its nuclear programme while maintaining it is
strictly peaceful.]{.underline} Seyed Mostafa Khoshcheshm, [a
Tehran-based Iran affairs analyst]{.underline} currently focused on the
Vienna talks, [said]{.underline} the Ukraine war has just started and
would require more time to directly affect the talks in the Austrian
capital. But he told Al Jazeera [both Ukraine and JCPOA are security
issues and "**crises that have been manufactured by the
US**".]{.underline} "[It appears this will ultimately **lead to Russia
getting closer to Iran** and expand its support of Iran]{.underline},"
Khoshcheshm said, adding this could include closer economic cooperation
despite US sanctions, since Russia is now heavily sanctioned by the
West. [The analyst said the Ukraine crisis could also lead to closer
security and military cooperation between Iran and Russia, especially in
**Syria**.]{.underline} He pointed out that Israel had built strong ties
with Russia, but its support of the Western bloc on Ukraine could
endanger that.

for Russia]{.underline}. The trip will follow President Biden's tour of
the Middle East this week, where Iran and its nuclear program were main
topics of discussion. [The relationship between Moscow and Tehran
stretches back centuries and has often been fraught. Iranians still
recall the territory that the Persian Empire had to cede to Russia's
czar in the early 19th century.]{.underline} Today the two countries
find themselves in the club of nations hit by sanctions and shunned by
the West. To learn more about the relationship, I spoke to Farnaz
Fassihi, a Times journalist who covers the U.N. and is an expert on the
Middle East. Our conversation has been lightly edited. [How has the war
changed relations between the two countries? **Before**, Iran and Russia
had an alliance that was much more tactical than strategic. Iran really
always wanted to develop this relationship. But because Russia had
economic dealings with the West, Russia was always keeping Iran at arm's
length. **The war in Ukraine changed that**. Russia now faces
international isolation, so it needs to figure out how to skirt
sanctions. So it's looking at Iran, a country with a lot of expertise on
getting around sanctions. Iran sees an **opportunity to get closer to
Russia**. And Russia now sees Iran as an important ally that could help
it sell oil and energy and avoid sanctions.]{.underline}

Finland and Sweden\'s green light to join NATO is set to bring about the
U.S.-led Western military alliance\'s largest expansion in decades.
Meanwhile, [the G7, consisting of NATO states and fellow U.S. ally
Japan, has adopted a tougher line against Russia and China. In the East,
however, security and economy-focused blocs led by Beijing and **Moscow
are looking to take on new members of their own, including Iran** and
Saudi Arabia, two influential Middle Eastern rivals whose interest in
shoring up cooperation on this new front could have a significant impact
on global geopolitical balance.]{.underline} The two bodies in question
are the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and BRICS. The former
was established in 2001 as a six-member political, economic and military
coalition including China, Russia and the Central Asian states of
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before recruiting South Asian
nemeses India and Pakistan in 2017, while the latter is a grouping of
emerging economic powers originally consisting of Brazil, Russia, India
and China (BRIC) upon its inception 2006, and including South Africa in
2010. [\"**The BRICS and the SCO share one important ideological
quality: they are both focused on multipolarity**]{.underline}, and
their summits have even been held back to back with one another at
times,\" Matthew Neapole, an international affairs expert and
contributor to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Canada, told Newsweek.
[\"Both are angling to act as force multipliers for this drive for
multipolarity, to help along with alternatives \[i.e, in currency or
banking\],\" he added. \"It could, in theory, facilitate economic
linkages and step into gaps that U.S. institutions are not filling due
to sanctions, such as those laid on Russia.\"]{.underline} Iran, already
an SCO observer, began its formal membership ascension process amid the
latest leaders\' summit in September. [On Monday, **the Iranian Foreign
Ministry announced the Islamic Republic would also seek to join
BRICS**.]{.underline} Across the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia has also
reportedly considered applying for BRICS membership, as revealed by
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov during his visit to the kingdom
in late May. The announcement followed Saudi Arabia joining Argentina,
Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Senegal, Thailand and the United
Arab Emirates at China\'s invitation for a \"BRICS+\" discussion, after
which Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced
members had \"reached consensus on the BRICS expansion process.\" Of
these candidates, Argentina has already applied for membership,
potentially advancing the group\'s status toward being a major player in
international economic relations. And with the SCO seeking to grow as
well, Beijing and Moscow might be poised to advance their effort to sway
the international influence equilibrium toward a broader group of
countries that do not necessarily sign on to an explicitly U.S.-led
international order. And while Neapole argued that there would be \"big
hurdles to get over\" in trying to transform this vision from ambitious
talk to substantive action, he said a cohesive SCO-BRICS bloc could have
a huge impact on reshaping the world order. [\"If it can be successful
in positioning itself as the standard-bearer of the Global South or G20,
develop strong organizational mechanisms and integrate more
thoroughly,\" he said, \"it could be quite influential.\" **BRICS\'
multipolar approach to international affairs has proven attractive to
both Iran and Saudi Arabia alike.**]{.underline} The two nations,
however, have their own unique reasons for seeking membership. For
Riyadh, the move would likely be less about choosing sides against the
close ties it has fostered for decades with Washington and more about
the kingdom\'s own growing status as an independent player.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/08/putin-suleimani-russia-iran/

Since its pivotal intervention in the Syrian civil war in 2015, [Russia
has sought to position itself as a major player in the Middle East,
establishing itself as a rare broker that is on good terms with all of
the region's feuding powers. **Now Moscow has a fresh chance to solidify
that reputation**]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir [Putin will
look to boost his country's standing in the Middle East following the
Trump administration's decision to assassinate]{.underline} the Iranian
military leader Qassem [Suleimani]{.underline} last week [and Iran's
missile attack against U.S. air bases in Iraq]{.underline} on Tuesday,
[which have roiled the Middle East and pushed Iran and the United States
to the brink of war]{.underline}. **[The escalating situation raises the
stakes for Moscow's calculus in the region significantly, but it also
provides Putin with new opportunities to achieve two of his
long-standing goals: undermining U.S. credibility and expanding Russia's
footprint across the Middle East]{.underline}**. "**[Putin sees pushing
back against U.S. unilateralism as a personal mission and he is
extremely opportunistic]{.underline}**. **[He will therefore seek to
capitalize on every opportunity he can to use the assassination of
Suleimani and any ensuing instability to tarnish Washington's reputation
in the region]{.underline}**," said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior
fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank who
previously served as deputy national intelligence officer for Russia and
Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council. The killing sparked a
flurry of diplomatic activity from Moscow. In phone calls with his
American, Iranian, Chinese, and Turkish counterparts, Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov condemned the killing and characterized it as a
gross violation of international law. On Tuesday, Putin made an
impromptu visit to Damascus to meet with Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad and shore up Moscow's patronage. "The last thing Putin wants is
to have to pick a side in the Middle East," said Anna Borshchevskaya, a
senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a
Washington-based think tank. "His best card is as a mediator and I
suspect they are in a wait-and-see mode now. If Russia does something
major, it will be diplomatically." On Wednesday, Putin traveled to
Istanbul to meet with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to discuss
escalating tensions in the Middle East. Despite not always seeing eye to
eye on the future of the region, Erdogan and Putin have managed to cut
deals in the past, such as when both leaders agreed to effectively carve
up northeastern Syria last year following the Trump administration's
unexpected withdrawal. On Saturday, Putin will welcome German Chancellor
Angela Merkel to Moscow for talks about the crisis. Both Russia and
Germany are among the countries that have sought to prop up the Iranian
nuclear deal following the U.S. withdrawal from the agreement in 2018.
**[The killing of]{.underline}** the Quds Force leader
**[Suleimani]{.underline}** in a U.S. drone strike at the Baghdad
airport on Jan. 3 **[will likely stress test Moscow's ability to be a
friend to all major players in the region]{.underline}**. [Russia and
Iran have developed deep ties in recent years, working together in Syria
to tilt the balance of power in favor of the Assad regime]{.underline}.
Despite their shared interests, Moscow has simultaneously pursued deeper
ties with Israel and Saudi Arabia, Tehran's foes, as well as with other
players across the region. "**[Moscow is trying to play this role as a
reliable and stable player in the Middle East and this certainly helps
its cause]{.underline}**," said Julia Sveshnikova, a Middle East expert
and consultant at the PIR Center, a Moscow think tank. "**[But Moscow is
also very concerned about this situation and will be looking to stay out
of the fray as much as possible]{.underline}**." **[The Trump
administration's decision to assassinate a high-ranking official caught
many countries around the world off guard and undermined U.S.
credibility in the Middle East, an opening that Moscow will be looking
to capitalize on]{.underline}**. **[The Kremlin has long proven adept at
exploiting crises around the world to advance its strategic objectives,
from Ukraine to North Africa to Syria]{.underline}**. **[Washington has
slapped Russia with sanctions for its intervention in eastern Ukraine
and the annexation of Crimea, but the Kremlin has long pointed to the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as evidence of U.S. hypocrisy and will
likely use Suleimani's killing]{.underline}** and Trump's call to target
Iranian cultural sites **[as further evidence of U.S. overreach while
furthering its own standing as a regional power broker.]{.underline}**
While many of the United States' regional allies may privately welcome
Suleimani's demise, many also feared that they may bear the brunt of
Iran's retaliation. Those fears may have been allayed slightly as Iran
responded to the killing of its general by firing over a dozen missiles
at U.S. military and coalition forces in Iraq. [Early reports suggested
that there were no U.S. casualties, and both sides showed signs that
they wanted to de-escalate the situation. **U.S. allies in the region
may be breathing a sigh of relief, but if they conclude that Washington
had left them exposed to Iranian retaliation, it could encourage a pivot
toward Moscow for future mediation.**]{.underline} The last months of
2019 were marked by a wave of anti-Iranian protests in Iraq and Lebanon,
and for a moment it looked as if Tehran's potent influence in the region
may be starting to fray. But the Jan. 3 airstrike brought anti-American
sentiment in the region to the fore once more, a shift that will
undoubtedly be welcomed by Moscow. "**[As much as Putin may have wanted
\[a rise in anti-American sentiment\] to occur, Russia could not have
brought it about on its own]{.underline}**," said Mark Katz, a professor
of politics and government at George Mason University. "**[But Trump has
done it for him]{.underline}**."

### 2NC -- Link -- NATO Key

#### Relations are zero sum -- Russia must chose NATO or Iran

Lt. Col. Gordon B. **Hendrickson '05**, Atlantic Council Senior Fellow,
"The Future of NATO-Russian Relations: Or, How to Dance with a Bear and
Not Get Mauled", The Atlantic Council, December 2005,
https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/46291/2005_12_The_Future_of_NATO-Russia_Relations.pdf

[Russia is now more readily acknowledging, at least publicly, the value
of NATO and of closer relations with the Alliance]{.underline}.
Ambassador Anatoly Adamishin, President of the Russian Association for
Euro-Atlantic Cooperation, recently affirmed this view when he opined
that NATO-Russian relations are currently exemplary, despite some
disagreements. As he pointed out, [Russia must "have an alliance with
the Alliance" and any quarrels between the two must be settled without
taking sides.]{.underline} He put it plainly when he said, "NATO is
necessary." The challenge, he said, is to avoid tackling new problems
with old, obsolete methods.105 **[It is vital for the Alliance to
encourage this view and to keep Russia engaged with the
West]{.underline}**. **[Without a continuation of strong, active, and
regular engagement from NATO]{.underline}** and other important Western
institutions, such as the EU, **[Russia naturally will look for support,
security and prosperity from other sources, such as China, India, and
even Iran, if they offer much-needed economic capital for
Russia]{.underline}**. **[NATO's European members will be particularly
key players in this regard]{.underline}**, both multilaterally and even
bilaterally, as Moscow looks more and more toward integration into
European institutions and seeks to regain what it considers its
rightful, prominent role on the continent. **[Without such continued
active engagement, NATO could face a hardening of Russian attitudes
toward the West]{.underline}**. The likely result would be for Russia to
close more of its society and become even more secretive than it already
is, clearly a step backward from the Alliance's goal of transparency.
[NATO has to avoid these pitfalls, insofar as it can possibly influence
them]{.underline}. Above all, **[NATO should avoid marginalizing Russia,
which will take creativity as NATO's borders expand further eastward
toward Russia's]{.underline}**. The Alliance could encourage a more
active Russian role in the PfP, include more Russian officers in
technical ventures such as joint exercises and force planning, and even
possibly integrate Russia into its own efforts at military reform.106
**[One thing NATO leaders can count on is that as NATO expands its
membership, especially to the east, Russia will continue to look more to
other nations to establish or strengthen other alliances and
partnerships in response]{.underline}**. **[NATO's leaders also must
keep in mind that words matter to the Russians]{.underline}**. **[The
details and exact wording of international treaties, agreements, and
even simple diplomatic notes matter]{.underline}**. The author saw this
repeatedly during his time in Moscow, when reaching agreement on the
seemingly smallest details sometimes took excruciating lengths of time.
**[In the Russian view, the spirit and intent of an agreement cannot
necessarily be proven---only that which is written can be
proven]{.underline}**. [Accurate words also prevent a subsequent
administration or government from changing the intent of an agreement
without resorting to formal channels]{.underline}. **[Russian leaders
believe they can avoid being cheated or taken advantage of by correctly
spelling out everything]{.underline}**. Conversely, they do not see a
problem in taking advantage of loopholes in treaties and agreements, if
the letter of the law is not violated. In their view, it is perfectly
fair, even if it might violate the intent of the law. Otherwise, their
treaty partner should have seen this possibility and guarded against it.
The moral: Whenever Alliance leaders can join formally with Russia in an
activity or partnership, they should do it. [Close, honest and
transparent dialogue is critical to NATO success in continuing to engage
Russia, and the NRC definitely has been a step in the right
direction]{.underline}. Fortunately, the Alliance has recognized this,
and should do everything it possibly can to encourage dialogue.
Ambassador Maurizio Moreno, Italian Permanent Representative to the
North Atlantic Council, recently commented on the importance of dialogue
regarding NATO's new history in its relations with Russia. In his view,
Russia is now an equal partner and the process within the NRC is working
well, even on sensitive issues such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Georgia, and
the recent Ukrainian presidential election. [Although there are natural
differences of opinions, and even some differences between NATO and
Russian values, he believes the two sides can work successfully through
these challenges]{.underline}. According to Moreno, "there are values we
can share" and he stated that we have done so recently through the NRC.
Although Russia has not joined NATO, and most likely will not, in his
view there is still the definite possibility for beneficial and
productive dialogue.107 Former NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson
captured the essence of NATO's success in the NRC when he presciently
stated in 2002, "[the real difference between '19+1' and '20' is not a
question of mathematics, but one of chemistry: the success of the
NATO-Russia Council will depend on the political will of the
participants]{.underline}." Based on the apparent willingness of both
sides to make it work, he believed "the prospects for a genuinely new
quality in NATO-Russia relations appear bright."108 Thus far, his belief
in the NRC's prospects has proven well founded. Now[, it is up to
Alliance and Russian leaders to ensure that chemistry remains strong and
positive. This will undoubtedly require a skillful mix of patient
dialogue combined at times with more forceful pressure, without
resorting to confrontation]{.underline}. As history has shown,
confrontation, demands, and ultimatums will accomplish very little with
Russia (as indeed, these tactics accomplish little with any country).
**[The best prospects for NATO-Russia relations will result from NATO
leaders honestly listening to and considering Russian views, even if in
the end Moscow does not like the answer.]{.underline}** To the extent
possible, NATO must avoid marginalizing Russia.

#### Russia's perception of NATO is key -- doesn't see them as an economic partner in the squo which pushes them to Iran

[Leading intelligence experts also highlight the importance of a strong
Russian economy to the security of Europe, and of the role Europe can
play in drawing Russia closer]{.underline}. In their view, **[if Russia
knows Western Europe wants to forge a "special relationship" with a
Russia that is economically stronger, Moscow is more likely to be
tolerant of former Soviet states moving closer to
Europe]{.underline}**.103 **[Such a closer relationship to European
institutions and structures would also provide Russia a vital
counterweight to the strong economic lure of weapons of mass destruction
and other weapons proliferation, as well as reducing its perceived need
for growing ties with other regions and countries, such as China, India,
and Iran]{.underline}**. President Putin has made clear this Russian
need and desire for further development, stating shortly after his
re-election in March 2004, [The main goal of our policy is not to
demonstrate some or other imperial ambitions, but rather to secure
favorable external conditions for the development of
Russia]{.underline}. There is nothing unusual in that. And we will be
building a multi-vector foreign policy, we will work together with the
United State, the European Union, and with individual countries of
Europe. We will work together with our Asian partners, with China,
India, and with countries of the Asia-Pacific region.104 As a result,
**[the support of NATO]{.underline}** and other Western institutions
**[takes on vital importance in keeping Russia positively engaged in and
cooperating with the rest of Europe.]{.underline}**

its support of Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War. [Tehran has consistently

\"[Maintaining the political unity and territorial integrity of Syria,

Tayyip Erdogan said during a televised meeting with his Iranian and
Russian counterparts on Syria on Wednesday. \"We\'ll continue to do our
best to provide peace, security, and stability in our neighbour Syria,\"
he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin denounced the United States
for imposing new sanctions on Syria\'s regime during the coronavirus
pandemic. \"Despite the call from the UN secretary general to ease
sanctions under pandemic conditions, Washington, like Brussels, decided
to prolong measures against Syria,\" Putin said in his speech. \"In
addition, new sanctions presumably aimed at economically suffocating
Syria have been adopted,\" he said. **[Putin told his counterparts that
there was a need for peaceful dialogue between warring sides in Syria
and that \"hot spots of terrorism\" still remain in Syria\'s Idlib and
other regions.]{.underline}** \"[An inclusive inter-Syrian dialogue
should be actively promoted within the framework of the constitutional
committee in Geneva. I propose to support this process, to help the
participants to meet and start a direct dialogue]{.underline},\" Putin
said. Rouhani: No military solution for Syria \"[The Islamic Republic
believes the only solution to the Syrian crisis is political and not a
military solution]{.underline},\" Rouhani said in a televised opening
address. \"We continue to support the inter-Syrian dialogue and
underline our determination to fight the terrorism of Daesh, Al Qaeda,
and other related groups.\" \"I emphasise that the fight against
terrorism will continue until it is completely eradicated in Syria and
the region in general,\" he added. **[Astana talks]{.underline}** After
delivering opening statements, [the three presidents discussed Syria in
private and also released a joint declaration]{.underline}. [The talks
are the first since September in the so-called Astana format, in which

### 2NC -- Syria Impact -- Brink

#### Ukraine put Russia's involvement in Syria on the [brink]{.underline}. 

Dr Haid **Haid 6/22**, a Syrian columnist and a consulting associate
fellow of Chatham House's Middle East and North Africa program,
6/22/2022, "Russia maintains grip on Syria while mired in Ukraine,"
<https://www.timesnownews.com/columns/russia-maintains-grip-on-syria-while-mired-in-ukraine-article-92374069>,
RES

In late February, [when Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine, regional analysts began speculating how the fighting would
impact Moscow's military presence in Syria]{.underline}. The guesswork
didn't last long. [Faced with unexpected resilience from Ukraine's army,
Russia reportedly began to withdraw infantry, aviation, and engineering
units from various parts of Syria. As a result, many assumed that
Moscow's willingness -- or even its ability -- to support Syrian
President Bashar Al Assad had been wounded by overextension in Ukraine.
The conclusion: Russia's military role in Syria would be significantly
decreased. **But** recent developments on the ground tell a **much
different story**. In addition to reinforcing its forces in northern
Syria in response to Turkish threats of a cross-border military
operation, Moscow is carrying out operations as before with joint air
force drills with Damascus over the war-torn country, and humanitarian
aid to people in Sweida and Hassakeh. Taken together, these activities
suggest that despite decreasing its presence in Syria, Russia is
determined to mobilize its forces there to **maintain its means of
influence**.]{.underline} Since September 2015, an estimated 63,000
Russian military personnel have been deployed to Syria. While the number
of soldiers currently stationed in the country is likely much lower,
what's important to recognize is that [Moscow doesn't actually need to
keep many troops there to maintain **operational
advantage**]{.underline}. That's because the level of [active fighting
has dramatically decreased since March 2020]{.underline}, after the
ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey in Idlib. With somewhat frozen
frontlines, [Russia can recall units from Syria without fear of pushback
from opposition forces. A **more accurate** measure of Russia's
influence in Syria is its **ability to stabilise** the fractured north,
and so far, Moscow's war in Ukraine has had **little effect** on that
mission. In fact, Russia has **increased its activities** in the
northern part of the country to deter Turkey from carrying out a new
military operation against Kurdish factions based there.]{.underline} In
late May, Moscow deployed soldiers, six Ka-52 "Alligator" attack
helicopters, and two Su-34 fighter bombers to the Qamishli airport,
according to Syrian media. It also deployed military convoys with dozens
of vehicles to the cities of Manbij and Tel Rifaat. More importantly,
[Russia has increased its air force activities over the Syria-Turkey
border]{.underline} as well as the frontlines in Hassakeh and Aleppo
governorates. The aim of these activities is to ensure that [a new
Turkish offensive cannot take place without a green light from
Moscow.]{.underline} Meanwhile, Moscow remains engaged in mediating
between the Syrian regime and Kurdish fighters in the northeast. Despite
the absence of active hostilities between Damascus and Kurdish soldiers,
clashes are still common in the region, and Russia's ability to ease
tensions is often tested. [The latest round of Russian-led negotiations
occurred in April, when Russia succeeded in getting rival Kurdish and
Syrian government forces to lift sieges held against each other. The
deal demonstrates Moscow's continued **ability to act as a
mediator**.]{.underline} Russia also appears [determined to stand
between Iran and Israel to prevent any escalation between those two
states]{.underline}. For instance, Russia has allowed Israeli warplanes
to use Syrian airspace to target Iranian-linked sites and arms shipments
in Syria. Russia has also continued to prevent Iran from deploying its
allies close to Israel's borders. At the same time, however, [Russia has
pressured Israel to limit airstrikes in Syria]{.underline}, in deference
to Iran's interests; reportedly fired S-300 missiles at Israeli jets
over Syria; and carried out joint patrols along the occupied Golan
Heights in simulated confrontation with "hostile" warplanes and drones.
Beyond its military presence, [Russia's ability to influence events in
Syria is contingent on the financial support it provides to allied
militias]{.underline}. While information about Russia's funding to local
militias in Syria is scant, according to Syrian news websites, Moscow
does appear to have transferred roughly \$250,000 in May to pay some
16,000 fighters affiliated with local armed groups. [How long this
support will last is unclear. Financial difficulties caused by the war
in Ukraine could **hamper** Moscow's ability to continue funding a
second war effort.]{.underline} [If Russian money dries up, some
militias might agree to be paid by Iran or the Syrian regime, but former
rebels in the south operating under the umbrella of the Fifth Corps,
which remains hostile to Tehran and Damascus, are unlikely to do so
peacefully. Such a development could further destabilize southern Syria,
which in turn would threaten Jordan's national security across the
border through a new wave of refugees and smuggling. Hence, Russia's
continued involvement in Syria has **security implications** beyond the
troubled north. Moscow's shifting role in Syria will remain a topic of
intense regional speculation. But while the war in Ukraine is stretching
Russia's military capacity and altering its strategic priorities, it's
hard to imagine any scenario in which Moscow completely abandons its
role in maintaining Syria's fragile status quo. On the contrary,
Russia's Ukraine-fueled withdrawal from Syria, once eagerly predicted,
now seems like wistful conjecture.]{.underline}

[A senior Syrian official warned world powers of the potential of
militant groups gaining access to **nuclear weapons** as a war at home
worsened among both domestic and international forces.]{.underline}
Bassam Sabbagh, Syria\'s permanent representative to the United Nations
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told an agency gathering on
Tuesday that \"[the issue of nuclear security has emerged during the
past decade as an important issue that calls the attention of the
international community and that the convening of this conference for
the third time reflects the increasing importance of nuclear security as
a common **global area of concern**]{.underline},\" according to the
official Syrian Arab News Agency. [The diplomat argued that criminal or
**\"terrorist\" groups** could potentially get their hands on and use
nuclear or radioactive material to advance their agendas, presenting a
**major threat to global security**, especially as borders are
increasingly violated and cyberwarfare becomes increasingly
commonplace.]{.underline} He invited foreign delegates to visit Syria
and pool their efforts against such risks. Though a nearly nine-year
nationwide civil war has calmed in many parts of the country, it has
intensified in the northwest in recent months. Here, failing cease-fires
between Russia and Turkey have given way to a government offensive in
Idlib, the last province largely under the control of rebels and jihadis
battling overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Despite Moscow\'s efforts
to prevent direct hostilities between the forces of Ankara and Damascus,
recent deadly exchanges [threatened to **erupt into a wider conflict**

In June 1914, the [assassination of]{.underline} Austria's Archduke
[Ferdinand triggered a chain of events that led to World War I
and]{.underline} the eventual [loss of more than 30 million
lives.]{.underline}

The **[escalating rhetoric]{.underline}** [today regarding
Syria]{.underline} and Hong Kong [has]{.underline} the [potential to
turn **dangerously high-risk** conflicts into **tripwires**, which would
set off **confrontations** that]{.underline} could [spread **across the
globe**]{.underline}.

[Why are so many people willing to risk starting **World War
III**]{.underline}? It's a question we should ponder in all seriousness.

With regard to Syria, the [Russians are]{.underline} being [pulled
**deeper**]{.underline} [into that region and]{.underline} soon **[will
draw bright "red lines"]{.underline}** [that must never be
crossed.]{.underline} In Hong Kong, the authoritarian government of the
People's Republic of China soon may make those lines blood red.

**[This is not a game.]{.underline}** [It's not an academic exercise, or
a Hollywood movie. There will be no referees to throw a flag, no
professors to give a do-over, and no rewrites with happy endings.
Russia]{.underline} and China [are]{.underline} two dictatorial,
[ruthless regimes rapidly reaching the point where they no longer will
negotiate or cave to U.S. demands.]{.underline}

[In the worlds they rule, to cave]{.underline} in to populist
[pressure]{.underline} regarding "rights and liberty for all"
[is]{.underline} tantamount to [a **self-inflicted death**
sentence.]{.underline}

If pushed into a corner, [they will spring out]{.underline} in a
**[vicious attack]{.underline}** [to protect that which they cannot lose
--- even if such an attack steps directly upon the
tripwire.]{.underline} That should petrify us all.

"Stand with Hong Kong" is the slogan of the moment for those looking to
put a dictatorial government in its place. But it also has become a
cottage industry, with potential to make millions of dollars for
entrepreneurs who are happy to profit off millennials protesting from
the safety of cities other than Hong Kong. In a perfect world, we all
want to stand with Hong Kong in its aim to remain free of China's
aggressive overreach. But our world not only is far from perfect, it's
getting more dangerous by the day. Protesters, celebrities,
self-absorbed media personalities and U.S. politicians are conveniently
"outraged" that the National Basketball Association, Hollywood, certain
corporations and a long list of others might put profit before the
oppressed people of Hong Kong. In a perfect world, that would never
happen. In the real world we inhabit, it has been going on since the
first days of commerce and profit. Nazi Germany benefitted from such
deals with the devil, as have rogue nations and tyrants before and
since. Is it right? No. Will it ever stop? Not as long as human
frailties and greed exist. I suspect that most people who order Stand
with Hong Kong t-shirts have no idea of what they are protesting. In a
nutshell, the protests in Hong Kong started in June against proposals to
allow extradition to mainland China. The city leaders of Hong Kong soon
agreed to suspend the extradition bill, but the protesters then demanded
"full democracy" for Hong Kong. Full democracy, for a city in a
communist nation. For those who might not remember, in 1997 Britain
returned control of Hong Kong to the communist government of China. The
communist leaders recognized that Hong Kong had been Westernized to a
large extent and, even though it was now under their rule, they allowed
it to retain more rights and autonomy than in the mainland, a hybrid
government known as "one country, two systems." With all of the flaws
--- and outright atrocities --- associated with the leadership of the
People's Republic of China, Hong Kong was a functioning first-world city
in many ways. We all want full democracy for every human being,
everywhere on earth. But what price are we willing to pay to try to
force that to happen in totalitarian nations and rogue states? Hong Kong
is, in fact, a city of communist China. Will the protesters around the
world next demand full democracy for Beijing? Will they travel to North
Korea and demand it for Pyongyang? What about Damascus --- will they
travel there to march in the streets against Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad and his Russian protectors?

[**Conflicts** and **wars** in the Middle East have been **bottomless
pits** of quicksand that]{.underline} have [suck]{.underline}ed the
[life out of]{.underline} invading or protecting [nations]{.underline}
for centuries. The [situation in **Syria** regarding the Kurds is now a
**pressure-cooker** put on fast-boil by **Turkey's incursion** and
**Russia's actions**.]{.underline} What price are we willing to pay if
that top blows off, or if we nudge that top off?

Words are cheap but [lives are precious.]{.underline} There is evil in
the world, and people who foster and control such evil. Sometimes, as
with Hitler and the Nazis, such evil must be confronted at any cost in a
quest to stop it.

This is not about appeasing such evil. It is about knowing the
differences and enacting policies commensurate with the crime or the
threat. Hong Kong and [Syria could be tripwires for the truly
unimaginable]{.underline}. Our [leaders must recognize that reality and
act accordingly.]{.underline}

plenty of reservations about Moscow's ability to deliver on its economic
promises to Iran. [With Iran and Russia both large exporters of oil and

Fronts For Russia: How Washington Will Fan The Flames of Chaos In
Central Asia." Information Clearinghouse. February 23.
<http://tinyurl.com/pn3kpgy>.

Method of destruction

[The first way to destabilize Central Asia is to create **problems on
the borders**]{.underline}, along with the threat that Mujahideen will
penetrate the region. The testing of the neighbours has already started;
problems have arisen in Turkmenistan, which has even had to ask Kabul to
hold large-scale military operations in the border provinces. Tajikistan
has forced the Taliban to negotiate the release of the border guards it
abducted, and the Tajik border service reports that there is a large
group of Mujahideen on its borders.

In general, all the countries bordering Afghanistan have stepped up
their border security.

[The second way is to send **Islamists** behind the lines]{.underline}.
The process has already begun: the number of extremists in Tajikistan
alone grew three-fold last year; however, even though they are being
caught, it obviously will not be feasible to catch all of them.
Furthermore, the situation is aggravated by the return of migrant
workers from Russia, which will expand the recruiting base. If the
stream of remittances from Russia dries up, the outcome may be popular
discontent and managed riots.

Kyrgyz expert Kadir Malikov reports that \$70 million has been allocated
to the IS military group Maverenahr, which includes representatives of
all the Central Asian republics, to carry out acts of terrorism in the
region. Special emphasis is placed on the Fergana Valley as the heart of
Central Asia.\
Another point of vulnerability is Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections,
scheduled for this fall. The initiation of a new set of color
revolutions will lead to chaos and the disintegration of countries.

Self-supporting wars

Waging war is expensive, so the destabilization of the region must be
self-supporting or at least profitable for the U.S. military-industrial
complex. And in this area Washington has had some success: it has given
Uzbekistan 328 armored vehicles that Kiev had requested for its war with
Novorossiya. At first glance, the deal isn't profitable because the
machines were a gift, but in reality Uzbekistan will be tied to U.S.
spare parts and ammunition. Washington made a similar decision on the
transfer of equipment and weapons to Islamabad.

But the United States has not been successful in its attempts to impose
its weapons systems on India: the Indians have not signed any contracts,
and Obama was shown Russian military hardware when he attended a
military parade.

Thus the United States is drawing the countries in the region into war
with its own prot칠g칠s -- the Taliban and Islamic State -- and at the
same time is supplying its enemies with weapons.

So [2015 will be marked by preparations for widespread **destabilization
in Central Asia**]{.underline} and the transformation of AfPak into an
Islamic State subsidiary [on the borders of **Russia, India, China, and
Iran**]{.underline}. The start of **[full-scale war]{.underline}**,
[which will inevitably follow once chaos engulfs the
region]{.underline}, [will lead to a bloodbath in the "Eurasian
Balkans," automatically involving more than a third of the world's
population and almost all the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[geopolitical rivals. It's an opportunity **Washington** will find too
good to miss.]{.underline}

Russia's response to this challenge has to be multifaceted: involving
the region in the process of Eurasian integration, providing military,
economic, and political assistance, working closely with its allies in
the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS, strengthening the
Pakistani army, and of course assisting with the capture of the bearded
servants of the Caliphate.

But the most important response should be the accelerated modernization
of its armed forces as well as those of its allies and efforts to
strengthen the Collective Security Treaty Organization and give it the
right to circumvent the highly inefficient United Nations.

[The region is extremely important]{.underline}: [if Ukraine is a fuse
of war, then **Central Asia is a munitions depot**. If it blows up,
**half the continent will be hit**]{.underline}.

#### **Central Asian trade solves nuclear war**

**Starr 3** (S. Frederick, Chair -- Central Asia-Caucasus Institute,
"Afghanistan: Free Trade and Regional Transformation",
<http://www.cacianalyst.org/Publications/Starr_Asia_Society_Afghanistan.htm>)

However great [the]{.underline} economic and social
[benefits]{.underline} of renewed regional [trade across]{.underline}
the broader region of [Central Asia]{.underline}, they [are]{.underline}
fully matched by the [huge]{.underline} gains [in world
security]{.underline} that will flow from these changes. Indeed, it is
hard to imagine any other practical and simple steps anywhere that would
bring about greater geopolitical benefits for all. There are ten
different areas in which these improvements will be quickly felt: 1. The
revival of regional trade will do more than any other single measure to
[rebuild the Afghan economy]{.underline}, generate state income, and
enable the government to provide security and basic human services to
its people. This in turn will [undercut the appeal of
extremist]{.underline} and criminal [activities]{.underline}. And it
will do so in a way that reinforces Afghanistan\'s need to maintain
cordial relations with all its neighbors. 2. Trade with Afghanistan and
the broader region of Central Asia, as well as with India and Iran, will
[stimulate the]{.underline} flagging [economy of Pakistan]{.underline}.
The port of Karachi will become a regional hub and Pakistani businesses
will be able to exploit new opportunities in every direction. 3. Indians
will not choose to remain aloof from this opportunity, even if the price
is improved relations with Pakistan. Although this will not in itself
resolve the conflict over [Kashmir, it will improve the climate in which
the parties address that]{.underline} thorny [problem]{.underline}. 4.
Through regionwide trade to the northeast and east, [Iran will reclaim
its]{.underline} traditional [vocation as a pragmatic trading
state]{.underline}. This will [tip today\'s]{.underline} fragile
[balance between mullahs and merchants in favor of the
latter]{.underline}, hastening positive political change in that
country. It will also cause Iran to look eastward and will distance it
from the messy and seemingly intractable problems of the Arab world. 5.
By renewing trade with their old-age partners to the south and southeast
and by gaining direct access to the nearby port of Karachi, the [new
states of Central Asia will become economically]{.underline} more
[viable and sustainable]{.underline}. Although regionwide trade will
benefit all five of these states, the [impoverished]{.underline}
mountain [countries]{.underline} of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan will [see
the biggest gains]{.underline} as they acquire the ability to market
their most valuable product, hydroelectric power. 6. [Trade will
encourage all the Central Asian leaders]{.underline} and their
governments [to work with]{.underline}, rather than against, [each
other]{.underline} because these economic benefits can be reaped only
when harmonious and productive relations prevail among the regional
states. 7. In the five new states, as in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran,
[trade]{.underline} and investment [will f]{.underline}avor the
formation of an independent middle class and [undercut the appeal of
radical Islamist movements]{.underline}. As the new governments gain in
confidence they will be able to tolerate greater openness and
participation by members of the public. This will in turn strengthen
their identity as moderate Islamic societies ruled by secular states. As
such, they will present[a]{.underline}n alternative [model]{.underline}
of modern development [to the entire Muslim world.]{.underline}8.
Through the opening of trade relations with their natural partners to
the south and access to the port of Karachi, the new states of [Central
Asia will shed their]{.underline} one-sided [dependence on
Russia]{.underline} and reduce that country\'s ability to control their
overall destinies. Stated differently, free trade will do for these
countries what multiple pipelines will do for the oil-producing
countries of the Caspian basin. 9. [The growth of stability]{.underline}
in Afghanistan and the broader region of Central Asia [will address what
Russia has]{.underline}, for a decade, [identified as its number one
security concern]{.underline}. Free trade with the south all the way to
Pakistan and India will [stimulate the]{.underline} flagging
[economies]{.underline} of the Urals region as well. All this [will cut
the ground from]{.underline} under [those in the]{.underline} Russian
[military and intelligence]{.underline}services[who
feel]{.underline}that they must somehow regain a deciding voice in
Central Asian affairs. The waning of [neo-imperial
sentiment]{.underline} will in turn enhance the prospects for more open
public life in Russia. 10. The establishment of [stable]{.underline} and
prosperous [regimes]{.underline} in neighboring Afghanistan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, [and]{.underline} the
[fading]{.underline}of[radical Islamist currents]{.underline} there
[will address]{.underline} China\'s major security objective, namely,
that these countries not become transmission points for [destabilizing
movements within]{.underline} Turkic and Muslim [Xinjiang]{.underline}.
While this will not resolve the question of Xinjiang autonomy (any more
than it will resolve the analogous issue in Kashmir), it will at least
improve the climate in which it can be considered. America\'s Decisive
Role in Building a New Central Asia Reviewing this list, it is clear
that the establishment of free trade throughout the broader region of
Central Asia promises benefits for all and liabilities for none. This is
a policy that is not directed against the interests of any state in the
region. On the contrary, it is a policy that promotes the long-term
objectives of all the states and their peoples. The regional
transformation described above will take place on its own, without any
major push from any quarter. Supporting this claim is the fact that the
changes in question are neither new nor revolutionary. Rather, they will
bring about the reestablishment of certain relationships that proved
their value over the course of several thousand years. The first steps
along these lines are already visible, lending further credibility to
this argument. At the same time, [the region]{.underline} in question
[poses unique dangers. No other area]{.underline} on the planet [is
surrounded by]{.underline} four, possibly [five, nuclear powers
and]{.underline} a sixth power, Turkey[, a NATO member]{.underline}.
Nowhere else do the tectonic plates of several great civilizations and
economic zones grind so directly against one another. So while the
opening of freer trade may somehow be in the natural order of things,
[the risks of the process going awry are enormous]{.underline}. And were
that to happen, [it would put at risk]{.underline} not one but several
of [the relationships on whichworld security is grounded.]{.underline}

The geo-strategic salience of Central Asia today has been underscored by
two main factors. First, [Central Asia has become important because of
the discovery of hydrocarbon reserves and]{.underline} second, it [has
become a major transportation hub for gas and oil pipelines and
multi-modal communication corridors connecting China, Russia, Europe,
the Caucasus region, the Trans-Caspian region and the Indian
Ocean]{.underline}. Furthermore, whether it was Czarist Russia or the
Soviet Union or even the present Central Asian regimes, there has always
been a strategic ambition in the north to seek access to the warm waters
of the Indian Ocean. Thus Afghanistan, which links Central Asia and
South Asia, is a strategic bridge of great geopolitical significance.
Central Asia and South Asia are intimately connected not only
geographically but also strategically. The Central Asian republics of
Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have borders with Afghanistan,
Iran lies to its west and Pakistan to the east and south. Therefore, the
geostrategic significance of Afghanistan is enhanced even though it may
not be an oil- or gas-rich country. With the control of Afghanistan
comes the control of the land routes between the Indian subcontinent and
resource-rich Central Asia, as well as of a potential corridor to Iran
and the Middle East. Thus, stability and peace in Afghanistan, and for
that matter Pakistan, are a geostrategic imperative. [Central
Asia]{.underline} has never been a monolithic area and [is undergoing a
turbulent transitional process with a diverse range of ethnicities and
fragmented societies throughout the region]{.underline}. [These societal
divisions and lack of political maturity compound the social, economic
and political challenges]{.underline}. Security and economic issues are
the two most important components of the Central Asian states'
engagement with outside powers. [Among the states]{.underline}
themselves [there are elements of both cooperation and
competition]{.underline}. Historical legacies, their geo-strategic
locations, and above all their perceived national interests profoundly
influence the political choices of Central Asian nations. [The
weaknesses of the new nations in Central Asia pave the way for outside
powers to interfere in their internal affairs]{.underline}.

**S**ea.]{.underline} These are just some of the more visible dangers
that perturb the Indo-Paci遼c. [We are on the cusp of a
change]{.underline} in the global zeitgeist, [from celebrating a
**strong and growing Asia** to worrying about a **weak and dangerous
Asia**.]{.underline} For all its undeniable successes and strengths, the
[broader **Indo-Paci遼c region** faces signi遼cant, potentially
insurmountable challenges.]{.underline} The rest of us should worry
because [none of these problems threaten only Asia.]{.underline} Whether
one cares about the Indo-Paci遼c or not, [**it is half of our
world**.]{.underline} Today, one out of every three persons on earth is
of Chinese or Indian descent, and the countries of the Indo-Paci遼c
account for nearly 60 percent of the world's population. The World Bank
estimates that the [economies of Asia produce nearly **40 percent of
total global output**, and they are central to everything]{.underline}
from weaving textiles to crafting the most advanced electronic
technology. The [**militaries of Asia's countries** have **grown
dramatically**, and **China**, **India**, and **North Korea** are
**nuclear powers**.]{.underline} Democracies jostle with authoritarian
states as neighbors in the world's most dynamic region. But the
globalization that we continue to celebrate has its dark side as well.
[If an **economic or security crisis** erupted in Asia, it would
**reverberate** around our **increasingly interconnected world**. Those
**risks are festering**]{.underline}, some visible, others still hidden.
The number one priority for the countries of the Asia-Paci遼c, and the
rest of the world, over the coming decade is managing and mitigating the
risks that threaten the Asian Century. To properly conceive of these
trends, one must imagine a "risk map" of Asia. Unlike a traditional
geographic map, this map is a conceptual tool for identifying the most
important trends in the region and assessing their risk. This book maps
out five discrete yet interrelated risk regions. [The first such region
is the threat to Asia's growth from the end of its economic miracle and
the failure of reform.]{.underline} Thousands of headlines and dozens of
books continue to proclaim the economic miracle as if it were destined
to last forever. Yet dig beneath the headlines, and you find major
problems, many of which national governments are failing to solve. From
Japan to India, [the nations of Asia **struggle to maintain growth**,
balance their economies, and **fight slowdowns**.]{.underline} For most
of these countries, the days of high-flying growth are long over, while
for others, they never began. [It is past time for the rest of the world
to pay attention to the threats to Asia's economic health.]{.underline}
Uneven development, asset bubbles, malinvestment, labor issues, and
state control over markets are just some of the features of economic
risk in the Asia-Pacific. And because [**Asian economies are
increasingly interlinked**, **problems in one country spill over to
others**.]{.underline}

#### Prolif causes nuke war in the Middle East -- draws in all Great Powers

**Saab 18** - senior fellow and director of the Defense and Security
Program at the Middle East Institute, and an adjunct assistant professor
at Georgetown University's Security Studies Program (Bilal Y, "The
coming Middle East missile arms race," Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, Sep 25 2018,
<https://thebulletin.org/2018/09/the-coming-middle-east-missile-arms-race/>,
jwg)

[The main reason Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have yet to pursue ballistic
missiles is that Washington has managed for years to convince them not
to. The last thing the United States needs in the Middle East is **an
offensive missile race**, which could **quickly lead the antagonists
into a deadly military confrontation that drags Washington and Moscow
into war**]{.underline}. [Missiles are **inherently destabilizing**
weapons because of their potential to quickly escalate conflicts. Their
flight times can be very short, and new technologies are dramatically
improving their accuracy and lethality.]{.underline}

As if that were not scary enough, [the **nuclear future** of the Middle
East is also increasingly uncertain, **now that the United States has
withdrawn from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action**]{.underline},
the deal that limited Iran's nuclear development in exchange for
sanctions relief. At the same time, [at least half a dozen regional
powers including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Egypt,
Jordan, and Qatar see peaceful nuclear energy as a long-term solution to
their fossil-fuel dependence. The **growth of nuclear power generation
in the region could exacerbate the risk of nuclear proliferation**, as
the same technologies and materials are required to develop both nuclear
energy and nuclear weapons**. Should Middle East civilian nuclear
development become militarized**, possession of **fleets of offensive
missiles**---arguably the most effective delivery vehicle for nuclear
warheads---**could magnify the potential danger.**]{.underline}

Like Israel, [some **Gulf countries are heading toward a stronger
deterrent posture**---through a broader mix of offensive technologies,
including missiles]{.underline}---because missile defense on its own
does not seem to be the answer to the Iranian missile problem.
Furthermore, missile defense is expensive and comes with its own set of
challenges. While [the best missile defense system would be one that is
regionally integrated, any hope of establishing such a system in the
Gulf is now gone because of the ongoing feud Saudi Arabia, the Emirates,
and Bahrain are having with Qatar.]{.underline}

With US influence in the Gulf seemingly declining, [it is unlikely that
Washington's preferences will register as strongly in Riyadh and Abu
Dhabi as they did in the past.]{.underline} To be sure, the drive for
autonomy in national-security decision making has its limits, given the
Gulf countries' military dependence on Washington, but [US weapons are
not the only game in town**, with both Russia and China making inroads
into the region lately.**]{.underline}

\"What Trump's Syria Debacle Means for ISIS,\" POLITICO Magazine,

/\\

Few, however, imagined that [he might just give ISIS the enormous boost
of the Syria debacle.]{.underline}

Just months after the last scraps of ISIS' Caliphate were wrested from
the organization, northern [Syria]{.underline} has been
**[plunged]{.underline}** [into chaos thanks to Trump's abrupt removal
of U.S. troops]{.underline} from the region. Trump, a man addicted to
superlatives, can now safely boast of [having **squandered** a
hard-fought military]{.underline} victory [faster than **anyone in
history**.]{.underline} And [with the **Turkish military** and its
**proxies**, **Syria**]{.underline}n forces[, **Kurdish** fighters and
**Russian** troops converging, there is real danger that prisons holding
11,000 **ISIS** fighters will be **breached**.]{.underline}

According to U.S. officials, many of the [Syrian Kurdish
soldiers]{.underline} guarding the prisons [have been
**depart**ing]{.underline} either to fight the Turks or simply escape
the onslaught, [leaving minimal or **no security.**]{.underline} At some
facilities [detainees are rioting.]{.underline} Scattered reports have
been received of escapes, with official estimates of those who've gotten
out rising to more than 100. (Accounts of larger numbers of escapees
have come from camps where families of fighters are being held.)
Officials also worry that their ability to get news from the Kurdish SDF
or Syrian Democratic Forces, fighters guarding the prisons is
diminishing fast. As has been widely reported, the [U.S. military was
unable to]{.underline} re**[locate]{.underline}** 50
"**[HVIs]{.underline}**" (High Value Individuals), [the most dangerous
of the terrorists, in the chaos.]{.underline}

Although Vice President Mike Pence and his Turkish interlocutors agreed
on a cessation of hostilities on Thursday, [the agreement
will]{.underline} probably [have little effect on ISIS
detainees]{.underline}. Kurdish spokesmen have already understandably
derided the deal as part two of a U.S. sellout and presumably will
continue to fight. The 13-point agreement has no bearing on Syrian
forces who are moving to retake control of the Kurdish region. And it
commits Turkey to anti-ISIS "activities in northeast Syria" and
"coordination on detention facilities," but it is anyone's guess what
that will mean.

Exactly what the various parties have planned for dealing with ISIS
detainees or fighters in the field is hard to say. For the Turks, jihadi
fighters are a low priority compared with the Kurds, who they depict as
a profound long-term threat to Turkish security. President Recep Tayyib
Erdogan deserves no small amount of credit for the rise of ISIS: His
policy of allowing foreign fighters to transit Turkey en route to Syria,
over the objections of innumerable allies and partners, enabled ISIS to
enlist some 20,000 outsiders to the conflict in the Levant. Erdogan,
another paragon of bad judgment, had hoped these fighters would topple
the regime of Syrian leader Bashar Assad.

For his part, [Assad also has a history of]{.underline} neglecting---and
[manipulating]{.underline}---the [jihadists]{.underline}. For years, his
government quietly encouraged jihadis to travel to Iraq to harass U.S.
forces and the post-Saddam, U.S.-backed government. Through most of the
Syrian Civil War, the Syrian regime--- with backing from
Russia---concentrated its fire on other regime opponents rather than the
ISIS fighters who built the cross-border caliphate. U.S. officials take
some hope that Russia will press their Syrian partners to keep ISIS
militants---and especially foreign fighters---locked up. None of these
actors is known for a commitment to civil rights, to put it mildly, so
bombing the prisons or otherwise attacking the prisoners also can't be
ruled out. If, that is, [ISIS fighters]{.underline} on the outside don't
[break their comrades out first, a tactic in which the group is
well-practiced.]{.underline}

How much of a difference would this kind of replenishment to ISIS' ranks
make? Although Trump recently tweeted that the group is "100% defeated,"
that is not the case. [In Syria, Carter Center reporting
shows]{.underline} **[ISIS]{.underline}** [still carrying out numerous
attacks each month]{.underline}. The same is true in Iraq, where the
group has [embraced]{.underline} a strategy of [**hit-and-run** attacks
to demonstrate its **resilience**.]{.underline} United Nations reporting
has put the total number of ISIS fighters in the field at 20,000 to
30,000. That number may be high, and it is unlikely that the group could
start holding significant territory in Iraq as long as there are some
5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq with air power to back them, but the **[scope
for trouble is considerable]{.underline}**---[and all the more so with
civil unrest elsewhere in Iraq, distracting the country's
leadership.]{.underline} In Syria, for now, fighting among the various
militaries will likely prevent any new ISIS statelet from reemerging,
but for the longer term, nothing is certain.

The [potential for ISIS carrying out **terrorist attacks elsewhere** is
also noteworthy]{.underline}. [Of]{.underline} the [detainees in Syria,
2,000 are foreign fighters representing some 40 countries]{.underline}.
While some of these might be reluctant to return to the fight after the
ordeal they've been through, Gen. Joe Votel, then commander of Central
Command, testified in Congress in March that [plenty of the "ISIS
**population**]{.underline} being evacuated from the remaining vestiges
of the caliphate largely [remains **unrepentant**, **unbroken** and
**radicalized**."]{.underline} [Intel]{.underline}ligence [services in
**Europe**, North **Africa** and **elsewhere** will be looking hard for
returnees, but borders are hardly airtight.]{.underline} Although ISIS'
principal focus is on the area that was home to the Caliphate, [the
group will want to continue to score points by carrying out violence
**wherever it can** to demonstrate its vitality.]{.underline}

Numbers of militants are one measure of a terrorist group's strength,
but morale matters as well, and the [Trump drawdown in Syria is a
**godsend for ISIS**' spirits.]{.underline} It's [not just that
**fighters in the field and supporters around the globe will be
heartened**]{.underline} [by the possible return of the detainees;
**it's** also **confirmation of the stories that jihadists tell
themselves** about their struggle.]{.underline}

At the heart of the ISIS narrative is the belief that its struggle is a
long one, filled with tribulations its members must endure but also with
occasional triumphs. [The fact that the U.S. is abandoning
Syria]{.underline} so shortly after the destruction of the Caliphate
[will resonate with the faithful as a sign of divine
support]{.underline}. ISIS' story is already one of comebacks,
especially after the devastation the group suffered beginning in 2006,
and the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, its first leader. ISIS leadership
speaks of the establishment of the Caliphate as a historic achievement
coming out of those ruins, and ISIS communications, though not nearly as
voluminous as they were, aim to create a nostalgia for the Caliphate.
Recalling that historic achievement helps keep ISIS at the forefront of
its followers consciousness and aims to entice others into the fold.
Just as the Prophet Mohammed faced setbacks, the propaganda claims, so
do ISIS fighters, but this quick a revival will be received a portent of
great things to come. Al Qaida tried a similar approach after the
invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, likening its followers to the
companions of the Prophet who endured terrible defeats, but [it never
benefited from the broad-based popularity of ISIS or the kind of
turnaround seen in Syria.]{.underline} Like all jihadist groups, ISIS
also has entwined in its ideological DNA the notion that the U.S. is
ultimately a paper tiger. Osama Bin Laden made this argument from the
earliest days of al Qaida, claiming that President Ronald Reagan's
retreat from Lebanon in the early 1980s and the pullout from Somalia
after the Black Hawk Down episode were indicative. After the pounding al
Qaida took in Afghanistan beginning in 2001 and the methodical
dismantlement of the Caliphate, that narrative has been in eclipse.
Given events in Syria and Trump's naked eagerness to escape from
Afghanistan, expect it to come roaring back.

[Departing Syria **will hurt global security**---and the **U.S. in
particular**---in still other ways]{.underline}. In the first instance,
the rekindling of [war in Syria will inevitably increase the production
of new **extremists**]{.underline}. War may be the father of all things,
[but it especially prolific in producing militants]{.underline}. The
U.S. has, until now, been remarkably effective at dispatching specific
terrorist foes who aim to do us imminent harm. But after two decades of
war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Somalia, Yemen and the north Caucasus,
the [number of jihadists in the world is widely believed to be at least
four or **five** times the number that who were operating on
**9/11.**]{.underline} So the [pool of extremists who may want to harm
America tomorrow is steadily growing.]{.underline}

#### Russia Iran relations decreasing now

However, the Islamic Republic's pro-Kremlin narrative has not remained
unchallenged. [There have been important cracks even with some major
media outlets and especially so across Iranian society. Those seeking to
bring forth counter-narratives, however, face daunting
obstacles.]{.underline} Russian tutelage over Iranian media reporting
--- a demonstration of neo-colonialism After the Russian embassy in
Tehran condemned a report by the Tasnim News Agency --- which,
curiously, is affiliated with the pro-Moscow IRGC --- as "fake news" for
characterizing Putin's operation in Ukraine as an "invasion," the report
was taken offline and replaced with one that closely mirrors the
Kremlin's official wording. In another instance, the embassy lashed out
against an Iranian reformist daily that criticized Russia for
threatening to derail the JCPOA negotiations. Later, on March 9,
[Russia's ambassador to Tehran held a press conference urging Iranian
media not to use the terms "war" or "invasion" in their coverage, a
blatant interference in Iranian domestic affairs that has stoked anger
in the country.]{.underline} These cases bring to mind similar
interventions by China's embassy in Iran against unfavorable media
reporting and official statements, most recently about China's alleged
stationing of security forces in Iran to protect its investment
interests. Earlier, in the pandemic's first year, the Chinese embassy
had stepped in to silence skeptics of Beijing's official COVID-19
statistics. Such [interference by ambassadors from both non-Western
great powers into Iran's domestic affairs reflects the nature of
Tehran's relations with Russia and China, upon which Iran's entire "look
to the East" geopolitical strategy depends. A yawning power gap results
in chronic Iranian weakness and dependency, raising the specter of a
neo-feudal arrangement whereby Tehran's leadership follows the diktats
of their masters in Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}. However, Russia's
newfound pariah status may improve Iran's standing in bilateral ties,
but only if Tehran plays its cards carefully and doesn't degenerate into
a power that simply follows Putin's whims. At its core, Iran's "look
East" policy has as its goal not only economic development and political
support against Western pressure, but the very survival of a regime
whose domestic support has been hollowed out. Moscow and Beijing hold up
this teetering regime from the outside. Hence, the Islamic Republic
finds itself granting concessions to Russian or Chinese interests, and
sometimes even trying to anticipate their apparent desires. In this
context, fears associated with Iran's already signed 25-year
comprehensive cooperation agreement with China are mirrored by those
over the planned 20-year deal with Russia. Both long-term agreements,
which are branded as "strategic," lack transparency and have therefore
stoked wild speculation. Theories abound that the Islamic Republic's
leadership is potentially selling out the country only to cement its own
power amid unprecedented domestic and international pressures with the
help of these non-Western great powers and their U.N. Security Council
vetoes. As a core pillar of the deal with Russia, which Iran's foreign
ministry said last December was "almost finalized," Moscow will
reportedly protect Tehran's interests at the U.N. Security Council and
with the JCPOA, and finally provide it with advanced military hardware
(such as the S-400 missile defense system and Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets)
in exchange for Russia obtaining favorable deals on Iran's oil and gas
fields. Coinciding with this 20-year agreement is another reported deal
between the two countries from last fall, granting Russian companies the
largest share in the recently discovered giant Chalous gas field in
Iran's Caspian Sea territory (followed by Chinese companies and only
then Iranian ones, more concretely those affiliated with the IRGC). For
Russia, Iran has been a true trump card, enabling it to leverage the
"Iranian threat" vis--vis the West while also benefitting economically
from ties with Tehran, including re-energizing its nuclear industry
through its prominent role in Iran's nuclear program. Therefore, if Iran
normalizes relations with the West, that would likely sharply curtail
Russia's influence. In other words, a Western-oriented Iran would
constitute a larger threat to Moscow's interests than a "nuclear Iran."
Societal and geopolitical concerns [The nature and possible
ramifications of Iran's relationship with Russia are hotly debated
across Iranian society. Iranian fears emerge from the unevenness of
bilateral ties and the perceived disconnect between national and regime
interests vis--vis Russia --- or China for that matter.]{.underline}
These concerns about Russia are rooted in both history and geopolitical
realities. [The bitter memories of the 1908 bombardment of Iran's
parliament by the Russia-led Persian Cossack Brigade meant to torpedo
the Constitutional Revolution as well as the 1941 Anglo-Soviet invasion
linger in the collective consciousness as a reminder of the Kremlin's
willingness to run roughshod over Iran in pursuit of its interests.
Moreover, some elements of Iran's foreign policy community see Russia as
flip-flopping when it comes to the perennial conflict between Iran and
the West. For them, Moscow is an opportunistic actor focused solely on
achieving its own aims, even if it means contradicting official rhetoric
that lambasts the U.S. and the West, including its propensity to keep
the flame of the Iran-West conflict alive as a means to maximize
Moscow's standing in that conflictual triangular
relationship]{.underline}. Among other things, Russia is accused of
breaking arms supply contracts, sabotaging the JCPOA process, and
maintaining close ties with Iran's regional foes (Israel, the United
Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia). Furthermore, there are also broader
concerns within society over the long-term alliance the Iranian regime
hopes to forge with the like-minded autocracies of Russia and China.
Although sparsely attended, [anti-war protests in front of the Ukrainian
embassy in Tehran, complete with chants of marg bar Putin ("death to
Putin"), illustrate the anti-Moscow sentiment]{.underline}. Such
reservations about Russia also pertain to China. Yet there is no
organized opposition to the regime's deepening of ties with either. The
interests of the regime and those of Iranian society clash over Russia.
While the former sees Russia as a formidable military-security guarantor
of its stability and survival, the latter sees in such support a looming
threat to democratic aspirations. [Pro-democracy Iranians fear that
Moscow could boost their country's repressive apparatus, and potentially
even deploy its military if popular protests ever were to imperil the
regime --- as witnessed in both Syria and Kazakhstan]{.underline}. The
relationship between the Russian and Iranian regimes is also
strengthened by their parallels: Both are petro-states with mafia-style
ruling classes helmed by all-powerful autocrats unafraid of using a
heavy hand and guided by their nostalgia for the glory days of empires
past.

#### Relations are [impossible]{.underline}\-\--[centuries]{.underline} of bad blood.

Russia-Iran Alliance Will Backfire,"

RES

[For all its talk of leading a "resistance front," the Islamic Republic
of Iran has historically had few allies.]{.underline} When Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini led his revolutionaries, "Neither East nor West but
Islamic Republic" was a foundational slogan of the Islamic Revolution.
[Khomeini also described the United States and Russia as being "**two
blades of the same scissors**."\[1\] He meant it: While the seizure of
the U.S. embassy in Tehran symbolized the Islamic Republic's hostility
toward the United States and its European allies, Khomeini was **equally
distrustful of the Soviet Union** and its eastern bloc
satellites.]{.underline} Iran's isolation was cemented when every Arab
state with the exception of Syria sided with Iraq during their 1980-88
war. Tehran's ties with Damascus have remained tight, but Syria's
influence is limited inside the Middle East and its diplomatic weight is
nonexistent outside it. The Iranian authorities sought to cultivate
African states and were able to purchase the occasional vote on an
international body, but Tehran's declining resources limited its
success. [Today, that isolation is over. Whereas Khomeini was wary lest
Moscow take advantage of Iran's vulnerability, Ali Khamenei, who
succeeded him in 1989, took the risk to align with Russia in pursuit of
a broader, anti-U.S. agenda. In this, he found success. But, the
question for Iranians is, at what cost? Distrust **Centuries** in the
Making]{.underline} Iranian leaders were aware of Russia by the
fifteenth century as many European traders, seeking to bypass the
Ottoman Empire on their overland journeys into Asia, traveled to Persia
via Moscow.\[2\] Iranians worried little about their distant neighbors
to the north: they viewed Russians as illiterate and cultureless
peasants and worried more about Uzbeks and the independent khanates of
the Central Asian steppes, which occasionally raided into Iran. The
Russians were equally uninterested in the Persians. Russian tsar Peter
the Great (r. 1682-1725) withdrew Russian troops from the Caspian coast,
believing Iranian forces posed little threat. Such neglect would be
short-lived. In 1796, Catherine the Great (r. 1762-96) sent a
50,000-strong force into the North Caucasus, which at that time was part
of Iran. Her death gave Iran a reprieve and saved it from what might
have been a far greater conquest. As the Russians conquered more
territory in Asia, British leaders grew increasingly concerned about the
security of India and, by extension, Iran, which had become the only
power separating Russia from India. It was this fear that led London to
first dispatch an ambassador to the shah's court in 1800. Both the
Russians and the French soon followed suit. It was not long before
disputes between Moscow and Tehran resumed. [Between 1804 and 1813,
Iranian and Russian forces fought repeatedly in the
Caucasus]{.underline}. The campaigns drained the shah's treasury and, in
the end, the Russians forced him to cede much of what today is the
Republic of Azerbaijan and eastern Georgia. Resentment simmered, and [in
1826, the Iranians attacked Russia to regain what the shah had
lost]{.underline}. [The gamble failed and, in the 1828 Treaty of
Turkmenchai, the shah ceded much of Armenia. For Iranians, these were
not some peripheral territories but rather part of the heartland and the
territory over which the crown prince would serve as
governor]{.underline}. [In 1829, an Iranian mob sacked the Russian
embassy in Tehran, slaughtering its thirty-seven Russian
diplomats]{.underline}.\[3\] Russia became a favorite bogeyman for both
nationalists and clergy, [and Russians in Iran suffered occasional **mob
violence** over subsequent decades]{.underline}.\[4\] Still, the Russian
government saw commerce as a source of influence and encouraged
businessmen to move to Iran. Russian leaders, like their British
competitors, also sought to further their leverage with debt traps: Both
powers would tempt the shah with loans to fund his profligate lifestyle
but then call in their extortionate terms, the expense of which the shah
would often pass to his subjects. [This led to a pattern in which the
Russian rulers often successfully wooed the shah while Iranian public
opinion continued to harden against them.]{.underline} The
Twentieth-century Unrest The twentieth century's first decade was a time
of upheaval in both Russia and Iran. First, the Japanese defeated Russia
in war, ending Moscow's image of invincibility. Then, first in St.
Petersburg and then across Iran, revolutionaries successfully won
parliamentary constraints on monarchies. In Iran, Muzaffar ad-Din Shah
conceded to a constitution just five days before his death. His
successor, Mohammed Ali Shah, was unhappy to see what he believed to be
his birthright diluted before he could even take power. He quickly
turned to Russia where Tsar Nicholas II also sought to preserve his
traditional powers. [As the shah worked to consolidate power and roll
back reforms, the Russian government worked to cement its position in
Iran.]{.underline} Mohammed Ali Shah continued the practice of tax
farming and office selling, so Russian officials used their resources to
ensure pro-Russian candidates won advantageous positions, much to the
chagrin of more liberal Iranian nationalists in Tehran's new
parliament.\[5\] The 1907 Anglo-Russian convention divided Iran into
spheres of British and Russian influence. An editorial cartoon of the
time depicts the Russian bear sitting on Persia while the English lion
looks on. The Russians were blatant in their disrespect of Iranian
sovereignty. On August 31, 1907, they shocked Tehran when they,
alongside their British competitors, unveiled the Anglo-Russian
convention, which effectively divided Iran into spheres of influence.
While Iranians remained angry at both parties for the affront,
[Britain]{.underline}'s main strategic interest at the time was its
telegraph lines across southern Iran, and so it [ceded most major
Iranian population centers to Russian control]{.underline}. [Here, the
Russians chafed the population more, using proxies and pressure to force
closure of Iran's nascent civil society groups and secret societies and
to impose broader censorship on Iran's exploding newspaper
scene.]{.underline} Even the affront of Russia's secret agreement to
divide Iran into different spheres did not break Mohammed Ali Shah's
tilt toward Russia. His ambitions were too great and so, in December
1907, he made his move against the Iranian Constitutionalists. His
guards---and a detachment of Russian-trained Persian
Cossacks---surrounded the parliament. Parliament's supporters resisted
and [soon Iran was on the brink of **civil war**]{.underline}. As far as
most Iranians were concerned, there were two sides: nationalists and
Russian-backed Iranian autocrats. That perception largely remains
unchanged today. Fighting erupted in July 1909 and, within two weeks, it
was over. The shah and his retinue fled first to the Russian embassy and
then to Russia itself. The nationalists put Ahmad, the shah's
12-year-old son, on the throne. Still, Mohammed Ali Shah did not give
up. Two years later and, again with Russian support, he invaded Iran
from the north. He failed, but [the episode cemented Russia's reputation
inside Iran as **hostile to Iranian sovereignty**]{.underline}. [During
World War I,]{.underline} Russian forces drove south from the Caspian
Sea reaching as far south as Qom. By 1917, British and [Russian forces
had occupied most of Iran]{.underline}, leaving Mohammed Ali Shah as a
titular leader. Grievance went beyond bruised pride. [During World War
I, Iran lost more than **20 percent** of its population to disease,
famine, and violence. The Soviets refused to leave Iranian territory
following World War II]{.underline} and supported Kurdish separatism in
Iran during the Cold War. The Bolshevik Revolution did not change the
uneven power dynamic. In 1921, the Soviet authorities imposed a new
treaty on Iran in which Moscow renounced earlier agreements and forgave
Russian loans but also reserved the right to intervene should Iran host
forces intent on interfering in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities
interpreted this literally and, within weeks, Moscow demanded that
Tehran expel all Germans. [Joseph Stalin would repeatedly cite the
treaty to justify Soviet ultimatums.]{.underline} Indeed, Stalin used
the 1921 Treaty to justify invading Iran two decades later. The Soviets
were not alone in this---British and subsequently U.S. forces took
part---but the Red Army was alone in refusing to leave Iranian territory
when World War II ended. Not only did Iranian Azerbaijan become the
focal point of the first Cold War crisis, but Moscow also sought to
encourage and support Kurdish separatism in the Mahabad Republic in
northwestern Iran. This was high among the reasons why Tehran tripled
its defense budget in the next decade and joined the Baghdad Pact.\[6\]
[The direct **military threat** the Iranians felt from across their
1,100-mile border with the Soviet Union loomed large in public
consciousness through the remainder of the Cold War]{.underline}. [This
is why, even as Ayatollah Khomeini railed against "The Great Satan"
America during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, his suspicions and those of
his followers remained just as deep toward the Soviet
Union]{.underline}.\[7\] Reconsidering Russia While Khomeini did not
waiver on his connection to Russia throughout the Iran-Iraq war despite
the isolation Tehran faced, toward the end of his life, he signaled
Iran's need not to treat the Soviet Union with the same enmity as the
regime did the United States. In May 2009, Hassan Rouhani, at the time a
former secretary of the Supreme National Security Council and a member
of the Assembly of Experts, spoke at a roundtable on "Iran, Russia, and
the West."\[8\] While critical of Moscow's posture toward Iran prior to
the Islamic Revolution, he suggested then-parliamentary speaker Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's 1989 visit to Moscow had laid the foundation
for a new partnership.\[9\] Ali Khamenei, Khomeini's successor as
supreme leader, continued Tehran's quiet outreach justified on shared
enmity with the Russians toward Washington and on economic opportunism.
Some Iranians raised questions about inherent ideological compromise,
but regime officials tried to explain this away. In 2012, for example, a
website affiliated with the supreme leader denied any parallels between
the Palestinian plight and Muslim minorities in Russia or China. The
difference, it said, was that Israel was alone in having "confiscated"
Palestinian lands.\[10\] Other outlets acknowledged the problem but
assured critics that Tehran continued to provide "emotional support" for
the Chechens.\[11\] That same year, however, Rafsanjani---by then a
senior statesman---threw cold water on the comfort some Iranian
officials felt about their anti-U.S. alliance with Russia even if he was
credited with its revival. In an interview, he noted the constraints
Russia felt from U.S. pressure and acknowledged, "Like Western
countries, Russia is also concerned about Iran becoming a power by
acquiring nuclear weapons."\[12\] As president, however, Rouhani
disagreed, arguing both that the growing U.S. military presence in
Afghanistan and the Caucasus and U.S. human rights advocacy provoked
Russia enough to cause it to put other concerns aside.\[13\] Other
officials were less sure. In 2014, Behrouz Nemati, a conservative who
represents Tehran in parliament, said that the [history of Russo-Iranian
relations demonstrates a tendency toward Russian subterfuge and warned
Iranian leaders to be careful "shaking Russia's
hand."\[]{.underline}14\] [Russian soldiers stand watch over Afghans
during the Soviet invasion]{.underline}, December 1979. Former Iranian
president Hashemi Rafsanjani claimed that the invasion "[left a **bad
memory** of Russians in Iranians' minds."]{.underline} In contrast to
Rouhani, Rafsanjani suggested that Afghanistan remained a source of
distrust between Tehran and Moscow rather than a catalyst for tighter
ties. "The Soviet Union's record on invading Afghanistan left a bad
memory of Russians in Iranians' minds," he explained. "It is too often
overlooked that the Islamic Republic's relationship with Russia was
formed in such an environment."\[15\] Sadegh Kharrazi, Iran's former
ambassador to France, also cast doubt on a Russian gamble.
"Historically, there is a national distrust in Iranians' nature against
Russia. We haven't been harmed by Americans like we have been by
Russians," he argued.\[16\] This appears to be a common attitude among
some senior Iranian diplomats. Ali Khorram, a former Iranian ambassador
to China, wrote that Russia was not trustworthy. "The Russians are good
to Iran as long as it is in their interest," he explained, but "as soon
as Americans and Western countries \[court Russia\], \[the Russians\]
will turn their back to their commitments to the Islamic Republic of
Iran. ... History has shown whenever we have relied on them
\[Russians\], they have immediately abandoned us," he added.\[17\] One
Iranian diplomat argued, "[The Russians are good to Iran as long **as it
is in their interest**]{.underline}." While Khamenei and later Rouhani
may have been eager for ties to Moscow, Russia's historical baggage in
Iran continued to intrude. Both countries supported the same side in the
Syrian civil war, and yet, when a Russian ship launched cruise missiles
from the Caspian Sea into Syria that overflew Iranian territory, even
sympathetic Iranians such as senior members of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps (IRGC) reacted with outrage.\[18\] [Other Russian actions
have antagonized ordinary Iranians]{.underline}. After Moscow provided
its Iranian counterpart with technology to jam Persian-language
broadcasts from diaspora stations, ordinary Iranians reacted with
vitriol. Internet commentary submitted to the conservative daily [Asr-e
Iran webpage on the story included comments such as, "**May God give
Russia Death," "Russia is the biggest jerk," and "the Russian embassy is
a nest of spies**]{.underline}."\[19\] Outside the constraints of the
official press, Iranian bloggers let loose, questioning the value of
alignment with a declining economic power and the stability of any
alliance with Russia.\[20\] An Iranian doctoral student in Moscow,
meanwhile, observed---correctly---that the Kremlin always acted in its
own national interest, but Iranian proponents of the alliance somehow
expected the Russians to act in Tehran's national interest
instead.\[21\] [Can Trade Overcome Distrust?]{.underline} While
Washington and its Middle Eastern allies may worry primarily about
Russia-Iran military ties, the trade relationship between the two
countries could potentially be broader. Upon the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Russia entered a deep, multi-year recession. At the time, Tehran
was already heavily sanctioned and, after a series of executive orders
issued by President Bill Clinton, soon became more so. Both Tehran and
Moscow, however, found an outlet in the other. In 1995, for example,
Russia's Atomstroyexport became the chief contractor for the Bushehr
nuclear program at a time when few countries wanted Russian nuclear
assistance given the stigma of the Chernobyl disaster, and Iranian
contracts were toxic for Western firms. Still, initial optimism in
Tehran that Russian trade might salvage Iran's economy quickly faded. In
2012, Rafsanjani explained, In the past quarter century ... [Iran and
Russia have **never** been able to set and create a visible trade
partnership. The most important commodity \[oil\] that Iran has to offer
other countries is **not attractive** to the Russians, and many Russians
commodities and technologies have always been the lowest priority for
the Iranian side]{.underline}.\[22\] Russian exports to Iran decreased
by nearly two thirds, from \$3.4 billion to \$1.2 billion, between 2010
and 2013, while Iranian exports to Russia grew only modestly and
remained under \$500 million.\[23\] Nor did either country's
non-military trade with the other increase appreciably over the next
decade.\[24\] Even the arms trade did not fully reassure those in the
Iranian government unsure about whether to trust Moscow. In 2007, Tehran
agreed to purchase the S-300 system for \$800 million. Prior to the
development of the S-400, the S-300 was still Russia's premier
anti-aircraft missile system, and so the announcement of the deal was a
high stakes affair. Soon, however, Iranians who expressed doubt about
Russia's reliability felt vindicated: Moscow suspended the sale under
international pressure. The dispute carried on for another eight years
with the Iranian government demanding a \$4 billion breach of contract
penalty against Russia's Rosoboronexport. And while Tehran dropped the
suit in 2015 when Rosoboronexport finally delivered the hardware,
cynicism and doubt remained.\[25\] Shortly after the signing of the 2015
Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA), Moscow agreed to license the manufacture of
Russian tanks inside Iran. Russia and Iran also now hold joint military
exercises. Ironically, it was the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA), President Barack Obama's signature Iran nuclear deal,
that breathed new life into the Russia-Iran arms trade. In order to
reach agreement, Obama agreed not only to end prohibitions on Iran's
military trade but also to provide a windfall for Tehran in terms of
sanctions relief and enabling foreign investment. It was not long, for
example, before Moscow agreed to license the manufacture of Russian
tanks inside Iran.\[26\] The two countries likewise appear to be
cooperating in the cyber sphere with drones, and, despite Russian
president Vladimir Putin's denials, with satellites as well.\[27\] That
appears to be the tip of the iceberg.\[28\] Russia and Iran also
increasingly hold joint military exercises, sometimes with Chinese
participation.\[29\] The IRGC also frequently participates in Russia's
annual military games.\[30\] [Will the Russian-Iranian Alliance
Last?]{.underline} For Khamenei, hatred of the United States trumps
animosity toward Russia. In November 2015, he visited Moscow for the
first time in more than a decade, nominally to attend a summit for
gas-exporting countries. After a meeting with his Russian counterpart,
Khamenei declared, "America's long-term scheme for the region is
detrimental to all nations and countries, particularly Iran and Russia,
and it should be thwarted through vigilance and closer interaction." He
praised Putin for "neutralizing \[Washington's\] policy." Putin was also
affable. "We regard you as a trustworthy and reliable ally in the region
and the world," he told Khamenei.\[31\] Putin also looks to the future;
he was the first world leader to call Ebrahim Raisi upon his win in the
June 2021 presidential elections, a victory that many observers believe
confirm his frontrunner status to replace Khamenei upon the aging
supreme leader's death.\[32\] For Khamenei, hatred of the United States
trumps animosity toward Russia. Still, [centuries of Iranian **distrust
and hostility** do not easily dissipate]{.underline}. Perhaps this is
why, in June 2021, the Russian and Iranian foreign ministries agreed to
waive visas.\[33\] Few countries allow Iranians such access, and the
decline of the Iranian rial makes it increasingly expensive for those
that do. But a desire to bolster tourism may not be the only basis for
the agreement. There is likely hope at a more senior level that enabling
Iranians and Russians to meet and mix might breakdown the hostility that
overshadows Iranian public opinion of Russia and its aims. While the
JCPOA helped reinforce Khamenei's flailing attempt to build a
Russia-Iran strategic alliance, the drive by both Tehran and Moscow's
dictatorial regimes to cement an anti-U.S. alliance will backfire.
Decades of official Islamic Republic hostility to the United States have
not eroded and, indeed, likely may have encouraged a general
friendliness by the Iranian public toward America. [To try to push
Russia upon the public will likely accelerate that trend while Moscow's
close association with an increasingly unpopular Khamenei and Raisi will
reinforce Iranian **public hostility** toward Russia for decades to
come]{.underline}. The nature of dictatorship, however, means that in
the short term, such sentiments will not affect policy as both Tehran
and Moscow work to erode the post-World War II liberal order and U.S.
dominance on the regional and global stage.

#### Iran-Russia relations low -- nuclear deal 

Golnaz **Esfandiari 3/10**, a senior correspondent for RFE/RL focusing
on Iran. She has reported from Afghanistan and Haiti and is one of the
authors of The Farda Briefing newsletter. Her work has been cited by The
New Yorker, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other major
publications, 3/10/2022, "Will Russia\'s Invasion Of Ukraine Derail The
Iran Nuclear Deal?,"
<https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-iran-nuclear-deal-demands-invasion/31746877.html>,
RES

[After nearly a year of painstaking negotiations, Iran and world powers
were on the brink of agreeing to restore the landmark 2015 nuclear deal.
But last-minute demands from Russia, one of the parties to the deal,
have threatened to derail efforts to revive an agreement that curbed
Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international
sanctions. Moscow has demanded guarantees from Washington that Western
sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine will not affect its trade and
military cooperation with Tehran. The United States has described
Russia\'s new demands as \"irrelevant.\"]{.underline} France, another
signatory of the original deal, warned they could dash hopes for a
revived nuclear accord. [Moscow' actions have been met with **surprise
and anger in Tehran**. Iran's foreign minister told lawmakers on March
7, without naming Russia, that Tehran would not let its interests be
undermined by "foreign elements." Experts warn that Russia's demands
could complicate and ultimately **scuttle** the already fraught
negotiations between Iran and world powers. If the talks collapse, Iran
could further advance its sensitive nuclear activities. It could also
lead to Western countries further tightening **sanctions against
Tehran**. Observers say Iran and world powers could **sideline Russia
from the negotiations**, although it is unclear whether Tehran would be
willing to risk jeopardizing its relationship with Moscow, an
ally.]{.underline} Iran and world powers have been holding negotiations
in Vienna since April 2021, with the United States taking part
indirectly. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew
Washington from the deal. Tehran responded by gradually exceeding the
limits imposed by the pact on its nuclear activities. U.S. President Joe
Biden has said he is willing to rejoin the pact if Iran return to full
compliance. \'Stabbed In The Back\' Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran
Project at the International Crisis Group, says that by inserting [the
war in Ukraine into the complicated nuclear negotiations, Russia appears
to be determined to upend the talks and take Iran down with
it.]{.underline} He suggested that [Russia appears no longer to be
interested in reviving the nuclear deal, which would allay Western
concerns over Iran's nuclear activities and allow Tehran to sell its
oil. And that could bring global oil prices down.]{.underline} "Neither
Iran\'s return to the oil market nor the peaceful resolution of a
Western security concern in the Middle East benefits the Kremlin," Vaez
told RFE/RL. "The leadership in Tehran is waking up to the reality that
you often get stabbed in the back by those you believed to have your
back." \'Tank The Talks\' Analysts say the scope of Russia's demands
will determine whether they complicate or scuttle the negotiations
entirely. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on March 5 said that
Moscow wanted written guarantees that sanctions ''launched by the U.S.
will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and
economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation
with Iran." Russia's new demands coincided with mounting international
pressure on Moscow over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February
24, a move that has resulted in unprecedented Western sanctions. U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed Russia's demands on March 6,
saying U.S. sanctions that are "being put in place and that have been
put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal."
"If it is simply exemptions that allow Russia to help Iran meet its
nuclear obligations in the deal, that is one thing," Eric Brewer, a
senior director at Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a Washington-based
think tank, told RFE/RL. "But Lavrov\'s comments suggest Russia is after
something much bigger. [I don\'t see the United States giving Russia
that type of sanctions relief, even if it endangers a revival of the
\[nuclear deal\],"]{.underline} he added. Brewer says the United States
and Russia have been able to cooperate on shared nonproliferation
interests in the past, even when tensions have been high. But he says it
is possible that Russia's recent demands \"tank the talks.\" \'Critical
Decision\' Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle
East studies at Johns Hopkins University, says [Russia's demands have
forced Iran to make a difficult choice: to stick by Russia and incur the
**diplomatic and economic costs** of the talks collapsing or to ditch
Moscow and endanger its ties with an ally.]{.underline} "Iran would have
to decide how important an agreement is to its national interest, and
whether it will allow talks it has invested so much in and built its
economic and foreign policies around \[to\] be taken hostage by Russia,"
Nasr, who served as a senior adviser to the Obama administration, told
RFE/RL. "[It will be a critical decision for Tehran]{.underline}." [Nasr
suggested that **sidelining Russia was possible**.]{.underline} "[The
nuclear side of things is in Iran's hand. The sanctions are in the hands
of the U.S. and Europe. Russia\'s only leverage is to prevent a
deal]{.underline}," Nasr said. Brewer says the other parties to the deal
would have to find ways to replace Russia's technical role under the
deal, including removing excess enriched uranium from Iran. "Given
enough time, you could probably come up with some workarounds for other
parties to take Russia\'s place on these technical areas," he says.
\"But it won\'t be easy, and time is in short supply. \"[At a practical
level, it would be incredibly challenging to reimplement the deal if
Russia, the United States, and Europe are not in alignment on the
\[nuclear deal\] and if Russia is actively trying to play the role of
**spoiler**]{.underline}."

### 2AC -- Ukraine Thumper

#### Russia is moving [away from]{.underline} Syria to [Ukraine]{.underline} now\-\--the impact is [inevitable]{.underline}. 

Dr. Hamdan **Al-Shehri 6/4**, a political analyst and international
relations scholar, 6/4/2022, "Russia's Syria withdrawal a boon for
Iran's regional project," <https://www.arabnews.com/node/2096641>, RES

The [echoes of the Russian-Ukrainian war]{.underline}, which is less
than four months old, have [reached our region]{.underline}. Our talk is
not about units or militias affiliated with Tehran joining the fight
there. Rather, [we are talking about geopolitics, as well as the void we
have begun to notice as a result of the **gradual military retreat** and
withdrawal of Russia from Syria, with the Iranian presence filling this
void.]{.underline} [Russia moved into the region in the shadow of the
American withdrawal as it sought to achieve its interests. This led to
Moscow improving its trade and investment balance, besides using the
port of Tartus and playing an important role in the Middle East.
Russia's military presence in Syria --- to support the Damascus regime
--- was considered a **counterbalance and check on Iran**, even though
it is an ally of the Iranians there]{.underline}. Its presence has also
become a reason for the regional acceptance of the spread of Iran's
militias in Syria. However, the theory of the foreign balance inside
Syria is on the verge of disruption. [In recent weeks, there have been
reports of Russian troops leaving, possibly to the front line in
Ukraine. We will **likely** see further Russian **withdrawals**,
creating more space for the Iranians.]{.underline} [The Russian
withdrawal from Syria could end up as a repeat of America's withdrawal
from Iraq.]{.underline} [This might mean the Iraqi scenario --- with its
**sectarian war**, demographic changes, **armed terrorist militias**,
killings and displacement --- is replicated in Syria.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine war destroys Russia and Iran relations

Emil **Avdaliani,** 5-13-20**22**, \"Iran Gives Russia Two and a Half
Cheers,\" CEPA,
https://cepa.org/iran-gives-russia-two-and-a-half-cheers/

[For Iran, the **invasion of Ukraine** is closely related to the very
essence of the present world order. Much like Russia, Iran has been
voicing its discontent at the way the international system has operated
since the end of the Cold War. More broadly, **Iran and Russia** see the
world through strikingly similar lenses. Both keenly anticipate the end
of the multipolar world and the end of the West's geopolitical
preponderance. Iran had its reasons to think this way. The **US
unipolar** moment after 1991 provoked a deep fear **of imminent
encirclement**, with American bases in Afghanistan and Iraq cited as
evidence. Like Russia, the Islamic Republic views itself as a separate
civilization that needs to be not only acknowledged by outside
players,]{.underline} but also to be given ana suitable geopolitical
space to project influence[. Both Russia and Iran are very clear about
their respective spheres of influence. For Russia, it is the territories
that once constituted the Soviet empire. For Iran, it is the contiguous
states reaching from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean --- Iraq,
Syria, Lebanon --- plus Yemen.]{.underline} When the two former imperial
powers have overlapping strategic interests such as, for instance, in
the South Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, they apply the concept of
regionalism. This implies the blocking out of non-regional powers from
exercising outsize economic and military influence, and mostly revolves
around an order dominated by the powers which border on a region. [This
largely explains why Iran sees the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an
opportunity that, if successful, could hasten **the end** of the
**liberal** world order. This is why it has largely toed the Russian
line and explained what it describes as legitimate motives behind the
invasion]{.underline}. Thus the expansion of NATO into eastern Europe
was cited as having provoked Russian moves[. "The root of the
crisis]{.underline} in Ukraine [is the US policies that create the
crisis, and Ukraine is one victim of these policies,"

certain degree, Iran's approach to Ukraine has been also influenced by
mishaps in b]{.underline}ilateral relations which largely began with the
accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger jet by Iranian
surface-to-air missiles in January 2020, [killing 176
people](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51073621). The
regime first denied responsibility, and later blamed human error. Iran,

the ideal scenario would have been a quick war in which the Kremlin
achieved its major goals**. Protracted war, however, sends a bad
signal**. It signals that the liberal order was not in such steep
decline after all, and that Russia's [calls for a new
era](http://www.kremlin.ru/supplement/5770) in international relations
have been far from realistic. The unsuccessful war also shows Iran that
the collective West still has very significant power and --- despite
well-aired differences --- an ability to rapidly coalesce to defend the
existing rules-based order. Worse, for these countries, the sanctions
imposed on Russia go further; demonstrating the West's ability to make
significant economic sacrifices to make its anger felt. In other words,
Russia's failure in Ukraine actually strengthened the West and made it
more united than at any point since the September 2001 terrorist attacks
on the US. A reinvigorated liberal order is the last thing that Iran
wants, given its own troubled relations with the collective
West.]{.underline} The continuing negotiations on a [revived nuclear
deal](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/eus-borrell-says-coordinator-trip-075454031.html)
will be heavily impacted by how Russia's war proceeds, and how the US
and EU continue to respond to the aggression. Iran fears that a defeated
Russia might be so angered as to use its critical position to endanger
the talks, vital to the lifting of the West's crippling sanctions. And
despite rhetorical [support for Russia, Iran has been careful not
to]{.underline} **[overestimate]{.underline}** Russia's power. It is now
far from clear that the Kremlin has achieved its long-term goal of
"safeguarding" its western frontier. Indeed, the Putin regime may have
done the opposite now that it has driven Finland and Sweden into the
NATO fold. Western sanctions on Russia are likely to remain for a long
time, threatening long-term Russian economic (and possible regime)
stability. Moreover, Russia's fostering of separatist entities
(following the recognition of the so called Luhansk and Donetsk
"people's republics" and other breakaway entities in Georgia and
Moldova) is a highly polarizing subject in Iran. True there has been a
shift toward embracing Russia's position over Ukraine, but Iran remains
deeply committed to the "Westphalian principles" of non-intervention in
the affairs of other states and territorial integrity. This is hardly
surprising given its own struggles against potential separatism in the
peripheries of the country. Many Iranians also sympathize with Ukraine's
plight, which for some evokes Iran's defeats in the early 19th century
wars when Qajars had to cede the eastern part of the South Caucasus to
Russia. This forms part of a historically deeply rooted,
anti-imperialist sentiment in Iran. Iran is therefore likely to largely
abstain from endorsing Russia's separatist ambitions in Eastern Ukraine.
It will also eschew, where possible, support for Russia in international
forums. Emblematic of this policy was the March 2 meeting in the United
Nations General Assembly when Iran, rather than siding with Russia,
abstained from the vote which condemned the invasion. Russia's poor
military performance, and the West's ability to act unanimously, serve
as a warning for the Islamic Republic that it may one day have to soak
up even more Western pressure if Europe, the US, and other democracies
act in union. In the meantime, [like
China](https://chinaobservers.eu/china-struggles-to-strike-a-balance-amid-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/),
Iran will hope to benefit from the magnetic pull of the Ukraine war.
With so much governmental, military and diplomatic attention demanded by
the conflict, it will for the time being serve as a distraction from
Iran's ambitions elsewhere.

#### Ukraine thumps

Mark N. **Katz**, 3-23-20**15**, \"Russian-Iranian Relations in the
Shadow of Ukraine,\" Wilson Center,
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/russian-iranian-relations-the-shadow-ukraine

On March 23, 2015, the Middle East Program and the Kennan Institute at
the Woodrow Wilson Center hosted an event, "Russian-Iranian Relations in
the Shadow of Ukraine" with Katz, also a former scholar of the Woodrow
Wilson Center. Haleh Esfandiari, Director of the Middle East Program,
Woodrow Wilson Center, moderated the event. Katz began by stating that
the character of Russian-Iranian relations is much different since the
election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani than it was in the past. He
[noted the tension between the United States and Russia has increased
because of the escalating crisis between Russia and Ukraine. However, he
emphasized that for the first time since the 1979 Iranian Revolution
there is hope for an improvement in U.S.-Iranian relations. It is not
likely that U.S.-Russian relations **will improve** in the coming years,
however. Katz then explained how the nuclear negotiations are playing a
large role in the three countries' relations with one
another.]{.underline} He said Russia would not interfere in the nuclear
talks because it is not in a position to stop them but argued that
Russia would not benefit from improved U.S.-Iranian relations because
sanctions against Iran would be lifted with a deal, allowing for Iranian
oil imports. Furthermore, Katz stated that despite the illusion of a
stronger alliance created by the visits of Russian officials to Iran and
vice-versa, there is still a significant amount of history between the
two countries. For example, the division of the Caspian Sea is still an
unresolved conflict between Russia and Iran, and Iran remains resentful
of Russia for Soviet support of Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq War.
Katz emphasized that while [the media may portray U.S.-Iranian relations
**as straine**d, Russian-Iranian relations **are much more
hostile.**]{.underline} Katz argued that despite the differences Russia
and Iran may have, they share the same view on multiple issues. He
stated that both countries are fearful of the Taliban regaining control
and influence in Afghanistan. In addition, both countries support Bashar
al-Assad's regime in Syria and provide military assistance to Assad.
Russia and Iran also both have a common interest in joining the fight
against ISIS, which poses a threat to both countries' national security.
Regarding a potential nuclear agreement between Iran and the P5+1, Katz
stated that Russia is very conflicted---Russia does not see Iran
acquiring nuclear power as the worst case scenario but is concerned
about an improvement in U.S.-Iran relations. Although Russia is not in a
position to block the nuclear deal, it hopes it will benefit from the
failure to secure a deal. On the topic of Russia-Iran relations with
regard to the Ukrainian conflict, Katz argued that Iran is not concerned
with the issue and has kept its distance from the matter. [Katz stated
that Iran would benefit from the crisis because it gives the country
**more leverage with the** West, considering that the West will want to
reduce their dependence on Russian]{.underline} gas and would be more
likely to turn to Iran for support. In response to a question from Jane
Harman, President of the Wilson Center, on whether Russia will benefit
from taking Iran's reprocessed fuel if the negotiations succeed, Katz
said that Russia would benefit greatly from this because it would
produce a profit, but whether or not this will put Russia in the good
graces of the West is questionable because of the escalation and
severity of the Ukraine crisis. Esfandiari asked what effect Russia's
rush to sign agreements on additional nuclear power plants with Iran
will have on the talks. Katz answered that Russia views the negotiations
as an opportunity for the United States to gain commercial profit rather
than a national security issue. Therefore, Russia is attempting to sign
as many agreements as possible with Iran before the United States has an
opportunity to lift the sanctions.

#### Turn - NATO expansion improves Iran Russia relations

foreign policy at Newsweek, where he specializes in the Middle East,
North Korea and other areas of international affairs and conflict. He

"As NATO Grows, China and Russia Seek to Bring Iran, Saudi Arabia Into
Fold",
<https://www.newsweek.com/nato-grows-china-russia-seek-bring-iran-saudi-arabia-fold-1720780>)

[Finland and Sweden\'s green light to join NATO is set to bring about
the U.S.-led Western military alliance\'s largest expansion in
decades.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the G7, consisting of NATO states and
fellow U.S. ally Japan, has adopted a tougher line against Russia and
China. [In the East, however, security and economy-focused blocs led by
Beijing and Moscow are looking to take on new members of their own,
including Iran and Saudi Arabia, two influential Middle Eastern rivals
whose interest in shoring up cooperation on this new front could have a
significant impact on global geopolitical balance.]{.underline} The two
bodies in question are the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and
BRICS. The former was established in 2001 as a six-member political,
economic and military coalition including China, Russia and the Central
Asian states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan before recruiting
South Asian nemeses India and Pakistan in 2017, while the latter is a
grouping of emerging economic powers originally consisting of Brazil,
Russia, India and China (BRIC) upon its inception 2006, and including
South Africa in 2010. \"[The BRICS and the SCO share one important
ideological quality: they are both focused on multipolarity, and their
summits have even been held back to back with one another at
times]{.underline},\" Matthew Neapole, an international affairs expert
and contributor to the Macdonald-Laurier Institute in Canada, told
Newsweek. \"Both are angling to act as force multipliers for this drive
for multipolarity, to help along with alternatives \[i.e, in currency or
banking\],\" he added. \"It could, in theory, facilitate economic
linkages and step into gaps that U.S. institutions are not filling due
to sanctions, such as those laid on Russia.\" Iran, already an SCO
observer, began its formal membership ascension process amid the latest
leaders\' summit in September. On Monday, the Iranian Foreign Ministry
announced the Islamic Republic would also seek to join BRICS. [Across
the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia has also reportedly considered applying
for BRICS membership, as revealed by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov during his visit to the kingdom in late May]{.underline}. The
announcement followed Saudi Arabia joining Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia,
Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Senegal, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates at
China\'s invitation for a \"BRICS+\" discussion, after which Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced members had
\"reached consensus on the BRICS expansion process.\" Of these
candidates, Argentina has already applied for membership, potentially
advancing the group\'s status toward being a major player in
international economic relations. And with the SCO seeking to grow as
well, Beijing and Moscow might be poised to advance their effort to sway
the international influence equilibrium toward a broader group of
countries that do not necessarily sign on to an explicitly U.S.-led
international order. And while Neapole argued that there would be \"big
hurdles to get over\" in trying to transform this vision from ambitious
talk to substantive action, he said a cohesive SCO-BRICS bloc could have
a huge impact on reshaping the world order. [\"If it can be successful
in positioning itself as the standard-bearer of the Global South or G20,
develop strong organizational mechanisms and integrate more
thoroughly,\" he said, \"it could be quite influential.\"]{.underline}
BRICS\' multipolar approach to international affairs has proven
attractive to both Iran and Saudi Arabia alike. The two nations,
however, have their own unique reasons for seeking membership. For
Riyadh, the move would likely be less about choosing sides against the
close ties it has fostered for decades with Washington and more about
the kingdom\'s own growing status as an independent player. \"China\'s
invitation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to join the \'BRICS\' confirms
that the Kingdom has a major role in building the new world and became
an important and essential player in global trade and economics,\"
Mohammed al-Hamed, president of the Saudi Elite group in Riyadh, told
Newsweek. \"Saudi Arabia\'s Vision 2030 is moving forward at a confident
and global pace in all fields and sectors.\" This vision, unveiled by
Prince Mohammed bin Salman a year before being appointed as heir to the
throne and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia in 2017, outlined a plan to
diversify his country\'s oil-dependent economy and present a new image
of the kingdom to the international community. [And while Crown Prince
Mohammed has sought to enhance cooperation with the U.S., especially as
President Joe Biden prepared this month for his first visit to the
monarchy he once branded a \"pariah\" over alleged human rights abuses,
the Saudi royal has also expanded ties with Russia and China in recent
years.]{.underline} Joining BRICS would demonstrate a commitment to
Riyadh\'s resolve in dealing with other major powers and mark a
significant win for the effort to boost economic frameworks established
outside of the auspices of the U.S. and its immediate allies. \"This
accession, if Saudi joins it, will balance the world economic system,
especially since the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of
oil in the world, and it\'s in the G20,\" Hamed said. \"If it happens,
this will support any economic movement and development in the world
trade and economy, and record remarkable progress in social and economic
aspects as Saudi Arabia should have partnerships with every country in
the world.\" [This approach came in stark contrast to that of
Washington, which has regularly shut out countries it disagreed with
through a growing list of sanctions. The U.S.\' dominant position in the
global financial system has traditionally left few options for these
nations, but that situation has gradually changed as frameworks like
BRICS offer potential ways to dodge these restrictions]{.underline}.
[Among those countries looking to counter U.S. economic pressure is
Iran. International sanctions against the Islamic Republic in response
to its nuclear activities were lifted in 2015 after a multilateral
nuclear deal was reached with the U.S. and other major powers, including
China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom, but
then-President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, severely
impacting Tehran\'s ability to trade with the international
community]{.underline}. Biden has set out to negotiate a potential
return to the accord that was reached during his vice presidency under
former President Barack Obama. However, a series of negotiations held
since April of last year has left the U.S. and Iran at an impasse and
another set of talks held in Qatar this week appeared to end early with
no sign of a breakthrough. Frustration over shifting politics in
Washington has led Tehran to increasingly look to its own region for
strategic partnerships, which it has increasingly forged with Beijing
and Moscow. [\"Iranian officials have come to the conclusion that the
U.S. and its Western allies will never allow the Islamic Republic of
Iran to play its well-deserved regional role as a middle power,\"
Zakiyeh Yazdanshenas, a research fellow at the Center for Middle East
Strategic Studies in Tehran, told Newsweek.]{.underline} \"Therefore,
they have decided to neutralize U.S. attempts to isolate Iran by further
closing to non-western bodies like SCO and BRICS,\" she added. \"In
addition, [Iranians consider the future world order to be Eastern and
they are trying to get closer to organizations in which Eastern powers
such as Russia and China play a significant role.\"]{.underline} This
doesn\'t mean that the two blocs are necessary anti-Western in nature.
Though a concerted effort has emerged to empower countries outside of
the traditional G7 grouping from which Russia was suspended in 2014 as
conflict first erupted over Ukraine and other major economies such as
China and India have not been invited, the SCO and BRICS, which are not
formal military alliances like NATO, saw themselves as inherently
inclusive. \"The SCO and the BRICS have not been established as an
alternative to Western organizations,\" Yazdanshenas said, \"and their
specific function has not been defined on the basis of confrontation
with the West or the existing world order.\" Still, she argued that
growing international competition has only intensified \"the balancing
function of non-Western organizations\" such as the SCO and BRICS. And
here, she said Iran could serve as an important asset for both
coalitions. [\"Joining a moderate power with an anti-Western approach
such as Iran to these bodies can strengthen this aspect of SCO and
BRICS,\" Yazdanshenas said. \"Iran has been under the most severe
sanctions in the last decade, yet it has been able to significantly
expand its power in the region.\"]{.underline} And, like Saudi Arabia,
[Iran\'s oil and gas reserves make it an important strategic partner,
especially given the worsening frictions over global energy that have
been exacerbated by Western sanctions on Russia, and heated rivalry
between Beijing and Washington.]{.underline} \"[Iran is the only
producer of energy resources in the Persian Gulf that is not an ally of
the United States and will not refuse to supply energy to China in the
event of an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and
Washington]{.underline},\" Yazdanshenas said. \"In addition, [Iran\'s
geopolitical position has been strengthened in the wake of
Russia-Ukraine war and that is of great importance for great powers in
these bodies i.e. Russia and China.\"]{.underline} The energy problem
plays into two key reasons having both Iran and Saudi Arabia on board
for BRICS would be a \"major gain\" for the organization, according to
Akhil Ramesh, a fellow at the Hawaii-based Pacific Forum. \"For
countries like China and to an extent India, import dependency for oil
has been a major headache, both from an economic standpoint of trade
deficits and from a geopolitical standpoint of having to make security
and strategic sacrifices for the sake of oil imports,\" Ramesh said.
\"Having three large oil producers in the grouping \[Russia, Iran and
Saudi Arabia\] could possibly give these countries the option of
securing oil at discounted rates or through alternative arrangements
\[barter\].\" Tehran and Riyadh\'s oil reserves would also lend BRICS a
stronger hand in taking on the U.S. dollar\'s hegemony over the world
financial system as Ramesh argued that, \"in order to replace the USD as
the global reserve currency you would need to have more
commodity-exporting countries, especially oil exporting ones buying into
the idea.\" \"Moreover,\" he added, \"[China and Russia are expanding
the grouping to create a coalition of countries that have pending
disputes with the West or have been humiliated by the West in the past
\[thinking Argentina and Falklands\].\"]{.underline} And in this
respect, Ramesh expressed that the U.S. and its allies had committed \"a
grave error\" in overlooking the importance of BRICS, as well as the
SCO, emerging financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank and the National Development Bank and China\'s broader
Belt and Road Initiative, which counts some 148 countries and 32
international organizations as partners. \"The U.S. and its allies are
grossly underestimating China, in particular,\" Ramesh said. \"BRICS,
SCO, development banks such as AIIB, NDB, and infrastructure initiatives
such as China\'s BRI are all different platforms for engaging mostly
poor countries that do not get a say in world affairs or have a seat at
the high table.\" As internal divisions have threatened to derail
NATO\'s agenda, feuds among members also serve as a complicating factor
for organizations led by China and Russia. And even if Iran and Saudi
Arabia were to both join BRICS, it would not necessarily prove a
breakthrough in their bitter rivalry. The two nations have pursued quiet
diplomacy over the past year, but their regional bout for influence has
continued to rage across the Middle East, most violently so in Yemen,
which has been devastated by a years-long war between a Saudi-led
coalition in support of an exiled government on one side and the
Iran-aligned Ansar Allah, or Houthi, rebels on the other. The conflict
has only quieted in recent months as a result of a fragile three-month
truce and not necessarily because of any lasting solution. [But China
and Russia have demonstrated a capacity to bring enemies together under
a common banner as seen with the SCO\'s simultaneous admission of India
and Pakistan five years ago.]{.underline} Yaroslav Lissovolik, a
Moscow-based Russian International Affairs Council expert and Valdai
Discussion Club program director, said BRICS too has the capacity to
host countries with clashing worldviews, mentioning the specific case of
China and India, whose rivalry has turned occasionally turned violent,
and even deadly, along their disputed Himalayan border. And while he
said that the \"expansion of the BRICS core membership may indeed result
in greater challenges in attaining consensus on key decisions going
forward,\" he felt there was ample room to work together on broader
questions. \"In this respect, the addition of Iran and Saudi Arabia
would not change matters fundamentally within BRICS as there is scope
for a divergence in views,\" Lissovolik told Newsweek, \"and while there
may be disagreement on particular local/regional problems, there may be
greater unity on global issues.\" He argued that disputes among members
have not stopped BRICS from managing \"to advance with an increasingly
ambitious development agenda, including with respect to launching the
BRICS+ initiative and the pragmatic cooperation within the BRICS
development institutions.\" \"What this means is that the BRICS offer
the possibility of development on the basis of divergence in economic
models and approaches to economic modernization rather than convergence
towards one particular universal model,\" Lissovolik said. \"While
allowing for the differences in views and approaches among their
members,\" he added, \"BRICS economies can move decisively forward in
tackling those global challenges where they manage to forge a
consensus.\"

#### Russia and Iran are only brought together because of NATO and the US' expansion

**Tasnim News Agency**, 5-17-20**22**, \"Iranian Spokesman Blames
Ukraine Crisis on NATO's Expansion,\"
https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2022/05/17/2712467/iranian-spokesman-blames-ukraine-crisis-on-nato-s-expansion

[Iran\'s envoy to Russia has said NATO\'s expansion **is not** in the
interest **of Tehran and Moscow**, and there is a global synergy against
Western "unilateralism." The comments came as Iran has supported
Russia's invasion of Ukraine by **blaming** the United States **and
NATO** for the ensuing crisis. During a webinar about bilateral
relations and regional developments, Kazem Jalali urged closer
cooperation with Moscow under President Vladimir Putin, saying, "We are
working with Russia on regional issues, and have a successful experience
in Syria's case", Jamaran News in Tehran reported on Monday.
\"Obviously, neither we nor the Russians see NATO expanding to our
borders in our interest,\" said Tehran's ambassador in Moscow. Turkey, a
NATO member borders Iran in the northwest but has followed a neutral
policy between the Washington and Tehran. Jalali added that Russia has
stood up to American unilateralism, noting that this is the same
approach that the Islamic Republic has taken since the 1979 revolution.
Jalali noted that Iran did not have good relations with the Tsarist
Russia, the Soviet Union, and in the post-Soviet period,
adding]{.underline}, "The fourth era is the Putin era, which I think
should be paid more attention to". Judging by the history of Iran-Russia
relations, "some people ask why we should have relations with the
Russians when we have such a history with them. We should know that
during the Soviet era 25 million people were killed in the war with
Germany" but that didn't stop them to cooperate on the Nord Stream
\--the system of offshore natural gas pipelines in Europe that runs
under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. He added that "we should
look at the realities of today", underlining that Iran's new government
prioritizes relations and strengthening cooperation with neighboring
countries, and "Russia is a large economy." Jalali went on to say that
"our foreign policy should serve Iran's national interests", urging to
keep a balance between the West and the East. In fact, in the past 30
years under Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei Iran's foreign policy has
increasingly tilted toward Russia and China. In the 1980s, when the
founder of the Islamic Republic Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini was Supreme
Leader, the country followed his dictum of "Neither West Nor the East."
During the same event, former member of the parliament Elaheh Koulai
described ties between Iran and Russia as one of **[the most
importan]{.underline}**t issues in Eurasia. "There are bitter events in
the history of Iran-Russia relations that have caused pessimism and
Russophobia in Iranian society" she added. She called for a balancing
approach with Russia, Europe and the United States, saying, "we must try
to use Russia to our advantage". Referring to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, Koulai said, "Iran must condemn Russia\'s military action
against Ukraine and demand that the two sides sit down at the
negotiating table". As debate about Russia's invasion of Ukraine
continues in Iran, [divisions reflect the political
dispositions](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202202274930) of various
factions over Tehran's foreign policy. Hardliners close to the core of
the regime fiercely defend a pro-Russia policy, while their rivals
within the regime argue for more balanced relations between the West and
the East, meaning Moscow and Beijing. Many ordinary Iranians and
opponents of the Islamic Republic invariably [support
Ukraine](https://www.iranintl.com/en/202202265209) and condemn the
government pro-Russia policies on social media.

### 2AC -- AT: Syria Impact

#### Syria war wont go nuclear, Israel destroyed their ability to use them

**Farley 22** (Robert Farley, a frequent contributor to TNI, is author
of The Battleship Book, January 26, 2022, "How Israel Prevented Syria
From Developing Nuclear Weapons",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/reboot/how-israel-prevented-syria-developing-nuclear-weapons-199923>)

On September 6, 2007, [Israeli fighter-bombers destroyed a mysterious
installation near the Euphrates River in the Deir-ez-Zor region. The
strike incurred curiously little response from Damascus. A cyber-attack
reportedly pre-empted a defensive Syrian military mobilization, and even
the diplomatic outcry was muted.]{.underline} No other Arab governments
commented on the attack, and even the Israelis did not acknowledge the
operation for quite some time. Destroying the facility was not regarded
as a slam-dunk decision, either in Israel or the United States. Anxiety
over the strength of the intelligence in the wake of the Iraq debacle
stayed the hand of the latter, while concern about international
blowback, not to mention a Syrian military response, worried the former.
What if cooler heads had carried the day, and Israel had never
undertaken the strike? Nuclear Progress It's difficult to assess how far
Syria would have been from developing a nuclear weapon if its efforts
had gone unhindered. [Although we may never have the complete story
regarding Syria's interest in a nuclear program, it probably stemmed
from the growing gap in conventional capabilities between Syria and
Israel, as well as the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Although Syria has always
denied that the installation was part of a nuclear program, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) later confirmed that the site
appeared to be a nuclear reactor.]{.underline} There is little question
that Syria's program was rudimentary compared to those of Iran or North
Korea. However, it is entirely possible that Syria could have relied
upon technical assistance from both countries; indeed, it is highly
likely that North Korea supplied technical assistance for the
development of the reactor on the Euphrates. But Damascus would have
needed to master a series of technical challenges, and there is little
indication that Syrian economic infrastructure was up to the challenge
of managing the very serious industrial and bottlenecks that it would
have encountered. Although the Syrian economy is larger than that of
North Korea, it is more dependent on resource extraction, making it less
capable of managing the technical challenges associated with the nuclear
pivot. [Syria also lacks the enormous oil wealth enjoyed by both Iran
and Iraq during their nuclear drives.]{.underline} It became clear after
the destruction of the box that Assad wasn't all that committed to
paying the costs necessary to develop nuclear weapons. Unlike Iraq and
Iran, Damascus made little effort to disperse and harden nuclear
facilities. Indeed, given Syria's proximity to Israel, it's difficult to
imagine how anyone in the country believed that the project could go
undetected. As Anthony Cordesman has argued, the nuclear program would
have been extraordinarily vulnerable at multiple points in its
development. This suggests that the [bureaucratic politics of the
nuclear program were complicated, and that Syria might not have gone
through with its development even in absence of the strike.
Nevertheless, Israel felt that even the remote possibility of a nuclear
Syria was worth curtailing, and that the strikes would have the added
benefit of reinforcing the Begin Doctrine.]{.underline} The Arab Spring
In any case, [it is extremely unlikely that even an unmolested Syria
could have successfully developed a nuclear weapon by the beginning of
the Arab Spring]{.underline}. The oset of the Syrian Civil War taxed the
Assad regime so dearly that it's unlikely it would have continued a
nuclear program. Would the nature of the war have changed if Syria had
still been actively pursuing [nuclear weapons? The war developed, to
some extent, out of the expectation of Western intervention. Anti-regime
forces took risks and made commitments out of the hope that the United
States and Europe would step up with active military support. The West
offered rhetorical support for toppling Assad, but only limited and
measured military assistance for anti-regime forces.]{.underline}
Clearly, the program itself would not have deterred the West; it could
not have produced a viable weapon by 2011. However, knowledge of an
existing nuclear program might have reduced Assad's standing in the West
even further, potentially making intervention more attractive. Moreover,
the [program would presumably have achieved some degree of technical
success in terms of the production of plutonium, the development of
associated nuclear technologies, and the training of a cadre of
scientists and engineers]{.underline}. This very success might have made
the West nervous---perhaps nervous enough to take a more assertive
policy against the Assad regime. The question is what impact the war
might have had on the knowledge and infrastructure developed around the
program, and how engineers and materials might have found their way into
the hands of ISIS or other rebel groups. ISIS took control of the site
in 2014, although the Syrian government likely would have defended it
more vigorously if an active reactor had remained. ISIS [would not have
been able to construct a useable weapon, and either the United States or
Syria likely would have destroyed any facilities before they fell into
the hands of the group]{.underline}---but it still would have been cause
for concern. And while ISIS could not have used the expertise or
equipment directly, it might have tried to export either, with dangerous
consequences. In any case, forces friendly to the United States captured
the area in 2017. Conclusion The strike on Syria was probably not
decisive in preventing Syria from getting a nuclear weapon; the program
was a long-shot from the beginning, and in all likelihood would have
ended at the onset of the Syrian Civil War. However, the strike helped
to confirm the regional sense of Israeli military power after the
failures of the war against Hezbollah, and undoubtedly also convinced
both Washington and Tehran that Israel would consider using military
force to prevent Iran from acquiring nukes. This, in turn, informed the
negotiating strategies of all of the parties to the JCPOA, which
continues to govern Iran's relations with the international community.
Whether that legacy will outlast 2018 remains in question.

which is used by Iran and Russia. It highlights what we assess to be the
Iranian movement of weapons, other material, and personnel to Syria with
the awareness and support of Moscow. This cooperation, which has allowed
Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) to
increase their capabilities and influence in Syria, should be concerning
for the United States as tensions increase between Washington and
Tehran. Yet Moscow's cooperation with Tehran is double-edged. Our
analysis also highlights Israeli attacks against Iranian or
Iranian-linked targets at T-4 Airbase in close proximity to Russian
aircraft. These developments suggest that Moscow is playing a delicate
game in Syria. It supports Iranian activity and aid in Syria, but also
explicitly or tacitly allows Israeli military actions against Iranian
targets. The rest of this brief is divided into four sections. The first
provides an overview of Russian-Iranian relations. The second section
analyzes satellite imagery of T-4 Airbase, focusing on the possible
Iranian movement of arms, other material, and personnel. The third
section highlights Israeli airstrikes in Syria, including at T-4
Airbase, in close proximity to Russian aircraft. The fourth provides a
brief conclusion. Russian-Iranian Partnership in Syria Russia and Iran
have developed a complex---and sometimes contentious---historical
relationship. During World War II, for example, the Soviet Union
occupied northern Iran, creating deep suspicion and mistrust among many
Iranians.2 Yet [Moscow and Tehran have developed a working relationship
in Syria, even though they have their own interests]{.underline}.
[Moscow's decision to become directly involved in the Syrian civil
war]{.underline}---including to work with Iran---was motivated by
several concerns. First was a [growing fear that Washington was
preparing to overthrow the Assad regime and replace it with a friendly
government, much like the United States had done in Afghanistan in 2001,
Iraq in 2003, and Libya in 2011.3 The possibility of losing Syria was
particularly alarming because Moscow had just lost its ally in
Ukraine]{.underline}. The 2014 Ukrainian revolution had ushered in a
pro- Western government in Kiev, further fueling Russian fears of U.S.
activity. Second, Syria had long been an important ally of Moscow. In
1946, the Soviet Union supported Syrian independence and provided
military assistance to the Syrian Arab Army. This cooperation continued
during the Cold War and endures under Russian President Vladimir Putin
today.4 Third, Russian leaders were concerned that Assad's collapse
would allow the Islamic State, al-Qaeda, and other terrorists to use
territory in Syria and Iraq to attract more fighters, improve their
capabilities, and spread terrorism in and around Russia. After all, over
9,000 individuals from Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia traveled
to Syria and Iraq to join Salafi-jihadist groups like the Islamic State
and al-Qaeda.5 Iran has its own interests in Syria. Following the onset
of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Iranian leaders became alarmed at the
rise of Sunni extremist groups like the Islamic State and U.S.,
European, and Gulf support to rebel groups.6 In addition to providing
light and heavy weapons to the Syrian regime and militias, up to 3,000
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force (IRGC-QF) helped plan and
execute campaigns such as the 2016 Battle of Aleppo (or Operation Dawn
of Victory).7 The IRGC-QF worked closely with the Assad regime and the
Russian military, which conducted strikes from Russian combat aircraft
and naval vessels in the Mediterranean Sea.8 Syrian forces and militias
supported by the IRGC-QF shelled rebel positions in Aleppo as Russian
close air support and Kalibr cruise missile strikes reduced entire
neighborhoods to rubble. By December 2016, ground forces routed rebel
forces, who departed under an agreement brokered by Russia, Turkey, and
Iran.9 Iranian support continues today. In addition, [Iranian leaders
have tried to use their activity in Syria to counter
Israel]{.underline}. Perhaps the most significant example is by
[encouraging the expansion of Lebanese Hezbollah and other militia
groups in Syria]{.underline}. Lebanese Hezbollah deployed up to 8,000
fighters to Syria and increased its arsenal with greater numbers and
ranges of rockets and missiles from Syrian territory.10 Hezbollah also
trained, advised, and assisted Shia and other non-state groups in Syria.
Today, the IRGC-QF works with thousands of trained fighters in Syria
operating in local militias. Many of these groups like Lebanese
Hezbollah possess advanced stand-off weapons, improved cyber
capabilities, more recruits, and more expansive forces in Syria capable
of striking Israeli targets. [While Russian-Iranian cooperation has been
contentious at times, both countries have collaborated in Syria in ways
that serve their own interests.]{.underline} One example of this
cooperation is at T-4 Airbase, which is located in eastern Homs
Governorate and roughly 100 miles northeast of Damascus. T-4 Airbase and
Flight Tracker Data Figure 1 shows the base using satellite imagery. On
the east side of the base is an apron (ramp) where aircraft,
helicopters, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are frequently parked.
On the west side is an apron where transport aircraft have been located
and where Israeli aircraft have struck targets. Figure 1: T-4 Airbase
Satellite imagery in Figure 2 highlights a Russian-made Ilyushin
Il-76-MD cargo aircraft on the base. This aircraft is likely the former
Russian Airforce Il-76 registered RA-76634, as indicated by the number
painted underneath the cockpit and livery of the aircraft.11 The imagery
shows the freighter being loaded or unloaded under the protection of
multiple Syrian air defense systems, including three SA-2 systems and a
Pantsir-S1--- all of which were provided by Russia.12 We assess that the
Il-76 and other commercial aircraft may have been used to transport
weapons, other material, or personnel from Iran into Syria, based on the
regular use of Il-76s for these purposes in Syria.13 Figure 2: Il-76 on
T-4 Runway Flight tracker data of the Il-76 aircraft indicates a recent
history of flights between Tehran and Damascus. As indicated on the
wing, the plane is registered as YK-ATD. The Prefix (YK) is the Syrian
country code. Other Syrian-owned Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft have similar
registry codes, such as YK-ATA, YK-ATB, and YK-ATC. Publicly available
flight tracker data indicates the YK-ATD makes regular flights between
Tehran and Damascus. As illustrated in Figure 3, on May 13, 2019, YK-ATD
departed Damascus International Airport. On May 14, 2019, the day we
observed YK-ATD at T-4 Airbase, flight records indicate the plane left
Tehran Mehrabad International Airport in the morning, arrived at what we
assess to be T-4 based on imagery analysis, and then departed for
Damascus International Airport in the afternoon. Our analysis of flight
history for other Syrian-owned Il-76 aircraft indicates similar flight
patterns between Iran and Syria for other aircraft, possibly for the
purpose of clandestinely transferring weapons, other material, and
personnel into Syria.14 Figure 3: Flight Data Tracker Map for YK-ATD As
shown in Figure 4, we identified four Russian fixed-wing Su-25 ground
attack aircraft with full weapons loads at the same site as the Il-76
aircraft, as well as an Mi-17 Hip transport helicopter and an Mi-24 Hind
attack helicopter.15 The proximity of Russian aircraft to the Il-76
suggests that Russia was highly likely aware of Iranian activity. It is
virtually inconceivable that Iran would transport and unload arms, other
material, and personnel to a base frequented by Russian aircraft and
government officials---and protected by Russian-made air defense
systems--- without Moscow's knowledge and approval. Figure 4: Russian
Su-25, Mi-24, and Mi-17 Aircraft on Runway The imagery also indicates
three active air defense sites around the perimeter of T-4 Airbase.
Figure 5 highlights one of these sites. All of the air defense sites are
equipped with Russian-made weapons systems. The first SA-2 air defense
site is situated to the north, another SA-2 air defense site is located
to the northwest, and a third SA-2 air defense site is to the south. The
SA-2 Guideline (Russian designation S-75 Dvina) is a high-altitude,
command guided, surface-to-air missile system (SAM) capable of
360-degree coverage. The SA-2 Guideline is designed for the defense of
fixed targets and field forces.16 The guidance system of an SA-2 site
can only focus on one target at a time but can direct three missiles
against a target simultaneously.17 This likely explains the need for
multiple SA-2 systems around the airbase. Figure 5: SA-2 Air Defense
System Also observable in the imagery is a Pantsir-S1 (NATO name---SA-22
Greyhound) transloader. The Panstsir-S1 is a short- to medium-range
missile and anti-aircraft artillery weapon produced by Russia. The
Pantsir-S1 provides point air defense for various installations and
provides protection to air defense units. Figure 6 illustrates the
Pantsir-S1 air defense system. Figure 6: S-1 Pantsir Air Defense System
All military assets in the imagery are Russian made. We assess that the
YK-ATD was likely either leased or sold to Syria.18 The Su-25 combat
aircraft, as well as the Mi-17 and Mi-24 rotary-wing craft, are likely
Russian operated.19 The SA-2 Guideline and Pantsir-S1 are Russian-built
SAM systems.20These air defense systems are just two of numerous air
defense systems provided by Russia to the Assad government. Others
include S-75s, S-200s, S-300s, and Strela-1/-10s.21 With Russian
support, Iran has used these types of activities to expand its presence
in Syria. Today, the IRGC-QF works with thousands of trained fighters in
Syria who are operating in local militias, including Lebanese Hezbollah.
The 2006 Israel-Hezbollah War demonstrated Israel's difficulty of
rooting out Hezbollah sites in Lebanon. Iran's activity in Syria has
only expanded the nature of this problem for Israel's military. Israeli
Airstrikes in the Shadow of the Bear Despite Russia's collaboration with
Iran, Moscow has also attempted to placate Israeli concerns about
Iranian expansion. This section highlights Israeli attacks against
Iranian or Iranian-linked targets---including at T-4 Airbase in close
proximity to Russian aircraft. These developments suggest that Moscow
supports Iranian activity and aid in Syria, but also condones some
Israeli military actions against Iranian targets. Russia and Israel have
established deconfliction mechanisms, including a hotline between the
Israeli and Russian militaries. As one Israel Defense Force official
remarked, "We are very strict about informing the Russians about our
activities and that their operational picture is up to date."22 This
cooperation is particularly important to avoid incidents like the one in
September 2018. Following an Israeli strike against Iranian-linked
targets in western Syria, Syrian gunners accidentally shot down a
Russian IL-20 surveillance aircraft. Russia complained that Israel had
given Russian leaders less than a minute of advanced warning and Israeli
aircraft used "the Russian airplane as a cover."23 Despite some
improvements in cooperation, Russia has occasionally condemned Israel
for its actions in Syria. In July 2019, for example, Russia publicly
criticized a series of Israeli strikes, saying that that they "grossly
violate\[d\] Syria's sovereignty.24 Figure 7 plots the location of
Israeli airstrikes against Iranian and other targets in Syria. The
darker shades of blue in the heat map indicate a higher concentration of
Israeli strikes. Most of Israel's attacks have been in southwestern
Syria, near the Israeli border. But a few attacks have been against
major bases used by Iran and Iranian-linked groups, including T-4
Airbase, the airbase north of al-Qusayr, and Damascus International
Airport. Figure 7: Israeli Strikes in Syria On June 2, 2019, Israel
conducted an airstrike on T-4 Airbase.25 This strike, along with similar
strikes conducted in 2019, indicate that Israel is still committed to
contesting attempts by Iran to entrench itself and its non-state partner
forces in Syria. As highlighted in Figure 8, satellite imagery taken
before and after the Israeli airstrike indicates that a UAV control
vehicle, launch ramp, and ground equipment were likely targeted. This
airstrike, which was conducted in close proximity to Russian
infrastructure on the base, highlights the ongoing challenge Israel
faces when conducting strikes near Russian forces. Figure 8: Before and
After Imagery of Israeli Strike Against Iranian-Linked Target at T-4
Conclusion The Trump administration has expressed [significant **concern
about Iran's nuclear ambitions**, its missile program, and the
activities of the IRGC-QF and its partner forces in the Middle East. One
of the countries where Iran has been most active is **Syria**, where
Tehran has increased its military presence to aid the Assad regime;
supported Lebanese Hezbollah, which has been directly involved in the
**Syrian ground war**; and expanded the number of rockets and missiles
in the country to establish a second front (along with Lebanon) in a
future war with Israel. Yet Iranian actions in Syria have been possible,
in part, because of Tehran's **cooperation with Moscow**. Containing
Iran and preventing further Iranian expansion in the Middle East will be
difficult without **increasing pressure on Moscow**.]{.underline} If
Washington wants to be more effective in containing Iran, U.S.
policymakers need to put greater pressure on Moscow to curb Tehran's
movement of arms, material, and people--- as this case study of T-4
Airbase highlights.

RES

[After nearly a year of painstaking negotiations, Iran and world powers
were on the brink of agreeing to restore the landmark 2015 nuclear deal.
But last-minute demands from Russia, one of the parties to the deal,
have threatened to derail efforts to revive an agreement that curbed
Tehran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of international
sanctions. Moscow has demanded guarantees from Washington that Western
sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine will not affect its trade and
military cooperation with Tehran. The United States has described
Russia\'s new demands as \"irrelevant.\"]{.underline} France, another
signatory of the original deal, warned they could dash hopes for a
revived nuclear accord. [Moscow' actions have been met with **surprise
and anger in Tehran**. Iran's foreign minister told lawmakers on March
7, without naming Russia, that Tehran would not let its interests be
undermined by "foreign elements." Experts warn that Russia's demands
could complicate and ultimately **scuttle** the already fraught
negotiations between Iran and world powers. If the talks collapse, Iran
could further advance its sensitive nuclear activities. It could also
lead to Western countries further tightening **sanctions against
Tehran**. Observers say Iran and world powers could **sideline Russia
from the negotiations**, although it is unclear whether Tehran would be
willing to risk jeopardizing its relationship with Moscow, an
ally.]{.underline} Iran and world powers have been holding negotiations
in Vienna since April 2021, with the United States taking part
indirectly. In 2018, then-U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew
Washington from the deal. Tehran responded by gradually exceeding the
limits imposed by the pact on its nuclear activities. U.S. President Joe
Biden has said he is willing to rejoin the pact if Iran return to full
compliance. \'Stabbed In The Back\' Ali Vaez, the director of the Iran
Project at the International Crisis Group, says that by inserting [the
war in Ukraine into the complicated nuclear negotiations, Russia appears
to be determined to upend the talks and take Iran down with
it.]{.underline} He suggested that [Russia appears no longer to be
interested in reviving the nuclear deal, which would allay Western
concerns over Iran's nuclear activities and allow Tehran to sell its
oil. And that could bring global oil prices down.]{.underline} "Neither
Iran\'s return to the oil market nor the peaceful resolution of a
Western security concern in the Middle East benefits the Kremlin," Vaez
told RFE/RL. "The leadership in Tehran is waking up to the reality that
you often get stabbed in the back by those you believed to have your
back." \'Tank The Talks\' Analysts say the scope of Russia's demands
will determine whether they complicate or scuttle the negotiations
entirely. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on March 5 said that
Moscow wanted written guarantees that sanctions ''launched by the U.S.
will not in any way harm our right to free, fully fledged trade and
economic and investment cooperation and military-technical cooperation
with Iran." Russia's new demands coincided with mounting international
pressure on Moscow over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February
24, a move that has resulted in unprecedented Western sanctions. U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken dismissed Russia's demands on March 6,
saying U.S. sanctions that are "being put in place and that have been
put in place on Russia have nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal."
"If it is simply exemptions that allow Russia to help Iran meet its
nuclear obligations in the deal, that is one thing," Eric Brewer, a
senior director at Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI), a Washington-based
think tank, told RFE/RL. "But Lavrov\'s comments suggest Russia is after
something much bigger. [I don\'t see the United States giving Russia
that type of sanctions relief, even if it endangers a revival of the
\[nuclear deal\],"]{.underline} he added. Brewer says the United States
and Russia have been able to cooperate on shared nonproliferation
interests in the past, even when tensions have been high. But he says it
is possible that Russia's recent demands \"tank the talks.\" \'Critical
Decision\' Vali Nasr, a professor of international affairs and Middle
East studies at Johns Hopkins University, says [Russia's demands have
forced Iran to make a difficult choice: to stick by Russia and incur the
**diplomatic and economic costs** of the talks collapsing or to ditch
Moscow and endanger its ties with an ally.]{.underline} "Iran would have
to decide how important an agreement is to its national interest, and
whether it will allow talks it has invested so much in and built its
economic and foreign policies around \[to\] be taken hostage by Russia,"
Nasr, who served as a senior adviser to the Obama administration, told
RFE/RL. "[It will be a critical decision for Tehran]{.underline}." [Nasr
suggested that **sidelining Russia was possible**.]{.underline} "[The
nuclear side of things is in Iran's hand. The sanctions are in the hands
of the U.S. and Europe. Russia\'s only leverage is to prevent a
deal]{.underline}," Nasr said. Brewer says the other parties to the deal
would have to find ways to replace Russia's technical role under the
deal, including removing excess enriched uranium from Iran. "Given
enough time, you could probably come up with some workarounds for other
parties to take Russia\'s place on these technical areas," he says.
\"But it won\'t be easy, and time is in short supply. \"[At a practical
level, it would be incredibly challenging to reimplement the deal if
Russia, the United States, and Europe are not in alignment on the
\[nuclear deal\] and if Russia is actively trying to play the role of
**spoiler**]{.underline}."

#### Russia-North Africa relations are strong -- currently displacing US influence

[**Russia's Reach Grows in North Africa** Esper's tour came amid Russian
moves to bolster its foothold in neighboring Libya, where Moscow
backs]{.underline} the Libyan National Army ([LNA]{.underline}) of
eastern strongman Khalifa Haftar. Mercenaries from the Kremlin-backed
Wagner Group are also fighting alongside Haftar's forces against the
Turkey-backed Government of National Accord (GNA). The Russian
involvement in Libya is part of a regional strategy by President
Vladimir Putin after the 2011 Arab Spring revolution to return to
regions where Moscow used to be a key player. [Russia perceived the Arab
Spring revolutions as part of a US-sponsored plan to carry out regime
changes in the Middle East and North Africa, causing Moscow to lose its
influence in the region]{.underline}. [As part of the new Russian
strategy in the region, Moscow provided support to]{.underline} the
Bashar [al-Assad regime in Syria]{.underline} against Turkey-backed
opposition groups. The Russian military support has helped tip the tide
of the war in Assad's favor and gained Moscow a foothold in the pivotal
Arab country. Washington's Fear of Russia's Future on the Libyan Coast
[Russia now has access to a naval base in Tartus on the Mediterranean
coast in Syria]{.underline}. This base can accommodate 11 warships and

**[Russia has also involved itself in Libya following a NATO-backed
uprising led to the ouster and subsequent death of]{.underline}** ruler
Muammar **[Gaddafi]{.underline}**. [Washington fears that if Russia
managed to earn military bases on Libya's coast, it would be able to
threaten southern Europe and reduce US ability to maneuver
militarily]{.underline}. **[Russia has also managed to forge a strong
relationship with the new regime in Egypt]{.underline}**, where it
signed a \$25-billion agreement to build the country's first nuclear
power plant. **[Moscow has also maintained a strong close relations with
Algeria]{.underline}**, which has relied on the Russian arms sales for
decades. **[Washington's allies Tunisia and Morocco have also edged
closer to Russia in recent years]{.underline}**. **[This increasing
Russian influence was quite visible]{.underline}** in Tunisia's tourism
industry, which is vital to the North African country's economy.

#### Relations are driven by a desire to take advantage of Western power declining

In March 2017, [Moscow received Prime Minister Netanyahu]{.underline}
(for his fifth visit in ten months). [Alongside the visits
of]{.underline} Turkish president [Erdogan and]{.underline} the Iranian
president [Rouhani, Moscow has found a new role for itself in the Middle
East where it intends to remain for a long time]{.underline}. **[Its
involvement in Libya and in particular its support for]{.underline}**
"Marshal" **[Haftar further strengthen this assessment]{.underline}**.
**[This new geopolitical structure marks a stark contrast with that of
the 1990s, characterised by a considerable weakening of Russia's
influence across the broader region]{.underline}**. As Russian political
scientist Aleksei Mlachenko explains, [Russia had then "abstained from
independent endeavours in Near Eastern politics, giving the initiative
entirely to its American and European partners]{.underline}." On the one
hand, the profound financial and economic crisis that Russia has faced
has stopped its diplomatic system from having effective means of action,
thus forcing it to prioritise certain areas outside of North Africa/the
Middle East. (These included ex-Soviet republics, the Euro-Atlantic
world and China). This marked a considerable break with the Soviet
posture during the Cold War when the Soviet Union was actively involved
in the region. From the mid-1950s, it actively promoted itself and
extended its influence in economic, military and ideological terms. The
area was of particular importance to the Soviet Union due to the
proximity of the region to its borders. Indeed, the disappearance of the
ideological dimension in the conduct of Russian foreign policy
undoubtedly reduced the importance of certain traditional partnerships
in the Middle East. The new importance given to the development of a
"strategic partnership" with Western countries prescribed "an extreme
prudence, if not a distance, with regards to the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict amongst other sources of tension in the Middle East." **[Around
the middle of the 2000s, when Russia recovered to relative economic
health, it was able to work at a renewal of its regional
presence]{.underline}**. This set a new tone in its foreign policy with
declarations of a Russian agenda concerning the main international
security issues. **[This was driven by a desire to distinctly mark its
independence from Washington]{.underline}** (**[whom the Russians
believed had tarnished its image following the Iraq war and its
spillovers]{.underline}**). Moreover, [it was characterised by an active
promotion of its commercial interests]{.underline} (the "economisation"
of Russian foreign policy) [alongside the implementation of an "energy
diplomacy."]{.underline} Finally, support for armament exports was a
unique opportunity to showcase Russian technological advances. **[If
Russian activism is more visible on the Middle Eastern front, Moscow has
also redeployed its interests in the Maghreb]{.underline}**. This
entrance into the Maghreb and Mashrek should be seen as part of a logic
of geographical continuum. In 2005, it obtained observer state status in
the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation. [The Arab Spring firmly
"shook" the process of Russian reengagement in the North African/Middle
Eastern zone.]{.underline} [Despite a willingness to act, Russian
involvement has been extremely gradual]{.underline} (and devoid of any
spectacular successes). **[Moscow was relatively reserved in its
reaction to revolutions and demonstrated a preference for the
maintenance of the status quo and the "legitimate" powers prioritising
stability]{.underline}** (independent of the nature of said regimes).
**[This attitude marks a certain continuity in Moscow's rejection to
what it sees as the inclination of Western countries to support regime
change]{.underline}**. **[This has been the case in certain
countries]{.underline}** (Serbia 1999, Iraq 2003, the Rose Revolution in
**[Georgia 2003]{.underline}**, the Orange Revolution in **[Ukraine
2004]{.underline}**) and occasionally **[through the use of
force]{.underline}**. This explains the recurrence of calls by the
Russian authorities to stop intervening in Arab revolutions. [The
Russian reaction can also be explained through fear of an expansion of
Middle Eastern political instability]{.underline}. Indeed, from the
outset, [the Russian authorities have voiced their concern at the the
possibility that revolution might principally benefit
Islamists]{.underline}. The conservative posture of Russia on the Arab
Spring will have been received differently at the regional level. On the
one hand, according to certain experts, the Algerian regime appreciated
the Russian contribution to the development of cooperation projects of
Sonatrach-Gazprom. On the other, the support of key figures in the
Russian government to Muammar Gaddafi will take a long time to be
forgotten in Tripoli. In any case, [after the erosion of its positions
in Iraq and in the 2003 war, Russia is determined to prevent the
repetition of scenarios of regime change]{.underline}. [This is clearly
the case in Libya and Syria, two countries it considers as important
stepping stones in its return strategy to the Middle East]{.underline}.
The UN intervention in Libya and the elimination of Muammar Ghaddafi
explain to a large extent the subsequent obstruction of Moscow on the
Syrian question. [When several Western powers argue that there cannot be
a political solution to the intra-Syrian conflict with the maintenance
of President Assad, Russia concludes that Syria will be the next country
on the list of regime change]{.underline}. This threatens to deny it one
of its most stable, if not main allies in the region. In turn, this
allows Russian experts to state that the rescue of the Syrian regime is
the most important of considerations that underpins the Kremlin line on
Syria. When Moscow justifies its military intervention in Syria through
issues touching at the stability of the region "it is a lie. Russia,
first and foremost supports Bashar Al-Assad!" Another parameter through
which to analyse Russia's desire for regional influence can be found in
an element of context. **[Moscow estimates that the world is witnessing
the collapse of the old regional order and that this constitutes
evidence of what it identifies, correctly or not, as the end of the
"Western moment" in international relations]{.underline}**. **[For the
Kremlin, this new configuration constitutes an opportunity allowing an
acceleration of Russia's reinsertion of Russia in the
region]{.underline}**. **[Such a reintroduction is also seen by Moscow
as a necessity in the context of conflict with Ukraine as it has to be
demonstrated by any means that Russia is not as isolated as the West
argues.]{.underline}** However, this endeavour also contains certain
risks, notably due to the fragility of the situation and the volatility
of political equilibriums prevalent in the region. 1 -- The return of
Russia into North Africa and the Middle East: Multiple motivations. 1.1
-- **[Russia as a power seeking global hegemony in a "post-Western"
international context]{.underline}** Through the assertion that Russia
is "no more" than a regional power (2014), in an interview given to The
Economist, President Barack Obama undeniably "provoked" the Russian
authorities. Indeed, Russia under Putin has incessantly gone back on its
diplomacy of the 1990s to demonstrate its intent to weigh in on major
international issues. This is particularly shown in its activity on key
issues such as its role as a nuclear power and as a permanent member of
the Security Council. In its vision of the world, this is evidence of
its capacity to play a role in Middle Eastern affairs, an area that
strongly mobilises the attention of the international community. "Those
who are in a strong position in this region will have strong positions
in the world" argues Fyodor Lukyanov, a Russian political scientist
known to be close to the seat of power. In this context, **[Russia did
not hesitate to use rhetoric that denounced the West's moral
responsibility in bringing about the current Middle Eastern
predicament]{.underline}** (this is perfectly reflected by Vladimir
Putin's speech to the UN General Assembly in September 2015). **[This
speech aimed to strengthen his own role at the forefront of the
resolution of crises in the Middle East]{.underline}**. In any case,
[the post-Arab Spring situation has offered new ground which is
particularly favourable to the realisation of Russian ambitions. Indeed,
the United States is advocating less involvement whereas Europe seems to
be confused if not predominantly because of the EU's internal
travails]{.underline}. An additional factor which is related to Russia's
"Middle Eastern activism" can be found in its internal dynamics. Through
foreign success, the Kremlin is actively seeking to respond to domestic
issues. This is particularly notable in the economic sphere, where the
projection of an image of a strong Russia at the heart of international
issues serves as a solution to internal impediments. Before the Arab
Spring, many of the antiquated relationships established during the
Soviet Union era were far from having recovered to their previous level.
Indeed, even the strongest ties (Syria, Libya, Egypt and Algeria) were
far from a complete return to the Cold War paradigm. Moreover,
successive revolutions had compromised some of the advances that Moscow
had managed to achieve since the start of the 2000s. Thus, the war in
Syria represented a real opportunity for Russia to demonstrate its
renewed regional importance. Besides, **[there seems to have been a
certain vengeful dimension to the motivations of the Russian Federation
at the expense of Western countries]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[from a
Russian point of view, the military interventionism of Western states
deprived Moscow of traditional]{.underline}** (Saddam Hussein) **[or
potential allies]{.underline}** (Muammar Gadhafi). Today, [Russia seeks
to compensate for such perceived or actual geopolitical losses through a
return in the area, expedited through its involvement in the Syrian
question]{.underline}. **[This is certainly not unrelated to the Russian
official line on Libya where Moscow holds a very similar discourse to
that which it has developed in Syria since 2011.]{.underline}**
"Undoubtedly, it is only up to the Libyans themselves to determine who
runs the country. This should not and cannot be envisaged or imposed by
external actors" explains Vladimir Chizhov, Russian ambassador to the
European Union. Moscow's ambition to impose itself as a central power in
the Middle East had manifested itself in several ways before and since
the start of the intervention by Russian forces in Syria in September
2015. Moreover, it expressed itself far beyond the Syrian question with
Russian contributions to the Iranian nuclear debate and agreements with
the United States on chemical weapons in Syria (September 2013). This is
further highlighted by both the self-promotion undertaken by Moscow at
the heart of the Quartet and initiatives pertaining to the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. (The aim is to remove the idea that an
exclusively American process of negotiations is still an option,
following changes in Washington.) In any case, the **[Syrian question
has allowed Russia to interact with Washington on a more level playing
field]{.underline}** -- **[a key objective of Russian diplomacy in the
Middle East and the wider world]{.underline}**. Thus, the **[main aim of
Russia's military campaign in Syria is to impose itself as "co-leader"
with the United States on intra-Syrian negotiations and to draw up of a
peace initiative backed by both countries]{.underline}**. This comes
alongside saving Bashar Al-Assad who is in in increasingly dire straits.
At the time, the last step of Moscow's "Syria plan" aimed at forming a
vast coalition of Russia/the US/European countries/regional powers
(Iran, Iraq, Syria) against the so-called Islamic State. [It was thought
that this would help thaw the relationships between Russia and Western
countries putting them on an "equal footing" that the Kremlin never
ceases to aspire to and make claims to. Thus, it isn't rare to hear
Russian officials or political experts close to power underline that
Russia and the United States have common interests "in many regional
crises and zones of instability."]{.underline} Such areas include Syria,
Iraq and Afghanistan (which the Russian government links to the zone
under consideration.) [In the same way, when Russia is attempting to
strengthen its presence in North Africa, it is with the calculation that
this may open opportunities of interaction and dialogue with a certain
number of European countries that are interested in the evolution of the
regional situation]{.underline}. Undoubtedly, **[this is one of the key
agendas of its current position on Libya.]{.underline}** More broadly,
**[Russian policy in Northern Africa and the Middle East is undeniably
reactionary.]{.underline}** **[It marks a response to an international
environment which it perceives as undergoing profound changes relating
to the perceived or imagined decline of Western global leadership that
is undoubtedly desired by Russia]{.underline}**. **[The Kremlin enjoys
luring regional powers to the organisations which it promotes in a bid
to strengthen its vision of an increasingly multipolar global
order]{.underline}**. Such a reading of global geopolitics highlights
Russia's importance in achieving such goals. From this point of view,
the interest shown by Turkey in joining the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation or the possibility of Iran (observing member) fully joining
said organisation are useful stepping stones. The same can be said
regarding the anticipated alignment of Egypt's Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi and
the Eurasian Economic Union. Besides, **[Russia is certainly aware of
the inherent weaknesses hindering it weighing in as a global
power]{.underline}**. [Thus]{.underline}, [Russia is constantly
searching for new partnerships with regional powers that would increase
its international visibility and credibility throughout the Middle East
and elsewhere]{.underline}. This is the case in such countries as Iran,
Israel, Egypt and Morocco.

#### In particular, Russian cooperation with Algeria is key to prevent escalation of the Libyan civil war and massive instability throughout North Africa -- failure undermines global stability

former Soviet republics, "Understanding Russia-Algerian Strategic
Partnership", Modern Diplomacy, 7/19/20,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2020/07/19/understanding-russia-algerian-strategic-partnership/

For almost 20 years, **[Russia has pursued its economic cooperation and
other geo-strategic interests using the Declaration on Strategic
Partnership agreement]{.underline}** signed in 2001 **[with the Arab
Republic of Algeria in the Maghreb region]{.underline}**. The Maghreb
also known as Northwest Africa, the Arab Maghreb is a subregion of North
Africa that is effectively a western part of the Arab world and is
predominantly Muslim. In geopolitical context, **[Russia has excellent
relations with countries in this region compared to the rest of
Africa]{.underline}**. While that two-decade old Declaration on
Strategic Partnership agreement has primarily allowed Russia to step up
military-technical cooperation by supplying arms and military equipment,
[it also sets out principles for the consolidating long-term bilateral
policy goals between the two countries]{.underline}. During her weekly
media briefing, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova
hinted about the official visit of Algerian Foreign Minister Sabri
Boukadoum. "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will hold talks with
the Algerian Foreign Minister in Moscow on July 22 in order to maintain
dialogue on the current issues of bilateral relations and the issues on
the regional agenda," the diplomat said. She reminded that Russia and
Algeria had signed the Declaration on Strategic Partnership in 2001,
which set out the long-term goals of joint work. ["In nearly two
decades, we have managed to expand the basis of our cooperation
significantly. We are successfully developing mutually beneficial ties
in the economic, military-technical, research and humanitarian spheres,
and in 2019, the turnover between two states reached \$3.4 billion. This
is a significant figure]{.underline}," Zakharova said. Undoubtedly,
**[Russia has tried to sustain its multifaceted bilateral relations with
Algeria that plays an important role in maintaining regional stability
in North Africa]{.underline}**. Sabri [Boukadoum has served as Minister
of Foreign Affairs]{.underline} since April 2019. In this short period
though, **[he has expressed his country's keenness on resolving the
Libyan crisis through dialogue and maintaining the integrity of the
country's territory.]{.underline}** According to him, Algeria does not
accept the presence of foreign forces in Libya, regardless of which
country they represent. Currently there is an intense fight between the
Government of National Accord (GNA) and Marshal Khalifa Haftar's forces
(the opposition from the Eastern region) to control the Libyan capital.
There are external forces already supporting the two warring groups.
**[The inflow of arms for the conflicting sides in Libya is only
aggravating the situation in the country]{.underline}**. **[It adds to
the involvement of foreign mercenaries and the presence of extremist and
terrorist groups, whose activities reinvigorated jointly with the
military escalation and is threatening the local, regional and global
peace]{.underline}**. **[This development largely worries Algeria that
wanted to assist Libyans in addressing "structural governance and
security issues" and prevent a new Arab Spring from spilling over unto
its territory]{.underline}**. **[From Russia's perspective, besides
Algeria's role in ensuring regional stability in North Africa, this
country makes a significant contribution to the fight against terrorism
in the Sahara-Sahel zone, actively participates in international efforts
to achieve national accord in Mali, and has a constructive mediating
potential in the Libyan settlement]{.underline}**. On this basis,
**[Russia wants to proceed from the premise that the upcoming talks help
to strengthen multifaceted bilateral cooperation and to engage in the
peaceful negotiation process in]{.underline}** its neighboring
**[Libya]{.underline}**. [As a sign of cordial friendship, Russia prompt
responded to Algeria's request for humanitarian aid by delivering a
cargo full of medical protective equipment to help tackle the novel
coronavirus pandemic]{.underline}. That aid was purchased and delivered
by Rosoboronexport, which is the sole State Arms Exporter, on
instructions from the Russian government late April. Algeria has one of
the biggest number of coronavirus-related deaths among the African
nations, according to official statistics.

**[Weapons previously unseen in the conflict have now

to [show anti-Hifter fighters using an advanced Chinese-made FN-6

Gharyan]{.underline}, south of Tripoli, [when anti-Hifter forces
captured that town]{.underline} in June. **[That such armed groups are
deploying advanced weapons has dangerous implications.]{.underline}**
**[With continued exposure to and training on such systems, Libyan armed

2000s --- as well as in the Sahel in the 2010s --- **[militants from
other armed groups may come to Libya to receive training]{.underline}**.
**[If Libya becomes a nexus for growing expertise and potential outflow
of arms, increasingly deadly regional armed groups could further
destabilize the region.]{.underline}** As was the case between 2012 and
2014 when Libyan arms bolstered the arsenals of terrorist and separatist

#### Nuclear war

[THE MOST BASIC CHALLENGE]{.underline} facing the United States today
[is helping to preserve peace. The end of the Cold War]{.underline}
eliminated a potential threat to American security, but it [did not
eliminate conflict. In 1998 alone there were 27 significant conflicts in
the world, 25 of which involved violence within states. Nine of those
intrastate conflicts were in sub-Saharan Africa]{.underline}, where poor
governance has aggravated ethnic and social tensions. [The ongoing war
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been particularly
nightmarish, combining intrastate and interstate conflict with another
troubling element: military intervention driven by the commercial
motives of several neighboring states. Such motives could fuel future
confiicts in other weak states with valuable resources. Meanwhile, a
number of other wars-in Colombia, the former Yugoslavia, Cambodia,
Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi-have reflected historic enmities or
poorly resolved hostilities ofthe past]{.underline}. Intrastate
conflicts are likely to continue in weakly integrated, poorly governed
states, destroying lives and property; creating large numbers of
refugees and displaced persons, and threatening regional security [The
two interstate clashes in 1998\--between India and Pakistan and Eritrea
and Ethiopia-involved disputes over land and other natural resources.
Such contests show no sign of disappearing. **Indeed, with the spread of
weapons of mass destruction, these wars could prove more dangerous than
ever**.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- UQ -- Russia-North Africa Ties

#### Strategic partnership with North Africa is a priority of Russia's foreign policy.

**Klomegah, 6/29**

(Kester Kenn, journalist specializing on socio-economic and political
development issues in former Soviet republics, particularly in the
Russian Federation and Eurasia. Writes for Pressenza News,
Russia-African Relations in the Context of Geopolitical Changes,
https://www.pressenza.com/2022/06/russia-african-relations-in-the-context-of-geopolitical-changes/)

Russia plans to hold the second Russia-Africa summit later this year.
[Sergey Lavrov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation,
indicated in mid-June message that "in these difficult and crucial times
the **strategic partnership with Africa** has become a **priority of
Russia's foreign policy**. Russia highly appreciates the readiness of
Africans to further step up economic cooperation."]{.underline} Lavrov
said: "It is in the interests of our peoples to work together to
[**preserve and expand mutually beneficial trade a**nd investment ties
under these new conditions.]{.underline} It is important to [facilitate
the mutual access of Russian and African economic operators to each
other's markets and encourage their participation in large-scale
infrastructure projects.]{.underline} The signed agreements and the
results will be consolidated at the forthcoming second Russia-Africa
summit." The above statement arguably offers some implications
especially discussing this question of relationship-building. Lavrov has
aptly asserted that within the "emerging and sustainable polycentric
architecture of the world order" [relations with Africa is still a
priority,]{.underline} but Russians always close their eyes on the fact
that Russia's foreign policy in Africa has largely failed to pronounce
itself, in practical terms, as evidenced by the countable forays into
Africa by Russian officials.

#### America's history of isolationism to Africa has resulted in Russia gaining an advantage in the area.

**Bruhl 6/14** \[Joe Bruhl; ; 6-14-2022; America Ignores Africa at Its
Own Peril; War on the Rocks;
https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/america-ignores-africa-at-its-own-peril/;
7-16-2022; SK\]

[America's ambivalence toward Africa puts it at a dangerous disadvantage
there]{.underline} --- and impacts U.S. leadership around the globe.
While Washington focuses on the Russian military threat in Eastern
Europe and Chinese expansionism in the Pacific, [Russia]{.underline} and
China are [outcompeting the United States in Africa]{.underline} in ways
that could fundamentally alter the global balance of power.

To restore momentum to its work in Africa, Washington should develop an
integrated strategy that does three things: establishes continent-wide
objectives with tailored regional strategies, dramatically expands
mutually beneficial economic investment, and leverages areas in which
the United States holds comparative advantage over its competitors.

A Continent-Wide Blind Spot

The [legacy of U.S. policy in Africa is checkered. Throughout its
history, the United States lacked clear objectives on the continent and,
as a result, its policies were largely reactionary, vacillating between
exploitation, benign neglect, and half-hearted attempts at
democratization and humanitarian assistance]{.underline}. In the 18th
and 19th centuries, U.S. engagement with Africa came principally through
the slave trade. For the next century, [Washington paid little attention
to the continent]{.underline} until de-colonization coincided with Cold
War competition in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. In this context, the
United States focused on bringing newly independent African countries
into its sphere of influence --- often ignoring (or enabling) leaders
with appalling records of violence and corruption. After the Cold War,
U.S. policy shifted to humanitarian objectives, intervening in Somalia
to stop a famine and initiating the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief --- and investment of more than \$100 billion to combat
HIV/AIDS. After the attacks of 9/11, however, [the preponderance of U.S.
diplomatic and military energy has focused on countering violent
extremist organizations]{.underline} as part of the Global War on
Terror.

Today, [Washington still primarily views the continent as a problem to
be managed rather than as a partner in shaping the next
century]{.underline}. Promising economic and demographic trends have
driven Africa's emergence as a significant player on the world stage.
But the United States has been slow to establish a clear, proactive
policy for Africa. This is a strategic blind spot that most U.S.
policymakers can't seem to shake --- and one that their competitors
don't have.

Instead of a problem to be solved, China and [Russia view Africa as an
opportunity to be seized]{.underline}. From 2007 to 2017, [U.S. trade
with Africa dropped by 54 percent]{.underline} as China's grew by 220
percent. While [Russia's total investment in Africa]{.underline} pales
in comparison to the United States and China, it has [grown by 40
percent since 2015]{.underline}. China supports 46 port projects in
Africa --- financing more than half and operating 11. The United States
supports zero.

In 2006, China launched the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, bringing
together heads of state from across the continent every three years.
Russia began a similar junket in 2019, holding the first Russia-Africa
Summit in Sochi. The United States hosted something similar in 2014 ---
but hasn't since. The Biden administration has recognized Washington's
error and announced plans to host a second event in 2022, but in this
diplomatic game the United States is still playing from behind.

In a savvy soft-power move, China launched a 2015 initiative to put
satellite televisions in 10,000 African villages. No surprise --- the
television sets come with free, pre-loaded access to Chinese stations,
pumping state-sponsored content into homes across the continent. Today,
Russia embeds a former intelligence agent as a senior defense advisor in
the Central African Republic, employs the Wagner Group in Libya and
elsewhere, and has deals with seven Sub-Saharan countries to build their
nuclear energy infrastructure.

Each competitor's strategy has its flaws --- and there are certainly
seams for the United States to exploit --- but the [contrast between
Russia and China's involvement in Africa and Washington's neglect is
stark]{.underline}.

Africa Rising

However, investing in Africa is not just about competing with China and
Russia: Africa is an epicenter of tremendous opportunity. If human
capital truly is the greatest asset to economic growth, Africa has
unappreciated potential. In the next 35 years, Africa's population is
expected to double --- comprising nearly 30 percent of the world's
population by 2050. By 2025, an additional 90 million African households
will enter the consumer class --- contributing purchasing power of \$2.1
trillion to the global economy.

Africa also has the potential to become the world's next manufacturing
epicenter. As the cost of labor in China increases, experts project that
100 million labor-intensive jobs will leave the country by 2030 --- with
Africa as a likely landing spot. The Brookings Institution estimates
that manufacturing spending in Africa will grow by over 50 percent ---
reaching more than \$660 billion by 2030. In 2021, 54 of 55 African
nations initiated the African Continental Free Trade Area --- a free
trade agreement that eliminates tariffs on 90 percent of goods, enabling
the free flow of the raw materials essential for manufacturing to
thrive.

There are also more immediate economic interests at play. Africa holds
vast repositories of rare earth elements, vital to the production of
everything from cell phones and LED screens to energy infrastructure and
defense technologies. More than two-thirds of the world's cobalt --- an
essential ingredient in lithium-ion batteries --- is in Congo. Around 35
percent of the world's bauxite --- a key component of aluminum
production --- is found in Guinea. However, China currently holds a
virtual monopoly on the world's rare earth elements production ---
putting America's economy and national security at risk. If the United
States wants to secure access to the raw materials required to build the
future, it's going to have to do it in Africa.

Politically, [African nations wield surprisingly significant, yet
subtle, influence on a host of global issues]{.underline}. At the United
Nations, African countries comprise nearly 28 percent of member states
--- providing a powerful voting bloc capable of channeling resources to
initiatives aligned to its interests. Unity among the A3 --- the three
rotating African members of the U.N. Security Council --- increases
Africa's voice on council resolutions, even ones that don't relate to
Africa. What's more, the way in which African leaders choose to
implement the African Continental Free Trade Agreement will determine
which global powers have greatest access to continent-wide markets worth
more than \$3.4 trillion. Early indications are that China is the big
winner.

No doubt, there are challenges to progress in Africa. But progress is
being made and the truth is that Africa will play a central role in the
next century --- demographically, economically, and politically ---
whether the United States likes it or not.

[Russia's announcement that it plans to open a naval base in Sudan marks
a clear return of Russia to the African continent amid a push to expand
its power]{.underline}. **[Since the mid-2010s, Russia has sought to
reassert itself via a mix of having an official state presence on the
continent and the use of]{.underline}** private military contractors
(**[PMCs]{.underline}**). Thus, while former President Trump disparaged
African nations as "shit-hole countries" in 2018 and later fired
then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson while he was on a tour of Africa,
Russia was steadily increasing its presence via diplomatic and military
means. In the face of a rising Russian presence, this article will
propose policy recommendations that allow the Biden administration to
counter Russian influence while building strong bilateral relations with
African states. During his term, President [Trump never made a single
visit to Africa and only received a few African heads of
state]{.underline}. [In comparison, Russia received 10 African heads of
states between 2017 and 2019]{.underline}. The most significant
diplomatic event during this period was the Russia-Africa Summit, which
brought representatives from all 54 African states, including 43 heads
of state. **[Diplomatic ties between Russia and Africa are
important]{.underline}**---**[the 54 African nations represent the

Russian-African ties, Russia has often backed the goals of the A3 at the

where Russia seeks to develop the capacity of African nations via its
state owned enterprises. Simultaneously, Russia is also increasing its
soft power push, through the creation of regional Russian language
centers that promote the Russian language and culture and partnerships

Algiers is increasingly aligning itself with Russia,]{.underline}**
Spanish Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said on Monday. Calvino said she
had noticed a **[growing rapprochement between Algeria and

Monetary Fund in April. \"**[I saw back then that Algeria was more and
more aligned with Russia, so this (decision to suspend the treaty)
didn\'t surprise me]{.underline}**,\" Calvino said in an interview with
Radio Catalunya. [The diplomatic row between the two countries followed
a change of stance by Spain over Western Sahara, a territory Morocco
claims while Algeria supports a group that seeks its independence. Spain
is also a member of the European Union and the NATO military alliance,
both in the forefront of international opposition to Russia\'s invasion
of Ukraine.]{.underline} After Algeria\'s decision, Madrid has tried to
convince the North African country to backtrack. \"I hope that Algeria
will reconsider its position and the statements it has made,\" Calvino
told reporters in Barcelona. Algeria is one of Spain\'s main suppliers
of gas and Spain has said it will firmly defend its national interests
and those of its citizens and companies. Calvino reiterated on Monday
that the gas supplies continue normally and was confident there would be
no disruption.

acquire맗otential energy exports, while **Russia** has been an
**invaluable security and strategic partner**. Thus, Algeria will hope
to continue its **independent foreign policy** where it can **balance
between both Europe and Russia.**]{.underline} On 11 April, Algerian
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune and Italian Prime Minister Mario
Draghi맙truck a deal[for Algiers to supply gas to Rome.]{.underline}
Per the deal between Algeria's Sonatrach and Italy's Eni, [Algiers will
send 9 billion cubic meters of gas to Rome by next year and in
2024.]{.underline} "Right after the invasion, I announced that Italy
will move with speed to reduce dependence on Russian gas. This agreement
is a significant response to that strategic objective. There will be
others," Draghi said after the meeting. In March, Sonatrach and
Eni마nnounced맍inding a "significant" oil and gas field in the Algerian
desert, which both companies will jointly explore. Following this, on 10
May, [Russian Foreign Minister met with Algerian President Tebboune,
with the aim of **enhancing bilateral ties** in various sectors, from
military to humanitarian areas. Following the meeting, Lavrov referred
to the two countries' **"military and technical cooperation**" while
praising "the confidence placed in us (by Algeria) in this
domain".]{.underline} **Military partnership** [Both Algeria and Russia
have adopted a similar stance of flexibility in the Middle East and
North Africa. Regarding various disputes in the region, Algeria is more
aligned with Russia's position and seeks to uphold positive ties with
most actors -]{.underline} even though its media often invokes
anti-imperialist sentiment, which explains the historic amicability
between Algiers and Moscow. Although [Algiers]{.underline} was a
prominent member of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War, it
still [established **close ties** to the Soviet Union]{.underline}. Many
of its political and military leaders trained there. And during the Cold
War period, the Soviet Union and Algiers struck several arms agreements.
After the fall of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Putin sought to further
strengthen ties between the two countries after visiting Algiers in
2006. That year, [both countries signed aMemorandum of Understanding
(MoU)맊oncerning the Russian and Algerian gas companies Gazprom and
Sonatrach.]{.underline} While [causing some alarm to EU
observers]{.underline}, the MoU entailed that Gazprom would help Algeria
develop its natural gas reserves. Further demonstrating its
determination to be a reliable ally of Algiers, [Moscow has forgiven
billions of dollars of Algerian debt,]{.underline} while Algeria sought
Moscow's assistance in 2019 against the맔ass anti-government protests,
which forced former long-standing president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to
resign. [For Algeria, regional tensions have driven it towards Moscow
and have propelled its desire to increase its[arms
imports](https://english.alaraby.co.uk/analysis/shifting-geopolitics-and-algerias-new-military-doctrine).
Currently, Algeria is Moscow's **third-largest arms customer** after
India and China, and Algiers' purchases account for around half of
Russia's arms exports to Africa. Russia is also Algiers' largest arms
partner.]{.underline} And [showcasing its wishes to **maintain ties with
Moscow despite** the war in **Ukraine**, Algeria agreed with Moscow on 5
April to carry out joint military exercises on the border of
Morocco]{.underline} -- with whom Algiers has맙our relations. The
exercises will include training for tactical moves to search for,
detect, and destroy illegal armed groups. About 80 soldiers from the
southern military region will participate and will take place at the
Hammaguir base in southern Algeria. The manoeuvres are scheduled for
November 2022. Such exercises are a continuation of similar activities,
such as in October 2021 when both
armies[trained](https://atalayar.com/en/content/russia-and-algeria-conduct-military-exercises-border-morocco)말n
the North Ossetia region, aiming to increase their effectiveness and
further their counter-terrorism cooperation. Moscow's support for
Algeria helps it over theWestern Sahara dispute, in which the US
supports Morocco's stance, having recognised Rabat's sovereignty over
the territory. Thus, [given Russia's supportive stance towards Algeria
over military partnerships, and how much of a vital ally it is, US
pressure on Algeria would be unlikely to deter it from scaling down its
ties with Moscow.]{.underline} Yet amid the Ukraine war, Washington has
already attempted this. In late March, US Secretary of State Antony
Blinken맛rgedㅁlgeria to limit ties with Russia. Blinken also urged
Algeria to repair its fraught ties with Morocco, particularly regarding
the dispute over Western Sahara, over which Washington has still upheld
recognition of Rabat's sovereignty. Such a move would therefore be
unlikely to sway Algeria into moving away from Moscow.

[Russia's Wagner Group]{.underline}, a shadowy paramilitary organisation
tied to the Kremlin, [has played a **significant role** in Libya,
supporting renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar's self-styled
Libyan National Army (LNA) in the **country's civil war**.]{.underline}

Western observers had begun wondering in recent weeks whether Wagner
forces would be withdrawing from Libya to instead focus on supporting
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Although Moscow might need to adjust and reconfigure its mission in
Libya, there is [good reason to expect the Russians to continue their
campaign, which has served to **shape the security architecture** of
Libya's east, where Haftar is based, and entrench itself.]{.underline}

"Before February 24 \[when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began\],
there [was **no indication** that the clandestine Russian mission \[in
Libya\] was withdrawing, shrinking, or anything of the
sort,]{.underline}" Jalel Harchaoui, a researcher specialising in Libya,
told Al Jazeera.

"It was rather quiet. The Libyans who live near \[Russian\] bases got
used to seeing some Russians at the grocery store. Some camps, bases,
and air bases are known to be fully controlled by Russians," Harchaoui
added. "In those particular cases, even the LNA itself sometimes needs
to get permission before entering the base."

While there are some [unconfirmed reports that Russian mercenaries have
been withdrawn from the country to fight in Ukraine, the **majority have
remained**.]{.underline}

"The [number of \[Russian\] fighters who made their way to Ukraine would
probably be tiny as the Kremlin wants to have a **stake in Libya's
future**]{.underline} and needs [these foreign mercenaries to maintain
their hold on the country,"]{.underline} said Ferhat Polat, a Libya
researcher at the TRT World Research Centre.

Sustaining a [military presence in Libya is key to Russia's agendas
elsewhere on the African continent]{.underline}, especially in the Sahel
region.

In late 2021 and early 2022, for example, Russian planes transported
armed personnel and arms from Syria to Mali via an airbase near
Benghazi.

"You [clearly have reliance on the perennial and permanent character of
the Russian footprint in Libya. It wasn't about to shrink]{.underline},"
said Harchaoui. "Even the [reduction, the **modest drawdown** of
probably 300 or 400 individuals **is not the end of the mission**. It
doesn't presage, announce, or augur capitulation."]{.underline}

It is important to take stock of the extent to which [Russia's role in
eastern Libya has become important not only to Haftar and those Libyans
aligned with him]{.underline}, such as parliament-appointed Prime
Minister Fathi Bashagha, [but also other external actors with stakes in
the North African country's uncertain future]{.underline}.

The Russians have built up a presence in Libya that makes Haftar
structurally unable to detach himself from Moscow.

The complete withdrawal of Russian forces from the country would throw
off the balance of power that has protected Haftar's longevity in the
east. [With at least three airbases, military camps, and spies on the
ground, the Russians retain **vast amounts of leverage** in Libya that
no meaningful power appears to be eager to seriously
diminish.]{.underline}

["There's no NATO plan to remove Russia \[from Libya\],"]{.underline}
explained Harchaoui. "The reason is, because Haftar is the only security
architecture for huge parts of Libya --- the eastern half mainly. Haftar
is someone that you cannot preserve if you go after the Russians. If you
forcefully remove the Russians, you will automatically and inevitably
weaken Haftar."

[Russia's Invasion of Ukraine May Drive a Wedge Between the West and
Africa]{.underline}

[The West needs to pay close attention to how they react to African
countries\' silence on the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} and
avoid seeming patronizing and dismissive to neutral African nations.

The apparent reluctance of many African countries to condemn Russia's
invasion of Ukraine has caught many Western governments, diplomatic
experts, and observers of Africa's international relations by surprise.

Although twenty-eight African countries voted in favor of the March 2,
2022, UN General Assembly (UNGA) resolution demanding that Russia
"immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its
military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally
recognized borders," notably, seventeen African nations abstained while
no votes were recorded from another eight.

Unsurprisingly, Eritrea, whose leader Isaias Afwerki enjoys a close
relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and who has long
staked out an anti-Western diplomatic stance, joined Belarus, North
Korea, Russia, and Syria in voting against the resolution. In total, 141
(out of 194) UN member states endorsed the resolution.

Africa in Transition

Except for the speech by Kenya's Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Martin Kimani vigorously affirming the sanctity of international
borders and rejecting "irredentism and expansionism on any basis,"
[African diplomats have largely maintained a studied silence, and,
significantly, none of the twenty-eight supporters of the resolution,
including regional powerhouse Nigeria, has come out to elaborate on its
position.]{.underline} Nigeria only condemned the reported ill treatment
of Nigerians and other African nationals seeking to leave Ukraine and
promptly turned to arrangements for repatriating back home an estimated
5,000 Nigerian students caught up in the conflict.

By contrast, [most of the talking is being done by the leaders of
countries which either opposed UN censure of Russia or
abstained]{.underline}. Among the latter, President Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda has alluded to Western "double standards" on the Ukraine conflict
and spoken of his personal preference for Chinese diplomacy, which, he
claims, steers clear of others' domestic affairs. Museveni has also
spoken out in the past against Western interference in Africa.

Museveni's son and heir apparent Lt. General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who
also leads the country's elite Special Forces Command, was less
diplomatic, tweeting:

The majority of mankind (that are non-white) support Russia's stand in
Ukraine. Putin is absolutely right! When the USSR parked nuclear armed
missiles in Cuba in 1962 the West was ready to blow up the world over
it. Now when NATO does the same they expect Russia to do differently?

Last year, following a complaint to the International Criminal Court
(ICC) by lawyers acting on behalf of victims, the European Union (EU)
Parliament recommended "sanctions against individuals and organizations
responsible for human rights violations in Uganda." Kainerugaba and
other senior Ugandan military commanders were named in the ICC
complaint.

Museveni, who has held power for thirty-six years after toppling Tito
Okello in 1986 and was re-elected for an unprecedented sixth term in
January 2021, recently signed a \$10 billion oil extraction and pipeline
deal with France's TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation.

Ploughing the same furrow, [South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has
criticized NATO's expansion into Ukraine and continues to echo Russian
official position]{.underline} that it perceived "a national existential
threat" from NATO.

While South Africa is less economically dependent on Russia than other
African countries, the South African political class perhaps feels
indebted to Russia because of the former Soviet Union's support for the
African National Congress during the Apartheid era.

Clearly caught off guard by the African response (African countries
accounted for roughly half of the thirty-five abstentions), both the
[United States and EU countries have scrambled to engage with a cross
section of the dissenting countries]{.underline}.

Given the considerable [risk of confirming the very
prejudices]{.underline} that those countries have been pointing to, [how
the West goes about it is extremely important.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine has [decreased]{.underline} Western focus on Africa.

**Seldin 7/15** \[Jeff Seldin; ; 7-15-2022; Europe Warns of Russian
Pressure From Africa; VOA;

7-16-2022; SK\]

And nowhere are [concerns growing as fast as they are in the
Sahel,]{.underline} the semiarid stretch of land [spanning northern and
western Africa]{.underline} from Senegal to Sudan.

"By sending a couple of thousand Wagner paramilitaries, the [Russians
are taking over there]{.underline}," Dutch Defense Minister Kajsa
Ollongren told an audience in Washington Thursday. "We cannot accept
that."

Ollongren is not alone in voicing concerns about the Russian threat from
[Ukraine, in the east, overshadowing the threat from
Africa.]{.underline}

\"One of the worst effects this will have on the Western side in my view
is that it focused attention of the European member states on the
eastern front, lowering the already low level of attention on the
south,\" Lieutenant General Giovanni Manione, the deputy director
general of the European Union Military Staff, warned a forum in
Washington last month.

\"It is a tragic effect. It is a huge mistake,\" Manione added. \"We are
keeping resources \[in Europe\] just in case something happens,
[forgetting completely that actions should be taken now in another
theater]{.underline}.\"

Manione went even further, suggesting that Putin, as much as he may want
to conquer Ukraine, is also adroitly using the fight there as a
distraction.

\"I\'m not sure this is the main target of the Russians,\" Manione said
of Ukraine. \"The main target of the Russians could be having people
focused on there \[Ukraine\], forgetting their actions elsewhere.\"

[Russian paramilitary groups in Africa]{.underline}

Other European countries are also sounding alarms.

An Austrian Federal Intelligence Service report issued late last month
warned of [a "belt of instability" reaching across Africa, from the
Sahara Desert and the Sahel region all the way to Somalia and the
Arabian Sea]{.underline}.

"This instability is exacerbated by the [rise of a grass-roots anti-West
movement in the Sahel region]{.underline} and the withdrawal of European
armed forces from Mali," the report said. "Ostensibly private actors on
the ground, such as the Russian Wagner Group, also play an important
role here."

Many Western officials view Wagner, a paramilitary company run by
Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, as a proxy force for Putin, helping
Moscow secure access to natural resources with no regard for human
rights.

So far, [U.S. military officials have reported the presence of Wagner
mercenaries in more than a dozen African countries over the past several
years]{.underline}. With recent deployments to Mali sparking renewed
concerns, especially after Wagner forces were tied to the slaughter of
300 civilians this past March.

Wagner has also been tied to January's coup in Burkina Faso, though U.S.
officials have not confirmed the allegations.

Like their European counterparts, U.S. officials agree Russia's
involvement in Africa, and in the Sahel in particular, is worrisome,
warning the payoff for countries turning to Russia, and to Wagner, often
fails to deliver on Moscow's promises.

"We\'ve seen the impact and destabilizing effect that Wagner brings to
Africa and elsewhere, and I think countries that have experienced Wagner
Group deployments within their borders found themselves to be a little
bit poorer, a little bit weaker, a little bit less secure," U.S. Deputy
Commanding General for Africa Major General Andrew Rohling told
reporters last month.

But [U.S. military and intelligence officials]{.underline}, while
concerned, [question]{.underline} whether [Russian forces]{.underline}
are capable of threatening Europe from the south.

"There's not necessarily a concrete and cohesive plan," one U.S.
official told VOA, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to
discuss intelligence.

\"They\'re not a very effective organization, except for extorting money
and resources," the official added, [comparing Russia's strategy in
Africa to "placing a bunch of bets on a roulette table.\"]{.underline}

Indirect threat

NATO, in its recently adopted, updated strategic concept, also sees the
threat from Russia in Africa as indirect.

"NATO's southern neighborhood, particularly the Middle East, North
Africa and Sahel regions, faces interconnected security, demographic,
economic and political challenges," the alliance document said, adding
it "enables destabilizing and coercive interference by strategic
competitors."

Some experts warn it would a mistake, however, to view Russia's actions
as incoherent.

"Russia is pursuing several strategic objectives on the continent,"
Joseph Siegle, director of research at the National Defense
University\'s Africa Center for Strategic Studies, told U.S. lawmakers
Thursday.

While much of [Moscow's effort is designed to "displace and discredit
Western influence]{.underline}," Siegle said that is just the start.

"[Russia is trying to gain control over strategic territory in North
Africa, most vividly seen in Libya. This would provide Moscow with an
enduring security presence on NATO's southern border]{.underline}," he
said.

#### Western sanctions in response to Ukraine are causing Russia to step up its influence in North Africa, diplomatically and economically. 

**Aris, 6/12**

(Ben, German reporter for BNE NTELLINEWS, Russia preparing for second
Africa Summit to build closer ties as it pivots away from the West,
https://www.intellinews.com/russia-preparing-for-second-africa-summit-to-build-closer-ties-as-it-pivots-away-from-the-west-247188/)

Russia is preparing for the [second Russia-Africa summit]{.underline},
scheduled for October-November 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, as it
[steps up its campaign to move closer to the African
countries]{.underline} and pivot away from the West due to the latter\'s
extreme sanctions imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine[. Russia
was already heavily invested in Africa as part of President Vladimir
Putin's policy of fostering ties with the non-aligned nations of the
developing world ever since relations with the West soured following
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. But the need to develop deep
trade and investment ties in Africa has been given a new urgency since
the West has broken off almost all business ties with Russia this year.
Better relations with Africa are commercially important as Russia starts
searching for new customers to buy its energy, grain and other
commodities. But there is also an important political dimension as well
as Putin seeks to undermine US hegemony and to gain international
recognition of his regime. With a cornucopia of commodities and
technology in some sectors such as nuclear power on offer, many African
countries are willing partners.]{.underline} The details of the summit
will be decided in talks between the African Union, Russian Federation
Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko said at a meeting with the Speaker
of Mozambique's Assembly (parliament), Esperanca Bias, during an
official visit to Maputo from May 30 to June 1. \"We are already
preparing the next summit. Its dates will be determined jointly with the
African Union,\" Matviyenko said reports Tass, adding that Russia saw
Mozambique as a \"reliable and time-tested\" partner in Africa.\"Russia
has always provided assistance to Mozambique and it keeps doing so. We
are pleased to see your success in economic and social development. We
note with satisfaction the steady development of the political
dialogue,\" Matviyenko added. Russia has deep business ties with
Mozambique, but as bne IntelliNews has reported, the business relations
do not always run smoothly. Russia\'s VTB bank was a key participant
raising \$2bn for a project that should have transformed Mozambique\'s
economy, but the project collapsed and became the subject of a legal
battle that has sullied the country's reputation. The Russia-Africa
Summit has been an important platform for promoting Russian interests on
the continent and leaders from 48 of Africa's 54 countries attended the
first summit held in the Russian resort city of Sochi in October 2019.
It was co-chaired by the presidents of Russia and Egypt, Vladimir Putin
and Abdul Fattah al-Sisi[. Egypt is a key Russian partner in North
Africa, which imports 80% of its grain from Russia]{.underline} and
Ukraine. The event was supposed to be held annually, but was delayed
following the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020.
It is now back on for this autumn. This year's summit will be even more
important as Russia looks for new markets and to expand existing ones
after the West imposed extreme sanction on Russia following its invasion
of Ukraine at the end of February. For its part Africa is keen to keep
relations civil, as many countries on the continent depend on Russian
grain imports. The AU head, Senegalese President Macky Sall, met Putin
in Sochi on June 3 in a bid to offset an impending food crisis due to
the war in Ukraine and secure grain imports for his members. Sall has
also highlighted that the decision to expel Russian banks from the SWIFT
financial messaging system could hurt food supplies to the continent,
RFI reported[. African nations have been among Russia's most loyal
supporters since the conflict in Ukraine started. In a UN vote to
condemn Russia's invasion about half the African countries chose to
abstain from condemning Russia,]{.underline} as they sought to maintain
good relations with the West, but signal to Moscow they still see Russia
as an important partner. As bne IntelliNews reported, the voting
patterns in the UN votes concerning the war in Ukraine paint a very
clear picture of which African countries support Russia. Matviyenko's
trip to Mozambique was part of preparing the ground for this year's
summit. Bias said that Matviyenko's visit showed that \"Russia is always
with Mozambique and Mozambique is always with Russia. Our relationship
dates back to the period when Mozambique was fighting for independence.
Even after we gained independence, Russia has always been by our side.
These relations are obvious in different areas,\" Bias stressed. A
co-ordination council has been established under the aegis of the
Secretariat of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum (RAPF). According to
Sergei Lavrov, Russia's Foreign Minister, "[Concrete proposals for
consolidating Russian-African co-operation are being worked out by three
councils (co-ordinating, public and scientific ones) reporting to the
Partnership Forum Secretariat. They represent ministries, agencies,
business and public organisations engaged in the development of
relations with the African continent." Moscow is poised to build
relations of strategic partnership with pan-African organisations and
regional integration associations, Lavrov added.]{.underline} Lavrov
said that the two most important goals of the summit will be to sign off
on [a "memorandum of understanding between the government of the Russian
Federation and the African Union on basic principles of relations and
co-operation]{.underline}" and a "memorandum of understanding between
the Eurasian Economic Commission and the African Union on economic
co-operation. The Eurasian Economic Commission is the executive body of
the Eurasia Economic Union (EEU), Russia's answer to the European Union.
It is a trade club that unites five former Soviet states, with several
more in the region granted observer status. Russia hopes to extend the
reach of the EEU down into Africa by co-ordinating with the AU more
closely. At the upcoming summit a roadmap for this co-operation will be
finalised in co-operation with the Southern African Development
Community (SADS), Lavrov said. Progress on building up a North-South
free trade area between the EEU and AU has already taken its first
concrete step forward after the African Continental Free Trade Agreement
(AfCFTA) came into effect on January 1 this year. AfCFTA reduces to zero
95% of all previous intra-Africa tariffs that were imposed on
cross-border trade. Only Eritrea has not yet signed up to the deal. With
that previous tariff expense eliminated, sourcing for African products
can now take place on a continental basis, thus expanding the potential
for African supply chain development exponentially. The free trade
regime in Africa will also allow Special Economic Zones (SEZ) to import
machinery and parts to make African products such as machinery. These
either be sold on the regional market (when import duties on the parts
become due) or re-exported to markets like Russia (duty free). With
almost all high-tech machinery exports to Russia now banned, using
Africa as a production base, which is free to import machinery from
Europe, may become a way for Russia to avoid sanctions and buy badly
needed equipment it can no longer source from Europe. For example, the
Russian automotive sector has almost entirely collapsed in the first
months of the war, as it remains heavily dependent on imports of parts
that it cannot make itself. Russia has already begun developing such
SEZs in Africa, most notably in Egypt's Port Said but also in Mozambique
and Namibia. [The importance of the upcoming summit has been bolstered
by the booming trade between Russia and Africa, which has soared this
year.]{.underline} Afreximbank president Benedict Oramah said in a
recent interview with Tass that trade between African countries and
Russia has seen considerable progress. "Just six years ago there were
exports of some \$8bn from Russia and imports to Russia from Africa of
\$2bn or less. Today we have Russian exports to Africa worth \$14bn a
year and imports of African products of about \$5bn. That mean[s
bilateral trade is about \$20bn". This represents a doubling in
Russian-African trade since 2015, or an average annual growth rate of
15%.\" North Africa currently dominates Russian trade, led by Egypt
(\$4.53bn), Algeria (\$3bn) and Morocco (\$1.2bn),]{.underline} with
South Africa fourth with \$1bn, reports Tass. Moreover, in nearly all
African countries Russian trade and investment is increasing. Russia is
in the process of establishing a \$5bn ecommerce trade portal with
African countries, has been targeting Nigeria as a growth market and has
a naval base at Port Sudan. The EEU will sign off an agricultural trade
deal with the AU, and Egypt is expected to sign off an EEU Free Trade
Agreement at the summit[. Russia is heavily involved in the African oil
and gas industry, but has also been investing in infrastructure, with
Russia providing railway equipment to Egypt and developing manufacturing
facilities on a continental basis.]{.underline}

Africa]{.underline}** \-- [an expansion that military and civilian
leaders view as another, if less immediate, threat to security in the
West]{.underline}. **[Putin's strategy in]{.underline}** the Mideast and
**[Africa has been simple, and successful: He seeks out security
alliances with autocrats, coup leaders, and others who have been spurned
or neglected by the U.S. and Europe, either because of their bloody
abuses or because of competing Western strategic
interests]{.underline}**. --- In Syria, Russia's defense minister last
month showed off nuclear-capable bombers and hypersonic missiles over
the Mediterranean, part of a security partnership that now has the
Kremlin threatening to send Syrian fighters to Ukraine. --- In Sudan, a
leader of a junta that's seized power in that East African country has a
new economic alliance with the Kremlin, reviving Russia's dreams of a
naval base on the Red Sea. --- In Mali, the government is the latest of
more than a dozen resource-rich African nations to forge security
alliances with Kremlin-allied mercenaries, according to U.S. officials.
Especially in the last five or six years, "[what you've seen is a Russia
that is much more expeditionary and casting its military power further
and wider afield]{.underline}," retired U.S. Gen. Philip M. Breedlove
told The Associated Press. "**[Russia is trying to show itself as a
great power, as at the seat in world affairs, as driving international
situations]{.underline}**," said Breedlove, the top NATO commander from
2013 through 2016, and now a distinguished chair at the Middle East
Institute think tank in Washington. [But with Putin's hands already full
battling the fierce resistance from a much weaker Ukrainian military,
experts view his expansionist goals in the Middle East and Africa as a
potential long-term threat, not a present danger to Europe or the NATO
alliance]{.underline}. **["It's threatening NATO from
below]{.underline}**," Kristina Kausch, a European security expert at
the German Marshall Fund think-tank, said of the leverage Russia is
gaining. "**[The Russians have felt encircled by NATO]{.underline}** --
**[and now they want to encircle NATO]{.underline}**," she said. To
achieve its strategic aims, Russia provides conventional military or
Kremlin-allied mercenaries to protect the regimes of often outcast
leaders. In return, these leaders pay back Russia in several ways: cash
or natural resources, influence in their affairs, and staging grounds
for Russian fighters. [**These alliances help advance Putin's ambitions
of returning Russia's influence to its old Cold War boundaries.**
Russia's new security partnerships also aid it
diplomatically]{.underline}. When the U.N. General Assembly condemned
Putin's Ukraine invasion this month, Syria joined Russia in voting
against, and many of the African governments that have signed security
deals with Russian mercenaries abstained. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry
Peskov said Friday that Russia would bring recruits from Syria to fight
in Ukraine. The threat was seen primarily as an intimidation tactic and
U.S. officials say there's been no sign of Syrian recruits in Ukraine.
Some security experts say Russian mercenaries are using Mali as a
staging ground for deployment to Ukraine, but U.S. officials have not
confirmed these reports. [Regardless of how imminent the threat is, U.S.
and European leaders are paying increasing attention to Putin's moves in
the Middle East and Africa]{.underline} --- and Russia's growing
alliance with China --- [as it formulates plans to protect the West from
future aggression]{.underline}. German Foreign Minister Annalena
Baerbock said in mid-February that the West could no longer ignore the
competition for influence across Africa, where China spends billions on
infrastructure projects to secure mineral rights, and Russia provides
security through Kremlin-allied mercenaries. "We see and realize that if
we withdraw from this competition as liberal democracies, then others
are going to fill these gaps," Baerbock said as Western diplomats
huddled on the Ukraine crisis, in the last days before Russia's
invasion. Perhaps the boldest example of Russia flexing its global reach
was when it sent defense minister Sergei Shoigu last month to Damascus
to oversee Russia's largest military drills in the Mediterranean since
the Cold War, just as Russia's military made final preparations for its
assault on Ukraine. The drills, involving 15 warships and about 30
aircraft, appeared choreographed to showcase the Russian military's
capability to threaten the U.S. carrier strike group in the
Mediterranean. Russia's Hmeimeem air base on Syria's Mediterranean coast
has served as its main outpost for launching attacks in Syria since
September 2015. Russia's attacks in Syria, which leveled ancient cities
and sent millions of refugees to Europe, allowed President Bashar
al-Assad's brutal government to reclaim control over most of the country
after a devastating civil war. "Hmeimeem base is now an integral part of
Russia's defense strategy not just in the Middle East but all the
world,쒹 said Ibrahim Hamidi, a Syrian journalist and senior diplomatic
editor for Syrian affairs at the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.
In Africa, too, Russia is open to working with leaders known for
anti-democratic actions and abuses of human rights. On the eve of

returning home, Gen. Dagolo announced that Sudan would be open to
allowing Russia to build its long hoped-for naval base at Port Sudan on
the Red Sea. It's far from certain that Russia would be able to take
advantage anytime soon. The Ukraine invasion is straining its military
and financial resources and showing Russia's military weaknesses, and
international sanctions are crippling its economy. But longer-term, [a
Red Sea port could help give it a greater role in the Mediterranean and
Black Sea, increase Russian access in the Suez Canal and other
high-traffic shipping lanes, and allow Russia to project force in the
Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean]{.underline}. "[They certainly could create
enough havoc to cause problems]{.underline}," said Breedlove, the former
NATO commander. **[Russia's expanding alliances aren't just about its
conventional military.]{.underline}** From 2015 to 2021, Russian
mercenary security outfits increased their presence around the world
seven-fold, with operations in 27 countries as of last year, according
to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The most
prominent is the Wagner Group, which the U.S. and EU consider to be a
surrogate of the Russian military, but which the Kremlin denies even
exists. **[From Libya to Madagascar, security contracts granted to

[European security assistance]{.underline}

The hybrid nature of Libya's security sector, characterised by many
armed groups operating outside state control, has created significant
legal and procedural obstacles for EU agencies. Libyan leaders' lack of
support for SSR has been a significant reason why bilateral and
multilateral European support initiatives never developed beyond poorly
executed train-and-equip exercises. Worse still, a lack of conditions
attached to European equipment deliveries sometimes allowed the Libyan
government to integrate militiamen into the formal security sector
before they had received training.

Years of [failed security partnerships also reflect Europe's incoherent
policy on Libya]{.underline}. European leaders, like their Libyan
counterparts, have had no vision for SSR. This has undermined European
initiatives in Libya in the long term, with policymakers focused on
transient solutions to the problems of the day.

France was one of the first Western countries to back Haftar's
burgeoning military autocracy in Cyrenaica, including through training
and arms provisions. Paris couched this support in a narrative of law
and order, and opposition to terrorism and Islamism. However, French
forces and the LAAF did not participate in Libya's biggest
counter-terrorism operation of recent years -- which removed the Islamic
State group from Sirte in 2016, and which was spearheaded by Misratan
groups with American, British, and Italian backing. This operation
involved logistical and material support, initiatives to build local
operational capacity, the deployment of special forces, airstrikes, and
initiatives to help construct a cohesive counter-terrorism force. It
proved to be more successful and well-contained than the LAAF
counter-terrorism campaign, which has become a political and economic
behemoth that exploits civilians in the areas under its control.

France, in contrast, appeared to prioritise its partnership with Haftar
and regional partners such as the UAE above a common European position.
The approach was designed to strengthen the French position in Libya and
the Sahel more broadly, but it disregarded Haftar's human rights abuses.
This directly weakened international accountability mechanisms,
established precedents of impunity for other Libyan actors, and allowed
Haftar to remain a troublesome political actor following his military
defeat. It also helped Russia and Turkey become kingmakers in Libya,
while fuelling Franco-Turkish geopolitical tension, including in the
eastern Mediterranean.

Italy's efforts to compete with France in Libya have had a similar
effect, resulting in overt Italian backing for groups in western Libya.
The rivalry between Italy and France persists, despite the 2021
Quirinale accord, due to the fundamental divergence of their interests
in Libya. For Rome, Libya has always been a national foreign policy
priority -- so, it is disdainful of what it sees as France playing fast
and loose with Italian national security. Despite its criticism of the
French approach, however, Italy has also adopted a destructive approach
to security partnerships, as seen in the 32.6m it has spent since 2017
on the Libyan coastguard -- whose units have abused migrants and
refugees.

This policy helped strengthen predatory and often criminal local
militias at the expense of initiatives to build structural government
capacity and sustainable migration partnerships. Although it helped
block refugees' attempts to cross the Mediterranean at the time, the
policy has come back to haunt Italy. Human rights atrocities carried out
by Italian-funded militias are not only embarrassing for Rome but could
result in legal action. Worse still, the GNU now seeks to expand the
Italian policy into a model for extorting European states without
addressing migration issues effectively.

The French and Italian cases illustrate why Europeans have lost
influence in Libya since 2011, despite their many high-profile attempts
at engagement with the Libyan authorities. Not strategic enough
bilaterally yet not cohesive enough to form a powerful policy bloc,
Europeans have been unable to compete with regional actors that are more
single-minded in their aim for a political transition and face fewer
domestic obstacles to their policies. Additionally, the pressing
political imperatives behind Europeans' migration and counter-terrorism
policies have resulted in expedient solutions and poor vetting of their
partners in Libya.

Although there is [still space for Europeans to help stabilise Libya, be
it in a technical or political capacity]{.underline}, they have yet to
articulate how they would achieve this -- let alone seize the
opportunity to do so. They need to avoid the short-term policies based
on perceived security imperatives that have damaged their reputation
among Libyans. France's and Italy's self-serving policies have shaped
public perceptions of all Europeans. Accordingly, Libyans no longer
regard individual European states as reliable partners, despite the
amount of funding these countries have poured into development
assistance, notably on border management, counter-migration, and
counter-terrorism.

The [EU's contributions to multilateral capacity building efforts
through its missions and some international organisations were
insufficient and ineffectual, partly due to disunity between key member
states]{.underline}. They neither countered the negative impact of
Italian and French ventures in Libya nor matched the financial and
political commitments of actors such as Russia, Turkey, Egypt, and the
UAE.

While many lower-level contributions to SSR have been funded through
European countries' development assistance budgets, these initiatives
were often siloed and were broadly undermined by Europe's lack of
strategic cohesion. Germany was more successful in its diplomatic
approach, notably through the Berlin Process and its attempts to unify
Europeans on Libya. This political initiative paved the way for progress
on SSR. The JMC, despite its failings, demonstrates that Europeans can
have a meaningful role in international security policies when they work
together.

[Inadequate European strategy and leadership have hampered multilateral
mechanisms]{.underline} that could have coordinated security assistance
in the long term. Moreover, mechanisms for coordination between European
missions remain rudimentary and largely informal, as they are reluctant
to share information on security issues. Nevertheless, the situation has
improved somewhat recently. During Haftar's offensive on Tripoli,
European states produced a joint report on their role in Libya, which
was written by heads of missions and which referred to SSR as an issue
for cooperation between them and UNSMIL. Shared recognition of the
threat the offensive posed to European interests helped break down
traditional barriers to information sharing. It prompted European states
to take stock of their existing initiatives and limit duplication where
possible.

France, Germany, and Italy are finally improving their cooperation on
Libya. This could be seen in a joint visit to Libya by their foreign
ministers in early 2021. More substantively, France took the lead in the
Berlin Process in November 2021, holding a conference in Paris to try to
salvage Libya's election. And Italy now seeks to continue developing the
process. This has boosted European diplomacy in Libya in ways that
should lead to more cohesive European security policies in the country.

Policy recommendations

[For Europeans to compete effectively with their geopolitical rivals in
Libya, they will need a shared high-level strategy and joint operational
principles]{.underline}. Given their limited room for manoeuvre in
Libya, they should develop a medium- to long-term plan for security
sector assistance. They should begin by establishing a Libyan-owned SSR
body, endowing it with some political influence, and supporting its
attempts to reorganise Libya's security sector. The aim should be to
create an institution that can outlast the country's current political
struggles and crises, as well as to support local initiatives and
partners who can engage in shorter-term SSR programmes.

[Step 1: Shape a coherent European approach]{.underline}

As discussed, the [political anxieties and short-termism of European and
Libyan leaders remain the primary obstacle]{.underline} to the
comprehensive reform of security institutions. Germany, France, and
Italy should take the lead in laying out the priorities, boundaries, and
operational principles of a shared EU approach to SSR in Libya. Without
a unified strategy and policy, Europeans will be unable to end the
inertia generated by their rivals in Libya and will squander their
greatest assets: the technical expertise and resources of organisations
such as NATO and the EU.

A [coherent European strategy for SSR could encourage member states such
as Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark to maximise the impact of their
support for Libya]{.underline} as part of an EU-wide approach. This
effort should begin with an objective needs assessment of Libya's
security sector that maps all SSR initiatives in the country. This
process would improve the technical support that Europeans provide to
Libya and identify areas in which it would be most effective to work
bilaterally, in partnerships, or through multilateral institutions.
Brussels should implement a coordinated, long-term European plan for
Libyan SSR that includes mechanisms for cooperation and knowledge
transfer between Europeans.

Identifying and mapping out a European SSR support strategy in this way
could also facilitate enhanced multilateral cooperation with key
partners such as the UK, the US, and NATO. Russia's growing presence in
Libya, close to NATO installations in Sicily, only adds to the urgency
of these efforts. The 2003 Berlin Plus arrangement between NATO and the
EU creates avenues for joint programming and could enhance
organisational and capacity building projects in Libya. NATO has stated
that it will provide capacity building support if the Libyan government
requests this.

Should Europeans reach a consensus on the scope of SSR cooperation with
NATO, this could also help [repair the Europe-Turkey relationship in
Libya. **Working through NATO would diminish Turkey's concerns** about
being marginalised]{.underline} in Libya, while providing Europeans with
a platform on which to reduce Turkish influence on the Libyan security
sector. Such cooperation would not induce Ankara to abandon its
controversial agreement with the Libyan government on maritime
boundaries, but it could help Europeans discourage Turkey from
weaponising Libyan politics, gas reserves, or migration to extract
concessions from the EU. This could build confidence between Europe and
Turkey at a time when their relationship is fraught. It would also
reduce the chances of a Turkish-Russian partnership taking control in
Libya. Given Russia's growing influence in sub-Saharan Africa, a united
front with Turkey could have geopolitical benefits beyond Libya -- by
helping Europeans regain influence over Russia's expansion in Africa.

Step 2: Empower a Libyan-owned Joint Security Commission

Any credible, practical European strategy for SSR in Libya will require
a Libyan vehicle to own and implement the process. Again, recent
developments have created opportunities for this. Through UNSMIL, Europe
should initiate the establishment of a Joint Security Commission (JSC)
as a second phase of the JMC that focuses on SSR, while the JMC
nominally continues to handle interim security arrangements. The JSC
would have different priorities from the JMC and, to meet the political
requirements of SSR, would be under civilian leadership.

The use of JMC branding would associate this new body with UN
recognition and avoid some of the bureaucratic challenges of creating an
entirely new mechanism, thereby increasing its legitimacy among Libyans
and Libya's international partners. As a civilian-led body, the JSC
would be more acceptable to the many armed and political forces that
fought against Haftar or Qaddafi -- which are especially prevalent in
western Libya, and which fear a return to military dictatorship. The
evolution of the JMC represented by the JSC could also capitalise on the
changing views of members of the Libyan security services, many of whom
have in the past year rejected division as a means to stabilise Libya
and grown increasingly eager to protect their country's sovereignty. By
bringing in key commanders as part of its membership, the JSC could
formalise assistance for the Haddad-Nathouri initiative and local SSR
efforts. The body could gain the recognition and nominal support from
Haftar it needs by ensuring that he has representatives among the
civilian leadership. To avoid being hijacked as the JMC was, the JSC
should combine political representation with technocrats from the
security sector.

Nevertheless, as Haftar and other Libyan political elites could try to
undermine the JSC, Europeans should push them not to do so through
offers of enhanced partnerships and threats of sanctions against those
who spoil the JSC's work. Sustained pressure, close support for the JSC,
and attempts to find common cause with other international actors in
Libya would be key to the body's success.

The JSC's priority should be to articulate a Libyan-owned vision for SSR
that Europeans can support and that has effective oversight mechanisms.
To sustain the new body's influence, Europeans should promote inclusive
dialogue on the security needs of the Libyan population and
consultations with armed groups from the start.

As a next step, Europeans should provide technical assistance to the JSC
as it plans how to surmount the main obstacles to SSR. This could be
channelled and coordinated through the International Follow-up Committee
on Libya. In this setup, the JSC would act as a vehicle for Europeans
and Libyans to create mutually beneficial policies on issues where their
interests converge, such as the departure of foreign mercenaries. As the
JMC already engages with this issue under interim security arrangements,
it would be a useful area in which to ensure the two bodies complement
each other.

Meanwhile, European technical support could help strengthen the rule of
law in ways that protect ordinary Libyans. Libyan elites may not make
optimal use of such assistance, but it would contribute to a cultural
shift towards sustainable, systematic solutions to security problems.

Another key challenge for the JSC would be planning for the unification
of Libya's police and armed forces, which is the first step towards the
development of professional security services that could eventually
degrade and neutralise the influence of criminal and ideological
militias. This process could be important in formulating comprehensive
DDR strategies and increasing European support for Libya's security
sector. It would allow Europeans to target funding more effectively and
address key operational issues -- including local capacity to conduct
arrest and seizure operations across Libya, which are important to
migration and counter-terrorism policy. The professionalisation of the
security services would also help Libya create comprehensive security
and judicial policies to combat smuggling and process migrants and
refugees -- making it much easier for European states to implement their
own migration policies. Similarly, the reform of Libya's Ministry of
Defence would allow Europe to channel significant funds from the
European Peace Facility to the country's security sector.

The unification of Libya's police and armed forces will also require
operational changes such as the standardisation of rules of engagement
across the country. This would enable other Libyan institutions to set
up oversight mechanisms for demobilisation and professionalisation in
the security sector.

Another promising avenue of SSR involves internationally sponsored
initiatives such as the Libyan Political Dialogue Forum and future
consensus generating mechanisms and consultative programmes (such as the
National Conference Process consultations of 2018). It is important to
include security sector personnel in political programmes given armed
groups' influence on Libyan politics and policy. On a national scale,
most of Libya's armed groups are highly localised in their command
structures, interpersonal relationships, and self-perception as
guardians of specific communities. It would be wise to consult with them
in political discussions to win their support for national SSR policies.
This approach would also help the authorities understand armed groups
and thereby build more successful DDR programmes. Indeed, a critical
mass of support from some armed groups could counteract the obstructive
behaviour of criminal, ideological, or politicised militias. To this
end, in the lead-up to an election, the JSC should create mechanisms for
armed groups to engage with the political process constructively and in
ways that can survive a change of government. Some foreign powers have
already provided these groups with ways to engage with the political
process -- including through the creation of new leadership, as well as
institutional and local-level initiatives -- but more needs to be done
to ensure that such efforts fit within a coherent SSR strategy.

[Step 3: Deter spoilers]{.underline}

It will be vital for Europeans [to deter domestic and international
spoilers. This will initially require Europe to build a broad base of
international support for its SSR strategy]{.underline}. Egypt, Turkey,
and the UAE are all influential among different constituencies in Libya
and, after years of competition, are now exploring ways to cooperate
with one another. All three have an interest in stabilising Libya, which
will require the creation of a functional security service. France,
Germany, and Italy should try to persuade them that the European SSR
strategy is the only way forward, before giving them responsibility for
certain aspects of the strategy to ensure that they are invested in it.
Europeans will also need to deter them from using their proxies to
sabotage these efforts at reform.

[Russia is likely to remain Libya's spoiler-in-chief. Wagner Group, a
Russian private military company, uses its Libyan partners to disrupt
the political process and unification efforts while exploiting the
resulting anarchy to secure military bases and key oil production
sites.]{.underline} The firm will likely be difficult to brush aside.
[But, **by working with or deterring other potential spoilers**, Europe
could help **isolate Russia and limit its capacity** to counter the
European SSR strategy]{.underline}. This approach should also look to
[take advantage of many Libyans' resentment of Russian attacks on
Libya's sovereignty and political transition]{.underline}. If it becomes
possible to develop a partnership with Russia, Europe could use a
security working group under the Berlin Process to [launch a truly
multilateral approach to SSR.]{.underline}

[The Way Forward]{.underline} There is a consensus on the fact that the
security challenges in the Middle East and North Africa can create
instability in NATO member states, which therefore ought to do something
about it. Whether there exists a consensus on what to do and whether
NATO should be a central component of the response is less obvious. With
these reservations in mind, [below are three steps that NATO ought to
take were it be willing to shape the security environment in the
MENA]{.underline}. Strategy [The ongoing Ukraine crisis has given NATO a
new direction in the sense that it has provided it with a relatively
straightforward task: to deter and defend against Russia on the eastern
flank]{.underline}. The alliance has adopted doctrinal documents and
taken measures aimed at operationalizing this agenda. Nothing like this
really exists with regard to the southern flank.23 Policy documents like
the Framework for the South or the Package for the South are not
strategic texts nor do they define a level of ambition for NATO in the
region. This is partly a sign that the allies want to concentrate on the
eastern flank (and maybe then on China) and that the attention and
energy that they are ready to dedicate to the MENA is limited as a
consequence. **[If, on the contrary, NATO wishes to upgrade its presence
and impact in the MENA, then a significant effort is to be made at the
strategic level]{.underline}**. The alliance could not by itself address
the root causes of instability in the region, which is clearly beyond
its remit, but it could at least give more purposefulness to what it has
done so far. [This first implies a comprehensive analysis of the
security situation in the MENA and of the issues that are likely to
spill over into NATO in the near future]{.underline}. This does not need
to be carried out by NATO itself. It could rely on national input or a
mix of open-source and classified information. [On this basis, a
strategic reflection and document, as part of the current Strategic
Concept process, defining the objectives, methods, and resources of
NATO's presence in the region is of the essence]{.underline}. **[A
dedicated document or a section in the Strategic Concept would not only
give visibility to a policy that has suffered from a lack of strategy,
it would also clarify the level of ambition of the
allies]{.underline}**. **[A strategic narrative laying down a "renewed
cooperative security" ambition]{.underline}** for the region **[would
also help articulate such ambition with NATO's deterrence and defense
agenda]{.underline}**. Resources and political commitment would have to
follow suit and be sustained over time. No quick fix will do.
[Furthermore, a "renewed cooperative security" plan should be
accompanied by strategic communication]{.underline} (in English, French,
and Arabic) [on what NATO intends to do, how, and why it matters to the
recipient entities]{.underline}. Any strategic-communications or
public-diplomacy effort should also include a counter-disinformation
component. Ideally such communication would be paired with a similar
exercise carried out by the EU. Realistically, the chance that such a
strategic framework will be adopted is not high; conversely, the chance
that NATO would achieve anything meaningful in the region absent a
strategic vision is equally low. Division of Tasks and Concentration of
Efforts [Second, any purposeful NATO presence in the MENA will have to
be the result of a well thought-through partnership with the
EU.]{.underline} The two institutions must capitalize on what they do
best and refrain from developing activities that are better covered by
the other. This also applies to cooperation with the UN and its
development and humanitarian agencies. The typology of security issues
in the region presented above is useful in this respect. Distinguishing
between conflicts, terrorism, or organized crime; between state
fragility, bad governance, or the porosity of borders; and the more
diffuse human-security issues makes it possible to identify areas where
a military alliance can add value and others where it most likely will
not. NATO can play a role in response to open conflicts or terrorism,
and it can contribute to the strengthening of military and security
institutions, but it is unlikely to be able to bring anything tangible
in human-security domains. This prioritization matters to the definition
of where the alliance should go, but it also calls for partnerships
insofar as any NATO activity on a narrow segment will only produce an
effect if complemented by parallel actions on the other (economic,
political, etc.) segments, by other entities. [With this logic in mind,
if NATO and the EU are engaged in capacity-building and training in the
region, NATO must concentrate on the defense segment for which it offers
the best know-how or resources]{.underline}. **[This includes tasks such
as defense-sector reform, capacity-building on operations in
high-temperature environments, military counterinsurgency and
counterterrorism, assisting in building interoperability between allies
and partner countries, and handling improvised explosive
devices]{.underline}**.25 But NATO should probably refrain from
investing in security areas where the EU or the UN are better placed or
only embrace these tasks in places where the others cannot go. Focus on
the defense segment suggests that NATO alone is unlikely to play a
strategic role, in the sense that its limited presence will in most
cases be insufficient to be transformative. Hence the importance of
inter-institutional cooperation. **[Beyond cooperative security, NATO
must retain the capacity to conduct military operations in a
crisis-management mode in the region]{.underline}**. This goes against
the current post-Afghanistan mood, yet the nature of the environment
makes it impossible to rule out a major military operation one day.
(There was similar intervention fatigue in 2010 while NATO was drafting
its Strategic Concept and a year later it got involved in Libya.) [This
carries implications for NATO planning and exercises as well as for the
projection capabilities of European states, at a time when the
collective-defense agenda tends to concentrate on territorial
defense]{.underline}.

**[This confirms that Russia's regional politics remain above all an
instrument working towards the realisation of larger ambitions in its
foreign policy and security agenda]{.underline}**. This is shown perhaps
by what is left of its, still modest, economic footprint. [The regional
powers are aware of this whilst taking into account the calculations of
a strengthened Russia]{.underline}. Indeed, **[said powers are often at
the origin of such rapprochements]{.underline}**. Thus, **[the heating
up of links with Algeria would not have been possible if the Algerian
regime had not needed international legitimisation]{.underline}** at the
end of the period of violence that it emerged from at the end of the
1990s. **[In the case of Egypt, the rapprochement can also be explained
by Cairo's will to play Russia and America off against one another so as
to draw the greatest profits]{.underline}**. This is in a context where
it is necessary to find a solution to the very reserved stance of
Western countries towards President Sisi's regime. Indeed, [regional
actors maintain their independence as, despite Russia's new found
political and military credibility, they are still seen as "strangers in
the Middle East."]{.underline}75 To explain this, several examples are
cited by an expert including the constitutional project proposed by
Moscow for Syria following the Astana76 format which is unpopular in the
region (for example in Turkey). The same specialist also evokes the
traces left in the region by Russia and their contribution to the
creation of memories of "Russian wars against Islam" (Afghanistan,
Chechnya and Aleppo).77 [The multi-faceted game which Moscow
employs]{.underline} -- at times both a strength and a means of
safeguarding its influence in a particularly unstable and conflictual
area -- [contributes to the blurring of its image.]{.underline} In
Syria, how should Russia develop relations with Tehran when the Gulf
monarchies and especially Israel aim to extract concessions from Moscow
in order to contain Iranian influence? There are many in Iran who
believe, as put by the old spokesperson of the Iranian ex-president
Mohamed Khatami, that Russians are untrustworthy and likely "to stab you
in the back."78 [Many of these new regional relations, whether with
Turkey or Saudi Arabia, lie on shaky foundations and are far from being
based on complete trust.]{.underline} Success is not always
straightforward or clear, a conclusion demonstrated by the mixed result
of the Astana Conference held in March 2017. **[An important parameter
of the Russian growth in regional influence lies in the possibility that
the region becomes the object of a "deal" between Moscow and the Trump
administration]{.underline}**. This would be under the name of the
struggle against international terrorism. [As of March 2017, too many
uncertain variables are in play to proffer a definitive answer to this
question]{.underline}. For now, **[political circumstances in Washington
are preventing progress from being made, given Russia's place at the
heart of issues questioning the legitimacy of]{.underline}** Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}**. In any case, scepticism abounds in Moscow as
Trump's new security advisor, H. R. McMaster is not the zealous
proponent of total war against radical Islam that Flynn was" and that
"this limits room for d칠tente."79 [The Trump administration's position
on Iran]{.underline} (the president will doubtless be keen to limit
Iran's influence in Syria) [could complicate things, especially as
Russia is attached to the JCPOA that Trump has criticised at several
instances]{.underline}.80

introduction of democracy to Iraq, as well as the US-backed Cedar
Revolution in Lebanon, all this had spread fear among the ruling
autocrats. **[In the Kremlin, where conspiracy theories about US-led
revolutions are rife, the Arab leaders found a listening ear and
repeated it constantly to their US counterparts]{.underline}**. 5
**[This convergence in opinions created a synergy between Moscow and
many Arabs that would blossom in the following decade]{.underline}**.
[Whether Putin meditated carefully on his current MENA strategy or if he

prove indispensable for some]{.underline}**. By the end of the 2000s,
[Russia was an important player in the region, to be counted along with
the US and the EU]{.underline}. It seems that Vladimir [Putin has jumped
on every single opportunity that presented itself, calculated the
benefits Russia can make]{.underline} -- be it economic or geopolitical
-- [and threw the dice.]{.underline} So when the Arab Spring broke out
in late 2010, he was in the right place. The moment was ripe to increase
Russia's presence in the region, which he did. Today, **[Russia can
engage with all sides, including sworn enemies who wage wars against
each other, and is once again treated as a global power not to be
neglected.]{.underline}**

#### Western abandonment is key to Russia-North Africa relations

Isabelle **Falcon '17**, Deputy director of the Fondation pour la
Recherche Stategique, "Russia's quest for influence in North Africa and
the Middle East", Fondation pour la Recherche Stategique, 4/11/17,
https://www.frstrategie.org/en/programs/observatoire-du-monde-arabo-musulman-et-du-sahel/russias-quest-influence-north-africa-and-middle-east-2017

Beyond the military operations in Syria starting from September 2015,
[Russia surprised the international community through its capacity to
talk with several major players about the Syrian issue, including
non-state actors, such as the Kurds]{.underline}. **[This significantly
contributed to the fact that it managed to impose itself as a vital
mediator]{.underline}**. **[This approach reflects the strategy pursued
more generally in the Northern Africa/Middle East region]{.underline}**.
**[No relation is excluded]{.underline}**, including those with Fatah or
the Iraqi Kurds. [Such an approach aims at widening Russian room for
manoeuvre]{.underline}. If the legacy of the Soviet era favours the
development of certain relations, it does not render them exclusive.
Thus, from 2001, President [Putin signed a strategic partnership
agreement with his Algerian counterpart. However, this did not stop
Moscow from engaging with Morocco with whom the Kremlin had always
maintained relations, and conversely with Tunisia]{.underline}. [In the
Middle East, the partnership with Iran has reached an unprecedented
level]{.underline}. In four years (2013 -- 2017), Presidents Putin and
Rouhani have met on eight separate occasions. The last meeting being the
first bilateral meeting between the two men. Tehran has authorised
Russia to temporarily use the base of Nojeh for its air strikes in
Syria. This increased Russo-Iranian proximity has not stopped the links
between Russia and Israel from becoming an important paradigm of the
Kremlin's regional policy. The demographic weight of Israeli citizens of
Soviet origin undoubtedly contributed to this development. Communication
between the two countries became particularly during the Russian
military intervention in Syria. The Russian government is showing itself
to be particularly attentive to Israel's concerns regarding the presence
of Hezbollah and the military influence of Iran in Syria. Considering
that dialogue is preferable to tension and recriminations, Russia has
actively sought to establish workable relations with Saudi Arabia. [The
two countries show themselves inclined to compartmentalise the issues
that characterise their bilateral relations]{.underline}. **[Thus Russia
has shown itself to be faithful to a new foreign policy that seeks to
diversify its relations in all regions]{.underline}**. In the region
concerned[, this effort must take into consideration the fact that the
inherited networks of the Soviet era have been significantly eroded
since the 1990s]{.underline}. Moreover, **[the growing instability in
the zone, especially since the Arab Spring, has forced the Kremlin to
demonstrate its flexibility so as to not remove any options in the event
that political relations were to evolve.]{.underline}** In this context,
**[Moscow has also managed to appreciate the opportunity that was
presented by the perception spread at the regional level of a
"confusion" of Western powers]{.underline}** (caused by such factors as
the "abandonment" of Mubarak, red lines not followed in Syria and the
United States' regional disengagement). **[Thus, Moscow did not hesitate
to manipulate the disappointments left by Western political leaders to
its advantage]{.underline}**. This partly explains the development of
relations with Egypt, which, after the military coup d'칠tat of 2013, is
looking to establish a more independent foreign policy. **[Despite the
strong ambiguities that will lastingly encumber the Russo-Turkish
relationship]{.underline}** (starting with the Kurdish question),
**[Turkey and Russia continue to share a strong disdain for the
West]{.underline}**. After [the coup attempt in Turkey, the immediate
support offered by Moscow to the "legitimate authorities" help to repair
the damage left by the crisis of the Su-24 shot down by Turkish forces.
This marked a stark contrast with Western capitals which voiced their
concerns about the repression carried out by the Turkish
regime]{.underline}. Russia also knows that its link with Tehran
indirectly benefits from the suspicion Iran harbours for the Western
powers. The pragmatism observed in the Saudi Arabia/Russia relationship
is tied to Riyadh's desire to diversify its foreign policy in a context
where its relationship with Washington has undergone a restructuring in
recent years. The arms deals made with Iraq underline Baghdad's desire
to strengthen its political independence from Washington. **[In the
Maghreb, even the situation is less "severe" for the West, "the Russian
project finds a favourable environment due to these countries' belief in
the necessity for a better balanced, bipolar world"]{.underline}**
(**[against a highly fluid backdrop, a rapprochement with Moscow can now
be used to put pressure on EU countries and the US]{.underline}** ).
**[These circumstances have notably favoured the recent development of
Russo-Moroccan relations and]{.underline}**, to a lesser extent,
**[Russo-Tunisian relations]{.underline}**. In general, [Russia plays a
sensitive game in the entirety of the region. This is demonstrated when
Moscow states that its policy in the Middle East and North Africa will
always be led on a basis of "respecting their \[states'\] sovereignty
and territorial integrity and the right to self-determination without
outside interference"]{.underline} (Foreign Policy Concept).

#### Coop is driven by Russia's distance from the West

Samuel **Ramani '20**, is a DPhil candidate at the University of
Oxford's Department of Politics and International Relations, "Russia
Takes its Syrian Model of Counterinsurgency to Africa", Rusi, 9/9/20,
https://rusi.org/commentary/russia-takes-its-syrian-model-counterinsurgency-africa

Although it remains unclear whether Moscow assisted Mali's coup
plotters, supporting an extra-legal turnover of power would severely
undercut Russia's aspirations to become a counterinsurgency leader in
Africa. [Since Russia embarked on its military intervention in support
of Syrian President]{.underline} Bashar Al-Assad in September 2015,
**[the Kremlin has advertised its 'Syrian model' of counterinsurgency to
African countries struggling with political violence]{.underline}**.
**[This model emphasises state-to-state cooperation between Russia and
African governments and presents authoritarian stability as the most
effective antidote to extremism]{.underline}**. As the **[unilateralism
that underpins US counterterrorism efforts]{.underline}** in Somalia
**[and Washington's frequent attachment of human rights conditions for
military assistance have frustrated African leaders, Russia's
alternative counterinsurgency model has become increasingly attractive
in Africa.]{.underline}** In April 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
[Lavrov stated that Somalia desired Russian equipment to aid its
counterterrorism operations and Somalia subsequently requested Moscow's
assistance in upgrading its military preparedness]{.underline}. [Sudan's
President]{.underline} Omar [Al-Bashir praised Russia's Syrian model of
counterinsurgency more explicitly in November 2017 by stating that 'if
it were not for the Russian intervention in the situation in Syria, then
this country would be lost'.]{.underline} More recently, US Secretary of
Defense Mark **[Esper's wavering commitment to African security and
France's counterinsurgency struggles in the Sahel have increased the
appeal of Russia's counterterrorism model in West Africa]{.underline}**.
Nigeria's Ambassador to Russia Steve Ugbah argued in in October 2019
that '[We're sure that with Russian help we'll manage to crush Boko
Haram' and cited Russia's defeat of the Islamic State in Syria as proof
for this statement]{.underline}. In November 2019, large-scale
anti-French and anti-UN protests erupted in Mali's capital Bamako
calling for Russia to vanquish Islamists in Mali like it did in Syria.

#### Cooperation depends on anti-US sentiment

Samuel **Ramani '20**, is a DPhil candidate at the University of
Oxford's Department of Politics and International Relations, "Russia
Takes its Syrian Model of Counterinsurgency to Africa", Rusi, 9/9/20,
https://rusi.org/commentary/russia-takes-its-syrian-model-counterinsurgency-africa

In spite of its military setbacks and cautious counterterrorism policy,
**[Russia has capitalised on anti-Western sentiments and effective
branding of its Syrian model of counterinsurgency to secure arms deals
and economic contracts]{.underline}**. [Russia is the leading arms
vendor to Africa, as it supplied 49% of North Africa's weapons and 28%
of Sub-Saharan Africa's weapons]{.underline} between 2014--18, [and
numerous African states struggling with insurgencies have requested
Russian weaponry]{.underline}. After human rights concerns prevented the
US from selling advanced aircraft to Nigeria in 2014, Abuja struck a
deal with Moscow to purchase Mi-35 and Mi-17 fighter jets. Nigeria's
reliance on Russian aircraft in its struggle against Boko Haram resulted
in its agreement to purchase another 12 Mi-35 fighter jets from Russia
in October 2019. **[Russia has also supplied light weaponry to Mali, the
Central African Republic, and Sudan, as all three countries grapple with
varying degrees of isolation from international arms markets. Russia has
also presented itself as a counterinsurgency partner in order to expand
its access to the continent's mineral deposits]{.underline}**. Russia's
PMC deployments in support of Central African Republic's President
Faustin-Archange Touadera against Seleka rebels are closely intertwined
with its desire to profit from the country's vast diamond reserves.
[Russia has spearheaded efforts to lift export restrictions on diamond
sales from the Central African Republic and leveraged its
counterinsurgency campaign to profit Lobaye Invest]{.underline}, a
mining company with close ties to Yevgeny Prigozhin. **[Russian media
outlets and think tanks often assert that US and French counterterrorism
campaigns in the Sahel are aimed at securing hegemony over the region's
vast uranium stockpiles]{.underline}**. However, [Russia's civilian
nuclear energy giant Rosatom's forays into Nigeria and aspirations to
enter Niger's uranium market are undoubtedly strengthened by the
positive impact of counterinsurgency cooperation on Moscow's bilateral
relationships with West African countries]{.underline}.

## 2NC Impact Toolbox

### 2NC -- Libya Impact -- Russia Coop Key

#### Russia is the key regional broker for bringing peace to Libya and North Africa broadly

Marianna **Belenkaya '19**, writes on the Middle East for the Russian
daily Kommersant. An Arab studies scholar with almost 20 years of
experience covering the Middle East, "Russia keeps plugging away at
cooperation with North Africa", Al-Monitor, 1/29/20,
https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/russia-north-africa-algeria-morocco-tunisia.html

Tunisia's ambitions and abilities are more modest; nevertheless, the
nation managed to spark interest in Russian entrepreneurs, who are also
weighing the prospects of working in Libya. In any case, **[Russia is
obviously willing to develop its relations with Africa in general and
with the northern part of the continent Africa
particularly]{.underline}**. For instance, [Moscow plans to organize a
Russia-Africa summit in the fall]{.underline}. **[North Africa\'s Arab
nations are likely to provide much-needed help and support, considering
that currently they are Russia's main are primary drivers of cooperation
between Russia and the African continent]{.underline}**. According to
authors of the "Russia-Africa Shared Vision 2030" report who spoke with
Al-Monitor, from 2010 to 2017 Russian exports to Africa basically
tripled, increasing from \$5.1 billion to \$14.8 billion. It should be
noted, however, that this amount almost exclusively consists of trade
with North African countries; more precisely, Algeria and Egypt received
73% of such Russian exports in 2017. **[Lavrov's meetings in the Maghreb
also touched upon the conflicts in Libya and Western
Sahara]{.underline}**. [In its view of the latter, Moscow tries to
balance between Algeria and Morocco]{.underline}. As the Russian foreign
minister moved from one country to another, he had to adjust his
statements with utmost caution. However, **[in regard to this conflict,
as with many others, Russia formally advocates for compromise and
dialogue]{.underline}**. [Expressing his position on the situation in
Libya, Lavrov objected to the arbitrary choice of election dates,
emphasizing that the conflicting sides should reach a consensus
first.]{.underline} He said **[Russia is willing to become a mediator
for anyone interested in peace]{.underline}**.

### 2NC -- Libya Impact -- AT: Not Russia's Focus

#### Russia sees stability in North Africa as a [core]{.underline} foreign policy goal as long as its stranded from the West

https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/07/03/2018/north-africa-%E2%80%93-gateway-russia%E2%80%99s-involvement

**[North Africa has long been an essential vector for Russian foreign
policy, with multiple]{.underline}** political, diplomatic and military
**[resources dedicated to the presence in this region]{.underline}**. On
the overall, **[Russia looks to build up its presence in the area
through establishing closer links in mutually beneficial
areas]{.underline}** such as military, energy and nuclear energy in
particular (developing nuclear reactors with local partners) **[and also
looks to boost strategic partnerships or explore new domains of
cooperation]{.underline}** (establishing factories of Russian
manufacturers in the region, developing new paths of economic
cooperation in agriculture, technology, tourism etc.). [The main aim is
to display itself as a strong partner and develop economic ramifications
that bring revenues and political influence]{.underline}. Strategically
speaking, [the Russian government aims to recognize the local economic
and military needs in North Africa and enhance its regional
presence]{.underline}. In this sense, wearing off debts under some form
of agreement and attractive financial schemes are very effective tools.
[Russia also quantifies on the need of the regional actors to diversify
their international partners]{.underline}, for instance when acquiring
military equipment. What are the implications for the region? [The North
African countries are looking for economic stability and development,
diplomatic support, and to ensure that their security needs are
met]{.underline}. In other words, this indicates that the local
governments are ready to cooperate with global and regional powers.
[Therefore, they generally welcome the Russian involvement, although
they treat it with cautiousness]{.underline}. **[On the long term it is
rather difficult to assess developments but naturally, the EU and the US
will search for ways to become more visible and enhance their
credibility in the region, countering the Russian
influence]{.underline}**. The extent of cooperation between Russia and
the North African countries **[In the context of the uncertainty of the
relations with the US]{.underline}** (a traditional long-standing ally),
**[it is clear the need for Morocco to search to strengthen ties with
other international powers and explore every option
available.]{.underline}** Proof of this is the king's visits to China
and Russia, in spring 2016, in order to deepen strategic ties. [Russia
developed relations with Morocco on two directions, namely economic and
security & defense. **Once again, Russia is seizing the opportunity to
fill a gap and extend its influence by being ready to supply Morocco
with military equipment and expand economic ties**]{.underline} (growing
foreign investments, trade and expanding tourism opportunities --
Morocco seems very appealing for Russian tourists). I would argue that
in the case of Morocco, [Russia is looking to establish itself as a
strategic partner in multiple areas]{.underline}. The recent visit of
the Russian Prime Minister in October 2017 confirms this, its scope
being to explore new dimensions for furthering this partnership, the
economic area being the most feasible way to do so (with emphasis on
agriculture, trade, energy, tourism etc.) while also exploring
cooperation in the military sphere. **[The Russian Prime Minister's tour
also included Algeria]{.underline}**, highlights of the visit being
discussions to further deliver military equipment (aircrafts and air
defense systems) and to establish factories of Russian companies that
make trucks, bulldozers etc. [The Russians are looking to extend the
economic cooperation and maintain Algeria as an important weapons
buyer]{.underline}. Russia is the largest supplier of military equipment
to Algeria and according to the data gathered by SIPRI, every year from
1999 to 2016 Algeria has signed deals to buy significant weaponry from
Russia (a few examples in this sense are the acquisitions of multi-role
fighters Su-30MKI(A) and Mi-28 attack helicopters). **[Another point
worth mentioning in the case of Algeria-Russia relations is that the
Russian government agreed to erase the debt owed to the former Soviet
Union and in exchange Algeria purchased Russian goods in the amount of
the disregarded debt]{.underline}**. **[This has been a practice in
multiple cases in Africa]{.underline}**. **[Cooperation in the energy
field is very important, Russian companies being very involved in
Algeria]{.underline}** -- Gazprom and Sonatrach explored together the El
Assel block and found oil and gas reserves with further exploration
currently underway (Gazprom owns 49% of the project). [Nuclear energy
cooperation is also on top of the cooperation agenda between Russia and
Algeria]{.underline}, the countries having signed an agreement to
cooperate in 2014 and being currently in discussions to build Algeria's
first nuclear power plant. [The deal concerning the nuclear energy area
signed in 2016 with Tunisia is also relevant and involves cooperation in
research and development of nuclear infrastructure including reactors
and power plants]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the rise of the Russian
tourism in Tunisia in the past years is very important in the overall
relations between the two countries]{.underline}. On military
cooperation, it is noticeable the intention of the Russians to supply
Tunisia with military equipment (helicopters, bullet-proof vests and
night-vision goggles) with the aim of supporting Tunisian forces in the
fight against terrorism. Russia goes the extra mile and brands itself as
an important partner in fighting terrorism in the region by being ready
to support with military equipment, sharing intelligence and expertise.
**[In the context of worsening relations with the US and rather stranded
ones with the EU, Egypt has moved closer to Russia in the recent
years]{.underline}**. The August 2017 visit of Egyptian Prime Minister
to Russia and the meeting between Putin and Sisi in China at the BRICS
summit in September are just the most recent examples of the
strengthened relations between the two countries. The military equipment
package deal (2014), the agreement to buy Russian attack helicopters
(2016), cooperation in fighting terrorism in the region and joint
military exercises are all part of the nexus of cooperation between
Egypt and Russia. The agreement on the construction of the El-Dabaa
power plant, a partnership between Rosatom and the Egyptian authorities,
has been finalized during the September meeting with a very good
financial scheme in place (a loan offered by the Russians that will
cover 85% of the costs). [**The relationship between the two countries
is also important from a political standpoint, through the lens of
regional issues where the two actors have common interests and support
or can support each other such as in the case of Libya**. **Amidst the
crisis in Libya, Russia is providing support to the**]{.underline}
Libyan National Army (**[LNA]{.underline}**) commander Khalifa Haftar,
**[and is present in the overall international negotiations expecting to
play a role in a future stable Libyan state.]{.underline}**

BEIRUT: While it may not make the rounds in Washington as one of the big
geopolitical rivalries of the era, [tensions between Morocco and Algeria
are real, and have escalated in recent years thanks to a dispute over
the Western Sahara]{.underline}, which Morocco claims to be its own
territory, while Algeria backs the Tindouf-based Polisario Front rebel
group.

[As a result, **both nations have begun investing heavily** in their
militaries --- and specifically in airborne systems that can counter one
another.]{.underline}

Now, an [aviation arms race may be **escalated further by a need for
Russia to find defense exports** in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine,
and subsequent sanctions pain]{.underline}. Algeria, a longstanding
military client of Russia, could suddenly see cheaper rates for the
Su-57, or even end up as the first export customer for the Su-75
Checkmate.

"At this point, [as one of the biggest global customers of Russian
weaponry, it's likely that Algeria may eventually **acquire Russia's
top-notch technology** that Moscow seeks to export]{.underline}," Samuel
Bendett, a member of the Russia Studies Program at CNA and an adjunct
senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, told Breaking
Defense. "This may include Su-57 down the line, but it's also likely
that Algeria may start importing Su-75 Checkmate fighter, once it goes
into production, considering how much Moscow is seeking to export its
new military technology."

In turn, [Morocco is looking to bolster its own advanced air assets,
spending heavily on American-made jets and helicopters]{.underline}.

"It appears that [both countries seek to bolster their **military
capabilities with new technologies**, including air force]{.underline}.
Given the regional geography where both countries are located --- large
territory, long distances --- air force capabilities are crucial for
monitoring, ISR and combat," Bendett said.

Mounting Tensions In The Region

Tensions between the two countries have simmered for years, but
intensified in December 2020 after Morocco normalized ties with Israel
and the US recognized the kingdom's sovereignty over the Western Sahara.

In August 2021, [**Algeria cut diplomatic relations** with Morocco,
after what it called "hostile actions by its most populous neighbor with
which it has had strained relations for decades]{.underline}." Algerian
Foreign Minister Ramdane Lamamra accused Morocco of using Pegasus
spyware against its officials, supporting a separatist group and failing
in bilateral commitments, including on the Western Sahara issue.

In the last few months, the verbal attacks between the two countries
have increased. In January, Morocco's King Mohammed VI declared the
creation of a new "eastern military zone" along its border with Algeria,
a move described in media reports as "a statement of intent meant to
indicate Morocco's readiness to confront any military provocations from
its eastern neighbor." And just weeks ago, Algeria suspended a
two-decade old cooperation treaty with Spain, after Madrid backed the
position of Morocco on the disputed Western Sahara.

With such defense deals and interests, is there an actual potential for
an armed conflict between the two countries?

"Earlier I would have asserted that there is no such possibility, but
[after the Russian invasion to Ukraine with all its geostrategic
implications]{.underline} and the escalated Algerian speech towards
Morocco, [the **possibilities** **are high for such a
conflict**]{.underline}," Abdel Hamid Harfi, a Moroccan military expert,
told Breaking Defense.

[Israel has reportedly reached out to Morocco over the possibility of
selling Iron Dome missile system, nearly a year after the Tel Aviv
regime and the North African country normalized diplomatic
relations]{.underline} in a deal brokered by former US president Donald
Trump.

According to a report published by French-language Moroccan newspaper Le
Desk, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which has developed the system,
has expressed interest to supply the military hardware to Morocco.

The report asserted that [Iron Dome missile system, designed to
intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells, would
ensure better protection of Morocco's sensitive military
sites]{.underline}.

Spanish daily newspaper La Raz칩n reported on Thursday that Algeria had
deployed missiles near its border with Morocco, after the killing of
three Algerians in an airstrike earlier in the week that Algeria says
Morocco carried out against the border area between Mauritania and the
disputed territory of Western Sahara.

"On November 1... three Algerian nationals were subjected to a cowardly
assassination in a barbaric bombing of their trucks while they were
traveling between the Mauritanian capital, Nouakchott, and Ouargla," the
Algerian president's office said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Several factors indicate that the Moroccan occupation forces in Western
Sahara carried out this cowardly assassination with sophisticated
weaponry," it added, warning that the act "will not go unpunished."

Morocco's government has made no comment yet.

For decades, [the relationship between Morocco and Algeria has been
characterized by tension. The border between the two countries has been
closed since 1994. Eighty percent of Western Sahara is controlled by
Morocco, which regards the territory as its own.]{.underline} Algeria
supports the Polisario Front, which seeks independence for the disputed
region.

After an incident near the border crossing between Western Sahara and
Mauritania last year, the Polisario declared a three-decade ceasefire
against Morocco "null and void."

[Israel and Morocco agreed on December 10, 2020 to normalize relations
in a deal brokered with the help of Trump's administration]{.underline},
making the North African country the fourth Arab state last year to
strike a normalization deal with the regime. The others were the United
Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan.

After two decades of war, [the United States withdrew its troops from
Afghanistan]{.underline}. Soon after the withdrawal of America-led NATO
troops started, the [Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan
government]{.underline}. The insurgents swept across the country in an
unbelievably quick overtake, capturing all major cities in a matter of
days, as [Afghan security forces, trained and equipped by the US and its
allies, melted away]{.underline}.

Like in Afghanistan and the Middle East, [military intervention has been
a common feature in post-colonial African history]{.underline}. Most
African leaders view the US- and NATO -- as the protector of democracy
and a moral mediator of national conflicts. The United States even has a
Mission to African Union to strengthen democratic institutions, promote
peace and stability, etc. But with the US-induced chaos in Afghanistan,
[African countries should become wary of foreign military interference.
Africa's past is an indicator of this.]{.underline}

In 1992, UN Security Council Resolution 733 and UN Security Council
Resolution 746 led to creating the United Nations Operation in Somalia I
(UNOSOM I) to provide humanitarian relief and help restore order in
Somalia after the dissolution of its central government. United Nations
Security Council Resolution 794 was unanimously passed in December 1992,
which approved a coalition of United Nations peacekeepers led by the
United States. Forming the Unified Task Force (UNITAF), the alliance was
tasked with ensuring security until humanitarian efforts would be
transferred to the UN.

In January 2021, the [US troops completed their withdrawal from Somalia
at a time when the Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabab extremist group was
improving its bomb-making skills and continuing to attack military and
civilian targets even in the capital]{.underline}, Mogadishu. The
withdrawal came less than a month before Somalia was set to hold a
national election. For three decades of foreign interference, [Somalia
has 500,000 fatalities to show and a legacy of being both a fragile and
failed state]{.underline}. This timing of the withdrawal makes one
wonder whether the United Nations Security Council worsened the heavy
loss of life, destruction to property and threat to regional stability
they set out to rectify in 1992.

On the other hand, is [Libya that was invaded by a multi-state NATO-led
coalition in 2011]{.underline}. The military intervention was to
implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 in response to
the First Libyan Civil War events. [American and British naval forces
fired over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles.]{.underline} At the same time,
the French Air Force, British Royal Air Force, and Royal Canadian Air
Force undertook sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by Coalition
forces.

Fighting in Libya ended in October 2011 following the death of Muammar
Gaddafi. Libya's new government requested that the mission be extended
to the end of the year, but the Security Council unanimously voted to
end NATO's mandate for military action. [This withdrawal shows a pattern
of US and NATO troops withdrawing from territories in a time of need.
Since the end of the war, there has been violence involving various
militias and the new state security forces]{.underline}, which have
escalated into the Second Libyan Civil War. [Libya is now arguably a
failed state]{.underline}.

The result in Afghanistan has been a crisis marked by displacement
within the country and abroad. According to the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), nearly 400,000 people have been forced from their
homes since the beginning of the year. Now that the NATO troops have
withdrawn and the Taliban is back, all that is left to show is an
estimated 147,000 people killed in the Afghanistan war since 2001, with
more than 38,000 civilians killed.

In all this, what is particularly alarming is that NATO had foreseen the
return of the Taliban after their departure. [According to a US
intelligence report, the Afghan government would likely collapse within
six months after NATO completed its withdrawal from the
country]{.underline}. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan two weeks
before the US was set to complete its troop withdrawal. It is
distressing to know that the US withdrew their troops fully aware that
anarchy would soon follow.

Upon reflection on Afghanistan's grim situation, it is more evident than
ever that foreign military intervention in Africa is not a viable
solution. These military campaigns are carried out under the guise of
humanitarianism and saving the civilian population but ultimately worsen
the situation. For this reason, foreign military interference in Africa
should cease since it does more harm than good.

Furthermore, if the situation is so dire that foreign military
interference is justified, the troops and mediators should be from
fellow African countries. The reason is that [Africans have a better
understanding of African politics hence realistic strategies in
resolving conflict and promoting democracy.]{.underline}

An excellent instance is the Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) role
in ending the South Sudan Civil War. In December 2013, a political power
struggle broke out between President Kiir and his former deputy Riek
Machar, as the president accused Machar and ten others of attempting a
coup d'칠tat. Uganda deployed troops to fight along with the South
Sudanese army, which ended in their triumph. Ultimately, the [warring
parties assented to a peace deal and formed a new unity
government]{.underline} in February 2020. The agreement brought an end
to the conflict that had killed about 400,000 people and displaced
millions.

With contemporary history replete with the failure of foreign military
powers to ensure peace in conflicted regions, [it is time
interventionism came to an end, especially in Africa.]{.underline}

#### Which causes nuclear war.

**ABC '20** \[ABC News; ; 12-31-2020; Hot spots to watch: What crises
could explode in 2021; ABC News;
https://abcnews.go.com/International/hot-spots-watch-crises-explode-2021/story?id=74607383;
7-16-2022; SK\]

Here are the top [conflicts]{.underline} or issues that [could burst
into all-out crises]{.underline} in 2021.

[Nuclear arms race: From rogue states to regional tensions]{.underline}

At the start of 2020, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists made a
dramatic announcement \-- its famed Doomsday Clock was the closest to
midnight it\'s ever been, with [the threats of nuclear war and climate
change growing ever more acute]{.underline}.

\"[National leaders have ended or undermined several major arms control
treaties and negotiations]{.underline} during the last year, creating an
environment conducive to a [renewed nuclear arms race, to the
proliferation of nuclear weapons, and to lowered barriers to nuclear
war]{.underline},\" the group said in January.

Twelve months later, the last nuclear arms control pact between the U.S.
and Russia is weeks from expiry, with no plans to extend it in sight.
China continues to develop its nuclear arsenal, possibly even doubling
it in the next decade, according to the Pentagon. It\'s also clashed
high in the Himalayas with its nuclear-armed neighbor India, which in
turn spilled blood with nuclear-armed rival Pakistan over the disputed
territory Kashmir.

As the global infrastructure to constrain nuclear weapons wanes, [any
one of these could turn into a flashpoint next year]{.underline}, and
that\'s without even mentioning the rogue nuclear power states North
Korea and Iran \-- both of which are likely to test the incoming Biden
administration.

After four years of President Donald Trump\'s policies, North Korea has
more nuclear weapons and enhanced ballistic missile capability, which it
may show off with a test launch early in President-elect Joe Biden\'s
term to try to garner some attention and leverage, according to
analysts. While the likelihood of a \"fire and fury\" response will
diminish after Trump\'s departure, the risk of a skirmish spiraling into
all-out war remains real, according to analysts.

Iran doesn\'t have nuclear weapons and says it won\'t pursue them, but
it once again has a stockpile of enriched uranium and a host of spinning
centrifuges that decrease its so-called \"breakout time\" to potentially
develop the bomb, according to nuclear experts. Analysts expect its
forces, under disguise or through proxies, could resume attacks in the
Persian Gulf region to build leverage ahead of possible negotiations
with Biden\'s team, risking conflict with U.S., Israeli, or Arab forces.

Terrorism threat expands, seizing instability across Africa

On the campaign trail, Trump and his senior advisers repeatedly
celebrated the defeat of ISIS\'s so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria.
But since then, the terror threat has dispersed, with fighters and
weapons flowing out of shrinking ISIS territory to new pockets around
the world.

Across Africa in particular, the world\'s youngest and fastest-growing
continent, ISIS affiliates are now gaining strength, especially in
Nigeria, Mozambique and the Congo \-- although a few terrorism experts
caution some claim to be more powerful than they are in reality.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, sub-Saharan Africa\'s largest
country, the Allied Democratic Forces, a decades-old militant group, has
traded claims of responsibility for deadly attacks with a local ISIS
affiliate. The fighting compounds the deep hunger crisis there, with
more than 19 million people in need, according to the International
Rescue Committee, which reported that DRC now has \"more people facing a
severe hunger crisis\... than has ever been recorded in any country.\"

In Mozambique, Islamist [militants linked to ISIS have conducted brutal
attacks]{.underline} in the northernmost province Cabo Delgado,
including beheading more than 50 civilians in November and temporarily
seizing control of a port in August. The [deteriorating security
situation has displaced more than half a million people,]{.underline}
according to the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR), with continued violence
likely to bring more acute humanitarian need next year.

The [situation is perhaps worst, however, in the Sahel]{.underline}, the
semi-arid region that spans northern Africa just south of the Sahara
Desert and that has seen a sharp rise in extremist groups and fighting.
[In Mali and Niger, the security situation is at best
shaky,]{.underline} with a military junta trying to stabilize Mali amid
inter-communal and jihadist violence and tense elections this week in
Niger leaving the path ahead uncertain, but hopeful.

But [Burkina Faso, the landlocked country twice the size of New York,
has become the world\'s fastest growing crisis]{.underline}. Over 1
million people have been internally displaced in just two years,
according to UNHCR, and there is no end in sight of fighting between the
government, militia groups and terrorist organizations, boosting the
risk of famine for its 20 million people.

[Nigeria, the region\'s powerhouse and Africa\'s most populous country,
is facing all the same trends]{.underline}, with even deeper
implications for global security. Its northeastern corner has been a
hotspot for over a decade, with jihadist group Boko Haram and criminal
violence terrorizing and displacing millions of civilians. But Nigerian
armed forces\' response has been cast as failing, and the government
also faced sharp criticism for its heavy crackdown on anti-police
brutality protests \-- signs that the state itself is increasingly
unstable, which could create more chaos in 2021.

Peace efforts fail, crises worsen in Afghanistan, Yemen

Afghanistan and Yemen have been torn apart by conflict for years now,
but 2021 could bring even deeper suffering for civilians in both
countries.

In recent months, while Afghan government and Taliban delegations sit in
luxury hotels in Doha, Qatar, for peace negotiations, there has been a
spike in car bombings, rocket fire, targeted attacks on police and
security forces, botched Afghan Air Force bombings, and assassinations
of government officials, activists and journalists. Compounded by
coronavirus, that has kept Afghanistan\'s already victimized civilian
population in continued danger, even after decades of humanitarian need.

The peace negotiations were supposed to aim for a nationwide ceasefire
as soon as possible, according to the U.S.-Taliban deal signed in
February, but the militant group has resisted so far, using violence as
leverage in talks. But if the violence is sustained into 2021, it could
imperil negotiations and ignite into all-out conflict, just as U.S.
troops draw down out of the country and the ISIS franchise claims more
deadly attacks more frequently, according to Afghan officials and U.S.
analysts.

Yemen has similarly faced years of stop-and-start peace efforts, but
with coronavirus raging through the country with no health care system
to track it, let alone treat it, the world\'s worst humanitarian crisis
is expected to descend even deeper in 2021.

After five years of endless fighting, humanitarian funding is drying up,
leaving approximately 80% of the population in need, according to aid
groups. The U.N.-mediated effort has stalled, with the Saudi and
Emirati-led coalition fighting in its own ranks as much as with the
Iran-backed Houthi rebels, and neither side has shown real interest in
protecting civilians, let alone peace talks.

One other near decade-old conflict to mention is Syria, where murderous
strongman Bashar al Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, could test the
incoming Biden administration by trying to finally seize control of the
last pocket of rebels and jihadists in Idlib province, causing a
bloodbath and pushing masses of packed Syrians fleeing into Turkey and
beyond to Europe.

East Africa erupting as violence spills over borders

In the final few months of 2020, the [greater Horn of Africa experienced
a flash of violence, often spilling over borders and threatening to suck
in the whole region]{.underline} in the coming months.

At the heart of it is Ethiopia, whose government went to war with
well-armed political forces in its Tigray region, a [conflict that
continues to see sporadic fighting and claims of mass killings and that
could worsen ahead of 2021 elections]{.underline}. It may also suck in
neighboring Eritrea, long at war with Tigrayan leaders and now
partnering with federal forces against them, leading to cross-border
rocket fire and aerial bombardment.

Further endangering the region is the fact that the fighting sent tens
of thousands of refugees scrambling into Sudan, itself on a rocky
transitional road to democracy after decades of oppressive rule. The two
[neighbors are already locked in a dispute over the Grand Ethiopian
Renaissance Dam]{.underline}, and occasional clashes along the border
could enflame into another frontline.

Elsewhere in East Africa, Kenya and Somalia have cut diplomatic ties
over Kenya\'s support for breakaway region Somaliland, heightening
regional tension further. The move also means Kenya will likely pull its
peacekeeping troops in Somalia, just as U.S. forces withdraw, leaving
Somalia more vulnerable to al-Shabab, a powerful al-Qaida affiliate that
will continue to plot attacks and increasingly conduct them abroad.

In the midst of it all, the fragile semi-peace in South Sudan, the
world\'s youngest country still emerging from civil war, faces
\"catastrophic levels of hunger,\" according to the U.N.

\"[If left unchecked much longer, a strategic region could devolve into
war]{.underline} \-- with itself and others \-- [imperiling U.S.
interests]{.underline} from the Red Sea to Europe,\" warned Cameron
Hudson, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\'s Africa Center.

### 2AC -- Ukraine Thump Libya Impact

#### **Ukraine war has caused de-escalation in Libya.**

**Abdullah 4/20** \[Bilal Abdullah; ; 4-20-2022; Russia-Ukraine War and
the De-escalation in Libya; No Publication;
https://epc.ae/en/details/featured/russia-ukraine-war-and-the-de-escalation-in-libya;
7-19-2022; SK\]

[Libya has been relatively calm since the Russian war on Ukraine started
on February 24. Although this North African nation has long been viewed
as a potential arena for settling scores between Russia and the West,
the situation in Libya is currently moving in the opposite direction.
Its political disputes have become less severe, and the flashpoints
between the political rivals have decreased.]{.underline}

This analysis touches on three main areas of conflict between Russia and
the West in Libya in the post-February 24 period -- oil, the UN
mission's future, and military deployment. The analysis also examines
the impact of these points of contention on the local dispute and any
local party's ability to seize the transitional authority or manage any
settlement.

The Oil Factor

The dispute over oil revenues has been at the heart of the larger
conflict in Libya. [Controlling oil wealth creates a balance between the
two sides of the conflict]{.underline}. The eastern camp militarily
controls the oil facilities, i.e., production and export, while the
western camp controls the revenue distribution because the central bank
is located in the capital, Tripoli.

Considering this conflict, the international community tried to protect
the independence of the National Oil Corporation and moved, for months,
toward withholding export revenues from the Libyan Foreign Bank. Also, a
conflict over the powers between the Minister of Oil in the government
of Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, Muhammad Aoun, and the head of the National Oil
Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, deepened the Corporation's impartiality,
which was usually affiliated with the western Libya camp.

[Oil is now more critical for the western part of the country. Crude oil
is a critical tool in new Western policies designed to besiege Moscow
and undermine it economically and militarily by reducing Western
countries' dependence on Russian oil and gas. The idea is to deprive
Russia of a significant financing source. Therefore, the United States,
the architect of sanctions against Russia, is actively seeking to ensure
a stable oil supply from Libya.]{.underline}

Indeed, the West has taken the following steps in this regard:

[The embassies of the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy
in Libya issued a joint statement urging all actors in Libya to respect
the unity and independence of the National Oil Corporation]{.underline}.
They were urged not to politicize it or engage in any actions that would
undermine the stability of this institution. Remarkably, this statement
was issued on February 24, the same day the Russian invasion of Ukraine
began. \[1\]

UN Adviser Stephanie Williams tweeted, stressing the need to preserve
the independence and impartiality of the National Oil Corporation, the
Central Bank, and the Libyan Investment Authority and not subject them
to arbitrary pressures to employ them for the benefit of one party over
another. The US and British embassies retweeted that tweet, emphasizing
the same position. \[2\] This became clear about a month after the
Western embassies' statement referred to this position. It also
coincides with growing uncertainty in the oil market against the
backdrop of the Western-Russian conflict.

[On March 17, the United States ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland,
announced a proposal to introduce a short-term mechanism for managing
Libyan oil revenues that build on the previous arrangement, i.e.,
depositing oil revenues in the Libyan Foreign Bank.]{.underline} The new
mechanism assumes that the various parties publish transparent data on
expenditures and revenues, and the oil revenue distribution is limited
to salaries, subsidies, fuel production, and major imported goods such
as food and medicine. \[3\]

In early March, the National Oil Corporation announced that it had
agreed with British Petroleum to carry out exploration activities in the
Ghadames and Sirte basins. The agreement came about 10 days after the
British oil giant announced that it had quit its partnership with the
Russian oil company Rosneft following the Ukraine war. \[4\] Kate
English, Deputy British Ambassador to Libya, met Mustafa Sanalla, head
of the National Oil Corporation, on March 21 and discussed expanding
cooperation between British energy companies and the Libyan Corporation.
\[5\]

[UN Mission]{.underline}

The appointment of a UN envoy to Libya is likely to turn into a
contentious issue between Russia and Western countries. The UN Security
Council's mandate is scheduled to expire at the end of April, and the
Council will have to consider renewing it. There have been some key
developments related to this issue, including the following:

[The UN mission's mandate was renewed on the last day of January 2022
for only three months without appointing a UN envoy]{.underline}. This
British proposal offered a compromise between two American and Russian
draft resolutions. The US decision called for renewing the mission's
mandate until mid-September without appointing a UN envoy. However, the
resolution stipulated that Stephanie Williams, an American, would assume
the actual tasks of the UN envoy as an adviser to the Secretary-General
on Libyan affairs, a position she assumed on December 6, 2021. The goal
is that Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will not have to seek the
Security Council's approval for the appointment. However, the Russian
draft resolution called for the mission's renewal until the end of April
only, with the appointment of a UN envoy by the Security Council without
delay.

With the date of the decision on renewing the mission's mandate
approaching, i.e., the end of April, and against the backdrop of a
raging US-Russian conflict, it is expected that the dispute over the
mission's future will return to the fore again, especially concerning
the issue of appointing a UN envoy.

In a direction opposite to the expected West-Russia escalation over the
mission's future, and specifically on the UN envoy job, some African
countries with considerable clout in the African Union cling to the
demand of appointing an African diplomat to the position of UN envoy
following the resignation of former envoy Ghassan Salame in March 2020.
[Re-introducing this demand in the coming period may be the best way to
shield the mission's mandate against the repercussions of international
escalation. Even the parties to the conflict seem willing to maintain
the ceasefire and reduce escalation to preserve the gains
achieved.]{.underline}

[Military Deployment]{.underline}

[There are many indications about how the Russia-Ukraine war will affect
Russia and its allies' military deployment in Libya. A large-scale
military escalation is unlikely in Libya during the next stage for
several reasons:]{.underline}

[Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to bring in fighters from
the Middle East to participate in military operations in Ukraine. On
March 11, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that 16,000
fighters from the Middle East were ready to volunteer for the
war.]{.underline} \[6\]

On March 20, [the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced that Field
Marshal Khalifa Haftar had sent fighters to fight alongside the Russian
forces, among the forces announced by the Russian Defense Minister.
Wagner would supervise the transfer of fighters.]{.underline} \[7\]
However, the General Command in Libya officially denied these
statements. \[8\]

The British Ministry of Defense announced that [the fighters of the
Russian company Wagner were deployed in eastern Ukraine, which came at
the expense of the company's operations in Africa and
Syria]{.underline}. \[9\]

The "Syrians for Truth and Justice" organization has published a report
confirming that Russia has transferred Syrian fighters fighting in Libya
alongside Haftar forces to fight in Ukraine. The report was based on
testimonies from Syrian fighters and records of flights from Benghazi
and Damascus to Russia. \[10\]

British Ambassador to Libya Caroline Harrondale met Field Marshal
Khalifa Haftar at the General Command headquarters in Benghazi on March
27. The ambassador said that the meeting focused on the Russian invasion
of Ukraine, the importance of withdrawing all mercenaries from Libya,
and the need to avoid war returning to the country. \[11\]

[These indicators suggest a plan to reduce the support provided by
Russia to Haftar's forces at the level of human resources and prioritize
the war in Ukraine, which naturally means that there will be no
large-scale military escalation in Libya. However, in light of the
escalation of the conflict between Russia and the West led by the United
States and the increase in pressures on Russia, the Russian-Western
conflict will possibly not remain confined to Ukraine but rather erupt
in other flashpoints including Libya.]{.underline}

Therefore, foreign fighters wholly loyal to Russia are expected to
remain in Libya, given that Russia controls the oil negotiating card in
Libya.

Impact on the Political Track

The Russo-Ukrainian War had impacts on Libya's political process as
follows:

1\. Fathi Bashagha as the New Prime Minister: The project to install
Fathi Bashagha as the new prime minister is no longer enjoying
significant momentum, despite the man's alliance with the Russian-backed
parties in eastern Libya. Moscow was among the few capitals that openly
called for Bashagha to be able to exercise his new position in the
capital, Tripoli. On March 13, a group of residents of the cities of the
so-called Libya Oil Crescent threatened to shut down oil facilities in
the region and stop the export of oil if the UN mission continued to
support the Dbeibeh government, demanding that Fathi Bashagha be able to
take power in the capital. \[12\] This threat was already put into
practice in mid-April. The use of the oil card in support of Bashagha
sends negative messages to Western countries regarding attempts by the
eastern Libyan camp to justify Western concerns about oil management in
Libya and Russia's support for Bashagha taking power.

Contrary to expectations, on March 2, Bashagha publicly condemned the
Russian invasion of Ukraine and met the Ukrainian ambassador to Libya on
March 26, stressing his position in support of Ukraine. \[13\] On the
other hand, Bashagha is aware of the sensitivity of using the oil card
for political influence at this stage and that the United States would
reject this. Bashagha openly announced his refusal to use the oil card
to enable him to take power in Tripoli \[14\], which reflects his
commitment to keeping a distance from Moscow to avoid the political
price he might pay in his relationship with Western powers. He is also
keen to settle for a local alliance with the eastern Libyan camp. At the
same time, the control of its headquarters in the eastern and southern
regions has mounted pressure on the Dbeibeh government.

If the situation escalates around the Oil Crescent region within a
US-Russia conflict, and if Moscow decides to make Libya an arena for
settling accounts with the West, this would become the main challenge
for Bashagha. Part of the forces loyal to him is located in the
country's center, in an area separating the forces loyal to Haftar and
those affiliated with the Dbeibeh government in the western region.
Thus, in this case, Bashagha may find himself compelled to break up the
political partnership with the eastern Libyan camp, especially if the
conflict escalates in a way that undermines his chances of becoming
prime minister.

The only case that would make Bashagha accept a military escalation is
for his forces to storm Tripoli by force. On the other hand, he is
unlikely to accept that his forces will be involved in any confrontation
between Haftar's forces and the camp in western Libya, against the
backdrop of the US-Russia conflict.

[2. The Drawing Up of a New Constitutional Rule: Due to the new military
balance, primarily temporary, owing to the decrease in the number of
foreign fighters supporting Haftar, Moscow's Ukraine preoccupation, and
the decline in the chances of Bashagha being appointed prime minister,
the UN adviser could work on a draft constitutional rule. It was
achieved through a consensus between the House of Representatives and
the State Council, based on which the elections might be held next
June.]{.underline}

UN Adviser Stephanie Williams seeks to achieve a fundamental
breakthrough to break the political deadlock, thus preventing the
eastern Libyan camp from installing Bashagha for a new transitional
period. The objective is to prevent Dbeibeh from achieving his goal of
staying in power for a more extended period, as was the case with the
Fayez al-Sarraj government. Williams is under the pressure of the time
factor, whether the vote on the mission's mandate takes place at the end
of April or the end of the roadmap term comes at the end of June.

The House of Representatives is aware of the current international
balances following Western sanctions against Russia and the latter's
failure to provide sufficient support to the eastern Libyan camp. This
explains the Parliament's attempt to play on the time factor and not
respond to Stephanie's efforts to thwart and wait for a new
international order. Until then, the Parliament will continue to adhere
to the roadmap it adopted, which calls for the appointment of Bashagha
as prime minister.

On the other hand, Dbeibeh seeks to sabotage Stephanie's plans. He
declared that he was committed to his plan "to return the trust to the
people," based on which he formed a committee to draft an election law
to hold the vote during June. However, the chances of this plan becoming
a reality are almost non-existent. Dbeibeh wants to stay in power for a
more extended period, especially when Libya is no longer an urgent
priority on the international community's agenda.

Conclusions

[Although the crisis between Russia and the West is poised for further
escalation, it is unlikely to see the conflict spill over to Libya due
to differences over oil management and military deployment. Still, the
two sides might clash over the appointment of a new UN envoy. The Libyan
parties are seeking pragmatically to exploit the current international
situation to avoid any political losses regarding the conflict over the
transitional authority or the future of the settlement process. In this
context, the main actors are working, in various ways, to thwart the
efforts of the UN adviser to hold elections before the middle of this
year and to buy more time in anticipation of any new
developments.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Internal Link Turn

#### Russia only intervenes in North Africa to further its interests. Russia supports autocratic, corrupt leaders which is destabilizing and detrimental to African People 

**Siegle, PhD, 2/22**

(Joseph, leads the Africa Center's research program, which produces
security briefs and research papers with the aim of generating policy
relevant analyses that contribute to addressing Africa's security
challenges. He has written widely for leading policy journals and
newspapers and is a regular media analyst, The future of Russia-Africa
relations,
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2022/02/02/the-future-of-russia-africa-relations/)

[Russia has been **aggressively pursuing** its strategic objectives in
Africa in recent years---securing a **foothold** in the eastern
Mediterranean, gaining **naval port access** in the Red Sea, expanding
**natural resource extraction** opportunities, **displacing Western
influence**, and promoting **alternatives to democracy** as a regional
norm. Africa, thus, is a "theater" for Russia's geostrategic interests
rather than a destination itself---a perspective reflected in the means
that Russia employs. Unlike most major external partners, Russia is not
investing significantly in conventional statecraft in Africa---e.g.,
economic investment, trade, and security assistance. Rather, Russia
relies on a series of asymmetric (and often extralegal) measures for
influence---mercenaries, arms-for-resource deals, opaque contracts,
election interference, and disinformation]{.underline}. PARTNERSHIP WITH
WHOM? [Russia's Africa-focused initiatives are typically concentrated on
propping up an embattled incumbent or close ally: Khalifa Haftar in
Libya]{.underline}, Faustin Archange Touad칠ra in the Central African
Republic (CAR), [and coup leaders Colonel Assimi Go칦ta in Mali and
Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in Sudan, among
others]{.underline}. To assess the future of [Russia-Africa relations,
therefore, it is necessary to be clear that the "partnerships" that
Russia seeks in Africa are not state- but elite-based. By helping these
often illegitimate and unpopular leaders to retain power, Russia is
cementing Africa's indebtedness to Moscow]{.underline}. This strategy
works for Russia and the respective leaders who gain international
diplomatic cover, resources to consolidate power domestically, a
mercenary force, arms, and revenues from resource deals. However,
[Russia's opaque engagements are inherently destabilizing for the
citizens of the targeted countries, resulting in stunted economic
development, human rights abuses, disenfranchisement of African
citizens, the perpetuation of illegitimate governments, and social
polarization]{.underline}. Through this model, Russia has been able to
advance its objectives with limited financial and political costs.
Accordingly, we can expect to see Moscow continuing to expand its
influence on the continent in 2022. FOCAL POINTS FOR AFRICA-RUSSIA
RELATIONS IN 2022 [Libya. Russia retains Wagner mercenary forces (former
Russian defense intelligence troops) and military assets on the ground
in support of its proxy, warlord Khalifa Haftar. Russia can be expected
to try and steer the outcome of the postponed presidential and
legislative elections with the aim of emerging as the principal
powerbroker]{.underline} in this [geo-strategically important
territory---with access to oil reserves]{.underline} and deep-water
ports in the eastern Mediterranean and a permanent presence on NATO's
southern flank. [Sudan. Russia has been striving to gain naval port
access in the Red Sea, especially Port Sudan. It also has longstanding
ties to the Sudanese military, elements of the ousted Bashir regime, and
gold trafficking networks in the west]{.underline}. Continuation of the
military government in Khartoum provides a ready entry point for
expanded Russian influence. [Mali. The military coup in Mali has
provided Russia an opportunity to become a pivotal actor in the Sahel.
We can expect Moscow to provide political cover to the junta of Assimi
Go칦ta as it seeks to avoid a transition back to a democratic
government]{.underline}. Indications are that Wagner mercenaries have
already been deployed in support of the junta. Guinea. Russia has long
been a patron of former president Alpha Cond칠, who had been a strong
supporter of Russia's extensive mining (bauxite) interests in Guinea.
Following Cond칠's ouster in a coup in September 2021, Moscow can be
expected to refocus its diplomatic efforts on propping up the military
junta of Colonel Mamady Doumbouya in return for Moscow's continued
political sway and unencumbered access in the mining sector. Gulf of
Guinea. Having consolidated its position in the CAR in 2021, Russia is
set to expand its influence in nearby Republic of the Congo, the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon in 2022. Moscow has been
cultivating ties with leaders of all three countries with an eye on
becoming a more significant player in the lucrative oil and mineral
networks of Central Africa. Angola. President Jo칚o Louren칞o is
contending for a second term in office in 2022 amid a long recession,
criticisms for increasing authoritarianism, and divisions within his
ruling party. Russia's opportunistic strategy of coming to the aid of
isolated leaders as a means of enhancing Moscow's leverage makes
Louren칞o an attractive target. His military academy training in the
USSR, Russia's extensive Cold War era ties to Angola, and Angola's vast
diamond, oil, gold, and mineral resources will all factor into increased
Russian attention on Louren칞o in 2022. CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT AND
SCRUTINY Since [Russia's engagements in Africa are typically predicated
on co-opting leaders facing limited checks and balances, they are nearly
**always detrimental to African citizens** who must endure **deepened
institutionalized corruption, diverted public revenues, unaccountable
leaders, and instability**]{.underline}. Reform, therefore, will not
come from these leaders but from African citizens, which will entail
greater civil society engagement, enhanced transparency around
contracts, and higher levels of scrutiny of any deals struck with
Russia. Building more mutually beneficial Africa-Russia relations
depends on changes in both substance and process. Such a shift would
require Russia to establish more conventional bilateral engagements with
African institutions and not just individuals. These initiatives would
focus on strengthening trade, investment, technology transfer, and
educational exchanges. If transparently negotiated and equitably
implemented, such Russian initiatives would be welcomed by many
Africans.

#### Russia seeks to further its strategic interests in Africa, propping up authoritarian leaders, undermining democracy, and destroying African sovereignty.

its Africa engagements. [Regrettably for African citizens, these
**tactics are all inherently destabilising**. Moreover, the result is
disenfranchisement and **diminished African sovereignty**. Russia's
expanding influence portends a **bleak vision for Africa**.]{.underline}
In effect, [Russia is attempting to export its governance model -- of
an**authoritarian, kleptocratic, and transactional regime**-- onto
Africa.]{.underline} This is especially problematic since there are at
least a handful of African leaders who are more than happy to go down
this path. Never mind that this [**diverges wildly from the맋emocratic
aspirations held by** the vast majority of **African**
citizen**s**.]{.underline} The United Nations' vote on Russia's invasion
in Ukraine provides a useful prism to understand relationships between
Moscow and particular African countries. It reveals a spectrum of
governance norms and visions for Africa. It is through these lenses and
interests that groups of African countries can be expected to engage
with Russia moving forward -- with far-reaching consequences for
democracy, security and sovereignty on the continent. Puppets, patrons
and pushback The [UN General Assembly resolution condemning the Russian
aggression]{.underline} garnered only one dissenting African vote --
Eritrea. This was accompanied by strong denunciations of the Russian
attack on Ukraine by the African Union (AU) and the Economic Community
of West African States. The current chair of the AU, Senegal's President
Macky Sall, and AU Commission chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat also
criticised Russia's unprovoked war. In total, 28 of Africa's 54
countries voted to condemn the Russian invasion, 16 abstained and 9 did
not vote. All in all, the vote was a remarkable rebuke of Moscow from a
continent where many African leaders' worldviews are shaped by a posture
of non-alignment, raw legacies from the Cold War, African diplomatic
politesse, and a desire to remain neutral in Great Power rivalries. The
vote also revealed a[widening segmentation of governance norms in
Africa](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/uploads/documents/Africa-Year-in-Review-2021.pdf#page=16).
And it shows that African relations with Russia from here on in will not
be uniform -- nor abruptly reversed. The [African countries]{.underline}
that [abstained]{.underline}, or did not vote, did so for a variety of
reasons. The most obvious category of country [unwilling to condemn
Russia]{.underline} was those with African leaders who have been
co-opted by Moscow. These included Faustin-Archange Touad칠ra in the
Central African Republic, Lt. General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in
[Sudan]{.underline}, and Colonel Assimi Go칦ta in [Mali]{.underline}.
These leaders lack legitimacy domestically. They depend on Moscow's
political and mercenary support to hold onto power. A second category
among the countries that abstained or did not vote is those with leaders
who have patronage ties with Russia. Those in power in
[Algeria]{.underline}, Angola, Burundi, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea,
Madagascar, Mozambique, South Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe benefit from
Russian arms, disinformation or political cover. These leaders,
moreover, have no interest in democratic processes that may threaten
their hold on power. Others who abstained or did not vote likely did so
for ideological reasons rooted in their traditions of non-alignment.
These included [Morocco]{.underline}, Namibia, Senegal and South Africa.
While they may maintain ties to Moscow, they are appalled by Russia's
imperialistic actions. By and large, they support the upholding of
international law to maintain peace and security. Those who voted to
condemn the invasion included leading African democracies and
democratisers. These comprised Botswana, Cabo Verde, Ghana, Malawi,
Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Kenya, Seychelles, Sierra Leone and Zambia.
They represent a mix of motivations. But I calculated that the median
Global Freedom score for this group of 28 countries based on Freedom
House's annual (0-100) ratings is 20 points higher than those that did
not vote to condemn. The[powerful speech by Kenya's ambassador to the

Human Rights Watch said today. National authorities, the country's
Special Criminal Court (SCC), or the International Criminal Court (ICC),
should investigate these incidents as well as other credible allegations
of abuse by Russia-linked forces with a view to criminal prosecution.
Several Western governments, and United Nations experts and special

operating in the Central African Republic include a significant number
of members of the Wagner Group, a Russian private military security
contractor망ith apparent links to the Russian government. On April 15,
the United Nations announced it would investigate the circumstances in
which at least 10 people were killed in the northeast, with some initial
reports alleging Russian forces may have been involved. ["There is
**compelling evidence** that Russian-identified forces supporting the

against civilians** with **complete impunity**,"]{.underline} said Ida
Sawyer, crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. "The failure
of the Central African Republic government and its partners to
forcefully denounce these abuses, and to identify and prosecute those
responsible, will most likely only [fuel further crimes in Africa and

including 10 victims and 15 witnesses, about [abuses they said were
committed by men with white skin speaking Russian, a language the

carrying military-grade weapons and wearing beige khaki clothes, scarves
to cover their faces, military boots, gloves, and sunglasses. In August
2018 the Central African Republic and Russian authorities signed

unlawfully detained them for several days or weeks between June and
August 2021 in inhuman conditions in an open hole at a national army

[Mr. Hifter did not want to talk peace.]{.underline}

A former Libyan Army general and onetime C.I.A. client, [Mr. Hifter
wanted a White House blessing for a surprise attack to seize Tripoli,
the capital, before the peace talks commenced]{.underline}.

Mr. Bolton did not say no.

The attack, launched last April 4, backfired badly. Mr. Hifter [failed
to capture Tripoli, overextended his forces and restarted a civil war
--- killing thousands and displacing hundreds of thousands
more]{.underline}. The fighting has cut off the flow of Libyan oil,
[injected new volatility into the region and severely diminished
Washington's influence]{.underline}.

[But one apparent winner has emerged: the Kremlin. Russia has operated
with cold-eyed cynicism, taking advantage of three years of muddled
messages from the Trump administration to become a critical kingmaker in
Libya]{.underline}, a geopolitical prize with vast energy reserves and a
strategic location on the Mediterranean.

Mr. Bolton's call with Mr. Hifter --- described by a former senior
administration official as well as three Western diplomats briefed by
both Mr. Hifter and American officials --- appears to have played into
the Russian machinations.

Days before the call, private Russian operatives in Libya reported to
Moscow that Mr. Hifter was a flawed and outmatched military leader sure
to fail if he ever tried to conquer the capital, according to secret
Russian documents seized in Tripoli and viewed by The New York Times.
[The operatives saw opportunity in his weakness and suggested that
Russia could win leverage over Mr. Hifter if it sent mercenaries to
bolster his so-called Libyan National Army.]{.underline}

["Russia will maintain a loyal and strong ally in the structure of the
LNA," the operatives argued, "which Hifter will have to contend
with."]{.underline}

Washington's inconsistent position on Libya --- officially supporting
the peace process even as the White House has signaled that President
Trump favors Mr. Hifter --- has played a major role in prolonging the
chaos. The absence of a strong American policy has opened the door to
interference from competing American partners, including Turkey, Egypt
and the United Arab Emirates.

Yet it is [Russia that is now best positioned to dominate
Libya.]{.underline}

An arm of the [Kremlin controls dozens of social media accounts
promoting Mr. Hifter and other favored clients]{.underline}, including
the eldest son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Libya's former dictator,
according to the operatives' report. The same Kremlin operation has
acquired an ownership stake in a pro-Qaddafi Libyan satellite network
and advised a pro-Hifter network as well, the operatives wrote.

At the same time, the Russian military has worked behind the scenes to
surround Mr. Hifter with many of its old partners from the Qaddafi-era
security forces, encouraging Qaddafi henchmen to return from exile. The
Kremlin also has built ties to a potential governing party-in-waiting,
the documents show.

And the Kremlin followed the operatives' prescient advice. [When Mr.
Hifter's assault stalled, Moscow propped up his sagging advance with
thousands of trained mercenaries who continue to operate in
Libya.]{.underline}

Representatives for the White House and Mr. Bolton declined to comment.

But alarmed American lawmakers have begun asking how the White House
appears to have ended up backing the same side as Moscow.

During a recent Senate hearing on Libya, lawmakers wondered how the
United States could fault Russia for propping up a client when the White
House appeared to like him as well. The president sounded "inclined to
support Hifter" even as the State Department seemed to oppose him, said
Senator Mitt Romney, the Utah Republican.

"Is there consistency?" Mr. Romney asked.

"I can say unequivocally," David Schenker, the assistant secretary of
state for Near Eastern affairs, insisted with exasperation, "We do not
support the Hifter offensive."

Courting the President

A campaign to get the White House behind Mr. Hifter started almost as
soon as Mr. Trump was elected.

Mr. Hifter's most important patron, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed of
the United Arab Emirates, pitched Mr. Hifter to members of Mr. Trump's
foreign policy team at a secret meeting in New York in December 2016,
according to a person with knowledge of the meeting.

President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, whom Mr. Trump has jokingly
called "my favorite dictator," also took up the Hifter cause five months
later when he visited the White House.

"Hifter was a core talking point in every meeting with the Egyptians and
Emiratis," said Andrew Miller, a former member of the National Security
Council staff and now a researcher at the Project on Middle East
Democracy, a Washington-based nonprofit.

Libya had foundered in chaos since a NATO air campaign helped oust
Colonel Qaddafi during the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Extortionist
militias, militant extremists and migrant traffickers ran amok as the
country was divided into fiefs. Officially, the United States recognized
only the United Nations-sponsored provisional government in Tripoli.

But Crown Prince Mohammed and Mr. el-Sisi told Mr. Trump that the
provisional government was hopelessly weak and riddled with Islamists.
They argued that only Mr. Hifter could prevent Islamists from taking
power in Tripoli, which the Arab leaders said would create a domino
effect across the region, according to two former senior administration
officials.

Mr. Hifter had vowed since 2014 to eradicate political Islam and take
power as Libya's new military ruler. Yet he had quietly formed an
alliance with a rival faction of extremists, Saudi-style
ultraconservatives known as Salafis.

As they lobbied Mr. Trump, Crown Prince Mohammed and Mr. el-Sisi
overlooked that contradiction. They were also simultaneously working
closely with Russia. Egypt had opened a secret Russian base to supply
Mr. Hifter's forces, to the alarm of Western officials worried about
Moscow's expanding influence.

The two Arab leaders, though, found a sympathetic ear in Mr. Bolton, who
became national security adviser in the spring of 2018 and had
previously led a far-right think tank known for sweeping attacks on
political Islam.

The Bolton-Hifter phone call last spring came at a critical moment. Even
as the peace talks were approaching, Mr. Hifter had moved his forces
into a strategic oasis town south of Tripoli and was poised for a
surprise attack.

When Mr. Hifter asked for consent, Mr. Bolton's answer was "a yellow
light," not a green or a red one, the former senior administration
official said. Yet three Western diplomats briefed on the call by both
Mr. Hifter and senior American officials described Mr. Bolton as less
equivocal: If you are going to attack, do it quickly, he told Mr.
Hifter, according to all three diplomats.

Mr. Hifter counted that as an explicit assent, all three diplomats said.

The April 4 attack stunned the world. The United Nations secretary
general, Ant칩nio Guterres, had just landed in Tripoli for the peace
talks. He urged Mr. Hifter to pull back, a message endorsed by Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo. American military forces hurriedly left the city.

But as the fighting was underway, Mr. Hifter's powerful allies were
lobbying Mr. Trump to show his support, White House officials said. Mr.
el-Sisi pressed the president in person last year on April 9, and Crown
Prince Mohammed over the phone on April 18.

The next day, the White House said in a statement that the president had
called Mr. Hifter to commend his "significant role in fighting
terrorism." A day after the call, Mr. Hifter's forces began shelling
civilian neighborhoods of Tripoli.

"It seemed as if the Americans were switching sides in a way that didn't
make sense," said Peter Millett, the British ambassador to Libya until
2018, noting that the Tripoli government had been the main Libyan
partner to the United States military in counterterrorism.

"There was confusion and massive surprise in the international
community," he said.

Col. Ahmed Mismari, a spokesman for Mr. Hifter, declined to comment on
the call with Mr. Bolton but said the Libyan commander appreciated the
president's support.

[Russian Hedging]{.underline}

Even before the assault on Tripoli began, the Russians had concluded it
would be a disaster for Mr. Hifter.

The Russian operatives in Libya worked for an obscure research center
linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of the Russian president,
Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Prigozhin is also described by American officials
as the leader of a Kremlin-linked private security company, the Wagner
Group. Their teams of mercenaries have overseen Russian efforts to
meddle in the politics of Ukraine, Syria and several African countries.

The leader of the Libyan team, Maxim Shugaley, had been identified in
news reports in 2018 trying to pay bribes and spread disinformation to
turn elections in Madagascar. Tipped off by American intelligence,
according to a person involved, a militia allied with the Tripoli
provisional government eventually detained Mr. Shugaley and his
interpreter. A third operative eluded capture, Libyan officials said.

After detaining Mr. Shugaley, the security agents found a report in his
hotel room that his team had sent to Moscow in March of last year,
shortly before the Hifter-Bolton call. Dossier, a London research center
critical of Mr. Putin, obtained a copy of the seized report and provided
portions to The New York Times. Senior Libyan officials authenticated
the text independently.

For several years, [Russia had provided military supplies to Mr. Hifter
and printed millions of dollars in newly minted Libyan currency for him
to distribute.]{.underline}

But the secret report showed that the operatives were much more
skeptical of Mr. Hifter than were the Arab rulers advising the White
House.

Mr. Hifter, now 76, had recurring health problems. He won few military
victories and had instead gained territory by "buying off local tribal
groups for the right to place the flag," so that he could "raise his
significance in the eyes of internal and external players," the report
stated.

Not only did the operatives conclude that any advance on Tripoli was
almost certain to fail, as did an offensive in 2014, they also warned
that Mr. Hifter was stubborn and had become increasingly "difficult" to
his Russian advisers.

["Hifter is using Russian help to increase his
significance,"]{.underline} the operatives wrote, but "there is a
serious basis to suggest that in the event of his military victory,
Hifter will not be loyal to Russian interests."

[The operatives recommended the Kremlin hedge its bets on Mr. Hifter by
allying with Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, the eldest son of the former
dictator]{.underline}. The operatives said their "company" had acquired
a stake in a pro-Qaddafi satellite network and revitalized its
broadcasts.

A longtime partner to Russia under his father, Mr. Qaddafi, now 47, was
imprisoned in Libya in 2011 before somehow regaining his freedom. Now he
is at large and plotting a comeback, according to Libyans close to him
and Western diplomats familiar with intelligence reports on his
movements.

But the Russians also identified a new opening with Mr. Hifter: The
Kremlin should insert paid mercenaries loyal to Russia into his
faltering military. Sudanese paramilitary forces were ready to do the
job, the operatives insisted, and could give Moscow crucial leverage.

Game Changer

[The contingents of mercenaries from the Wagner Group began arriving via
Sudan last September, according to Western diplomats tracking their
movements.]{.underline}

"That was the big game changer," Ambassador Richard Norland, the
American envoy to Libya, said at a recent briefing. "It's clear the
Russians see strategic advantage now in Libya --- low risk and high
gain."

[To deepen its influence, the Kremlin has also organized secret meetings
in Moscow between Mr. Hifter's supporters and former officers in the
Qaddafi-era military and security services]{.underline}, according to
Western diplomats and other analysts who have spoken to Libyan
participants.

Musa Ibrahim, a former Qaddafi spokesman, declined to comment on
specific meetings in Moscow but acknowledged that Russia had been
"bringing together" the Hifter and Qaddafi officers, especially since
the assault on Tripoli.

This month, on the anniversary of Mr. Hifter's attack, the United
Nations urged a halt to the fighting to respond to the coronavirus
pandemic now spreading in Libya.

But Mr. Hifter has continued shelling Tripoli, even targeting a major
hospital. And the [Russian mercenaries have given Russia a de facto veto
over any end to the conflict]{.underline}.

["This has been Russia's dream since World War II,"]{.underline} said
Fathi Bashagha, the interior minister of the Tripoli government, quoting
Winston Churchill's wartime statement that Moscow saw Libya as the "soft
underbelly" of Europe.

["To get Russian feet on Libyan soil."]{.underline}

[Bachagha's Appointment Has the Potential for Stability]{.underline}

Days before the scheduled -- and already compromised elections -- on
December 24, Bachagha went to Benghazi where he met Haftar, head of the
self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) on December 21, 2021. This
meeting 춼-- at Haftar's invitation no less -- was remarkable. Its
remarkability can only be explained by noting that in April 2019, Haftar
launched the "Flood of Dignity" campaign to liberate Tripoli from the
militias and Brotherhood-dominated Government of National Accord (GNA)
--- the original internationally supported transitional Libyan
government --- arresting all members of the Muslim Brotherhood and
dissolving the political movement.

That same December, Turkey's ambassador to Tripoli met Aqila Saleh of
the House of Representatives, the Haftar-affiliated Libyan parliament in
Tobruk. Around the same time, a delegation of GNA members from Tripoli
flew to Turkey and met President Erdogan himself. This series of
unlikely meetings suggests that Turkey and Haftar have reached a
tactical agreement to soften their differences in order to stabilize
Libya.

[Evidently, Turkey has decided to change its game: it is no longer
interested in staying in -- and outright controlling -- Libya. Erdogan
calculated that Turkey's continued presence in Libya created a problem
for fellow NATO allies (Italy, France, and the US) which are eager to
increase stability in North Africa, halt the flow of migrants, and
secure important energy sources.]{.underline}

This situation parallels that of Tunisia, where Erdogan maintained ties
to Rachid Ghannouchi and the Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated Ennahda, and
where the political cards have also been shuffled with the dismissal of
parliament by President Kais Saied. [Therefore, a shift in relations
between Ankara and the Muslim Brotherhood has occurred in the
Mediterranean. And without Turkey's backing, the movement and its
political representatives have been weakened.]{.underline}

Was it a Coup?

Technically, Bachagha's appointment does not represent a coup. Indeed,
as in all democracies, the executive governs with the trust of the
parliament. [And the "institution" in Tobruk that appointed Bachagha is
Libya's official parliament, elected by the people in 2014]{.underline}.
That said, the militias in 2014 were affiliated with Bachagha, implying
that any objectives the new prime minister sets toward stability should
be easier to achieve.

Meanwhile, following the indefinite postponement of the elections,
Turkey and Russia -- until then rivals over Libyan matters --- moved
closer, building a common front and incubating the alliance of former
enemies Haftar and Bachagha. This is especially impressive given that
Bachagha fought against Haftar two years ago. [Despite this ideal
situation -- for what could be more conducive to peace than a mutually
beneficial alliance between two former]{.underline} enemies -- there is
an unlikely obstacle: the United Nations. Indeed, the UN has made it
known that it does not recognize Bachagha and will continue to recognize
Dbeibah.

In the current circumstances, which could lead Libya out of its
darkness, the UN's position represents a real and counterproductive
interference in Libya's internal affairs. Until recently, the government
in Tripoli had the support of the UN, but not of the parliament. Today,
the situation is that of one UN-backed prime minister and another prime
minister who enjoys the support of the Libyan parliament. If the Misrata
militia close to Bachagha has allied itself with Haftar's LNA -- the two
single most powerful armed organizations in the country -- the intensity
and amount of fighting may also decrease drastically.

As for elections? They may or may not happen this year -- or even the
next. But there's no denying the fact that [perhaps for the first time
since 2011, Libyans have more or less come together]{.underline}.
Bachagha is in an unprecedented position to build a unified Libya, and
the current scenario is one of renewed diplomacy. If the UN and the West
care about elections and democracy, they should welcome these new
arrangements as they will lead to more stability and only then,
encourage a vote.

[Bachagha has the potential to unite the country]{.underline}, even if
some suspect him to be Haftar's Trojan horse. The UN could be more
productive and save face by encouraging a scenario that supports the
Libyan parliament's decision to back Bachagha while keeping Haftar at
bay.

#### Russia and Turkey are pulling out.

**Klapper '21** \[Rebecca Klapper; ; 6-23-2021; Russia, Turkey reach
agreement to remove troops from Libya, U.S. official says; Newsweek;

[A senior U.S. official said Russia and Turkey have tentatively reached
an agreement to begin the process of withdrawing foreign troops from
Libya in agreement with Germany\'s Foreign Minister pledging to remove
foreign forces from Libya.]{.underline}

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told the
Associated Press that the deal is not yet done, but each country is
prepared to discuss an incremental withdrawal of about 300 troops by
both sides.

\"[We will not let up, and we will not rest, until the last foreign
forces have left Libya \... wherever they come from,\"]{.underline}
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said.

Maas said that Russia and Turkey have been heavily involved on opposite
sides, but acknowledged that a [withdrawal would have to be taken \"step
by step\" while also maintaining balance so one side doesn\'t gain an
advantage over the other]{.underline}.

Libya\'s transitional government underlined its commitment to holding
elections on Dec. 24 at a conference Wednesday with powers that have
interests in the North African country, while the German hosts vowed to
keep up pressure until all foreign forces have been withdrawn from
Libya.

[Germany and the United Nations brought together 17 countries at the
conference in Berlin. Libya\'s transitional leadership was joined by
foreign ministers from Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, Algeria, France and
Italy, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and senior officials from
Russia, the United Arab Emirates and others.]{.underline}

The meeting followed up on a January 2020 conference where leaders
agreed to respect an arms embargo and to push the country\'s warring
parties to reach a full cease-fire. Germany has tried to act as an
intermediary.

Maas said the [meeting \"marked a new phase\" and that \"we are no
longer only talking about Libya, but above all with
Libya.\"]{.underline}

Participants welcomed progress since the process was launched. An
October cease-fire agreement including a demand that all foreign
fighters and mercenaries leave Libya within 90 days led to a deal on the
elections in December and the transitional government that took office
in February.

Libyan Foreign Minister Najla Mangoush said the [transitional government
came \"with a vision of how best to re-establish stability in our
country]{.underline} and pave the way for free, inclusive and safe
elections on Dec. 24.\"

Wednesday\'s conference saw [powers involved in Libya recommit to
refraining from interfering in the country\'s internal affairs and
stating that foreign forces and mercenaries need to be withdrawn
\"without delay\"]{.underline} --- something on which there has been
little progress.

Asked what guarantees the countries involved are giving to withdraw
foreign fighters, Maas pointed to the fact that they had gathered for
the conference.

Mangoush said there was [\"progress\" regarding mercenaries, \"so
hopefully within the coming days mercenaries from both sides are going
to be withdrawn,\" creating more trust and leading to further
steps]{.underline}.

A further challenge will be to start bringing all armed groups in Libya
under a joint military command.

Speaking earlier Wednesday ahead of the conference, Blinken said that
[\"we share the goal of a sovereign, stable, unified, secure Libya free
from foreign interference --- it\'s what the people of Libya deserve,
it\'s critical to regional security as well.\"]{.underline}

\"For that to happen, national elections need to go forward in December
and that means urgent agreement is needed on constitutional and legal
issues that would undergird those elections,\" he said. \"And the Oct.
23 cease-fire agreement has to be fully implemented, including by
withdrawing all foreign forces from Libya.\"

[Conference participants supported efforts toward a reconciliation
process and committed to helping Libyan authorities \"in developing a
comprehensive approach to addressing migration,\" including the closure
of detention centers.]{.underline}

with the Wagner Group, a paramilitary organization with ties to the
Kremlin, have been in Libya for some time, working on behalf of Moscow
and helping Haftar in his bid to capture Tripoli, however Schenker said
that Russia is now deploying regular uniformed personnel there as well.
["Russian regulars are being deployed in significant numbers to support

destabilizing." The presence of the Russian troops "raises the specter
of **large-scale casualties among the civilian
population**,"]{.underline} Schenker said. His comments come days after

**achieve** a suspension of hostilities and a political resolution to
the Libyan conflict," according to a State Department statement issued
Monday.

[Russia has been aggressively pursuing its strategic objectives in
Africa in recent years]{.underline}---securing a foothold in the eastern
Mediterranean, gaining naval port access in the Red Sea, expanding
natural resource extraction opportunities[, displacing Western
influence, and promoting alternatives to democracy as a regional
norm.]{.underline}

[Africa, thus, is a "theater" for Russia's geostrategic
interests]{.underline} rather than a destination itself---a perspective
reflected in the means that Russia employs. Unlike most major external
partners, [Russia is not investing significantly in conventional
statecraft in Africa]{.underline}---e.g., economic investment, trade,
and security assistance. Rather, Russia [relies on a series of
asymmetric (and often extralegal) measures for influence---mercenaries,
arms-for-resource deals, opaque contracts, election interference, and
disinformation.]{.underline}

PARTNERSHIP WITH WHOM?

[Russia's Africa-focused initiatives are typically concentrated on
propping up an embattled incumbent or close ally:]{.underline} Khalifa
Haftar in Libya, Faustin Archange Touad칠ra in the Central African
Republic (CAR), and coup leaders Colonel Assimi Go칦ta in Mali and
Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan in Sudan, among others.

To assess the future of Russia-Africa relations, therefore, it is
necessary to be clear that the "partnerships" that Russia seeks in
Africa are not state- but elite-based. [By helping these often
illegitimate and unpopular leaders to retain power, Russia is cementing
Africa's indebtedness to Moscow.]{.underline}

This strategy works for Russia and the respective leaders who gain
international diplomatic cover, resources to consolidate power
domestically, a mercenary force, arms, and revenues from resource deals.
However, [Russia's opaque engagements are **inherently destabilizing**
for the citizens of the targeted countries, resulting in stunted
economic development, human rights abuses, disenfranchisement of African
citizens, the perpetuation of illegitimate governments, and social
polarization.]{.underline}

Through this model, Russia has been able to advance its objectives with
limited financial and political costs. Accordingly, we can expect to see
Moscow continuing to expand its influence on the continent in 2022.

FOCAL POINTS FOR AFRICA-RUSSIA RELATIONS IN 2022

[Libya. Russia retains Wagner mercenary forces (former Russian defense
intelligence troops) and military assets on the ground in support of its
proxy, warlord Khalifa Haftar. Russia can be expected to try and steer
the outcome of the postponed presidential and legislative elections with
the aim of emerging as the principal powerbroker in this
geo-strategically important territory---with access to oil reserves and
deep-water ports in the eastern Mediterranean and a permanent presence
on NATO's southern flank.]{.underline}

[Sudan]{.underline}. Russia has been striving to gain naval port access
in the Red Sea, especially Port Sudan. It also has longstanding ties to
the Sudanese military, elements of the ousted Bashir regime, and gold
trafficking networks in the west. Continuation of the military
government in Khartoum provides a ready entry point for expanded Russian
influence.

[Mali. The military coup in Mali has provided Russia an opportunity to
become a pivotal actor in the Sahel.]{.underline} We can expect Moscow
to provide political cover to the junta of Assimi Go칦ta as it seeks to
avoid a transition back to a democratic government. Indications are that
Wagner mercenaries have already been deployed in support of the junta.

[Guinea]{.underline}. Russia has long been a patron of former president
Alpha Cond칠, who had been a strong supporter of Russia's extensive
mining (bauxite) interests in Guinea. Following Cond칠's ouster in a coup
in September 2021, Moscow can be expected to refocus its diplomatic
efforts on propping up the military junta of Colonel Mamady Doumbouya in
return for Moscow's continued political sway and unencumbered access in
the mining sector.

[Gulf of Guinea.]{.underline} Having consolidated its position in the
CAR in 2021, Russia is set to expand its influence in nearby Republic of
the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gabon in 2022.
Moscow has been cultivating ties with leaders of all three countries
with an eye on becoming a more significant player in the lucrative oil
and mineral networks of Central Africa.

[Angola]{.underline}. President Jo칚o Louren칞o is contending for a second
term in office in 2022 amid a long recession, criticisms for increasing
authoritarianism, and divisions within his ruling party. Russia's
opportunistic strategy of coming to the aid of isolated leaders as a
means of enhancing Moscow's leverage makes Louren칞o an attractive
target. His military academy training in the USSR, Russia's extensive
Cold War era ties to Angola, and Angola's vast diamond, oil, gold, and
mineral resources will all factor into increased Russian attention on
Louren칞o in 2022.

CIVIL SOCIETY ENGAGEMENT AND SCRUTINY

[Since Russia's engagements in Africa are typically predicated on
co-opting leaders facing limited checks and balances, they are nearly
always detrimental to African citizens who must endure deepened
institutionalized corruption, diverted public revenues, unaccountable
leaders, and instability.]{.underline} Reform, therefore, will not come
from these leaders but from African citizens, which will entail greater
civil society engagement, enhanced transparency around contracts, and
higher levels of scrutiny of any deals struck with Russia.

June 22, 2022, Turkey's wartime bridge to the West is collapsing,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkeys-wartime-bridge-to-the-west-is-collapsing//RM)

For the first time in a while, Turkey was not only acting in line with
transatlantic allies but also taking a lead in the region in a way that
has bolstered its importance as a key NATO member. [US officials have
gone as far as to suggest that Turkey transfer its S-400 missile-defense
systems to Ukraine in a bid to finally solve the problem of Russian air
defense systems stationed in a NATO member state and the consequent
Western sanctions imposed on Ankara. **Turkey has bluntly rejected that
proposal.**]{.underline} Instead, it has slowly allowed domestic
problems, regional geopolitics, and pragmatism to dictate its approach
to the war. As a result, [Turkish leadership once again appears eager to
continue business as usual with an increasingly isolated
Russia.]{.underline} Shifting winds Though only obliged to close the
Bosporus and Dardanelles straits for the naval ships of states at war
under Article 19 of the Montreux Convention, Ankara has denied access to
non-littoral NATO states as well. [Turkey's fears of losing out to the
West in its ambitions for a kind of regional ownership of the Black Sea
prevailed over the security threats posed by Russia. Turkey's desire to
limit the presence of NATO vessels in the Black Sea, which might lead to
further escalation with Russia, is understandable---even if not in line
with the Alliance's objectives]{.underline}. It is harder to justify the
statements of Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar wondering whether
mines discovered in the Black Sea had been laid there deliberately to
create an excuse for NATO minesweepers to enter those waters. Turkey is
also blocking the quick addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO, trying
to use the situation to solve its own problems and voice its own
security concerns. It is highly unlikely that Turkish leadership will
block the membership of the two Nordic countries in the long term.
Nevertheless, its current diplomatic bargaining has revealed major
differences in threat perceptions as seen from Ankara and other
capitals. While for most of the European states, the major threat on
NATO's eastern borders is a revisionist Russia, for Turkey it is Kurdish
People's Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) fighters
operating in Syria and allegedly finding a safe haven in Finland and
Sweden. Obviously, [skyrocketing anti-American sentiments in Turkey and
a traditional mistrust for the West limit the possibilities for
cooperation on Ukraine]{.underline}. Whereas the majority of Turks
support Ukraine in this war, [polls show that more than 48 percent blame
the United States or NATO for the conflict while only 34 percent hold
Russia responsible]{.underline}. There is a widespread belief in Turkish
society that the war in Ukraine is just another regional conflict
instigated by Western powers after Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and
others. Russia's invasions and aggression in in South Ossetia, Abkhazia,
Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, and more recently in Ukraine and Syria
don't evoke a similar response among Turks. [Populist rhetoric,
burgeoning ahead of next year's elections, as well as massive
anti-Western propaganda on Turkish media mostly featuring retired
generals, nationalist pundits, and (pro-)Russian experts with a strong
Eurasianist agenda, do not help either. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's
economic and strategic agendas also depend on close coordination with
Moscow. Russia supplies almost half of Turkish domestic gas demand,
provides technology for the country's first nuclear power plant in
Akkuyu, and serves as the source of more than five million tourists
annually. The Kremlin's support is also vital for Turkey to maintain its
presence in the South Caucasus and Middle East.]{.underline} The recent
meeting of 칂avu릂륿u with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in
Ankara clearly showed that [Turkey is keen to stick to mechanisms for
cooperation with Russia]{.underline}, like the Astana Platform in Syria
or the 3+3 format in the South Caucuses (which also involves Iran,
Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). Instead of using this crisis as a
chance to decrease its strategic dependence on Russia[, Turkey seems
eager to bind itself even more to Moscow within new
formats.]{.underline} Money matters Ukraine has so far largely respected
Turkey's sensitivities and not pushed too hard on sanctions, instead
focusing on arms supplies and Ankara's mediator role. However, that
dynamic is coming under stress with Russian oligarchs using Turkey as a
safe haven to bypass European Union restrictions. According to Lavrov's
recent statements, [Russia-Turkey bilateral trade doubled in the first
quarter of 2022, and there are now ongoing talks on expanding the use of
Russia's MIR payments system in Turkey]{.underline}. In March, Erdo르n
suggested to Putin that their countries switch to national currencies or
gold in commercial deals instead of the dollar or euro. Izzet
Ekmekcibashi, the head of the Turkish-Russian Business Council (DEIK),
said that more than one thousand new Russian companies opened in Turkey
in March alone. Most recently, a well-connected Turkish journalist
reported on a Russian-Turkish agreement to move the European
headquarters of forty-three leading Russian companies including Gazprom
to Turkey. [Turkish-Russian cooperation in tourism has also quickly
developed.]{.underline} Turkish media outlets have reported that Turkish
carriers are operating 438 flights per week to Russia this summer at a
time when sanctions have made it difficult for Moscow to arrange
flights. According to the pro-government Sabah newspaper, Turkish
Airlines has signed a deal to bring 1.5 million Russian tourists over in
2022. The newspaper's report suggests that Ankara also plans to issue
loans under state guarantees to support Turkish travel companies working
with Russian tourists and back a new airline with the specific mandate
of transporting Russian tourists to Turkey. [Ankara]{.underline}, which
earlier called on Moscow to end its blockade of Ukrainian ports so grain
exports could restart[, is now taking a more pro-Russia position,
advocating for the international community to help unblock not only
Ukraine's but also Russia's trade in grain and fertilizers through safe
logistics, ship insurance, and a return of Russian banks to the SWIFT
system]{.underline}. During Lavrov's recent visit to Turkey, 칂avu릂륿u
said that Turkey considered Moscow's demands "reasonable" and "feasible"
and backed easing Western sanctions against Russia. [There is also ample
evidence of Ankara's involvement in the illegal shipment and trade of
Ukrainian grain stolen by Russian forces to the Middle East via the
Turkish ports of Samsun, Derince, Band캼rma, and Iskenderun. So far,
despite strong evidence of Russian crimes and official appeals from
Ukraine, Turkish authorities have remained silent on these cases. These
moves]{.underline} [by Turkey don't just undermine its credibility as a
mediator between Ukraine and Russia but also raise questions about
Ankara's geopolitical choices in a broader regional and transatlantic
framework]{.underline}. As it leans toward Russia in a bid for stability
at home, Turkey risks finding itself estranged from the West and aligned
with a pariah state on the international arena. The Ukrainian case will
become a major test for Turkey. Whether Ankara prefers to use it to
bridge the gaps with the West or to burn the bridges remains to be seen.

#### Anti-western sentiment [ties]{.underline} Russia and Turkey together--NATO recentralization [wrecks]{.underline} this relationship

Turkish Studies (CATS) at SWP. (5-20-2022). Deciphering Turkey\'s

[The war in Ukraine is set to]{.underline} increase the pressure on
Turkey's balancing policy, shed light on the role of anti-Westernism in
Ankara-Moscow relations, and [**reshape Tur춼key's relations with Russia
and the West**.]{.underline} The balancing policy will face a less
permissive environment. However, a rupture in Turkey-Russia relations is
not to be expected. Given the prohibitive cost of a breakdown, Ankara
will strive to maintain functional bilateral relations with Moscow. More
broadly, despite the changed con춼text, Turkey will continue to seek
autonomy in its foreign and security policy. This quest precedes the
balancing policy and was not driven solely by discontent with the West.
It was also informed by Turkey's reading of the global order becoming
more multipolar and less Western-centric. In spite of similarities in
their narratives, the Turkish and Russian anti-Westernisms manifest
themselves differently in policy terms. Finally, Russia's geopolitical
revisionism is set to drive Turkey and the West relatively closer
together in matters geopolitical and strategic, provided that Turkey's
current blockage of Sweden and Finland's NATO membership bid is resolved
in the not too distant future. [The pace and depth of developments in
Turkish-Russian relations since 2016 has been intriguing. **Discontent
with the West has been a major driver for rapidly improv춼ing ties.** In
fact, one could argue that it was anti-Westernism that created Turkey's
geo춼political balancing policy between Russia and the West]{.underline},
coupled with the understand춼ing that a multipolar global order was in the
making. The close relationship with Russia has led to further rifts
between Tur춼key and the West. However, despite their shared discontent
with the West, Russian and Turkish anti-Westernism differ in nature,
origin and manifestation. Turkish anti-Westernism tends to be selective
and policy-focused, whereas the Russian version is more structural and
encompassing. For instance, Russian For춼eign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke
of ending US and western dominance of the inter춼national system as the
core goal of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Unlike Russia, Turkey also
benefits from the Western-centric inter춼national system it criticises.
These differences carry major policy implications. The invasion of
Ukraine has also injected a whole set of new dynamics into the
Turkey-Russia-West triangle. [Ankara's geopolitical balancing policy is
now entering **difficult terrain**, if not becoming unfeasible, as NATO
and the West treat Russia explicitly as an enemy.]{.underline} The cost
of such a policy is likely to increase. But even if balancing became
unfeasible, Ankara would still strive to maintain some form of
function춼ing bilateral relationship with Moscow. Geopolitical Balancing
Policy and Functional Bilateral Relations The major difference between
Turkey's geopolitical balancing policy and its quest to maintain
functional bilateral relations with Russia is the scope of cooperation.
A functional bilateral relationship meant cultivating economic, energy
and political ties, but did not extend into the strategic realms of
geopolitical and defence industry cooperation. Geopolitical balancing
in춼volves strategic cooperation, military pro춼curement (purchasing the
Russian S400 air defence system), and geopolitical engagement in
conflict zones in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh. [The **balancing
policy is driven by discontent with the West** and rests on a particular
reading of global poli춼tics, which Ankara sees becoming increas춼ingly
multipolar and less Western-centric (if not post-Western). It has also
been informed by Ankara's assessment that the **West lacks internal
cohesion**, seeing signs of fragmentation between Europe and the United
States]{.underline} (especially during the Trump presidency) and within
Europe post-Brexit.

https://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/why-turkey-needs-russia//RM)

Turkish security concerns also played a major role in Ankara's
rapprochement with Moscow. The Turkish Government had grown increasingly
frustrated with the United States and the West's Syria policy. The
United States' unwillingness to directly confront Syrian regime forces,
its focus on countering ISIS, and western collaboration with the
People's Protection Units (YPG) through the Syrian Defense Forces
aggravated Erdogan. Ankara views the YPG and the Syrian Kurdish
Democratic Union Party (PYD) as off-shoots of the Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK). In 2016, as the PYD expanded control along the
Turkish-Syrian border and the United States considered arming the YPG,
the Turkish government grew alarmed, as it did not want to see the
creation of an autonomous Syrian Kurdish region on its border nor a
strengthened YPG or PKK.\[vi\] Erdogan knew that if he wanted to take
action to counter PYD expansion in Syria he would need to work with
Moscow. [**Turkey's openness to working with Russia on the Syria crisis
revealed a shift in Turkish priori-ties**.]{.underline} Since the fall
of 2011, Turkey and Russia had been on opposites sides of the Syria
crisis; Ankara was focused on Syrian President Bashar al-Asad's ouster
while Moscow supported the regime. [Turkey's fear over the growing
strength of the PYD began to outweigh its aversion to the Asad regime
and necessitated better cooperation between Ankara and
Moscow.]{.underline} In August 2016, Turkey launched the Euphrates
Shield offensive, supporting Turkish-backed Syrian opposition forces
against ISIS, and succeeded in [both taking back the town of Jarabulus
and preventing Kurdish forces from gaining additional territory.
**Turkish plans for this offensive probably encouraged the restoration
of Turkey's bilateral ties with Russia.** Ankara likely sought out
Moscow's acceptance of the military operation to avoid a confrontation
with Russian and Syrian regime forces. **Turkey also began to work
closely with Russia to negotiate a diplomatic solution to the crisis.**
Ankara worked with Moscow to facilitate a ceasefire in Aleppo and
participated in Russian led peace talks in Astana. Russia likely
welcomed Turkey's new focus as it forced Ankara to be more flexible on
Asad's status in future Syrian governments and offered an opportunity
for greater Russian influence over Turkey.]{.underline} Ankara's
security concerns over the potential for an autonomous Syrian Kurdish
controlled region along the Turkish border and the strengthening of PKK
forces motivates Turkey to work with Moscow, as well as Washington, on
the Syria crisis. While unable to convince either Russia or the United
States to adopt Turkey's perspective on the YPG and PYD, the Turkish
government will maintain dialogue with both in an attempt to protect its
agenda. [Erdogan sees Russia as a dominate force in the crisis and will
continue to work with Moscow in the hope of **influencing the future of
Syria.** Ankara will push to preserve the territorial integrity of Syria
and limit the power and influence of Syrian Kurds.]{.underline} Erdogan
has repeatedly stated that Turkey will never allow the establishment of
a Syrian Kurdish state in northern Syria.\[vii\] [Turkey is possibly
**working on a deal with Russia** and Iran on Kurdish-controlled Afrin
and the city of Idlib, with Ankara working to get groups it backs to
retreat from Idlib in exchange for Turkey having more leeway to take
action against YPG forces in the Afrin region]{.underline}.\[viii\]

The [war unleashed by Turkey's invasion of Syria]{.underline}, targeting

**[powers.]{.underline}** UN reports show that 130,000 Syrians have fled
their homes in the region amid the Turkish offensive, and Turkish
officials claim they had "neutralized" at least 415 Kurdish fighters.
Turkish troops seized the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ayn, amid heavy
fighting including ongoing Turkish air raids, and seized a road crossing
that cut off US and Kurdish troops in Kobani. Turkish troops also fired
artillery at US troops near Kobani in what former US envoy Brett McGurk
said was "not a mistake," although Turkish officials later denied this.
Turkey's [Syrian "rebel" allies]{.underline}, the Islamist Syrian
National Army (SNA, formerly the Free Syrian Army), [are executing
Kurdish civilians]{.underline} in areas they hold, according to multiple
reports. Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf was executed; her
bullet-riddled car appeared in a video surrounded by SNA fighters.
Beyond Al Qaeda-linked calls to destroy infidels, the British Daily
Telegraph noted, the SNA's main outlook "is sectarian: they are
anti-Kurdish and they are Arab chauvinists." Yesterday evening, the
Syrian army announced it would march on the area. The official Syrian
Arab News Agency (SANA) reported: "Syrian Arab Army units began moving
north to confront Turkish aggression on Syrian territory\... The
movement comes to confront the ongoing Turkish aggression on towns and
areas in the north of Hasaka and Raqqa provinces, where the Turkish
forces committed massacres against locals, occupied some areas and
destroyed infrastructure." The Syrian army has reportedly reached an
agreement with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia,
whose alliance with the United States was broken by Washington a week
ago. Under this agreement, Syrian army troops would reach the city of
Kobani near the Syrian-Turkish border in 48 hours. On Saturday,
President Donald Trump had authorized the remaining 1,000 US troops in
Kobani to withdraw, and US forces were in full retreat across northern
Syria this weekend to avoid being cut off by advancing Turkish troops.
Iran, which has deployed tens of thousands of troops as well as drones
to Syria in recent years to back the Syrian regime against a NATO-led
proxy war, indicated it would support the Syrian army. Iranian Supreme
Leader Ali Khamenei's Advisor for International Affairs Ali Akbar
Velayati met with Syrian Ambassador to Iran Adnan Mahmoud yesterday in
Tehran. He gave Iran's "full support to Syria's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, calling for the withdrawal of the Turkish
forces," SANA reported. Velayati added, "The principled policy of Iran
is based on supporting the people and government of Syria and defending
their righteous stances in a way that entails continuing joint
cooperation until terrorism and terrorist organizations are completely
eliminated." At the same time, [military tensions between Iran and Saudi
Arabia are surging amid mutual attacks]{.underline} on tankers carrying
Persian Gulf oil supplies that are critical to the world economy. Last
month, the US and Saudi governments blamed a September 14 missile attack
on Saudi oil facilities that caused a sharp rise in world oil prices on
Iran, without providing any evidence. Then on October 11, two missiles
hit the Iranian tanker Sabiti off Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coast. Ali
Shamkhani, the secretary of the Iranian Supreme National Security
Council, said yesterday that Iran would retaliate against unnamed
targets for the attack on the Sabiti. "A special committee has been set
up to investigate the attack on Sabiti\... Its report will soon be
submitted to the authorities for decision," Shamkhani told Fars News.
"Piracy and mischief on international waterways aimed at making
commercial shipping insecure will not go unanswered." Saudi officials
declined to comment on the Sabiti attack, and officials with the US
Fifth Fleet in the Gulf sheikdom of Bahrain claimed to have no
information on it. But there is widespread speculation in the
international media that the attack was carried out by Saudi Arabia or
with its support. The **[conflicts erupting]{.underline}** between the
different capitalist regimes [in the **Mid**]{.underline}dle [East pose
an **imminent threat**]{.underline} not only to the population of the
region, but **[to the entire world.]{.underline}** Workers can give no

Middle East war could strangle the world **oil supply** and escalate
into war between **nuclear-armed powers.**]{.underline} The [working
class is coming face to face with the real possibility of a Third World
War.]{.underline} The Kurdish-led SDF militias in Syria, vastly
outgunned by Turkish forces and vulnerable to air strikes, warned US
officials in talks leaked by CNN that they would appeal for Russia to
attack Turkey and protect SDF and Syrian army forces. As Turkey is
legally a NATO ally of Washington and the European powers, such [an
attack could compel the United States and its European allies
to]{.underline} either break the 70-year-old NATO alliance or [go to war
with Russia to protect Turkey.]{.underline} "You are leaving us to be
slaughtered," SDF General Mazloum Kobani Abdi told US officials in a
meeting last Thursday. "You are not willing to protect the people, but
you do not want another force to come and protect us. You have sold us."
Mazloum dismissed US officials when they replied by demanding that the
SDF not cut a deal with Russia, but instead keep taking huge casualties
from Turkish air raids. He said, "I need to know if you are capable of
protecting my people, of stopping these bombs falling on us or not. I
need to know, because if you're not, I need to make a deal with Russia
and the regime now and invite their planes to protect this region." US
forces across Syria were in full retreat, however, and US Defense
Secretary Mark Esper told US television news yesterday that the
Turkish-Kurdish conflict "gets worse by the hour." Given the attempts by
the Kurds to work out an alliance with Syria and Russia, he added, Trump
"directed that we begin a deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern
Syria." Esper said he would "not place American service members in the
middle of a longstanding conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. This
is not why we are in Syria." Esper said the Turkish army was rejecting
the Pentagon's appeals for a ceasefire with the Kurds and instead
expanding its war aims inside Syria. "In the last 24 hours, we learned
that they likely intend to expand their [attack]{.underline} further
south than originally planned, and to the west," he said. Esper added
that "all the exact things" US officials warned their Turkish
counterparts [would]{.underline} likely happen if they invaded Syria
were now taking place, including the [release]{.underline} of [tens of
thousands of]{.underline} Islamic State (**[ISIS]{.underline}**)

'Extremely vulnerable' [Turkey's "economic crisis" is the "most
important factor in its calculations"]{.underline}, Howard Eissenstat, a
Turkey expert at St. Lawrence University in New York state and the
Middle East Institute in Washington DC, put it to FRANCE 24. The Turkish
lira lost 47 percent of its value over the past year, as prices soared
by over 54 percent. This 20-year inflation high marked a new nadir in
the currency crisis wracking Turkey since 2018, a crisis experts blame
on Erdogan's belief -- contrary to all economic evidence -- that higher
interest rates cause inflation. [Turkey does not want to "antagonise
Russia"]{.underline}, Eissenstat noted, because it **[is "extremely
vulnerable to a loss of Russian wheat, gas and oil"]{.underline}**.
[Russia is in effect a **vital trading partner** for the beleaguered
Turkish economy, providing **45 percent of its natural gas** and a
**colossal 70 percent of its wheat**. The latter is an especially
high-priority import, seeing as escalating bread prices are a major
source of discontent in Turkey. **Russia is** also **Turkey's biggest
source of tourists**, with its 4.7 million visitors accounting for 19
percent of all travellers to the country in 2021.]{.underline}
'Competitive co-operation' Historically, Turkey and Russia have a track
record of antagonising each other, most notably when the clashing
geostrategic manoeuvrings of Tsarist Russia and the Ottoman Empire saw
them fight on more than 10 occasions from the sixteenth century to the
twentieth century. At the outset of the Cold War, Kemalist Turkey's
axiomatic anti-communism and pro-Western ethos prompted it to join NATO
and host US nuclear missiles, a major source of Soviet vexation until
they were removed after the Cuban Missile Crisis. The most recent
Russo-Turkish diplomatic crisis flared in 2015, when Turkey shot down a
Russian jet near the Syrian border. But a formal apology from Erdogan
soon ended Moscow's retaliatory sanctions -- inaugurating a rapid thaw
in relations that weathered Russia and Turkey backing opposing sides in
the Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh wars. This recent paradigm in
Russo-Turkish relations is best described as "competitive co-operation",
the German Marshall Fund's Unluhisarcikli said, in which supporting
rival forces abroad "doesn't prevent them from cooperating in the fields
of energy and trade". A year on from that swiftly resolved spat with
Russia, a dramatic coup attempt sparked a pervasive crackdown as Ankara
held responsible Islamic cleric Fetullah Gulen and his movement.
Erdogan's government felt the West was not supportive enough after this
would-be putsch. Thus the [failed coup set the stage for Turkey-Russia
ties to deepen]{.underline}, explained Reilly Barry, a Turkey researcher
at Harvard University. Following the putsch attempt, Russian President
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} "successfully [sowed more seeds of doubt
into Erdogan's mind that the West is not his ultimate protector and
security assurance, and achieved his desired effect to create a wedge
among NATO allies when Turkey purchased the S-400 missile system from
Russia, a major red line for a NATO country to cross]{.underline}\",
Barry told FRANCE 24. "So, the Turkish government has formulated a
stance on seeing Russia as a potential major power protector in cases
when Western relations and alliances do not suit Turkey's best
interests." In this context, "having been close with Russia and Putin
lately more so than at any other time in recent history, **[it would
make Turkey extremely vulnerable to be condemning Russia in the language
that the US and Western European countries are]{.underline}**", Barry
continued. "It is also important to remember the US and other countries
do not share a sea with Russia and are not only separated by one other
country \[Georgia\]," she added.

[President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n highlighted the necessity of maintaining

tensions between Russia and Ukraine as Moscow recognized the sovereignty
of the separatist Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) and the Luhansk
People\'s Republic (LNR).]{.underline} Speaking to reporters on his way

both Russia and Ukraine and will not halt relations or plan to impose
sanctions against Moscow]{.underline}. "We have political, military and
economic relations with Russia. Same with Ukraine. We cannot give this
up if you ask me because our country has high interests in this regard,"
Erdo르n said. [He noted that Turkey aims to resolve the issue without
harming relations and will conduct talks with the Turkish delegation as
soon as he returns home.]{.underline} Careful calculations need to be
made to figure out the pros and cons of actions to be taken against
Russia, Erdo르n said, noting that steps need to be taken in a delicate
manner. "Some say the conflict will boost the costs of natural gas while
others discuss turning off the valves. We need to take our steps with
this sensitivity in mind," he said, adding that Turkish officials are
currently in contact with Russian counterparts to arrange a meeting.
["We will continue phone diplomacy and I hope we achieve favorable
results," Erdo르n said. The president noted that he highlighted
Turkey\'s stance regarding Ukraine\'s territorial integrity to Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a recent phone call and that Turkey
does not accept any actions violating the Minsk agreements. \"I told him
that we are ready to undertake the responsibility to ensure that the
crisis is solved through diplomacy and dialogue,\" he said, adding that
the ongoing tensions pose a threat to security in the Black Sea. \"Our
hope is for our Black Sea neighbors Russia and Ukraine to immediately
return to the negotiation table,\" he added.]{.underline} Erdo르n
continued by saying that he believes the planned NATO summit is quite
important in this regard, as countries will discuss measures to be taken
in light of Russia's actions. He noted that he would hold another
meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin following the NATO summit.
[He criticized Western leaders for their ineffective talks with
Putin.]{.underline} "As you know, Macron came to Moscow and you see the
picture. Scholz followed him and you see that picture too," Erdo르n
said, adding that Biden was also supposed to speak with Putin, but no
concrete results have been achieved so far. He noted that NATO was the
only instrument left to display a common stance. "In this
videoconference meeting, NATO needs to decide on its stance and do
whatever necessary," Erdo르n said, adding that no troops have been sent
to Ukraine so far, but Russia has amassed soldiers near the Ukrainian
border. "Of course, you don't need to be an oracle to know what's coming
in the face of this picture," Erdo르n said, adding that Turkey will
display its final stance regarding the issue after the meeting. However,
the president highlighted that Turkey has already sided with Ukraine
regarding Russia's annexation of Crimea and Putin's recent recognition
by rejecting it for violating Ukraine's territorial integrity. [NATO
member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with both Ukraine and
Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both its neighbors and has
offered to mediate the crisis, while warning Moscow against invading
Ukraine. Turkey has been closely following the developments and is in
close contact with both Kyiv and Moscow. While forging cooperation on
defense and energy, Turkey has opposed Moscow's policies in Syria and
Libya, as well as its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It
has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine, angering
Russia.]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed
decrees to recognize the sovereignty of Luhansk and Donetsk, known as
the Donbass, at a televised event in which he delivered a fiery speech
questioning Ukraine\'s right to statehood. [Putin also instructed

#### Ukraine war escalation goes [nuclear]{.underline}

How Russia Might Deploy Nukes in Ukraine War,
https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/how-russia-might-deploy-nukes-ukraine-war//RM)

With Russian forces struggling mightily to subjugate Ukraine in the face
of incredible resistance from both the Ukrainian army and ordinary
citizens, observers are concerned about the Kremlin escalating the war
with the use of nuclear weapons. At this point, it's arguably "low
risk," but it's not "no risk." [Moscow could certainly decide to move
the war from conventional to nuclear at any time. As such, we must take
the threat of the use of Russian nuclear weapons very seriously, surveil
it intensely, and prepare for the possibility of a nuclear
event.]{.underline} But under what circumstances might Russia use a nuke
against Ukraine---or as part of the Ukraine conflict? Dmitry Medvedev,
former Russian president and current deputy chairman of the Russian
Security Council, outlined Moscow's policy on using nuclear weapons in
an interview Saturday, according to The Guardian: [Number one is the
situation when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is
any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies. The third
is an attack on a critical infrastructure that will have paralyzed our
nuclear deterrent forces, and the fourth case is when an act of
aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardized
the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear
weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.]{.underline}
That's relatively clear, but that's not all. [Russia also has a
secretive "escalate to deescalate" doctrine for the use of nuclear
weapons that Medvedev didn't mention---unsurprisingly---in that list of
four conditions. This unspoken possibility is perhaps the most likely
scenario of all. Let's face it: The war isn't going well for Vladimir
Putin & Co. What the Kremlin thought would be a three-day dash to Kyiv
has turned into a monthlong slog, which has seen Russian forces losing
general officers, troops, and equipment at an alarming
rate.]{.underline} The outcome---once thought to overwhelmingly favor
Moscow---is up for grabs. That state of affairs doesn't bode well for
the Kremlin and its cronies. Even authoritarian leaders care about
public opinion at home and the effect it might have on the regime's
control over the country. [Losing the war in Ukraine would have
repercussions on Russia internationally, too, including significant
reputational costs, likely diplomatic pariah status, punishing economic
costs, and a demoralized, depleted military. In other words, losing in
Ukraine will be plenty painful for Putin and his pals---and this is
when, unfortunately, the use of nuclear weapons potentially comes into
play for the Russians. Indeed, Putin might use a nuke (or more) in an
(as yet unproven) "escalate to deescalate" plan for advancing Russia's
unjust goals in Ukraine.]{.underline} Although there is debate about the
effectiveness of using a nuke on the battlefield in Ukraine,
alternatively Russia could pop off a low-yield, tactical (aka
battlefield) nuke over an unpopulated area, or even the Arctic Ocean.
The point would be to send a clear signal to the U.S., NATO, and others
who are supporting the Ukrainian political and military resistance that
their backing must end---immediately. [If they choose otherwise, the
risk would be that Moscow might escalate from a single, low-yield
battlefield nuke over an unpopulated territory to high-yield theater or
intercontinental-range nukes targeting populated areas in these
countries.]{.underline} The Kremlin might calculate that Ukraine's
supporters (e.g., NATO) don't have the political will to risk a wider
conflict or chance a move up the nuclear-escalation ladder. Ukraine's
backers---and Ukraine itself---would have to make some fateful choices.
[Using the "escalate to deescalate" nuclear stratagem, Moscow
potentially could force any number of advantageous political and
military outcomes to the war in Ukraine, including a victory that avoids
the unpleasantries of a loss.]{.underline} Of course, the use of a
nuclear weapon in war for the first time since World War II is a
troubling idea to contemplate. But we must understand that the Russian
political and military playbook includes pages on the use of nukes.
[Consequently, we must consider Russia's use of nuclear weapons a real
possibility, monitor the movement of Russian nuclear forces with vigor,
and prepare for making the tough choices that the possibility of a
nuclear event would bring.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear war causes extinction

<https://fas.org/pir-pubs/nuclear-war-nuclear-winter-and-human-extinction/>/RM)

While it is impossible to precisely predict all the human impacts that
would result from a nuclear winter, it is relatively simple to predict
those which would be most profound. [That is, a nuclear winter would
cause most humans and large animals to die from nuclear famine in a mass
extinction event similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs.
Following the detonation (in conflict) of US and/or Russian launch-ready
strategic nuclear weapons, nuclear firestorms would burn simultaneously
over a total land surface area of many thousands or tens of thousands of
square miles. These mass fires, many of which would rage over large
cities and industrial areas, would release many tens of millions of tons
of black carbon soot and smoke]{.underline} (up to 180 million tons,
according to peer-reviewed studies), [which would rise rapidly above
cloud level and into the stratosphere.]{.underline} \[For an explanation
of the calculation of smoke emissions, see Atmospheric effects &
societal consequences of regional scale nuclear conflicts.\] The
scientists who completed the most recent peer-reviewed studies on
nuclear winter discovered that the sunlight would heat the smoke,
producing a self-lofting effect that would not only aid the rise of the
smoke into the stratosphere (above cloud level, where it could not be
rained out), but act to keep the smoke in the stratosphere for 10 years
or more. The longevity of the smoke layer would act to greatly increase
the severity of its effects upon the biosphere. [Once in the
stratosphere, the smoke (predicted to be produced by a range of
strategic nuclear wars) would rapidly engulf the Earth and form a dense
stratospheric smoke layer]{.underline}. The smoke from a war fought with
strategic nuclear weapons would quickly prevent up to 70% of sunlight
from reaching the surface of the Northern Hemisphere and 35% of sunlight
from reaching the surface of the Southern Hemisphere. [Such an enormous
loss of warming sunlight would produce Ice Age weather conditions on
Earth in a matter of weeks. For a period of 1-3 years following the war,
temperatures would fall below freezing every day in the central
agricultural zones of North America and Eurasia]{.underline}. \[For an
explanation of nuclear winter, see Nuclear winter revisited with a
modern climate model and current nuclear arsenals: Still catastrophic
consequences.\] [Nuclear winter would cause average global surface
temperatures to become colder than they were at the height of the last
Ice Age. Such extreme cold would eliminate growing seasons for many
years, probably for a decade or longer]{.underline}. Can you imagine a
winter that lasts for ten years? The results of such a scenario are
obvious. [Temperatures would be much too cold to grow food, and they
would remain this way long enough to cause most humans and animals to
starve to death. Global nuclear famine would ensue in a setting in which
the infrastructure of the combatant nations has been totally destroyed,
resulting in massive amounts of chemical and radioactive toxins being
released into the biosphere.]{.underline} We don't need a sophisticated
study to tell us that no food and Ice Age temperatures for a decade
would kill most people and animals on the planet. Would the few
remaining survivors be able to survive in a radioactive, toxic
environment? It is, of course, debatable whether or not nuclear winter
could cause human extinction. There is essentially no way to truly
"know" without fighting a strategic nuclear war. Yet while it is crucial
that we all understand the mortal peril that we face, it is not
necessary to engage in an unwinnable academic debate as to whether any
humans will survive. What is of the utmost importance is that this
entire subject --the catastrophic environmental consequences of nuclear
war -- has been effectively dropped from the global discussion of
nuclear weaponry. The focus is instead upon "nuclear terrorism", a
subject that fits official narratives and centers upon the danger of one
nuclear weapon being detonated -- yet the scientifically predicted
consequences of nuclear war are never publically acknowledged or
discussed. Why has the existential threat of nuclear war been
effectively omitted from public debate? Perhaps the leaders of the
nuclear weapon states do not want the public to understand that their
nuclear arsenals represent a self-destruct mechanism for the human race?
Such an understanding could lead to a demand that nuclear weapons be
banned and abolished. [Consequently, the nuclear weapon states continue
to maintain and modernize their nuclear arsenals, as their leaders
remain silent about the ultimate threat that nuclear war poses to the
human species.]{.underline}

#### Russia-Turkey relations are [high now]{.underline}--BUT they are on the brink

**The European Institute for International Law and International
Relations, 7-5**-20**22**, \"How do Russia and Turkey manage to maintain
a privileged relationship despite their differences on many issues?,\"
European Institute for International Law and International Relations,
https://www.eiir.eu/international-relations/europe/how-do-russia-and-turkey-manage-to-maintain-a-privileged-relationship-despite-their-differences-on-many-issues///DS

First of all[, **the good personal chemistry between the two**
presidents plays its role. Putin and Erdogan are both adepts of speaking
frankly, and they present this as an asset in inter-state relations,
making it possible to overcome differences and blockages.]{.underline}
In fact, each time the different stands they have on Syria, Armenia,
NATO, Libya... threatened to reach the point of crisis[, the two heads
of state met or spoke to each other, finding an agreement to overcome it
while acknowledging the persistent disagreements. **Erdogan and Putin
also agree on the way they treat opposition** in their respective
countries, which is brutal to say the least.]{.underline} They both also
agree on the strongman image they intend to project, both internally and
on the international scene. A turning point in the closeness between the
two presidents was Putin's expressed support for Erdogan after the
failed coup in 2016, while Western countries, for their part, criticized
the massive repression that followed that event in Turkey. What role
does [the West]{.underline} play in the current convergence between
Moscow and Ankara? This [is another major point of convergence between
the two countries.]{.underline} Wether one sees it negatively or
positively, and with obviously very different historical contexts, [both
countries consider that the West has refused their will of cooperation
and integration. They also believe that their Western partners have
ignored their security interests as they see them. For example, on the
Kurdish question for Turkey, the enlargement of NATO for
Russia.]{.underline} Turkey, like Russia, is interested in the idea of a
less Western-centric multipolar world, in which regional powers see
their role enhanced. But the anti-Western posture is clearly more
structural in the case of Russia (which sees itself as a global power)
than in the case of Turkey (who wants to extend its influence but on
different regional scales). Thus, for Russia we are dealing with
questions of principle, of world vision. For Turkey we are probably
dealing with something more situational, more fluid because it is more
negotiable, and this can constitute a fragility in the bilateral
relationship. This is perhaps why [the Russians have been keen, over the
last decade, to involve Turkey in economic cooperations that have a
strategic scope, creating long-term dependence (nuclear, energy...). The
rejection of Western policies is ultimately a common objective. Syria,
Libya, the Caucasus -- topics where the interests of Ankara and Moscow
are far from fully converging. But the one objective of marginalizing
Western countries, and showing the decline of their authority on the
international scene reconcile them.]{.underline} During the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, the Minsk group (of which France and
the United States are co-chairs with Russia) was not very active and the
ceasefire agreement was steered exclusively by Russia and consultations
with Turkey. Considering the tensions with the Europeans in the eastern
Mediterranean, Turkey sees it as useful to be able to display a capacity
for coordination with Russia. As for Moscow, it likes to emphasize the
spirit of cooperation that governs its relations with Ankara in the
Black Sea. Turkey has positioned itself in the Black Sea as a littoral
power tending to oppose the plans of Alliance members who are pushing
for a stronger NATO presence. This, of course, suits Russia. Turkey has
developed its relations with Kiev, affirming its support for the
territorial integrity of Ukraine, condemning the annexation of Crimea
and developing Ukrainian-Turkish arms projects. What impact does the war
in Ukraine have on relations between Russia and Turkey? Before the war,
Russian officials have repeatedly denounced the arms cooperation between
Turkey and Ukraine. Turkey also participated in the first summit of the
"Crimea Platform", initiated by Ukraine August 2021, in Kiev. As long as
this policy is not explicitly part of a NATO strategy towards Ukraine,
Moscow can accept the development of Ukrainian-Turkish ties. But when
Russia complained, before the war in Ukraine, about the development of
cooperation between the latter and the Nato countries, and if it was
mainly aimed at the role of the Americans or the British, it also had in
mind the Turkish drones. For the moment, [**Turkey gives the impression
of remaining in its posture of Russia-West balance** : it condemns the
invasion, it closes the straits to warships, but it does not take
sanctions against Russia, continues to work with it in the economic
field, and seeks to pose as a mediator.]{.underline} Everything depends
on what Turkey wants to do with the opportunity that the war in Ukraine
potentially represents for it: continue its game of balance between the
West and the Russians as in recent years; or repair its relations with
its NATO allies? It seems that the first option prevails at this stage
-- let's not forget that Turkey is very dependent on Russia economically
(energy, tourism...). It seems to want to make its usefulness known to
the various players in the context of this war, which is upsetting many
balances, and to gain an additional regional and international aura from
it (and to make people forget its economic crisis?). To what extent does
the desire to expand their respective influences constitute limits to
their political and economic cooperation? So far, [the two actors are
playing in the same arena, sometimes with more or less serious
friction]{.underline}. But their order of priorities is different. For
Turkey, it is the Middle East and the Mediterranean, while Russia's
foreign policy remains focused on maintaining its weight in the
ex-Soviet space. [This could change if Turkey were to become more
enterprising in this space that Russia claims as its sphere of
influence. Moscow is keeping a tight rein on Ankara's desire to develop
its presence in Central Asia in the name of historical, linguistic and
cultural kinship.]{.underline} Above all, with the war in Ukraine, one
wonders if Turkey, a member of NATO, will be able to continue for long
on its line of a transactional attitude in which it plays the Russian
card in its negotiations with its Western partners, and the anti-Western
card in its power relations with Moscow. [Correct **relations with
Turkey are perceived in Moscow as an asset** in relation to several
major strategic issues.]{.underline} The impression has often been given
that Turkey is more or less leading the game. Meaning, on the
international stage, and in particular in its relations with Western
countries and some of its neighbors, Russia has not exactly shown
flexibility lately, with an often offensive, if not aggressive,
behaviour. In this context, [the manifest effort of Russian diplomacy to
find points of agreement with a Turkey that does not hesitate to impose
its pace and its interests offers a striking contrast! This is because
correct relations with Turkey are perceived in Moscow as an asset in
relation to several major strategic issues.]{.underline} The Black
Sea-Mediterranean stage is a key issue. Russia proceeds by priorities :
[Turkey is not a convenient partner in Syria]{.underline} (where it
tends to take advantage, at present, of the Russian withdrawal linked to
the war in Ukraine), [but this is acceptable, as long as it remains on
the right line in the Black Sea, an arch-strategic zone for Moscow.
However, **one of the** **major objectives of Russian foreign policy**
in recent **years has been to divide by all means the NATO alliance**,
which it sees as strong militarily but weak politically.]{.underline}
Hence the efforts to quickly complete the contract for the sale of the
S-400 anti-aircraft system. One of the reasons why Ankara worked to
improve its relationship with Moscow was probably its perception that
its Western allies would not necessarily be of much help in the event of
a problem with Russia, and that it was therefore necessary to manage and
stabilize this relationship as best as possible in autonomy. Regardless
the extremely controversial democratic system reigning in Turkey, this
is more "looking out for themselves" behaviour than "challenging NATO"
behaviour.

**[The presence of Erdogan]{.underline}**, who has tried to position
himself as a mediator between Moscow and Kyiv, [**raised hopes that he
could help build on progress made last week in Turkey**, when Russia and
Ukraine agreed to preliminary steps that would allow grain shipments to
resume from Ukrainian ports.]{.underline} Russia is blockading Ukraine's
Black Sea shipping routes, including the major port of Odessa,
contributing to a global food crisis as the price of bread, cooking oil
and fertilizer soars. More than 100 ships laden with grain are estimated
to be stuck at port or at sea. U.N. officials, who are also helping to
broker the grain agreement between Ukraine and Russia, said more work
needed to be done. During a news briefing Monday, Farhan Haq, a
spokesman for the U.N. secretary general, said that "we don't have any
particular expectations" that a grain deal will emerge from the
three-way meeting in Iran. Since the talks in Istanbul last week, he
added, "we feel that incrementally, there's been a little bit more
progress made, but there's nothing to announce at this stage." [Putin
sounded a similar note at the outset of his meeting with Erdogan,
saying, **"It's true that not all issues have been resolved yet, but the
fact that there is movement is already good."** The leaders were also
discussing Turkey's plans for a **military incursion into northern
Syria**, targeting a U.S.-allied Kurdish-led militia.]{.underline}
Ankara says the planned operation is aimed at pushing back fighters
affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which it regards
as a terrorist group. But any military operation could put Turkey in
conflict with Iran and Russia, which are allies of Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad and have maintained military forces in the country.
Khamenei appeared to signal his displeasure during a meeting with
Erdogan on Tuesday, saying that a military attack was "definitely to the
detriment of Syria, Turkey and the region." [An aide to Putin, Yuri
Ushakov, said before the Tehran meetings that Russia opposed any action
that violated Syria's territorial integrity.]{.underline} But as the
leaders gathered late Tuesday to address the media, Erdogan brushed off
Russia's and Iran's opposition to his military plans: ["**I hear from
you, my dear friends, that you understand Turkey's security concerns. I
am grateful for this. However, words alone are no cure for wounds."**
Erdogan also criticized attacks on civilians in rebel-held Idlib
province in northwestern Syria, carried out by Russia or the Syrian
government, saying they "undermine our efforts for a political
solution."]{.underline} Putin's visit comes just days after President
Biden visited Saudi Arabia and Israel, where he spoke of fears that
China and Russia were seeking to fill a power vacuum in the Middle East.
"We can't let that happen," he said Friday in Tel Aviv. "There is a
reality in the region with Russia in the center of it," said Vali Nasr,
professor of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University's School

[At the risk of oversimplification, it may be useful to talk of an
emerging **global struggle** between two forms of governance: liberal
**democracy and** oligarchical **authoritarianism**]{.underline}. There
are still meaningful differences between the West on the one side, and
Russia and other oligarchical authoritarian states on the other ---
despite the emergence of Trump and other conservative-nationalist
populists in power in countries like Hungary. Thus, while it may be
misleading to speak of a new Cold War, there does appear to be a new
ideological divide emerging between Russia and the West that has a clear
national security dimension. If this continues over the coming decade,
Turkey will face the same question as during the Cold War: Which side is
it on? [In light of the transformations that have occurred in the
**Turkish foreign policy elite**, it seems much more likely for Turkey
**to side with Russia** this time around. There are **strong
affinities** between the Russian and Turkish **models of governance**
today, and leaders in both countries share a desire to be liberated from
the **interference** of Western governments, non-governmental
organizations, and international institutions concerned with internal
matters such as human rights and freedoms. They both have **ambitions**
to be more than leaders of mere subservient states on the periphery of
Western institutions]{.underline}. Russia wants respect as a world
power,111 Turkey as a formidable regional power. And there are also
significant push factors in Turkey's relations with the West. [Unless
there is a regime transformation in Turkey, **it is likely to continue
to diverge from** its traditional **Western allies**]{.underline}.

Sixty one years to the day since the Soviet Union\'s Yuri Gagarin
blasted off into the history books by becoming the first man in space,
Putin travelled to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia\'s Far East, 3,450
miles (5550 km) east of Moscow. [\"The sanctions were total, the
isolation was complete but the Soviet Union was still first in

successes such as Gagarin\'s flight and the 1957 launch of Sputnik 1,
the first artificial satellite from earth, have a particular pertinence
for Russia: both events shocked the United States. [The launch of
Sputnik 1 prompted the United States to create NASA in a bid to catch up
with Moscow.]{.underline} Putin says the \"special military operation\"
in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to
threaten Russia - including via the NATO military alliance - and that
Moscow had to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from
persecution. He said on Tuesday that the had no doubts Russia would
achieve all of its objectives in Ukraine - a conflict he cast as both
inevitable and essential to defend Russia in the long term. \"Its goals
are absolutely clear and noble,\" Putin said. \"It\'s clear that we
didn\'t have a choice. It was the right decision.\" [Ukrainian forces
have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping
sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

the biggest fall in gross domestic product since the years following the

SC)

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has **upended the geopolitical
calculations** of countries around the world. For Turkey, a NATO member
that has **performed a delicate balancing act between Kyiv and Moscow**,
the war is forcing some hard choices.]{.underline} Like his World War
II-era predecessor Ismet Inonu, [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
seeks to keep Turkey out of today's conflict as much as possible, while
maximizing his own room to maneuver.]{.underline} Amid the escalating
conflict and humanitarian disaster, however, Ankara faces growing
pressure to pick sides. Turkey faces a range of vulnerabilities from
either an emboldened or a desperate Russia. **[Erdogan's strategy
therefore centers on supporting Ukraine without jeopardizing ties with
Moscow.]{.underline}** Over the longer term, the course of the war
itself will do much to determine how Ankara maintains this balancing
act. Strong, unified NATO support for Ukraine, along with Russian
military setbacks, would provide the best opportunity to reinforce
Ankara's commitment to Ukraine---and to the alliance. Russia and Turkey
have for centuries been rivals across a wide geographic space
encompassing the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, and Central Asia.
[Vulnerability to Russian military power throughout these regions has
encouraged Turkish leaders to seek allies:]{.underline} Britain and
France in the Crimean War, Germany in World War I, and NATO in the Cold
War. When the international environment has been less threatening,
though, [Turkey has looked to Russia (and the Soviet Union) for economic
opportunities and as a partner for boosting its own strategic
autonomy.]{.underline} The Soviet Union's collapse created a series of
buffer states (including Ukraine) that shielded Turkey from Russian
military power, allowing Ankara to pursue a more forward-leaning policy
in Eurasia. It also opened up new opportunities for Turkish companies in
Russia, which became a major source of tourists to Turkey's
Mediterranean resorts as well as a lucrative market for exporters and
construction companies (many with close ties to Erdogan's Justice and
Development Party). Turkey also turned to Russia for energy, at one
point getting the majority of its natural gas from Russia, and signing a
deal with Russia's state-owned Rosatom to build Turkey's first nuclear
power plant at Akkuyu. [**Ties with Russia also allowed Ankara to hedge
against what it perceived to be excessive dependence on the West amid
tensions over Washington's role in the Syrian conflict.** Erdogan's
purchase of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system after he was
unable to strike a deal with the United States for the Patriot system
sent a message to Turkey's NATO allies that Ankara had other
options.]{.underline} Some voices in Turkish political and military
circles would like to go further, seeing Russia's pursuit of a
non-Western security order in Eurasia as preferable to continued
dependence on NATO. Improved relations with Moscow also reflected a
growing closeness between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin,
who was the first foreign leader to call Erdogan after the failed 2016
coup attempt, and whose strongman rule contrasted with mounting U.S. and
European criticism over Turkey's democratic backsliding. Russia and
Turkey nevertheless remain geopolitical rivals. Their forces and proxies
have clashed repeatedly---in Syria, Libya, and the South Caucasus. In
February 2020, Russian forces (or Russian-backed Syrian forces) bombed
Turkish positions near Idlib, Syria, killing over 30 Turkish soldiers.
Nor was Russia the only target of Turkey's Eurasian outreach. [Ukraine
is also important to Turkey as both an economic and a geopolitical
partner. Trade between the two countries has increased
rapidly]{.underline} since Ukraine's 2013-2014 Revolution of Dignity,
reaching \$7.4 billion in 2021. Ankara and Kyiv also signed a free trade
agreement on the eve of the most recent Russian invasion. Since 2019,
Turkey has also supplied Ukraine with military assistance, notably the
Bayraktar TB2 armed drones that were instrumental in Azerbaijan's
victory over Russian ally Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh and that have
inflicted significant casualties on Russian-backed forces in both Libya
and the Donbass. During Erdogan's visit to Kyiv at the start of
February, the two countries agreed to set up a factory to produce drones
inside Ukraine. Turkey's security is much better served by an
independent Ukraine than a Ukraine under Russian military-political
domination. Further territorial changes at Ukraine's expense would allow
Moscow to bolster its naval presence along the northern Black Sea coast.
(Russia's post-2014 militarization of Crimea has already tipped the
balance of power in the Black Sea against Turkey.) While the bulk of
refugees fleeing Ukraine have so far gone westward, a longer conflict
could also send refugee flows to Turkey, a country still struggling with
the effects of large-scale migration from Middle Eastern conflicts.
Turkey also remains susceptible to Russian retaliation. Despite some
diversification in recent years and new offshore discoveries, Turkey is
dependent on Russia for the bulk of its gas and a significant percentage
of its oil. With Turkey's inflation likely to be above 40 percent for
the year, turbulence in energy markets could have damaging effects not
just on Turkey's economy but on Erdogan's political fortunes ahead of
elections next year. Even with its military tied down in Ukraine, Russia
retains the capacity to hit back at Turkish interests. Idlib remains a
particular liability, packed as it is with refugees and a motley
collection of rebels who would likely flee for the Turkish border in the
event of an offensive on the city. [Because of all this, and because its
relationship with Moscow is important to Erdogan's larger geopolitical
ambitions, **Turkish support for Ukraine has been real---but
cautious.**]{.underline} On the first day of the conflict, Erdogan
characterized the Russian attack as "unacceptable" and "contrary to
international law." Turkey has since reiterated long-standing
commitments to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity
(including Crimea, the annexation of which Ankara has insisted it will
never recognize). Yet [many Turkish statements during the first week or
so of the conflict lacked the moral clarity of those from its Western
counterparts, instead **calling on both Russia and Ukraine to find a
diplomatic solution.**]{.underline} With the conflict worsening and
Western unity holding, Ankara grew slightly bolder. In a March 6
telephone call with Putin, Erdogan called for a cease-fire, the opening
of a humanitarian corridor, and a peace agreement. Turkey has also
continued to supply both humanitarian assistance and military equipment
to Ukraine. Perhaps its most visible contribution has been continuing to
supply drones to Ukraine---deflecting Russian criticism with the
disingenuous claim that such sales are purely private transactions. At
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's request, Turkey also agreed to
invoke the 1936 Montreux Convention, which allows Ankara to regulate the
passage of warships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits---the
first time since World War II it has done so. The decision required a
formal determination that the Russia-Ukraine conflict qualified as a
war---thereby rejecting Putin's description of a "special military
operation." Effectively, the decision to invoke Montreux means that
Turkey can prevent Russia from reinforcing its naval forces already
present in the Black Sea with ships based outside the Black Sea. (The
bulk of Russia's navy remains engaged in the Eastern Mediterranean off
Syria.) Particularly if the conflict drags on, closure of the straits
could degrade Moscow's naval and amphibious capabilities. [Still,
**Turkey's rhetoric remains cautious**, and it continues its policy of
engagement with Moscow. **Erdogan has spoken with Putin on multiple
occasions** since the start of the war, and Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov is set to attend the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey
later this week, where he plans to meet his Ukrainian counterpart,
Dmytro Kuleba.]{.underline}

[Erdo르n first announced that he **did not view the NATO membership bids
of either Finland or Sweden** favorably, on the grounds that they had
**become "safe houses" for terrorists**.]{.underline} This was a
reference to the presence and activities of individuals and
organizations with ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) as well as
G칲lenists, widely recognized to be the perpetrators of the coup attempt
against him in July 2016. The announcement came on May 13 and may
initially have been an attempt to divert attention from two events
around that time: a political ban of opposition politician Canan
Kaftanc캼o륿u, widely credited for engineering the defeat of Erdo르n's
preferred candidate in Istanbul's 2019 mayoral elections, and the
violent intervention by Israeli police during the funeral of the slain
Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, over which Erdo르n
chose to remain uncharacteristically silent. He subsequently intensified
his objections by adding that "all forms of arms embargoes," especially
by Sweden, against Turkey's defense industry go against "the spirit of
military partnership under the NATO umbrella." [Erdo르n has since made
it clear that he will not easily relinquish his veto unless these
objections are addressed. A flurry of diplomatic activities followed to
address what Stoltenberg on numerous occasions defined as Turkey's
"legitimate" concerns, without concrete results. The deadlock appears to
result from different definitions of "terrorism" and Erdo르n's
insistence on the extradition of persons including Swedish nationals and
a member of the Swedish parliament.]{.underline} It goes without saying
that direct material support, as highlighted by several experts and
former Turkish diplomats, provided to the PKK --- recognized by Turkey,
the United States, and the European Union as a terrorist organization
--- is indeed problematic and needs to be resolved. The complication
arises from a definition of terrorism in Turkish law that goes beyond
criminalizing participation in violent acts and infringes on basic
freedom of speech. This loose and often aggressive framing of the terms
terrorist and terrorism is regularly used by Erdo르n and members of his
government to silence and repress their critics and opponents. Erdo르n's
uncompromising stance contrasts with the earlier years of his leadership
of Turkey, when he seemed to be committed to liberal democratic values
and when Ankara --- with considerable U.S., Finnish, and Swedish support
--- started its accession process towards EU membership. Turkey achieved
its greatest integration with the trans-Atlantic community, and shared
peacekeeping responsibilities on behalf of NATO in its neighborhood, and
persistently supported NATO's enlargement including the "open door"
policy. [**Erdo르n** has since **transformed Turkey's parliamentary
system** to a presidential one with practically **no checks and balances
on his power**. Growing authoritarianism and repression of critics and
opponents has become a defining face of the country,]{.underline} with
the sentencing of civil society activist Osman Kavala and Selahattin
Demirta, former leader of the main Kurdish political party, together
with the likelihood that Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamo륿u, who enjoys
higher poll ratings than Erdo르n, may well face a political ban too.
[**NATO** has became another **target** of Erdo르n's vitriol as he
blames the West for Turkey's growing economic ills and political
isolation]{.underline}. This goes back to the aftermath of the 2016 coup
attempt, when members of parliament from the ruling Justice and
Development Party (AKP) alleged NATO involvement without presenting a
shred of evidence, even calling it a "terror organization." This
allegation has been periodically nurtured by the government even if
Erdo르n has personally avoided it. Yet, Erdo르n's close relationship
with Russian President Vladimir Putin, decision to purchase S-400
missiles from Russia, and a relentless diplomatic battle over them with
Washington has deeply damaged the reliability of Turkey as a NATO ally.
Skepticism about Turkey's place in the alliance was further aggravated
by Erdo르n's threat to expel 10 Western ambassadors, seven of them from
allies, for asking him to implement a European Court of Human Rights
(ECHR) ruling and release Kavala. Instead, Erdo르n chose to
categorically dismiss the ECHR decision as well as the Council of
Europe's initiation of disciplinary action against Turkey. This

The article mainly contends that since [the real and expected benefits
from the European Union (EU) and NATO were not delivered sufficiently
from Turkey's perspective, **Turkey looked for alternatives and
collaborated with Russia more intensely in recent years.** Turkey's
cooperation with Russia was also facilitated by several global,
political, economic, conjectural, security-related, and individual-level
factors.]{.underline} Another argument of the study is that despite
Turkey's intensive collaboration with Russia, it is not feasible for
Turkey to build a strategic partnership with it in the short- and
medium-term at the expense of its relations with NATO and the EU. The
main reasons for this are, in addition to the institutional and social
shortcomings, geostrategic divergences, Russia's inadequacy as an
economic actor, the pitfalls of an asymmetric relationship with Russia,
the security risks posed by Russia, NATO's continuing importance for
Turkey's security needs, and the incompatibility of Russia's and
Turkey's political systems. Keywords: EU; NATO; Russia; strategic
partnership; Turkish foreign policy Introduction [The arrival of the
Russian S-400 air defence system in Turkey in July 2019 was welcomed
enthusiastically by many in Turkey. This breakthrough event was even
described by some in Turkey as the **"country's liberation from the
West"**]{.underline} (Tol and Ta릃캼nar 2019, 107). Almost a decade ago,
the question started to be asked as to whether Turkey was drifting away
from the West, especially since it had approached Iran and voted against
sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme in the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) as well as clashed with Israel over the Mavi
Marmara incident in 2010. This time, however, this question is more
pronounced and the likelihood of a strategic shift became more tangible
with the arrival of a weapon system from a country that has been
confronting the West recently. [Given that Turkey's relations with the
United States and the European Union (EU) have been at a nadir in recent
years, **many regarded the acquisition of the Russian weapon system as a
precursor of Turkey's withdrawal** from the North Atlantic Alliance
(North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO)]{.underline} and the EU. In
addition to many other factors, [Moscow's and Ankara's bitter relations
with the West are a major reason why the two countries have closed ranks
in recent years.]{.underline} A milestone for Moscow's relationship with
the West was its annexation of Crimea in March 2014 while the coup plot
against the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalk캼nma Partisi,
AKP) government in Turkey in July 2016 marked a watershed in Ankara's
relations with the West. Russia had to confront a series of economic
sanctions from the West after 2014 while Turkey was deeply disappointed
with its Western allies for their slow and reluctant condemnation of the
coup attempt. Ankara has even aired doubts that the West might have been
behind the coup attempt. [These events have helped peak the two
countries' deeply-ingrained sense of distrust towards the West. As one
observer put, "Despite their obvious differences and even antagonisms,
**Russia and Turkey are united by one thing---the fact that they are two
great powers connected historically, culturally, and geographically to a
Europe that never fully accepted them as one of their
own"**]{.underline} (Lukyanov, People with Big Ambitions, The Moscow
Times, 19 July 2016). A major objective of this article is to unpack the
puzzle of whether Russia could replace the EU and NATO as a strategic
partner for Turkey. The article contends that in addition to some
factors facilitating the Russo--Turkish rapprochement[, Turkey searched
for alternatives, collaborating with Russia owing to the decline in the
real and expected benefits from the EU and NATO from the Turkish
perspective.]{.underline} Another major contention of this article is
that despite the close collaboration between Moscow and Ankara, in
particular after the coup attempt against the Turkish Government in July
2016, it is hard for Turkey to forge a strategic partnership with Russia
because of significant divergent geostrategic interests, Russia's
inadequacy as an economic actor, the downsides of an asymmetric
relationship with Russia, the security risks posed by Russia, the
continuing importance of NATO for Turkey's security as well as the
incompatibility of Turkey's and Russia's political systems. Moreover,
the absence of a solid social basis and the lack of institutionalization
in their relations further make it infeasible for Turkey to switch from
the Transatlantic Alliance to Russia. The study is divided into three
sections. The first part concerns the motives that brought Moscow and
Ankara together, including, first and foremost, their strained
relationship with the West, economic interests, conjectural factors such
as the Syrian conflict, transformation of the global governance system,
and similarity of their political culture based on security and personal
harmony between the leaders. The second part draws attention to the
limitations in the relationship, and the third part explains why a
strategic partnership between Turkey and Ankara and at the expense of
Turkey's partnership with the EU and NATO is not feasible in the
foreseeable future. Finally, the conclusion wraps up the article.

Western observers are increasingly worried and puzzled by the apparent
rapprochement between Vladimir Putin's Russia and Recep Tayyip Erdo르n's
Turkey, which is taking place despite an escalating Russo-Turkish
competition for influence extending from North Africa through
southeastern Europe and the Caucasus to Central Asia. A [shared
**aspiration to legitimate** the idea of regional powers policing their
respective neighborhoods and building regional orders **outside the
framework of Western**-led multilateral **institutions** and based on
hierarchy, limited sovereignty, and the disruption of smaller states'
territorial integrity provides a **basis for Russo-Turkish
cooperation**. Yet by inserting themselves more directly into their
neighbors' disputes and conflicts, **Russia and Turkey** have
**multiplied** the number of **friction points** between
them]{.underline}. This [combination of deepening political-economic
relations alongside escalating confrontation throughout their shared
periphery rests on unstable foundations. Which of these tendencies wins
out---a **shared interest** in moving toward a **less Western-centric
global order** based on post-imperial spheres of influence, or
competition over defining the nature and extent of those spheres---will
be a **critical determinant** of the future course of **Russo-Turkish
relations**]{.underline}.

[Following talks in Ankara, **the Turkish and Russian presidents said
they agreed to closely cooperate on ending Syria's civil war**. Russian
President Vladimir Putin said in the Turkish capital on September 28
that Moscow and Ankara will work to \"deepen coordination\" on ending
the six-year-old war, adding the \"necessary conditions\" now existed
for the conflict to end. Putin spoke at a joint press conference with
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who said that Turkey **"will
continue close cooperation with Russia for reaching a political solution
to the crisis in Syria.\"**]{.underline} Erdogan said that the pair
agreed to \"pursue more intensely\" the creation of a "de-escalation
zone" in Idlib Province, in comments echoed by his Russian counterpart.
\"Readiness was confirmed to comply with the final agreements on
creating four de-escalation zones, including the biggest of them in
Idlib Province,\" Putin said. Moscow and Ankara support different sides
in Syria's war. Russia and Iran are backing Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad in the conflict, while Turkey and the United States are
supporting various rebel groups opposed to Assad's rule. But [Russia,
Turkey, and Iran earlier this month agreed to **create a \"de-escalation
zone\"** in Idlib, an area under the control of opposition forces in
northern regions.]{.underline} Three other \"de-escalation zones\" have
come into effect in different parts of Syria since July. Islamic State
(IS) fighters, who captured large swathes of Syrian territory in 2014,
are opposed by all sides and are being driven from most of their
strongholds by the separate government and rebel campaigns. Putin\'s
one-day working visit to Ankara comes three days after the two leaders
spoke by telephone in a call that included a discussion of the
controversial independence referendum in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish
region. [Erdogan said after meeting Putin on September 28 that Ankara
and Moscow agree that the territorial integrity of both **Iraq and
neighboring Syria must be preserved**. He added that the September 25
nonbinding referendum in Iraq's Kurdish region had no legitimacy and
that the regional leaders must be prevented from making \"bigger
mistakes.\"]{.underline} Election authorities in the Kurdistan region
say the independence referendum passed with 92 percent support. Ankara
sees the vote, which was also fiercely opposed by the Baghdad government
and much of the international community, as a threat to its national
security and fears it will inflame separatism among its own Kurdish
population. However, the Kremlin has not explicitly condemned the
referendum, stressing instead the importance of maintaining Iraq's
territorial integrity. On economic matters, the two presidents said they
wanted to see progress in two major projects: the TurkStream gas
pipeline from Russia to Turkey and the Akkuyu nuclear power plant being
built in Turkey with Russian collaboration. \"We place great importance
on the realization of these projects swiftly,\" Erdogan said. \"We have
observed during our talks that there are some disruptions. We will fix
them quickly.\" Erdogan said the two states aim to increase their trade
turnover to \$100 billion a year. [Putin said Russia and Turkey will
**continue to lower trade barriers** both countries erected during a
period of soured relations last year]{.underline} after a Turkish
fighter jet shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border in late
2015. He said Russia has already lifted most of its restrictions on
Turkish agricultural products, resulting in a 58.7 percent surge in
imports of Turkish fruits, vegetables, and other farm products in the
first half of 2017. Another sector that has rebounded is tourism, with
the number of Russians taking vacations in Turkey increasing elevenfold
so far this year to 2.5 million people, Putin said. Putin said that when
the trade restrictions were in place last year, overall trade fell by 32
percent. But with the lifting of many restrictions, so far this year
trade has rebounded by 31.5 percent, he said. The two leaders didn\'t
mention a deal announced earlier this month for Turkey to buy Russia\'s
most advanced air defense missile system, the S-400, in its first major
weapons purchase from Moscow. The deal, Turkey's most significant
weapons purchase from a non-NATO supplier, has raised concerns in the
West over technical compatibility with NATO equipment. [Both Moscow and
Ankara have **brushed off those concerns**, with Erdogan saying on
September 12 that Turkey "makes the decisions about our own independence
ourselves."]{.underline}

[Since 2016, **there has been increased engagement between Turkey and
Moscow**, which has become crucially important **in various theaters of
war** and because of its significance for regional and global balances
of power.]{.underline} Researchers have tried to assess it on numerous
occasions. However, Turkish-Russian relations remain a puzzle for many.
They have not led to a complete realignment of the two countries, as
some of their most enthusiastic supporters and their most worried
critics had foreseen, but on the other hand, they overcame crises that
many observers at the time predicted would sever the relationship
altogether. Onlookers used variety of expressions to qualify these
relations and show the difficulty of defining them and their profound
ambiguity, among others: "uneasy alliance,"\[2\] "fragile
friendship,"\[3\] "partnership of convenience,"\[4\] "adversarial
cooperation,"\[5\] "cooperative competition,"\[6\] and "brutal
entente."\[7\] Moreover, just in the last few months, a series of events
occurred that impact, directly or indirectly, Turkish-Russian ties:\[8\]
the implementation of the ceasefire in Nagorno Karabakh, new
developments in Libya, the tensions surrounding Idlib, the election of
Joe Biden, and changes in the Ukrainian conflict, as well as with
Belarus. Each of these parts has emphasized some of the determining
factors involved in the links between Moscow and Ankara. This article is
an attempt to assess Turkish-Russian relations based on what emerged
during these recent events. Converging interests Since the dismantling
of the Soviet Union, [Turkey and Russia have **developed relations** in
different fields. Trade has been an important one of them\[9\] and
Russia is one of Turkey's top providers.\[10\]]{.underline} Energy
occupies a central position in the exchanges between the two countries.
Turkey relies heavily on Russia for natural gas, and at the same time it
would like to serve as an energy hub between Western consumers and
Eastern providers. Together with Russia's attempts to create new streams
for its production, this has served as a basis for common projects
between the two countries, the latest of which being the Turkstream
pipeline running from Russia to Turkey through the Black Sea.\[11\]
[Moscow also succeeded in being a partner in Turkey's efforts to
diversify its energy sources by building a nuclear power plant in
Akkuyu.\[]{.underline}12\] Other significant fields of exchange between
Turkey and Russia include tourism, with an important flow of Russian
tourists to enjoy Turkish resorts, and construction. Beyond these
long-term economic factors, [the last few years have seen a **new series
of common political interests** emerging between the two countries, or
more precisely between their presidents.]{.underline} Erdo르n's growing
authoritarian tendencies have echoed Putin's own political system.\[13\]
The Russian president also played his cards very smartly when Turkey
felt insufficiently supported by the West while facing of international
and domestic threats, following, paradoxically, the downing of a Russian
jet by the Turkish army in 2015 and in the context of the 2016 failed
coup in Turkey. While, in both cases, Western leaders were hesitant in
expressing support for Erdo르n, Putin saw an opportunity in the coup
attempt and was among the first to call the Turkish president following
the event.\[14\] [**Both leaders' suspicion towards the US and European
countries brought them closer** to each other and these developments
created a wider, more personal, basis for Turkish-Russian
cooperation.]{.underline} Common successes While the economic relations
between Russia and Turkey continued to grow slowly, Putin and Erdo르n
developed a strong personal relationship. Starting in 2016, the two
leaders met on a regular basis, which led to a new partnership between
the two countries. [This partnership found its most striking expression
in Syria, where Moscow and Ankara understood that they had common
interests. Russian support for Assad, Turkish worries that the Kurdish
YPG, considered by many to be the Syrian branch of the PKK, could
establish permanent control over a zone bordering Turkey led both
countries to feel that the West, and more particularly the US, was
retreating from Syria, which gave both Russia and Turkey the opportunity
to **coordinate some of their actions in the Syrian conflict**. While,
together with Iran, Turkey and Russia created their own platform to
manage the Syrian civil war, the Astana process,\[15\] both countries
also transformed the situation on the ground.]{.underline} Russian
support enabled Assad to make important victories over insurgents and to
restore his control over a large part of Syria. Turkey supported
Islamist groups that fought the Kurdish militias and launched direct
military interventions to create a buffer zone at its border. [On the
diplomatic scene**, Putin and Erdo르n reached a series of ad hoc
agreements** to try and solve their different problems in
Syria.]{.underline} Facing tensions in Idlib, where Turkey supports
Islamist rebels, both as part of its strategy in Northern Syria and to
avoid a new wave of Syrian refugees to its territory, whereas Russia
supports Assad's efforts to take over the city, the two leaders decided
to turn the city into a "de-escalation zone" in 2018.\[16\] Similarly,
Turkey's advances in North-East Syria were inscribed in the Sochi
agreement reached in October 2019 between Erdo르n and Putin.\[17\] It
created a "safe zone" without Kurdish fighters and controlled by Syrian
and Russian forces, while Turkish troops remained in the territories
they had seized. [Following the agreement, Turkish-Russian joint patrols
started in the buffer zone, which embodied both countries' cooperation
in Syria. All this was made without consideration for Western positions
on the conflict and was considered as a success for Erdo르n and
Putin]{.underline}, who, by "putting boots on the ground" and creating
faits accomplis, imposed their own agendas in Syria based on national
interests and hard power,\[18\] against the more liberal Western plans
for the country. Another important mutually beneficial move [was the
decision by the Turkish government to buy Russian S-400 missiles.\[19\]
This was a way for **Turkey to express its disappointment** towards
Washington and an attempt to free itself from its dependence on Western
providers for its defense.]{.underline} For Putin, the sale was a blow
to NATO. [The introduction of Russian material into a NATO member's
military system, contrary to the alliance's rules, **created tensions
between Turkey and its allies and weakened the organization's internal
cohesion.**]{.underline}

Until 2016, among the two backers of Syria\'s Bashar al-Assad regime,
Iran had the upper hand over Russia and exerted more influence on the
regime apparatus and the ruling Assad family. Iran was the first country
to come to Damascus\' help by providing weapons, financial support,
advisors, and proxies to fight the armed rebellion. [When Turkey doubled
down on its involvement in Syria starting in late 2015, the Assad regime
could not turn to Tehran for protection, since Iran lacked the capacity
to deliver. As the Turkish threat was combined with the possibility of
imminent and crippling Western air strikes, the Assad regime had little
choice but to become more reliable upon Russia. In that way, **Turkey\'s
presence allowed Moscow to dominate the Syrian regime** and reduce
Iran\'s influence. Turkey became the dominant backer of the opposition,
as the armed groups realized **they could not survive without Turkey**
due to Russia\'s intervention]{.underline}. Regional rivals such as
Saudi Arabia gradually lost influence on the ground. Western diplomatic
and political influence over the Syrian opposition also eroded - to
Ankara\'s benefit. In December 2016, [**Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip
Erdogan envisaged Astana, Kazakhstan\'s capital, as a new venue for
carrying on the Syria peace talks**.]{.underline} In doing so, they also
set in motion a game plan through which Moscow and Ankara controlled the
warring parties in Syria and took control of the conflict. [The Astana
Process removed international mediation mechanisms set up in Vienna and
Geneva from the center of attention. The Turkish-Russian cooperation
also further curbed Iran\'s influence]{.underline}, since tensions
between the Turkey-backed rebels and proxies and the Assad regime had
been resolved through bilateral Ankara-Moscow talks rather than in
Astana. Ankara\'s successful pressure campaign on Washington in 2019 to
reduce the amount of help it was giving to the Syrian Kurds was of
benefit to Moscow, which saw the presence of the United States and the
partnership in eastern Syria to be much more challenging than Turkey\'s
presence in north-west Syria. In 2016, [**Russia had given the green
light for the Turkish incursion into Syria**. In return, Ankara, in
effect, facilitated the regime takeover of Aleppo, the most important
city under rebel control.]{.underline}

SC)

In this paper, [we aim to analyze **the impact of the Turkish lira
currency shock** on the stock returns of 29 major banks in
Europe.]{.underline} Literature after the global economic crisis of
2008, deals mostly with the financial spillovers of shocks in the US or
Europe to emerging markets rather than vice versa and on a macro level
(Stracca, 2014; Kim, Kim, & Lee, 2015; Chen, Filardo and Zhu, 2016;
Fadejava, Feldkircher, & Reininger, 2017; Fratzscher, Duca and Straub,
2016). As a result, we look at data on some of the largest banks in
Europe from both high and low risk economies. Our results illustrate the
investors\' sentiment of how resilient banks would be to possible bank
defaults with spillover effects. **[The stocks of the overall banking
sample react negatively to the crisis in Turkey and results indicate
that banks that recently increased their leverage or experienced a
decrease in liquidity or profitability have also been subject to higher
abnormal losses on the event day and a day after the event, where the
losses in general were the most severe.]{.underline}** Nevertheless,
leverage, liquidity and performance ratios are by themselves not
sufficient to assess the financial soundness of banks, since the risk is
more related to the quality than the quantity of the assets they carry.
Across countries, [we find Greece, Italy and Spain, the three economies
of PIIGS analyzed in this paper, to be significantly related to the
Turkish currency shock. Banks of Greece show **the highest abnormal
losses**, which indicates that geographical proximity can be a factor in
speculative attacks and/or crisis spillovers.]{.underline} Moreover,
[banks located in countries with lower systematic risk such as Germany,
Netherlands and France **react strongly to the Turkish lira
crisis**.]{.underline} Therefore, investors do not appear sensitive to
whether a bank is operating in a less or more healthy banking system. In
addition, losses of banks are not necessarily proportionate to the size
of their exposures, with the exception of Turkish banks, which have been
the most vulnerable. Spanish and Italian banks, which carry the largest
amount of loans extended to Turkey do not seem to display the highest
abnormal losses among the European banks. [German banks, on the other
hand, have no subsidiaries in Turkey and their claims are small relative
to their capital (2.4%) and yet they disclose **significant abnormal
losses**.]{.underline} In fact, the underlying risk resulting from
banks\' exposures to Turkey is difficult to assess, as there are many
indirect factors that might influence the operation of banks such as
other country and industry-specific risks. [German, Dutch and French
banks could be vulnerable to the extent that their economies will
support the **ailing financial system in other EU areas**.]{.underline}
UK and Switzerland, which are considered as outsiders of the EU
financial system (the former in the process) appear to be immune to
these pressures and therefore their banks are found relatively stable.
[We conclude that foreign banks\' lending practices may be **a source of
instability in their financial markets** even when a shock originates in
a relatively small economy to which the banks have direct or indirect
exposure.]{.underline} The role of banks in transmitting disturbances
from emerging markets across borders is of increasing relevance with the
presence of international banks and emerging markets with greater
openness in their 遼nancial sectors. To better understand this
phenomenon, further research would be useful that analyzes the response
of individual bank balance sheets and lending decisions to such shocks
from the emerging economies.

Russia's atrocities against Ukrainian civilians and its escalated
warfare in southeastern Ukraine have swept aside last month's public
discussion of peace options as the countries briefly held talks in
Turkey. [Yet even in the darkest moments, all sides in this war,
including the United States and Europe, have strong interests in
maintaining channels for negotiation that can be used when opportunity
re-emerges. Protecting that interest means understanding and maintaining
Turkey's role in facilitating talks---and its potential to serve more
actively as a mediator.]{.underline} By at least some norms of peace
processes, [Turkey is an atypical mediator---but policymakers would do
well to note strengths, not widely recognized, that it can bring to this
role. While analysts have suggested China, Israel, India and others as
possible mediators---and while no options should be ignored---Turkey has
emerged as the most immediately useful go-between. It is no accident
that Turkey was Kyiv's and Moscow's preferred choice for their brief
attempts at negotiations in March. By design, Turkey's role in those
talks was limited to facilitation, providing a secure space and
even-handed treatment of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, but without
injecting Turkish observations or proposals]{.underline}. Particularly
for Russia, Turkey can seem like an illogical choice as mediator. It is
not neutral between the combatants, but rather is a member of NATO,
which Russia's government has declared an enemy. Turkey has supported
Ukraine with humanitarian gestures, evacuating some 16,000 civilians
from combat zones and receiving nearly 60,000 Ukrainian refugees so far.
It has even sold Turkish-built, armed, aerial drones that Ukrainians
have deployed against Russian ground offensives. Also, Russia and Turkey
have had their own conflicts, both historically and in recent years.
[Yet part of Turkey's utility as an interlocutor for Russia may be some
of these very qualities. Any eventual Russian-Ukrainian agreement will
need acceptance---and likely, reconstruction funds---from the United
States and Europe. As a NATO member, Turkey can offer influence with its
U.S. and European allies in securing that support. Turkey has built
credibility by developing a specific capacity for mediation over recent
decades, and by showing itself to Russia and Ukraine as an independent
actor that, while a NATO member, is not unduly influenced by the United
States or Europe. Even now, with heightened battlefield violence and
accusatory rhetoric from both sides, Turkey is continuing its go-between
role. Its diplomats are continuing meetings with both sides separately
and keeping lines of communication open. This creates an asset for
managing, and hopefully limiting, the conflict---one that policymakers
should not ignore.]{.underline}

#### Turkey plays a [key role]{.underline} in Ukraine

Turkey is in a unique position to mediate",
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/opinions/turkey-mediator-russia-ukraine-dalay/index.html>//RM)

As Russian and Ukrainian delegations arrive Tuesday in Istanbul for
peace talks, Turkey\'s unique political position is under the spotlight.
Could the nation that straddles Europe and the Middle East emerge as
peacemaker? As the war grinds on, a growing list of countries are
exploring the possibility of mediating, stepping in to avert further
bloodshed and the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine\'s borders. [Earlier
this month, Turkey hosted Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers for a
trilateral meeting in its southern city of Antalya. Afterward, the
Turkish foreign minister visited both Moscow and Kyiv. Likewise, Israeli
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett visited Moscow for the same
purpose]{.underline}. And China has signaled readiness for mediation.
Potentially other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, India or
South Africa, might get in line to broker some kind of resolution.
[Almost all countries that have vied for the mediation role have also
engaged in a strategic balancing act between the West and Russia for
some time. Serving an intermediary role is a way for them to prevent
further catastrophe in the conflict, and project international stature.
But it is also a way for them to avoid making difficult choices the war
might force upon them, such as choosing or tilting toward one side more
clearly.]{.underline} But the list of fence-sitters in the
Russia-Ukraine conflict is not confined to mediators. Many more
countries have chosen to remain \"neutral,\" including Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan and Morocco. The rationale for abstaining differs
between countries, but some reasons cut across. The international system
is changing. And the idea that the world is no longer Western-centric,
and increasingly multipolar, is widespread in the non-Western world. It
informs their policies toward Russia, and toward China as well. [As long
as the dominant narrative of this war is put in a West/NATO versus
Russia dichotomy, it will have little resonance in the non-Western
world. Plus, the fence-sitting approach is also a way of signaling
discontent with the US/Western policy.]{.underline} It was illustrative
that the rulers of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who depend on the US for
their security, refrained from taking calls from President Joe Biden
earlier this month. This snub was meant to convey their displeasure with
the United States for Washington\'s insufficient support for their
botched Yemen campaign. From food and energy supplies to geopolitical
vulnerabilities, many other factors also define their approach. For
instance, in spite of its close military ties with the US, Egypt depends
heavily on Moscow in terms of its food security. It also closely
cooperates with Russia in Libya, with both supporting the warlord
Khalifa Haftar. (Kyiv accuses Haftar of sending mercenaries to aid
Russia in Ukraine.) Likewise India, in spite of needing the West as a
countervailing force against China, has long maintained close ties with
Moscow; has purchased the Russian-made S-400 missile systems; and has
pursued a policy of balancing between Russia and the West. [ut of all
these countries sitting on the fence and trying to mediate, Turkey has a
unique profile and position. It is a NATO member, an organization for
which Russia and previously the Soviet Union served as raison d\'칡tre or
the foundational threat.]{.underline} Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan has been increasingly castigating the Western-centric
international system. But as a member of many Western institutions,
Turkey is also a beneficiary, and in a sense, part of the geopolitical
West. Meanwhile, Turkey also has maritime borders with both Ukraine and
Russia. Plus, Turkey is Russia\'s largest trade partner in the Middle
East and North Africa region. And it has competed and cooperated with
Russia through conflict zones in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh in
recent years. Compared to other contenders for mediation, Turkey has the
highest stakes in this conflict. The war is fundamentally changing the
geopolitics and balance of power in the Black Sea region, and Turkey is
a major Black Sea power. [Turkey will probably play a humanitarian role
soon, too, as the number of refugees \-- already in the millions \--
rises. French President Emanuel Macron\'s announcement that France,
Turkey and Greece will undertake a joint evacuation mission in Mariupol
is a harbinger of a humanitarian role that might become more salient in
Erdogan\'s policy down the road.]{.underline} In spite of its policy of
not provoking Russia, Turkey is simultaneously not pursuing a policy of
equidistance. It sells armed drones to Ukraine, which are exacting
significant losses on Russian targets, and has closed the Turkish
straits to warships. In addition to Russia dominating the Black Sea, it
has a sizable Mediterranean presence where it is deeply involved in
conflicts spots in Syria and Libya. Turkey\'s sea closure will put
pressure on Russian policy in these conflict zones if the war is
prolonged. [Yet unlike other NATO members, Turkey has neither joined the
Western sanctions against Moscow nor closed its airspace to Russia.
Doing so would have probably triggered a Russian veto against Turkey\'s
quest for mediating the conflict. And there are an increasing number of
anti-war Russian activists and pro-Kremlin figures heading to Turkey.
Turkey is basically trying to be pro-Ukraine without becoming too
aggressively anti-Russia. Its capital city, Ankara, is too deeply
exposed to Russia both economically and geopolitically. Russia is
Turkey\'s largest source of tourists, grain imports and
gas.]{.underline} In any case, at this stage, there is not yet any sign
of the West pushing Turkey more strongly in joining the sanction regime
against Moscow. And despite Turkey\'s efforts, the conflict is not ripe
for mediation yet, because Moscow still appears to be hellbent on the
military option. This does not mean that efforts or talks will cease in
this conflict; to the contrary, we are likely to see more. Russia wants
to give the impression it is interested in diplomacy to buy time and
prevent further Western sanctions, but to no avail. No breakthrough
should be expected anytime soon. In spite of this, keeping the idea of a
diplomatic process alive is still important. Plus, the mediation serves
Turkey\'s interests well. It boosts its international stature; turns
Turkey into one of the major centers of diplomacy in this conflict; and
delays some of the difficult decisions that it might face down the road.
hat said, as the war drags on, Turkey\'s previous strategic juggling act
may no longer be feasible, particularly as Russia is now more openly
treated as an enemy of NATO and European security. From imperial Ottoman
times to the present, Turkey and Russia have fought each other 13 times,
but they have also cooperated. In the past, grievances vis--vis the
West, or even anti-Westernism, have usually driven them closer to each
other. Now, Russia\'s geopolitical revisionism and Putin\'s dramatic
shift in post-Soviet ambitions will drive an uneasy Turkey closer toward
the West.

Tuesday. She hearkened back to the numerous instances during the

more robust U.S. nuclear arsenal is needed to deter adversaries. "I
really am worried here that [the war is going so badly for Putin ... it
raises the possibility of **Putin feeling like he needs to escalate to

former Trump White House nuclear policy adviser who is now a researcher

the situation could unravel to the point where Putin is "raising the
ante, climbing the rungs of the escalation ladder to make the point to
NATO 'hey, you guys really need to knock it off with arming the
Ukrainians, I will no longer tolerate this.'" Russia has already
ratcheted up the war with its hypersonic missile launch in Ukraine last
week, and it has also been accused of dropping phosphorus bombs, which
are banned under the Geneva Convention (though using the chemical to
obscure troop movements or illuminate targets is not). "A simple glance
at a headline today can point to how acute nuclear risks have become."
Izumi Nakamitsu, United Nations high representative for disarmament

said. "He could declare there is an existential threat from a NATO ally

Nunn has been sounding the alarm about the threat of an accidental

command-and-control systems --- including by malign actors not directly
involved in the conflict who could be confused for a nuclear adversary.
"Third parties, third countries, might interfere in terms of
command-and-control or warning systems," he said of potential hackers.
["Interference in command-and-control could be taken in this kind of
atmosphere as probably a deliberate act."]{.underline} Nunn successfully
lobbied Congress last year to require the Pentagon to conduct a
"failsafe review" of the U.S. nuclear arsenal "to prevent cyber-related
and other risks that could lead to the unauthorized or inadvertent use
of nuclear weapons as the result of an accident, misinterpretation,
miscalculation, terrorism, unexpected technological breakthrough, or
deliberate act." Further complicating the task of U.S. and allied
commanders to decipher Russian intentions, said Morrison, is the fact
that so many Russian battlefield systems are also designed to unleash
both conventional and nuclear or chemical warheads. In other words, it
could be exceedingly difficult to know when the Russian military has
decided to pursue a nuclear option. "One of the problems with Russian
nuclear forces is how many of their systems are dual-capable," Morrison
said. "So you're not going to necessarily know if the S-300 or that

On 24 February 2022, [Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered a
full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. The decision was based on a
series of fatally flawed situational assessments, including an
overestimation of the fighting abilities of the Russian army, an
underestimation of the determination of the Ukrainian army and people,
and a faulty evaluation of the West's willingness to impose serious
economic sanctions. The massive sanctions that have since been imposed
on Russia's economy have led to a freeze on half of the central bank's
reserves, a fall in the value of the rouble of more than 40 per cent,
and an exodus of most Western companies from Russia. Increasing
political repression and a fear of border closures caused several
hundred thousand Russians -- a significant part of the country's
intellectual elite -- to flee abroad. The economic consequences of these
developments will be disastrous.]{.underline} At the moment, neither the
Russian government nor most Russian people seem to realise the extent of
the economic catastrophe that is already sure to happen. In the best
scenario, Russia's economy will shrink by 10 to 20 per cent this year, a
somewhat worse decline than during the 2008 financial crisis. But if
[the war continues, and new war crimes lead to additional sanctions, the
economic disaster might be comparable to that caused by the collapse of
the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. A self-inflicted catastrophe There
are few, if any, politicians in recent history who have inflicted such
massive harm on their own country in such a short time as Putin has done
in the last 20 days]{.underline}. Three weeks ago, Russia was a
middle-income country well integrated into the global economy, with a
large part of its population enjoying a standard of living comparable to
that of some European states. Russians could choose from a similar range
of consumer goods to people elsewhere in the world, occasionally travel
abroad for a holiday, and expect to lead a relatively stable and
peaceful life. Today, [Russia has become an almost completely isolated
pariah state]{.underline}. Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, and Syria were
the only countries that voted against a UN resolution condemning the
Russian war in Ukraine. According to a list compiled by researchers at
Yale University, by 13 March, 350 foreign companies had ceased or
curtailed their operations in Russia, with only 34 overseas firms
continuing to operate normally. As both Airbus and Boeing are no longer
servicing Russian planes, Russia's airlines were forced to stop
international flights and might soon be forced to stop domestic flights
as well. [Travel within the country will be pushed back to where it was
in the early twentieth century. It is unlikely that any of these
companies will return to Russia if the current situation continues or
deteriorates. As a consequence, the country will be deprived of many of
the high-technology and consumer goods it has been importing until now.
As Russia produces very few hi-tech goods, this will seriously affect
the Russian economy, disrupting supply chains and making the country's
situation similar to that of Iran during the last 30 years]{.underline}.
A similarly heavy blow will be the brain drain caused by the recent wave
of repression. Most of the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled
Russia in recent weeks are highly qualified specialists and researchers
who are difficult to replace. The remaining scientists in Russia will be
cut off from international networks, as worldwide academic institutions
have cut all ties with Russian universities. The consequences for
science, research, and innovation in Russia will be devastating. Dark
prospects for the future [Even in the best possible scenario of
immediate peace, it would take several years to repair the damage
already caused]{.underline}. Such a scenario would probably require the
fall of the Putin regime, and a new government that ends the war and
takes responsibility for Russia's actions, to open up the possibility of
bringing the country back into the international community. Even in this
highly unlikely scenario, however, [Russia's population will have
suffered substantial economic harm, and the horrors already committed in
Ukraine will leave deep scars for Ukrainians and Russians
alike]{.underline}. In what is unfortunately a more likely scenario, the
war will drag on for a considerable time, potentially leading to a
complete end of Western oil and gas imports from Russia. Although China
might be willing to jump in, Russia will not be able to significantly
increase its oil and gas exports in the near future, as the existing
infrastructure in the Far East is already operating at full capacity.
Moscow will thus have to rely on Chinese loans to import Chinese
consumer goods. As a result, [Russia might turn into some large-scale
version of North Korea: economically dependent on China and with a
government that through tight control of travel and information will try
to prevent its population from finding out the true reasons for the
disaster that has befallen it.]{.underline}

[From a strategic point of view, Putin's attack on Ukraine has thrown
back Russia to its weakest position since World War II. Ukrainians have
shown they are ready to fight and die, and that they will never accept a
Russian puppet regime]{.underline}. In a best-case scenario for the
Kremlin, Russia ends up controlling swaths of eastern Ukraine, including
a land corridor from Russia to Crimea, allowing Russian forces to
continue threatening Ukraine's Black Sea coastline and the country's
center. Yet even this state of play would hardly improve the Kremlin's
hand compared to what it was before the February invasion, when Russia
already occupied Crimea and had the Ukrainians tied down in a low-level
war in the eastern part of the country. Strategically speaking, the
status quo ante was favorable to Russia, since the simmering conflict
was draining Ukraine's scarce resources and hobbling its aspirations to
join the EU and NATO. Germany and France, signatories to the stalled
Minsk peace process, were uninterested in inflaming tensions with Russia
over Ukraine---as was the United States. After taking office, President
Biden tried to patch up relations with Moscow so that he could focus on
his main foreign policy priority, China. Biden held a summit with Putin,
refused to give Ukraine any clearer guidance on NATO membership, and
ignored calls to sanction Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline. In the leadup
to the attack, Putin, the eternal tactician, may have been under the
impression that he was on a roll in Russia's "near abroad." In 2020,
when mass protests broke out in Belarus, wedged between Poland, the
Baltic region, and Russia, Putin offered dictator Alexander Lukashenko
financial support and riot police. After a flare-up in a bitter
territorial conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan that same year, the
Kremlin inserted itself into the fight by dispatching Russian
peacekeepers to the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region. In January the
Kremlin briefly deployed a Russian rapid-reaction force to Kazakhstan to
help a friendly regime shore up its authority amid antigovernment
demonstrations and violence. Though all are dependent on Russia, none of
the beneficiaries of recent Kremlin support has returned the favor by
actively backing the war against Ukraine. [Russia's Isolation To varying
degrees, Putin's attack on Ukraine sent shocks through every former
Soviet republic as Russia showed itself to be an unpredictable,
revanchist power. Russia's isolation in its own neighborhood has nothing
to do with NATO; its lack of true allies is a strategic disaster
entirely of Putin's own making. In light of their history as Soviet
vassals, the desire of former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO was
understandable and, in view of what's happening in Ukraine, completely
sensible]{.underline}. On emerging from behind the Iron Curtain three
decades ago, these countries didn't have the luxury to wait and see
whether their former overlord would first develop into a peace-loving,
democratic neighbor. That the Russian establishment even before Putin
was opposed to NATO expansion is also understandable, given Russia's
past domination over Central and Eastern Europe. The irony is that NATO
membership for the region's small, insecure nations made Russia's
western border the most stable it has ever been. Although Putin
fulminated about U.S. missile defense installations in Romania and
Poland, it was unclear how they were supposed to neutralize Russia's
vast nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world. In fact[, before Russia
launched its first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the United States was
drawing down its military presence in Europe and attempting to pivot to
Asia. The case of Ukraine is the most egregious example of how Russia's
postimperial phantom pains have clouded the Kremlin's strategic
thinking]{.underline}. Ukraine, with its close cultural, linguistic,
economic, and religious ties to Russia, should have been a natural ally.
While most Ukrainians were proud of their distinct identity, they were
generally well-disposed toward Russia and deeply ambivalent about NATO
before 2014. The Alliance itself was divided over Ukraine's membership
precisely because of the country's deep connections to Russia. Even as
Putin's attack on Ukraine eight years ago spurred the United States,
Britain, Canada, and Germany to send troops to NATO allies in Eastern
Europe, it did not solidify support for Ukrainian membership within the
Alliance. When Putin ordered a full-scale invasion in February, Ukraine
was not significantly closer to joining NATO than it had been in 2008,
when the issue was hotly debated, together with Putin, at the annual
NATO summit. What has changed since 2014 is that a majority of
Ukrainians support NATO membership and have no doubts that Russia has
become their mortal enemy. As for NATO, member states such as the United
States and Britain began arming and training the Ukrainian military.
[Putin's fears of an increased U.S. presence in Ukraine---and Eastern
Europe more broadly---became a self-fulfilling prophesy. The
reputational damage to Russia that Putin's belligerence has caused is
staggering. Finland and Sweden are considering NATO membership, and even
Switzerland has ended its traditional neutrality and adopted EU
sanctions against Russia. Germany, once Russia's most faithful partner
in Western Europe, is determined to stop relying on Siberian natural
gas, ending an energy relationship that began during the Cold War. Trust
and economic synergies that took decades to build have been sacrificed
for Putin's delusional war. The Kremlin may retort that it has friends
in other parts of the world. But even in the United Nations, Russia has
been ostracized, with a large majority of countries calling on Moscow to
end its offensive in Ukraine. Putin received explicit support only from
Belarus, Syria, Eritrea, and North Korea, with China and India
abstaining. The isolation of Putin's Russia is linked to the country's
inability to articulate an attractive message about what it stands for
beyond being the self-proclaimed antipode to the United
States.]{.underline} At least during the Cold War, the Soviet Union was
the bearer of a powerful ideology that found adherents around the world.
During his two decades in power, Putin has squandered the possibilities
of Russian soft power. With a tiny fraction of Russia's oil windfall, he
could have established a global network of institutes, like Germany's
Goethe-Institut or Spain's Instituto Cervantes, to tap into widespread
interest in Russian culture. Instead he focused on Russian hard power,
turning the Soviet Union's victory in World War II into the regime's
ideological foundation. The untold human sacrifice in World War II was
the source of the Soviet Union's legitimacy as a UN Security Council
member and worthy rival to the United States. [With his unprovoked war
against Ukraine, Putin has surrendered the last piece of moral high
ground Russia, as the successor state of the Soviet Union, held as a
leading member of the coalition that defeated Hitler. Putin's savage
attack on Ukraine will taint and overshadow the memory of Russian
heroism in World War II for generations to come.]{.underline} In May
2005, leaders from more than fifty countries, including the United
States and Ukraine, attended the Victory Day celebrations marking the
sixtieth anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat. The number of foreign
guests has since decreased inversely to Putin's mounting aggression.
Last year, only the leader of Tajikistan paid Putin the honor of
attending his parade. This May 9, in a striking symbol of Russia's
isolation, no foreign guests came at all.

"[Turkey is a NATO ally and will remain one. The war between our two
partners Russia and Ukraine has created a new understanding in favor of
strengthening procurement ties with our NATO allies," a presidential
aide told Defense News, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss
Ankara's diplomatic tightrope walk]{.underline}. The war has once again
put Turkey in a pivotal broker position within NATO. Ankara has
cultivated ties with both Russia and Ukraine that officials hope will
provide dividends in future negotiations. Turkey's approval is also
needed to advance Sweden's and Finland's respective NATO membership
applications, which grew out of their fear that Russia would work to
permanently isolate them from the alliance. But there is some history to
overcome. In 2020, Turkey paid \$2.5 billion for the Russian S-400 air
defense system. But fearing further isolation and sanctions from its
allies, Turkey decided against making the system operational. In
response to the acquisition, the U.S. suspended Turkey's membership in
the multinational consortium that builds the fifth-generation F-35
fighter jet. Turkey's down payment of \$1.5 billion for a first batch of
the stealth aircraft, which Ankara never received, remains to be
reimbursed. In March of this year, a senior Turkish diplomat who deals
with NATO and security affairs told Defense News that the
Russo-Ukrainian war has practically killed all potential Turkish-Russian
deals related to strategic weapon systems. [With Russia off the table as
a military supplier, Turkish leaders are back to surveying the Western
market]{.underline}. A senior Turkish procurement official said earlier
this spring that the Eurofighter Typhoon is one option, involving the
sale of about 80 aircraft --- a purchase that would give Turkish
industry an edge as it builds the country's indigenous fighter jet in
the making, the TF-X. The Typhoon was originally designed as an air
superiority fighter. It is manufactured by a consortium made up of
Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo, which conducts the majority of the
aircraft project through a joint holding company, Eurofighter
Jagdflugzeug GmbH. The NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency,
representing the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain, manages the project and
is the prime customer. Turkey also has moved to acquire 40 F-16 Block 70
aircraft and upgrade kits for its 80 older F-16s. The Turkish request
went to Congress in April. Earlier in May, the Biden administration
asked the House of Representatives to approve the upgrade of Turkey's
F-16 fighter jet fleet. A potential deal may include high-tech missiles,
radar systems and electronic warfare suites for the planes. In addition,
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n expressed hope in March that the
trilateral talks between Turkey, France and Italy to co-produce the
European air and anti-missile defense system SAMP/T, built by Eurosam,
would resume after the French elections in April. In similar optimism,
Foreign Minister Mevl칲t 칂avu릂륿u said in late March that Italy and
France were thinking "more seriously" now on co-producing the SAMP/T
systems in Turkey. [Meanwhile, Britain took steps to ease Turkey's
return to the Western procurement system. Turkish Deputy Foreign
Minister Faruk Kaymakc캼 said in February that Britain had lifted a ban
on arms sales to Turkey, imposed after a unilateral Turkish offensive in
northern Syria in 2019. The ease in trade restrictions was kept secret
from the public, and some observers say Canada might follow
suit]{.underline}. But most Western restrictions remain in effect. For
instance, the Czech Republic, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain
and Sweden imposed full arms embargoes on Turkey since 2019 over its
military interventions in Syria. France has placed restrictions on an
array of defense and aviation subsystems, and Italy has barred the sale
of certain products. Germany has suspended plans to sell engines to
power the Altay, Turkey's first indigenous main battle tank in the
making. "[Turkey's careful balancing act between its NATO allies and
Russia has generally been recognized in the West, sometimes with much
praise. How Turkey will maneuver between clashing Western and Russian
interests in the near future will shape Western appetite for Turkey's
return to their procurement system]{.underline}," said Ozgur Eksi, a
defense analyst in Ankara. Some Western diplomats think Erdo르n may try
to use Turkey's veto power in NATO for a reset in procurement ties with
the West. He said May 13 that his country is "not favorable" toward
Finland and Sweden joining the alliance, indicating Turkey could use its
membership to veto moves to admit the two countries. The issue was
unresolved at press time. "The Turks appear to be preparing for a tough
bargaining process, which may include the transfer of certain weapons
system," said a U.S. diplomat in Ankara. Russia's aggression in Ukraine
prompted Finland and Sweden to reconsider their traditions of military
nonalignment. Eksi said that because of the war in Ukraine, Turkey would
unlikely consider touching major arms deal with Russia that were
previously on the table. "That includes any Turkish intention to buy the
Russian-made Su-35 or Su-57 aircraft," he said. Erdo르n has previously
said Turkey was interested in buying the Russian-made fighter jets.

This week at their Madrid summit, NATO allies formally invited Finland
and Sweden to join the Alliance. [It was the latest step in a whirlwind
process initiated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and **delayed by
Turkey**---home to the second-largest military in the Alliance, after
the United States---which argued that the Nordic countries did not
sufficiently address Turkey's national-security concerns.]{.underline}
After weeks of tough negotiations, Turkey, Finland, and Sweden agreed to
a breakthrough trilateral declaration on Tuesday. Atlantic Council IN
TURKEY asked experts for their take on the implications of the summit
and the trilateral declaration. Jump to an expert reaction Mehmet Fatih
Ceylan: [A victory for NATO unity and cohesion Ian Brzezinski: **Erdogan
recognizes NATO brings far more geopolitical value than
Russia**]{.underline} Rich Outzen: The summit brings Turkey's security
concerns to the fore **[A victory for NATO unity and
cohesion]{.underline}** The ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine since
2014 has entirely changed the security landscape, not only in the
Euro-Atlantic area, but globally. It has fundamentally altered threat
perceptions beyond the Alliance, leading Finland and Sweden to
officially apply for membership in NATO. These two countries have indeed
crossed the Rubicon and deserted their neutrality in response to
persistent Russian belligerence in the middle of Europe. Their decision
to combine their efforts and assets with the Alliance against Russian
aggression is natural and legitimate. Hence the need to incorporate
Finland and Sweden into the Alliance family. The trilateral memorandum
signed among Turkey, Finland, and Sweden on June 28 is a welcome
development designed to demonstrate NATO's solidarity and unity, and
further strengthen the Alliance. [It is commonplace in NATO to consult
on and negotiate over any dispute among allies and would-be allies to
find a common ground. That is how NATO plays its role, and at the end a
solution accommodating such concerns is found by consensus.]{.underline}
It is also true that once new members accede to NATO, they are bound by
the decisions previously taken by the Alliance on a wide range of
subjects. In NATO there exists a robust set of decisions and practices
in fighting terrorism, beginning with the intervention in Afghanistan.
Therefore, there is already an agreement comprising all sorts of
conceptual work and practices in different geographical theaters on
combatting terrorism, developed within NATO and binding on all members.
[The newly adopted **Strategic Concept (SC) clearly** **identifies
Russia** and "terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations" as the
primary sources of threats]{.underline} in a 360-degree manner and
across all three core tasks of NATO: collective deterrence and defense,
crisis prevention and management, and cooperative security. Given that
terrorism is "the most direct asymmetric threat to the security of our
citizens and to international peace and prosperity," as defined in the
SC, it makes sense both for Finland and Sweden to cooperate with Turkey
in combatting terrorism as one of the primary sources of threats against
Alliance interests. In a nutshell, collective deterrence and defense
against actual and potential adversaries, nipping crises in the bud, and
expanding the web of networks with partners under challenging
circumstances are the main tasks of NATO in the next decade. The main
center of gravity for NATO is its solidarity, unity, and cohesion,
including all allies and those set to become allies. The summit
decisions in their entirety will help NATO to navigate the troubled
waters ahead over the long term. ---Mehmet Fatih Ceylan is the president
of Ankara Policy Center and previously served as permanent
representative of Turkey to NATO. [Erdogan recognizes NATO brings far
more geopolitical value than Russia At their summit in Madrid, NATO
leaders decided to "invite Finland and Sweden to become members of NATO,
and agreed to sign the accession protocols."]{.underline} This was an
important breakthrough. Until now, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan had held up the protocols on the grounds that the two Nordic
nations had embargoed his nation from defense sales and refused to
extradite alleged Kurdish terrorists. Consensus was facilitated by a
meeting between US President Joe Biden and Erdogan---a bilateral long
sought by the Turkish leader---and memorialized via a trilateral
Turkey-Sweden-Finland memorandum in which the latter two agreed to lift
the embargoes, condemn the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) as a terrorist
organization, "address" Turkey's pending extradition requests, and
support Turkey's involvement in European Union defense initiatives. The
breakthrough underscored the influence and leadership of the United
States in NATO. There is no way Erdogan would have lifted his veto
solely due to European pressure. [It also reflects Erdogan's recognition
that NATO brings Turkey far more geopolitical value than Russia, which
would savor seeing this Nordic bid for NATO membership fail. Consensus
on Finland and Sweden's applications also demonstrated **the Alliance's
unity in the face of Russia's aggression** and the difficulty Moscow
still has when it comes to fully peeling Erdogan away from the
transatlantic community.]{.underline} Once again, Putin's strongest
relationship in the Black Sea region has proven to be far more
transactional than strategic. With that said, Turkey, like all the other
NATO allies, still has to ratify these accession protocols. There
remains ample opportunity for Erdogan to introduce additional
negotiations with the rest of NATO. I am optimistic that Sweden and
Finland will become NATO members, but it is still too early to say this
round of NATO enlargement is a done deal. ---Ian Brzezinski is a senior
fellow at the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security and previously served as US deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Europe and NATO policy. The summit brings Turkey's security
concerns to the fore **[The summit was a great success for
Ankara]{.underline}** for three distinct reasons. The first is the
content of the trilateral memorandum signed with Sweden and Finland: No
arms embargo on Turkey, an affirmed commitment to address Turkish
security concerns, no aid to the PKK or (significantly) the Kurdish
People's Defense Units (YPG), the Gulen movement mentioned as a terror
concern, collaboration on the defense industry, working groups to
follow---it's hard to see what they missed. Of course, these are
statements of principle, and execution or a final commitment will play
out over time. But that is as true for Ankara approving accession as it
is for the specified cooperation. The second reason is the ringing
endorsement from the White House not only for the trilateral memorandum,
but for the strengthening of Turkish air power and specifically a
commitment to press Congress to approve F-16 fighter jet sales and
upgrades. Notably, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has already weighed in
with a strong endorsement of the deal. The in-person meeting of
presidents Biden and Erdogan was notable, too. The third reason is more
subtle: the inclusion in the new, slimmed-down Strategic Concept of
language on countering terrorism "in all its forms and manifestations."
[This language, and the prominence given both terror concerns and the
Russian military threat, address Turkish concerns and highlight **the
value Turkey adds to the Alliance.**]{.underline}

### 2AC -- UQ -- Turkey-NATO Coop Now

#### Turkey and NATO have a common interest in stopping enemy encroachment--that serves as a motivator within the alliance

Turkey's location near several global hotspots has made the continuing
availability of its territory for the stationing and transport of arms,
cargo, and personnel valuable for the United States and NATO. [In
addition to Incirlik Air Base near the southern Turkish city of Adana,
other key U.S./NATO sites include an early warning missile defense radar
in eastern Turkey and a NATO ground forces command in Izmir]{.underline}
(see Figure A-3). From Turkey's perspective, [**NATO's traditional
importance has been to mitigate Turkish concerns** about encroachment by
neighbors, as was the case with the Soviet Union's aggressive post-World
War II posturing.]{.underline} Some similar Turkish concerns---though
somewhat less pronounced---may stem from Russia's ongoing regional
involvement in places such as Syria and Ukraine, and may partly motivate
recent Turkish military operations to frustrate some Russian objectives
in various conflict arenas.86 As a result of growing tensions between
Turkey and Western countries, and questions about the safety and utility
of Turkish territory for U.S. and NATO assets, some observers have
advocated exploring alternative basing arrangements in the region.87
Some reports suggest that expanded or potentially expanded U.S. military
presences in places such as Greece, Cyprus, Jordan and Romania might be
connected with concerns about Turkey.88 Additionally, Turkish actions in
opposition to the interests of other U.S. allies and partners in the
Eastern Mediterranean (see "Cyprus, Greece, and Eastern Mediterranean
Natural Gas" below)--- particularly over the past two years---have led
U.S. officials to encourage cooperation among those allies and
partners.89 In 2020, the Trump Administration waived restrictions on the
U.S. sale of non-lethal defense articles and services to the Republic of
Cyprus, effectively ending a U.S. arms embargo that had dated back to
1987, and attracting criticism from Turkish officials.90 [Turkey's
influence in the Black Sea littoral region and its relationships with
European countries bordering Russia make **its actions in this sphere
important for U.S. interests**.]{.underline} Ongoing Turkish defense
cooperation with or arms sales to Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, and
Azerbaijan may present opportunities to make renewed common cause
between the United States and Turkey to counter Russia.91 Alternatively,
Turkey's interactions with these other countries could possibly check
both U.S. and Russian ambitions, or increase regional tensions
potentially leading toward conflict.92 A case in point will be how
Turkey regulates and controls other countries' maritime access to and
from the Black Sea---a limited privilege granted to Turkey in the
Montreux Convention of 1936 (with provisions to give Turkey greater
control when at war).93

Turks are rightly proud of the success of Bayraktar drones in the
conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine has also celebrated the success of
Bayraktar drones against Russian armour, particularly in turning the
tide in the first few weeks in the Battle of Kyiv -- with songs even
produced and sung by Ukrainians soldiers to acclaim the battlefield
changing nature of this high-end Turkish technology. [Turks like to view
this as a great example of the country's **new-found technological and
military prowess**, but also their willingness to show support for
Ukraine despite obvious risks to damaging valuable relations with
Russia. Ukrainians are, though, beginning to **doubt Turkey's commitment
to their cause**,]{.underline} notwithstanding the undoubted success of
Bayraktar. [Turkey's stance on peace talks]{.underline} in Antalya in
March and again over trying to broker a deal to break the grain blockade
of Ukrainian ports [has **left a distinct impression in Kyiv that Ankara
is too keen to toe the Russian line** and force a Russian friendly peace
deal down their throats.]{.underline} In Antalya [the Turkish side were
confident a deal was to be done, and even sold a deal as in the offing,
but this **seemed to be close to terms being offered by
Moscow**]{.underline}, with little effort to accept or even understand
the Ukrainian position. Predictably the Antalya peace process eventually
collapsed. The fact that Ankara seems tone deaf to Ukraine's position
was also evident on talks on-going over breaking the grain blockade,
with Ankara negotiating directly with Moscow and seemingly little effort
being made to involve the Ukrainian side -- even though any plan
involves decisions about unblocking Ukrainian ports. On the ports issue,
[Turkey seemed unable to comprehend the Ukrainian position that getting
agreement to de-mine ports was worthless unless there were also security
guarantees to ensure that Russian forces did not use this as an
opportunity]{.underline} to launch amphibious landings against Odesa,
Mikolaiv, et al. Turkey appeared na칦ve in both the Antalya talks and the
talks over ending the grain blockade. The Turkish side appeared to be
adopting a peace deal at any (to Ukraine) cost strategy, but with zero
effort to understand the Ukrainian position. But key to understanding
the Turkish position on the war in Ukraine, and its seemingly blinkered
effort to bring peace at almost any cost (to Ukraine), is that [the
Erdogan administration views all of this through **its very narrow
electoral lens**.]{.underline} And therein it faces difficult elections
within the next year, with opinion polls not looking good for either
Erdogan or his ruling AKP, while the economy is in a desperately weak
position. [A degree of desperation and wishful thinking is hence evident
in Turkey's approach to the war in Ukraine.]{.underline} On the latter,
[over the past decade, under Erdogan's failed monetary policy mantra
that "high interest rates cause inflation," the economy has been in an
almost constant state of balance of payments crisis. Erdogan continually
prioritises growth over inflation and exchange rate
stability]{.underline}, as in the past credit growth has delivered real
GDP growth, jobs and votes. But this has meant the economy has been run
too hot, the price of which has been wide current account deficits,
large external financing requirements and constant pressure on the lira
to weaken. An orthodox response would be to tighten monetary and/or
fiscal policy to slow domestic demand, lower import demand and with it
the trade and current account deficits, thereby alleviating pressure on
the lira. But Erdogan's interest rate ideology has removed this option
for the CBRT, meaning that the lira has had to take the strain, which
has in turn fuelled inflation. Turks are unhappy with inflation and a
constantly weakening lira. They feel poorer, which explains Erdogan's
lowly popularity. But [**Erdogan still thinks he can win the election**
by pulling a few more rabbits out of the hat]{.underline} -- including
the recent exchange rate protected deposit scheme, and more recently
restrictions on corporates borrowing in lira if they have large FX
deposits. Erdogan thinks that this can buy him some time, helping slow
dollarisation, anchor the lira enough for him to push the growth agenda
just one more time to win the next election. In normal times it would be
touch and go whether this strategy could hold things stable enough to
get through to elections by June 2023 and deliver Erdogan a win. But
[the war in Ukraine has just made the maths here even more difficult --
higher energy and food import costs and the threat of the loss of key
Ukrainian and Russian tourism receipts (one quarter of the total) are
pushing the current account deficit wider and putting even more pressure
on the lira.]{.underline} Erdogan needs this war to end and soon,
otherwise he risks getting rolled over in an extreme balance of payments
crisis which would scupper any remaining popularity he has. So, Erdogan
has been happy to allow Bayraktar drones to go to Ukraine -- they
advertise Turkish engineering prowess and generate important export
earnings. But beyond that Turkey has done little to help Ukraine's
cause. And, as noted, if anything the Antalya peace talks and the talks
over unblocking grain deliveries from Ukraine have undermined Kyiv's
position. Turkey has also failed to join Western sanctions on Russia --
arguing that it simply cannot afford to, given its challenging balance
of payments position. **[If relations with the West were better, it
might have hoped for financial support to offset losses from sanctions
and the war in Ukraine.]{.underline}** But this option is constrained by
broader Western concern about policy choices made by Erdogan, including
over monetary policy. Some close to the Erdogan administration have even
argued that Turkey could benefit from sanctions by acting as a
middle-man similar to its position on Iranian sanctions. Some think that
Turkey could benefit as Russian companies look to reflag to avoid
sanctions, as Russian capital and business look to exit and evade
sanctions, and also by being a conduit for Russian capital -- tourism,
the latter being the scenario where Russians seek to holiday in Turkey
but using this as an opportunity to park capital by opening Turkish bank
accounts and buying property. To some extent facilitating capital flight
from Russia is a benefit for the West in heaping the economic pressure
on Russia, but there is a fine dividing line for Turkey here from being
seen to profit from the conflict, and concern that some of the activity
might be on the edge of actual sanctions breaking. A recent visit by US
Treasury officials to Turkey likely was meant to draw clear lines as to
what is and is not acceptable. And then there is the whole furore around
Turkey's stalling on Finland and Sweden's bid to join Nato. As Nato
allies have highlighted, [Turkey does have understandable security
concerns over Scandinavian support for various Kurdish groups. It has
leverage now to force Sweden and Finland to rein these in. And playing
hardball on this issue **will play very well with the domestic
nationalist constituency** in Turkey before elections.]{.underline}
It\'s potentially a win-win for Turkey. But the risk is that Erdogan
overplays his hand and permanently damages relations with the West. He
needs to realise that for the US and the rest of its Nato allies, Russia
is the priority and is seen as a clear and present danger, and an
existential threat to Ukraine and the West. Finnish and Swedish Nato
entry is a huge win for the West, for Ukraine, and a major snub to
Putin. If Erdogan now blocks this at the Nato summit in Madrid later
this month, relations with the West will, I think, be permanently
soured. And likely the West will adopt an openly hostile, as opposed to
largely neutral, approach to Erdogan's re-election by June 2023.
Blocking Swedish and Finnish membership would also stall rising hopes of
a deal over Turkey's compensation for leaving the F35 project, through
purchase of additional F16s and upgrade kits. This would damage Turkey's
defence capability. Now [playing hardball to the end of this could turn
the next election in Erdogan's favour, and I think he will have to
balance this off against the risk of a major balance of payments crisis
if he plays hardball too long]{.underline}. And with the West angered,
he would have few tools to allay any such BOP crisis -- he does not want
to hike policy rates or go to the IMF, capital controls are
counterproductive and will damage business, the CBRT has limited
reserves and FX adjustment just leads to more inflation. If he faces a
BOP crisis after vetoing Finnish and Swedish Nato membership, I think
the West would stand on the sidelines as a full balance of payments
crisis washes over Erdogan. And likely Erdogan would lose the next
election. Logic would suggest that Erdogan would play very hardball to
the Madrid summit -- get deals over Kurdish groups in Sweden and
Finland, easing of arms sanctions, and new agreements over new arms
purchases like the F16. He can tell electors at home that he played
hardball and won concessions. He will hope the West is grateful enough
to keep capital markets open to allow him to finance his external
borrowing needs. All this feels pretty binary. But I think in all this,
[Erdogan needs to realise that for the West **the crisis in Ukraine is a
defining moment**]{.underline}, a definitive challenge they face, and
it's a time to ask if allies are with the West or against it. [Erdogan
**has tried staying on the fence**, to some extent trying to play one
side off against the other.]{.underline} I think time for such an
approach is fast running out. Madrid will likely be the moment when
Erdogan has to decide whose side he is on. An important week is in store
for Nato and Turkey.

[**The Turkish government has designated the Russian invasion as a
"war,"** giving it the right under the 1936 Montreux Convention to close
the Bosporus Strait---which leads to the Black Sea---to
warships.]{.underline} Although this action applies to any naval vessel,
it is clearly aimed at Russia's fleet in case Moscow seeks to reinforce
the firepower it already has there. [Turkey's decision is, at least, an
important symbolic one **in support of Ukraine.**]{.underline} A Russian
submarine surfaces in the Bosporus with Istanbul in the background A
Russian submarine sails in the Bosporus on its way to the Black Sea.
Despite the restrictions on warships in the Bosporus, it seems clear
that Turkey---like other countries including Israel---has sought a
strategically defensible but morally questionable middle ground. Though
[Turkey voted for a UN General Assembly resolution condemning
Russia]{.underline}, it has not sanctioned Russia or closed its airspace
to Russian aircraft. Some observers have been quick to highlight the
differences between Turkish policy and the definitive pro-Ukraine
approaches of the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), implying that [Ankara is trying to have it both
ways---remaining rhetorically committed to Ukraine's independence and
offering to mediate the conflict while tilting toward Russia. There is
some logic to this, especially after the purchase of the Russian-made
air defense system known as the S-400. However, it is less a tilt than a
recognition that **Turkey's interests are intertwined with Russia in
critical areas**, most importantly Syria.]{.underline} There, Turkey
wants to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish state and maintain pressure
on the People's Protection Units (YPG), a group linked to the Kurdistan
Workers' Party (PKK), which the United States and Turkey have designated
a terrorist organization. To accomplish these goals, Turkish officials
have to consider Russian sensibilities, as Moscow is the most important
external actor in Syria and can thus complicate Turkey's military
operations there and frustrate its diplomatic efforts. In recent years,
Turkey has pursued what can best be described as foreign policy
independence. As an important power in the Mediterranean, the Middle
East, and the Caucusus, Ankara has sought a multifaceted foreign policy
that has, at times, conflicted with its NATO allies. For example, in
2017, Turkey decided to purchase S-400s. This step coincided with a
growing dialogue between Ankara and Moscow that included moves to
upgrade economic ties and discussions about deepening diplomatic and
even military relations. At the same time, Turkey and Russia have found
themselves on opposite ends of major regional conflicts, including in
Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh, a region over which Armenia and
Azerbaijan fought a recent war. Even while they were supporting
different sides in these places, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
and Russian President Vladimir Putin maintained a dialogue. What about
Ukraine? [**Turkey has generally supported Ukrainian independence and
the country's territorial integrity.** Erdogan denounced Russia's 2014
annexation of Crimea and has advocated on behalf of Crimean Tatars (a
Turkic ethnic group) who have suffered under Russian rule. Turkey sold
armed drones to Ukraine ahead of Russia's most recent invasion, though
some reports indicate that only about twelve to twenty were
delivered.]{.underline} Still, in whatever number, Turkish Bayraktar TB2
drones are lethal and have been deployed to great effect in Libya,
Syria, and Nagorno-Karabakh. How is this war likely to affect Turkey's
interests in the region? [**Turkey has sought to expand its trade and
commercial relations with**]{.underline} both Russia and
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. It is also a destination for Russian tourists
and an importer of oil and gas. To the extent that this war affects
these ties and drives up energy prices, the Turkish economy---which is
already experiencing upwards of 50 percent inflation---will feel the
repercussions.

### 2AC -- No Link--NATO Over Russia

#### Even *if* Turkey and Russia [are]{.underline} tied together, Russia will [never]{.underline} replace NATO in Turkey's eyes

Bardak칞캼 21 (Mehmet Bardak칞캼, 12-6-21, "Is a Strategic Partnership
Between Turkey and Russia Feasible at the Expense of Turkey's Relations

The article mainly contends that since the real and expected benefits
from the European Union (EU) and NATO were not delivered sufficiently
from Turkey's perspective, Turkey looked for alternatives and
collaborated with Russia more intensely in recent years. Turkey's
cooperation with Russia was also facilitated by several global,
political, economic, conjectural, security-related, and individual-level
factors. Another argument of the study is that [despite Turkey's
intensive collaboration with Russia**, it is not feasible for Turkey to
build a strategic partnership with it in the short- and medium-term at
the expense of its relations with NATO** and the EU.]{.underline} The
main reasons for this are, in addition to the institutional and social
shortcomings, geostrategic divergences, [Russia's inadequacy as an
economic actor, the pitfalls of an asymmetric relationship with Russia,
the security risks posed by Russia, NATO's continuing importance for
Turkey's security needs, and the incompatibility of Russia's and
Turkey's political systems.]{.underline} Keywords: EU; NATO; Russia;
strategic partnership; Turkish foreign policy Introduction The arrival
of the Russian S-400 air defence system in Turkey in July 2019 was
welcomed enthusiastically by many in Turkey. This breakthrough event was
even described by some in Turkey as the "country's liberation from the
West" (Tol and Ta릃캼nar 2019, 107). Almost a decade ago, the question
started to be asked as to whether Turkey was drifting away from the
West, especially since it had approached Iran and voted against
sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme in the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) as well as clashed with Israel over the Mavi
Marmara incident in 2010. This time, however, this question is more
pronounced and the likelihood of a strategic shift became more tangible
with the arrival of a weapon system from a country that has been
confronting the West recently. Given that Turkey's relations with the
United States and the European Union (EU) have been at a nadir in recent
years, many regarded the acquisition of the Russian weapon system as a
precursor of Turkey's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Alliance (North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO) and the EU. In addition to many
other factors, Moscow's and Ankara's bitter relations with the West are
a major reason why the two countries have closed ranks in recent years.
A milestone for Moscow's relationship with the West was its annexation
of Crimea in March 2014 while the coup plot against the Justice and
Development Party (Adalet ve Kalk캼nma Partisi, AKP) government in Turkey
in July 2016 marked a watershed in Ankara's relations with the West.
Russia had to confront a series of economic sanctions from the West
after 2014 while Turkey was deeply disappointed with its Western allies
for their slow and reluctant condemnation of the coup attempt. Ankara
has even aired doubts that the West might have been behind the coup
attempt. These events have helped peak the two countries'
deeply-ingrained sense of distrust towards the West. As one observer
put, "Despite their obvious differences and even antagonisms, Russia and
Turkey are united by one thing---the fact that they are two great powers
connected historically, culturally, and geographically to a Europe that
never fully accepted them as one of their own" (Lukyanov, People with
Big Ambitions, The Moscow Times, 19 July 2016). A major objective of
this article is to unpack the puzzle of whether Russia could replace the
EU and NATO as a strategic partner for Turkey. The article contends that
in addition to some factors facilitating the Russo--Turkish
rapprochement, Turkey searched for alternatives, collaborating with
Russia owing to the decline in the real and expected benefits from the
EU and NATO from the Turkish perspective. Another major contention of
this article is that despite the close collaboration between Moscow and
Ankara, in particular after the coup attempt against the Turkish
Government in July 2016, [**it is hard for Turkey to forge a strategic
partnership with Russia** because of significant divergent geostrategic
interests, Russia's inadequacy as an economic actor, the downsides of an
asymmetric relationship with Russia, the security risks posed by Russia,
the continuing importance of NATO for Turkey's security as well as the
incompatibility of Turkey's and Russia's political systems. Moreover,
**the absence of a solid social basis and the lack of
institutionalization in their relations further make it infeasible for
Turkey to switch** from the Transatlantic Alliance to
Russia.]{.underline} The study is divided into three sections. The first
part concerns the motives that brought Moscow and Ankara together,
including, first and foremost, their strained relationship with the
West, economic interests, conjectural factors such as the Syrian
conflict, transformation of the global governance system, and similarity
of their political culture based on security and personal harmony
between the leaders. [The second part draws attention to the limitations
in the relationship]{.underline}, and the third part explains why [a
strategic partnership between Turkey and Ankara and at the expense of
Turkey's partnership with the EU and NATO **is not feasible in the
foreseeable future.**]{.underline} Finally, the conclusion wraps up the
article.

### 2AC -- No Link--Turkey Does Both

#### Turkey [can]{.underline} work with both sides

**Kusa 6/13** (Iliya Kusa, Iliya Kusa is a Kyiv-based author and analyst
of international relations with the Ukrainian Institute for the Future.
For the past six years he has been writing about Middle East, Ukrainian
foreign policy after 2014, and European politics. A special focus of his

<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/turkeys-goals-russia-ukraine-war>//RM)

Of the many countries struggling to find a proper approach to the
Russia-Ukraine war, Turkey seems to have landed on the most
controversial yet comfortable one. [Ankara has managed to preserve its
relationship with both Moscow and Kyiv without endangering its own
geostrategic calculations in the region while at the same time avoiding
joining ranks with Western countries in imposing crippling sanctions on
Russia. The role of a key mediator, which President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n
was so eager to take on, has allowed Turkey to conveniently position
itself in the middle of the fight---and not just in the conflict between
Russia and Ukraine but more broadly in the struggle between Russia and
the West, and even globally between the West and the numerous
non-Western countries that have preferred to strike a more cautious and
balanced approach to the war.]{.underline} The overall political and
ideological polarization incited by the war in Ukraine has threatened
many countries that have worked for years to build a balanced,
pragmatic, multivector foreign policy. Now many of them find themselves
having to make a hard choice. Western countries under U.S. guidance are
urging them to make common cause against Russia, which often means
abandoning their balancing act between major powers. As the war has
shown, in a highly tense international environment, a posture of
neutrality and balancing on the part of countries struggling not to
choose sides is not welcome by the conflicting parties, which strive to
mobilize support for their own efforts. [Turkey in particular has had to
carve a path that does not lethally threaten relations with either
Russia or the EU.]{.underline} The war in Ukraine has presented Ankara
with both opportunities and risks. After the 2015 centralization of
political power in the hands of Recep Erdo르n, the president moved his
personal ambitions and goals to the forefront of Turkey's foreign
policy. In particular, he has sought to make Turkey a regional Muslim
superpower capable of designing and guiding a new "post-Western"
security architecture in greater Eurasia and one of the first
non-Western powers to shape the new multipolar world order. [To preserve
this course, Turkey has had to find an appropriate way to deal with the
Ukraine challenge. In essence, two global objectives became a priority
for Turkey when Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24: to preserve its
global and regional positions, which Turkey has managed to consolidate
and enhance after 2016; as well as to reinforce Ankara's influence and
amplify earlier achievements to ensure further expansion.]{.underline}
Objective 1: Preserving Turkey's Global and Regional Positions The first
global objective is reflected in several developments that became
essential in Ankara's quest to hold its ground. First, the war in
Ukraine has threatened Turkey's pragmatic multipolar approach
underpinning its foreign policy. The political coalescence of NATO and
EU countries against Russia could not have escaped Turkey's attention.
Nor could Ankara remain on the sidelines and refrain from getting
involved, given its close ties with several Western countries and its
NATO commitments. On the other hand, Turkey did not want to degrade its
relations with Russia by joining the Western-led sanctions, in which
Ankara has declined to participate since 2014. For Turkey, Russia has
been an important trading partner (\$32.5 billion as of 2021), a key
source of foreign investment (more than \$10 billion), a colossal source
of tourists (Russians account for almost 5 million visits, or 1 percent
of all foreign tourist visitation), a crucial energy supplier, and an
important "frenemy" in several regional playgrounds where Turkey (though
not without Russia) has been able to actually accomplish something, such
as in Syria, Libya, and Nagorno-Karabakh. [Turkey has been able to
maintain relations with Russia and the West, thereby sustaining its
desired global position, by assuming the role of a key mediator between
Russia and Ukraine. This formal role gives Ankara a good reason not to
get involved in sanctioning Moscow.]{.underline} Second, the war in
Ukraine, with its subsequent social, economic, political, and
transnational repercussions, has endangered stability on a number of
regional issues that are vital for Turkey's security, reputation, and
international self-reliance. For years, Turkey's regional policy was
built on a situational partnership with Moscow. The possible weakening
of Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine could throw the regional
balance in the South Caucasus, the Black Sea region, and the Levant into
disarray, strengthening, for instance, Iran in Syria---and Iran is one
of Turkey's less preferred competitors. Regional destabilization is not
in Ankara's interests, especially in light of the substantial financial
and economic difficulties Turkey has been struggling with since last
autumn. Objective 2: Reinforcing Ankara's Influence The second global
objective has to do with furthering Turkey's political, economic, trade,
and geopolitical expansion. By shaping the dynamics of the current
crisis, Turkey is trying to "ride the tide" and use it to its advantage.
Its tactics to achieve this goal include taking the place of Western
companies on the Russian market, accruing tourist and financial flows
from Russia, thereby bypassing sanctions, and gaining political ground
in regional affairs by taking on a mediation role, forcing the
conflicting parties to consult with and through Ankara on issues of war,
peace, maritime trade, the demining of the Black Sea, and the
restoration of essential Ukrainian wheat exports. In addition, many
Russians, fearing Western sanctions, have moved to Turkey, investing
millions in the local real estate market and registering businesses
there, which is also a lucrative deal for Ankara. (Ankara offers
citizenship for a \$400,000 investment.) Finally, Turkey sees an
opportunity to achieve its long-sought goal of becoming the major gas
transit hub for Europe. With the European allies determined more than
ever to reduce their dependence on Russian gas imports, Turkey is
offering its services and lobbying for realization of a long-discussed
new subsea pipeline between Israel and Turkey, one that would allow
eastern Mediterranean gas to reach Europe through Turkey. Even more
important for Ankara in this context is exploiting the momentum to
strengthen its own standing in the world. As Western partners search for
support in containing the Russian threat and dealing with an array of
war-related consequences, Ankara sees the time is ripe to make the West
drop sanctions against the Turkish defense industry and embrace Turkey
as an equal partner. It is with this logic in mind that Turkey's
leadership unexpectedly jumped on NATO's expansion process with bold
demands as to what Sweden, Finland, and NATO member states should do to
obtain Ankara's consent. And it is this tactic of getting the most out
of concessions from all parties that drove Erdo르n to announce a new
military operation in northern Syria against the Western-backed Kurds,
thereby endangering the regional positions of both Russia and the United
States. All in all, Ankara's predominant stance on the Russia-Ukraine
war is not about Russia or Ukraine at all. It is about ensuring that any
future postwar settlement in the region and the world will necessarily
include Turkey's interests, and ideally establish Turkey as a
stakeholder in the process. Turkey's serious economic problems, however,
mean these plans may have to be adjusted. The key aspect of the
Russia-Ukraine war for Erdo르n and his government remains not so much
support for Ukraine or Russia as an opportunity for Erdo르n to
strengthen his position on the international stage at the expense of
either country's interests by proactively practicing diplomacy amid the
developing crisis.

### 2AC -- Link Turn --Turkey-West Increasing

#### L/T--Russian revisionism pushes Turkey [towards]{.underline} the West

[While discontent with the West and anti-Westernism have facilitated
cordial and cooperative relations between Moscow and Ankara, **Russian
geopolitical revisionism has almost invariably pushed Turkey closer to
the West.**]{.underline} The logic here is straightforward. First,
[Russian revisionism poses direct security threats to
Turkey.]{.underline} Historically, the centre of gravity of
Turkish-Russian rivalry has been the Black Sea. From the Turkish
perspective, [Russia's actions -- from the war in Georgia to annexation
of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine -- all decisively **tilt the
balance of power** in this region in Russia's favour.]{.underline}
Although Russia's policy in each of these cases might have specifics and
con춼textual nuances, taken together they point to one unmistakable
outcome: Russian revisionism in the post-Soviet space and an aspiration
to turn the region into a sphere of domination. This will only aggravate
the Turkish threat perception vis--vis Moscow. Second, the post-Soviet
space is also Tur춼key's immediate neighbourhood. If success춼ful, the
[Russian policy will restrict Ankara's geopolitical room for manoeuvre
in this region, and undermine its standing from the Black Sea to the
Balkans and the South Caucasus to Central Asia.]{.underline}
Additionally, [**Turk춼ish and Western interests are in broad align춼ment**
in these regions]{.underline}, so Moscow's geo춼political revisionism is
likely to bring Tur춼key and the West relatively closer together.

#### Turkey acts as a [geopolitical powerhouse]{.underline} to defend the Black Sea

**Ellehuus, 19** (Ellehuus, Rachel. "Turkey and NATO: A Relationship
Worth Saving." Turkey and NATO: A Relationship Worth Saving \| Center

\[Rachel Ellehuus is deputy director and senior fellow with the Europe
Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, D.C.//BVN SC\]

Yet these foundational factors remain valid: [Turkey's geopolitical
position at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa still provides
NATO with needed political and operational reach]{.underline}, and
Turkey continues to benefit from the collective military power of NATO.
With the relationship close to (if not at) its nadir, Turkey and NATO,
with the support of the EU, need to take active measures to anchor it
for the future, while avoiding steps that could destroy the relationship
entirely. Assuming that Turkey is in fact interested in rebuilding the
relationship with its NATO allies, there are several active measures
NATO and Turkey can take now to create a foothold for the future[. The
key is to focus on areas of mutual interest where NATO involvement is
critical to Turkish strategic interests and where Turkey has a unique
role to play in NATO. The first of these is the Black Sea, where Turkey,
as well as fellow NATO Black Sea littoral states Romania and Bulgaria,
are trying to balance an increasing Russian military
presence.]{.underline} While previously resistant to a greater NATO role
in the Black Sea for fear it would dilute its own influence in the
region, [Turkey now sees the dangers of leaving Russian influence and
presence in \[the\] Black Sea unchecked.]{.underline} With its illegal
annexation of Crimea in 2014 and entry into the Syrian civil war in
2015, Russia has significantly increased its presence and combat
capabilities in both the Black Sea and Eastern Mediterranean. [NATO now
faces an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble that restricts allies'
freedom of maneuver in the Black Sea, with Russia capable of attacking
from both land and sea. To effectively counter this, NATO should
establish a more continuous presence in the Black Sea]{.underline},
revive the idea of a permanent NATO maritime fleet in the Black Sea, and
consider basing more counter-A2/AD capabilities in Turkey and Romania.
Importantly[, Turkey holds unique power to control access to the Black
Sea]{.underline} thanks to the 1936 Montreux Convention, which governs
naval passage through the Turkish Straits, limiting the number of
foreign vessels that can enter the Black Sea via the Straits and how
long these vessels can stay. This access is important to both Russia and
NATO. Whereas Turkey has proven to be an impartial and reliable enforcer
of the treaty, Russia has pushed the boundaries of Montreux repeatedly
since the Russo-Georgian War in 2008 and, more recently, impeded the
course of NATO vessels that have entered and departed the Black Sea in
compliance with the treaty. More behavior along these lines, or a
Russian attempt to leverage its new, closer relationship with Turkey to
secure more favorable access to the Black Sea, would likely increase
Turkey's unease and lead it to rely more on NATO as a counterbalance.
For its part, the European Union should closely watch Turkey's proposed
construction of the Istanbul Canal to connect the Black Sea to the Sea
of Marmara (and, as such, the Aegean and Mediterranean seas), which is
reportedly drawing interest from Chinese as well as Russian investors.
As the canal would allow ships to sail between the Mediterranean and
Black Sea without transiting the Turkish Straits, and thus abiding by
the restrictions of Montreux, the European Union and United States
should consider investing in this infrastructure project to ensure they
are in a position to work with Turkey to ensure free and fair transit
through the canal.

### 2AC -- Link Turn --Key To ME

#### NATO and Turkey are [key]{.underline} to mitigating Middle Eastern conflict

In comparison with almost every other geographical region, [the Middle
East suffers from a lack of both regional dispute resolution mechanisms
and diplomatic protocols that might reduce the scope for regional
conflict]{.underline}. While the Cold War was defined by the antagonism
between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, both sides increasingly felt the need
for inclusive institutions and mechanisms to reduce tensions. Every U.S.
president during the Cold War, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George H. W.
Bush, met with his Soviet counterpart. During the tensest moments,
high-level U.S.-Soviet channels of communications were especially
important. Over time, a number of confidence-building institutions and
transparency-enhancing measures were created, including the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), successive arms control
agreements, and later the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows for unarmed
surveillance flights over signatory countries to promote military and
nuclear weapons openness. In the Middle East, however, [the absence of
any similar mechanisms or organizations, particularly amid proliferating
military conflicts, feeds security dilemmas across multiple vectors, so
that steps justified by one state as necessary to its
security]{.underline}---military intervention, arms procurement,
alliance formation, and so on---are perceived by its rivals as
threatening. During the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts of the 1990s,
there were attempts to build mechanisms for regional communication and
cooperation. Participants at the 1991 Madrid Conference set up five
multilateral working groups to address regional challenges, each
involving Israel and a range of Arab states. The centerpiece was the
Arms Control and Regional Security (ACRS) working group, which marked
the first bid to create a formal multilateral framework for regional
security issues. Six ACRS plenary sessions, co-hosted by the United
States and Russia, were held and a series of regional
confidence-building measures were outlined before the working group
slowly broke down by 1995 under the weight of regional animosities and
implementation challenges. While all of the working groups have long
been defunct, one tangible result survives: the Middle East Desalination
Research Center in Oman, created in 1995. The center conducts
transboundary water research and development projects, and its
membership includes Israel, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, and Qatar as well
as several Western nations.

But the critics do not stop there. There is the wider accusation of
Turkish unreliability. It should not be forgotten that [Turkey has been
a reliable member of NATO for the past seven decades. It **contributed
significantly to the Alliance's collective defence** and deterrence in
the Cold War.]{.underline} By tying up a large portion of Soviet troops
in its region, it considerably reduced the pressure on Central Europe.
Ironically, the Western European countries were able to build their
Union gradually in a secure and stable environment ensured by NATO, with
Turkey shouldering a heavy military burden. With the end of the Cold
War, alone among the existing allies, Turkey's security situation
worsened. Turkey found itself increasingly exposed in a region of
turmoil engulfed by several armed conflicts. The new and emerging
security risks, including terrorism, have impacted Turkey as much, if
not more, than any other Ally. Turkey feels itself on a new front line.
But throughout this period, [Turkey has **remained an island of
stability in a volatile region.** Even though instability and disorder
are on our doorstep, Turkey has fulfilled all its NATO obligations and
provided security and stability rather than consuming them.]{.underline}
Turkey has stood solid behind every key NATO decision. NATO invoked
Article V of the Treaty for the first time following the 9/11 terrorist
attacks against the U.S. Under the Taliban, Afghanistan had become a
haven for international terrorism. As a staunch ally, [Turkey has
**played a significant role in NATO's stabilization efforts in
Afghanistan.** It has deployed troops and other military assets in
harm's way alongside other allies and partners. Turkey has never
deviated from the NATO policy "in together-adjust together-out
together".]{.underline} Moreover, Turkey's especially close and
long-standing ties with Afghanistan has enabled the Alliance as a whole
to benefit from its knowledge, expertise and political weight in that
country. [Moreover, the fight against ISIS, a serious concern for the
whole world, **would not have been so successful without Turkey**'s
participation and assistance.]{.underline} Turkey has become an
essential partner in this struggle by joining the coalition against
ISIS. It made three air bases, including Incirlik, available for the
Allies, enabling decisively effective military operations. Elsewhere, in
the Balkans and Iraq, Turkey has contributed to NATO's stabilization
efforts. In terms of NATO's priority core task, collective defence,
successive governments in Turkey have never wavered in their commitment
to the Alliance. Turkey's current contribution cannot be overstated. [It
**currently hosts a range of NATO commands and and assets**, essential
to NATO's collective defence, including Allied Land Command (LANDCOM) in
Izmir and the NATO Rapid Deployable Corps (NRDC) in
Istanbul.]{.underline} Significantly, Turkey will be the lead nationin
2021 in command of the 'Spearhead Force' of NATO (VJTF). This force can
be deployed at short notice to any allied country considered under
threat.

aid, reconstruction, and refugee return. More broadly, [both sides also
share an interest in limiting Russian and Iranian influence in the
region.]{.underline} With the Russian military presence in Armenia,
Azerbaijan, and Crimea now supplemented by the Russian naval base at
Tartus, airbases at Kobani and Khmeimim, and helicopter base\[s\] at
Qamishli, Turkey is effectively encircled by Russia. It is in this
context that German minister of defence Kramp-Karrenbauer's suggestion
of [an internationally-controlled security zone along the Turkey-Syria
border, possibly NATO-led]{.underline} and backed by the United Nations
in loose partnership with Russia, makes sense. It [would address a
situation that immediately and directly affects the security of Europe
and Turkey and demonstrate that]{.underline} the **[NATO is invested in
addressing Turkey's security concerns]{.underline}**. Should NATO and
Turkey move to restore some level of trust by taking these first steps,
it will be important to avoid unnecessarily escalating tensions. For
Turkey, this means abiding by the terms of the Syria ceasefire, not
pursuing additional purchases of Russian military equipment, and doing
its part to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State in the region or
return of Islamic State foreign fighters to Europe. For the United
States and Europe, the trick will be to apply the required sanctions and
arms embargoes in a discriminate way. For example, whereas imposing
sanctions in accordance with the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and withholding delivery of Turkey's
F-35s due to its purchase of the Russian S-400 makes good policy sense,
imposing additional blanket sanctions could do more harm than good,
affecting the Turkish people more than their leadership and giving
Erdogan another opportunity to blame the West for Turkey's economic
problems. A smarter approach might involve going after corrupt actors
using the Global Magnitsky Act. Similarly, a total arms embargo by the
United States and the European Union will only drive Turkey to procure
more Russian or non-NATO interoperable military equipment. Rather, the
arms embargoes should be limited along the lines of the most recent
House sanctions bill, which includes exemptions for items to be used in
NATO-approved operations. Finally, as some of Turkey's biggest export
partners, the European Union and the United States can provide needed
carrots along the way to incentivize constructive behavior by Ankara.
[Measures might include an eventual upgrade of Turkey's customs union
with the European Union or limited visa-free travel to EU countries for
Turkish citizens.]{.underline} For the United States, President Trump's
offer of a \$100 billion trade deal will also be attractive to Erdogan
in Turkey's struggling economy. To be sure, repairing the trust that has
been lost and returning Turkey to the path of Western integration will
be a struggle, requiring sustained effort, and a setting aside of egos,
on all sides. Yet on this occasion of NATO's 70th anniversary, Turkey
and its NATO allies owe it to one another to pause for a moment and
reflect not on their many disagreements but on what brought them
together in the first instance and why that still matters.

[**Turkey failed to garner Russian and Iranian backing for a fresh
military intervention against Syrian Kurdish forces** at the meeting of
the Astana platform this week.]{.underline} Senior diplomats from
Turkey, Russia and Iran, the three guarantors of the platform, as well
as representatives of Syria's government and opposition, attended the
June 15-16 meeting in Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan, known previously
as Astana. While the official agenda included topics such as the return
of Syrian refugees, the humanitarian and economic situation in Syria,
the work of the constitutional committee in Geneva and
confidence-boosting measures toward a political settlement, [the **main
issue was Turkish threats** to wrestle control of further territory held
by the Kurds.]{.underline} President Recep Tayyip has openly named Tel
Rifaat and Manbij as targets, vowing to rid them of "terrorists" as part
of a plan to create a safe zone with a depth of 30 kilometers (about 20
miles) along the Turkish border. The groups in Ankara's crosshairs are
the People's Protection Units (YPG), the backbone of the US-backed
Syrian Democratic Forces, and its political wing, the Democratic Union
Party. Ankara equates them with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the
armed outfit designated as a terrorist group over its decades-long
separatist campaign in Turkey. Speaking to reporters ahead of the
meeting, [Alexander Lavrentiev, the Kremlin's special Syria envoy and
head of the Russian delegation, **called Turkey's intervention plan an
"illogical and irrational" prospect that threatens "an escalation of
tension and a new military confrontation in those areas,"** according to
Syrian media. He dismissed speculation that Russia could turn a blind
eye in return for Turkey blocking Sweden's and Finland's accession to
NATO. "There is no such thing. We are not bargaining. We are not giving
up on our allies in the region," he said.]{.underline} Ali Asghar Khaji,
[the head of the Iranian delegation, "underlined that Syria's
territorial integrity and sovereignty are **untouchable**" in a meeting
with the Turkish delegation]{.underline}, according to the Iranian
Foreign Ministry. Meanwhile, Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Ayman
Sousan, who led the Syrian delegation, urged the United Nations "to rein
in \[Erdogan's\] aggressive policies" in a meeting with UN officials,
Syrian media reported. In response, the UN officials cited statements by
the UN secretary-general's spokesperson in support of Syria's
sovereignty and against fresh escalatory moves in the country. In
separate talks with the Russians, Sousan rejected Turkey's pretexts for
attacks on Syrian territory, charging that they were designed "to
achieve its expansionist ideals" and that "the Syrian people are
determined to defend their country \[and\] resist the occupation."
Lavrentiev, for his part, pledged Russia would do its best to prevent
further escalation in Syria. In the final statement, [the parties
denounced "separatist agendas" in Syria in a nod to Turkey's security
concerns and a rebuke of the Kurdish groups leading the de facto
self-rule in the north.]{.underline} They also reaffirmed commitment to
Syria's sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and a political
settlement to the conflict, as they have done in all previous statements
in the past six years. In Turkey's view, its control of significant
chunks of Syrian territory does not contradict that commitment. [The
parties also pledged to work together "to combat terrorism in all forms
and manifestations."]{.underline} The sixth point of the statement
referred to Kurdish-held areas in northeast Syria, saying that lasting
security and stability in the region can only be achieved by preserving
Syria's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The wording matched the
arguments that Russia has put forward against Turkey's attempts to
expand its control in northern Syria. Simply put, [Moscow argues that
the best way to address Ankara's security concerns is to ensure that the
Syrian army returns all the way to the Turkish border as Ankara begins
to cooperate with Damascus and discuss joint measures under the 1998
Adana accord on security cooperation between the two countries. The
communique suggests that **Ankara has toed Moscow's line**, at least on
paper.]{.underline} In the same paragraph, the statement acknowledged
Turkey's concerns, saying that the parties reject "all attempts to
create new realities on the ground, including illegitimate self-rule
initiatives under the pretext of combating terrorism." In a reference to
the United States, the statement denounced "the illegal seizure and
transfer of oil revenues that should belong to Syria" and "the actions
of countries that support terrorist entities including illegitimate
self-rule initiatives in the northeast of Syria." Pledging continued
cooperation to eliminate the Nusra Front, al-Qaeda, the Islamic State
and other UN-designated terrorist groups, the statement expressed
"serious concern" with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which holds sway in Idlib
and with which Turkey has tacitly cooperated on the ground. It stressed
also the need to facilitate the return of refugees and support the
UN-sponsored process of drafting a new constitution for Syria. The text,
released by the Kazakh hosts of the meeting, did not explicitly mention
the YPG or the PKK, but Turkey's state-run Anatolia news agency said the
final communique emphasized Turkey's determination to "fight the PKK/YPG
terrorist organization" and enact "any measures to protect our borders
and prevent attacks on our people and security forces and innocent
Syrian civilians." Russia's denunciation of "separatist agendas" --- a
reference to the Kurds' autonomy drive and partnership with the United
States --- suggests that it is shifting to a position more pleasing to
Turkey. This trend has been tangible in other statements in recent
times. Moscow's temperate policy on the Kurds appears to be wearing out
amid rising Russian-US tensions over Ukraine, opening room for Ankara to
maneuver. According to media reports on the talks, the Turkish side
insisted that the YPG's removal from Tel Rifaat and Manbij was a
commitment that Russia failed to deliver under the 2019 Sochi deal,
while the Russians recalled Turkey's outstanding commitment to eliminate
terrorist groups in Idlib and reopen the M4 motorway. Such exchanges
between Turkey and Russia have recurred time and again as a tactic to
balance or restrain each other. The talks in Nur-Sultan were significant
in terms of clarifying Moscow's attitude on Ankara's intervention
threat, for its initial reactions were softer and more ambivalent
compared to similar tensions in the past, contrasting the firm
objections of Tehran. Some Russian statements even sought to justify
Turkey's security concerns, fueling speculation that Turkish-Russian
bargaining on issues related to NATO and Ukraine might extend to the
conflict in Syria. Nevertheless, [a marked difference was visible
between Russia's rhetoric and its actions on the ground. **Russia took a
number of steps signaling solidarity with the Syrian army**, including
joint military exercises in the south of Idlib on June 10.]{.underline}
In a series of firsts, the Russians installed a Pantsir-S1 anti-aircraft
system at the Hasakah airport in the northeast; deployed tanks, armored
vehicles, anti-aircraft weapons and missiles to the Abkar base in the
same region; and dispatched eight helicopters to the Abu al-Duhur base
in eastern Idlib. Russian planes and helicopters rumbled in the skies of
northeastern cities such as Qamishli, Tel Tamir, Amuda, Darbasiyah and
Ras al-Ayn. The Iranians, meanwhile, deployed reinforcements to the
vicinity of Tel Rifaat and moved Shiite militia from Deir ez-Zor to the
al-Nayrab base to the east of Aleppo. In other words, [**Russia** and
Iran were **naysaying a Turkish intervention** with their actions on the
ground, and any expectation that they would step back in the talks in
Nur-Sultan was unrealistic.]{.underline} Though the final statement
touched prominently on Turkey's concerns, the settlement path it
outlined is dismissive of military intervention.

has developed a new vulnerability in the aftermath of Washington's

foreign-policy priorities around the world. Today, the United States is
increasingly unwilling to intervene decisively abroad---making space for
other actors to scramble in pursuit of their individual agendas, trying
to carve out their own spheres of influence. Nowhere is this more
evident than in Turkey's environs, where [Ankara has sought to
capitalize on]{.underline} these [changes to pursue what amounts to a
**revisionist geopolitical agenda**. Domestically, this about-face has
been buttressed by a move toward Islamic **populism**, **nationalism**,

economic liberalization, pro-Western democracy, and Islamic values that

#### Non-unique--Turkey is mediating between Russia and Ukraine [now]{.underline}

**Kirby 22** (Jen Kirby, Foreign and National Security Reporter, April
1, 2022, "What diplomatic solution might end the war in Ukraine?",
<https://www.vox.com/2022/4/1/23002085/peace-talks-ukraine-russia-war-turkey-neutrality>//RM)

[The war in Ukraine has ground on for five weeks. For almost as long,
Russian and Ukrainian officials have been attempting to negotiate. Those
negotiations have yielded few firm results so far, especially as Russia
continues to bombard Ukrainian cities. Still, the talking matters.
Diplomacy is the only way this war will finally end, and the type of
agreement that might end the fighting looks a lot clearer than it did
even a month ago.]{.underline} In the early days of the war, the talks
made little apparent progress. Ukraine appeared to be demanding an
immediate ceasefire, and Russian withdrawal of troops. Russia, however,
had pretty different ideas. It laid out some aggressive demands. Among
them were: Ukraine's neutrality and no membership in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO); so-called "demilitarization and
"denazification;" the protection of Russian language within Ukraine; and
that Ukraine recognize Crimea as part of Russia and recognize the
independence of Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions in eastern Ukraine
that Vladimir Putin had declared as independent on the eve of his
full-scale invasion. [In recent days, some glimmers of optimism have
emerged. Ukraine has put forward serious proposals, which is centered
around a commitment to permanent neutrality and an agreement not to seek
NATO membership, in exchange for security guarantees. Russia has also
reportedly eased up on some of its previous demands, including
"denazification" --- a likely ruse for regime change --- and
"demilitarization," a sign that Ukraine's battlefield successes so far
have pushed the Kremlin to possibly reconsider some of its most
maximalist demands. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, who is
helping to broker the talks, described the discussions earlier in the
week as "the most meaningful progress since the start of
negotiations."]{.underline} But these really are just glimmers of
progress --- and they might not be so long lasting. Russia, this week,
promised to "drastically reduce" military activity around Kyiv and
Chernihiv, in the name of "mutual trust," though reports of shelling
continued in those areas. Some, including US and NATO officials, have
expressed skepticism that Moscow is sincere, and instead using talks to
buy time, so it can regroup and refocus its offensive, potentially on
areas in eastern and southern Ukraine. Since then, both Russia and
Ukraine have downplayed the seriousness of the talks, even as
negotiations resumed Friday. And huge gulfs remain. Perhaps the most
intractable problem may be the future of the Crimean peninsula, which
Russia annexed in 2014, and Donetsk and Luhansk, which Russia and
Russia-backed militias control parts of. Ukraine is unlikely to agree to
slice up its country. It is also hard to imagine Russia settling for
less territory than it controlled the day before its invasion in
February 2022. Other issues will emerge, and concessions and proposals
may shift depending on developments in the battlefield. The prospect of
a quick peace deal between Ukraine and Russia remains unlikely. Perhaps
the best case short term is that both sides broker a ceasefire that
includes a framework for an agreement, and then work the details out
over time. But the war continues.

[Russia claimed control Sunday over]{.underline} the key city of
[Lysychansk, the last major Ukrainian foothold in the Luhansk
region]{.underline} [--- signaling **a potential turning point in
Moscow's campaign** to take all of eastern Ukraine.]{.underline}
Ukrainian officials said their forces had withdrawn from Lysychansk
after fierce fighting to preserve lives from the Russians' relentless
assault[. The slow Russian advance across the region it has targeted
since the invasion began in February has been facilitated by
overwhelming artillery power that has leveled cities and towns and left
a trail of wounded and dead prompting comparisons with the devastation
of World War I in Europe.]{.underline} Russian Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu said in a statement that Russian troops and pro-Kremlin
separatists of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic "have
established full control" over Lysychansk "and a number of nearby
settlements." [The Ukrainian military's general staff said Sunday that
Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from Lysychansk after waging a
stiff but losing battle.]{.underline} Ukraine had tried to defend
Lysychansk for weeks[. The military said it decided to withdraw
because]{.underline} remaining in the city would bring "[fatal
consequences," given **the Russian forces' "overwhelming advantage**" in
"artillery, aviation, ammunition and personnel."]{.underline} The
decision was "made to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders," according
to a statement posted on Facebook. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky vowed to return. "If the command of our army withdraws people
from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire
superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one
thing: We will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in
the supply of modern weapons," Zelensky said in his nightly address
Sunday. "Ukraine does not give anything up." The city is a key target in
Russia's battle to capture the Donbas region, the heavily industrialized
area bordering Russia that is partly controlled by separatists loyal to
Moscow. In 2014, they unilaterally established two independent
"republics" in the Donbas region. 'They're in hell': Hail of Russian
artillery tests Ukrainian morale Russian President Vladimir Putin cited
false claims of Ukrainian "genocide" against Russian-speaking residents
there as justification for his invasion. Russia's latest advances in
eastern Ukraine add to creeping doubts among U.S. lawmakers and
observers of the war that the Ukrainian government can stop Putin from
seizing territory. [Optimism sparked by the defeat of his forces in the
battle for Kyiv in the spring has faded as **Russian artillery hammers
Ukrainian forces** and civilian targets. As Ukraine war bogs down, U.S.
assessments face scrutiny President Biden said last week that U.S.
support for Ukraine is unshakable and will continue "as long as it
takes" to ensure a Russian defeat. "We continue to fight. Unfortunately,
the steel willpower and patriotism are not enough to achieve success ---
**we need the technical resources**,"]{.underline} the Ukrainian
military's statement added. Why is Ukraine's Donbas region a target for
Russian forces? Ukrainian troops withdrew just over a week ago from
Severodonetsk, a city across the Donets River to the east. Russia's
capture of Lysychansk, if confirmed, would be a major victory that gives
its troops clear access to Donetsk, the other region that makes up
Donbas. Biden administration officials say Putin's gains have been
uneven and have come at a significant cost, highlighting the steep death
toll among Russian troops. But Ukrainian forces also are paying a heavy
price, which U.S. military officials rarely acknowledge. Ukraine
retreats from Severodonetsk as Russia advances in the east Control over
Donbas is the primary goal of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine,
after it failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, and other areas in the
initial weeks of the war. [Russian troops and their allies have been
making steady gains in the east, as officials in Kyiv say they are
outgunned and running out of ammunition.]{.underline} Ukrainian Defense
Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sak told the BBC earlier Sunday that Ukraine
controls other cities in Donetsk and argued that "the battle for the
Donbas is not over yet." Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region,
said earlier in the day that in attacking Lysychansk, Russian fighters
used tactics even more brutal than in Severodonetsk to overcome
resistance. Photos showed bombed-out residential buildings in Lysychansk
early Sunday, amid a barrage reminiscent of the destruction of
Severodonetsk. As recently as Saturday, a Russian-backed politician said
Lysychansk was "completely surrounded," but defense officials in Ukraine
said they still had control of the city. Those counterclaims were
probably "outdated or erroneous," according to an analysis from the
Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank. It
cited unconfirmed videos showing Russian forces erecting a red "victory"
flag in Lysychansk and "casually walking around" its neighborhoods.
"Ukrainian forces likely conducted a deliberate withdrawal from
Lysychansk, resulting in the Russian seizure of the city on July 2," it
said. [As Russia issued its claim of control over Lysychansk on Sunday,
Slovyansk, a town about 50 miles west in Donetsk, came under intense
shelling]{.underline} that killed at least six people, local officials
said. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said in a video on Telegram that "the biggest
shelling of Slovyansk recently" had left "a large number of wounded and
dead." Tetyana Ignatchenko, a spokeswoman for the Donetsk region, told
Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that at least six people were
killed and 15 were injured in the shelling. She added that missiles hit
the town of Kramatorsk, to the south of Slovyansk. In its assessment
Saturday, [the ISW said Russia was likely to fully take over the Luhansk
region "in coming days" and would probably "then prioritize drives on
Ukrainian positions in Siversk before turning to Slovyansk and Bakhmut,"
in Donetsk]{.underline}. In other developments, Ukraine's ambassador to
Turkey said Sunday that Turkish authorities have detained a
Russian-flagged cargo ship loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain. Millions
of metric tons of grain await export from Ukraine, blockaded by Russia's
control of Black Sea shipping lanes. The export blockades have resulted
in global food shortages and rising prices, which have particularly
affected poorer countries. Three people were killed in Russian strikes
early Sunday in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said. Cities
across Kharkiv were shelled Saturday and Sunday, according to regional
governor Oleh Synyehubov. In one district, Russian forces "burned farm
buildings, garages, and shelled open areas," he added. Russian forces
have recently intensified their attacks on Kharkiv, and some

"Russia\'s Economy is Collapsing, Data Reveals",
<https://www.newsweek.com/russia-economy-collapsing-data-reveals-1720532>//RM)

[If Russia defaulting on its foreign debt for the first time since the
Bolshevik revolution wasn\'t a clear enough sign of the impact Western
sanctions are having on the Russian economy, a new report on the
country\'s socio-economic situation leaves no margin for doubt that the
Russian economy is gradually collapsing.]{.underline} New statistics on
the state of the Russian economy, produced by the country\'s Federal
State Statistics Service, show production has plunged in multiple
sectors, from vehicles to domestic appliances, as has retail confidence.
[Overall, Russia\'s industrial production index---a monthly economic
indicator measuring real output in the manufacturing, mining, electric,
and gas industries---dropped by 1.7 percent in May compared to the same
month in 2021. That\'s higher than the decline of 1.6 percent
year-on-year reported in April.]{.underline} Mining dropped by 0.8
percentage points in May 2022 compared to May 2021, and manufacturing
dropped by 3.2 percentage points. [The overall numbers seem quite
modest, but they reflect a downward trend that is more obvious in the
staggering drops affecting the production of specific
products.]{.underline} Above all, car production has suffered, and it\'s
now down by 96.7 percent compared to 2021. Production of trucks plunged
by 39.3 percent, that of diesel and gasoline engines by 57 percent, that
of diesel locomotives by 63.2 percent and that of freight wagons by 51.8
percent. French automaker Renault, which controls Russia\'s largest
carmaker AvtoVAZ, suspended operations at its Moscow plant in March,
under pressure from Ukrainian leaders to act in response to Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine. Renault later agreed to sell its Russian operations
for a nominal payment. Air cargo is down by 86 percent year on year.
Other products were also affected. The production of fridges is also
down by 58.1 percent compared with 2021 levels, that of washing machines
by 59.2 percent, that of AC electric motors by 49.9 percent. TV sets
were down by 49.7 percentage points. Production of elevators is down by
34.7 percent and that of excavators was down by 60 percent. Curiously,
cigarette production also dropped by 24.5 percent. Graphs show that
retail turnover and retail confidence have also gone down compared to
one year before and even from the beginning of 2022. Wholesale turnover
has also plunged drastically, with consumer demand dropping in what is
likely a reflection of lower wages amid high inflation in the country.
Even more significantly for the Russian population, pensions have also
fallen in real terms, decreasing by 8.2 percentage points year-on-year
in May, while salaries dropped by 7.2 percentage points in April
compared to a year prior. [These data are a clear sign that the Russian
economy is suffering, despite the fact that the rouble bounced back
after collapsing in late February following the invasion of Ukraine and
that the country has held up surprisingly better than expected after
Western sanctions were imposed.]{.underline} The drop in industrial
production is less than Western economists expected, but the economic
contraction of the country is still undeniable. Even the Russian central
bank said it expected a fall in GDP of 7.8 percent this year, almost in
line with Western predictions but not quite, as Western experts estimate
that the country\'s economy will shrink by 15 percent by the end of the
year, according to the Institute of International Finance\'s (IIF). One
piece of unexpected good news for Russia came from the jobs market, with
a record-low unemployment rate of 3.9 percent reported in May. And yet,
as high inflation continues to cripple wages in Russia, it\'s unlikely
this high employment will turn into higher consumer demand able to turn
the tide of Russia\'s likely incoming recession.

<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jul/04/turkey-hit-with-soaring-prices-as-inflation-reaches-24-year-high-erdogan>/RM)

[Turkey's official inflation rate increased to almost 80% last month --
the highest in 24 years -- as President Recep Tayyip Erdo르n's
unconventional economic policies continued to drive up the cost of
living. The growth in annual prices rose from 73.5% in May to 78.6% in
June, according to the Turkish statistics agency. However, opposition
parties and economists said recent hikes in oil and gas prices meant the
real rate of inflation was almost double the official
figure]{.underline}. The minister of treasury and finance, Nureddin
Nebati, has attempted to head off criticism of the government's handling
of the economy, saying last week that consumer prices would start
dropping by the end of the year. "I promise to you and to the president,
we will see a drop in inflation starting in December," Nebati said. His
comments came after the government announced its second increase in the
minimum wage in six months, raising pay by 30%. The increase lifted the
monthly salary of about 40% of the workforce from \$254 (춲209) to \$328.
Erdo르n has claimed that Turkey's problem is not inflation. "We do not
have an inflation problem. We have a cost of living problem," he said
last month. [Economists said Turkey's official data disguised a more
disturbing trend of rising prices that had shown no sign of abating. A
monthly report release by Turkey's ENAG group of independent economists
showed consumer prices had risen by 175% in June compared with a year
earlier. ENAG said prices had risen by 71.4% since the start of 2022.
The Istanbul chamber of commerce said inflation in Turkey's largest city
had reached an annual rate of 94%. "No one actually believes official
Turkish data any more," said Timothy Ash, an economist at BlueBay Asset
Management. "There is no expectation of anything like a credible policy
response]{.underline}." The growing dispute over the veracity of
Turkey's official data is expected to be a difficult political issue for
Erdo르n's government ahead of next year's general election, which is
widely viewed as the toughest of his two-decade rule. Kemal
K캼l캼칞daro륿u, the leader of the main opposition party, accused the state
statistics agency of "lying", urging it in a tweet to "stop committing
crimes for the benefit of President Erdo르n." A survey published by the
Metropol polling agency on Friday showed 69% of respondents believed the
unofficial ENAG figure and just 24% the one reported by the government.
[Turkey was hit hard by the fallout from the European debt crisis in
2012 and the threat of higher interest rates by the US Federal Reserve
in 2013. Its currency tumble ever since.]{.underline} In 2013 the lira
was worth 36p, compared with 4.9p on Monday. To arrest the decline, in
2018 Erdo르n embarked on what he called a "new economic model", which
meant setting aside rising inflation and cutting interest rates to boost
economic growth. This was done against the advice of his central bank
chief and caused the lira to plunge to a record low, pushing up costs in
a country that is dependent on imported materials, especially energy.
[Inflation, which officially stood at 15% at the beginning of 2021, has
now reached its highest level since a currency meltdown during the 1998
debt crisis that helped bring Erdo르n to power. Three central bank
bosses have been fired by the president since 2018. The Turkish lira has
plummeted 20% this year alone.]{.underline}

SC)

WASHINGTON [-- The pertinent and unanswerable question about Turkey is
**whether the country's present economic turmoil is an isolated event**,
mostly confined to Turkey itself, **or whether it portends a larger
economic convulsion that shakes markets around the world.** Among
economists and other experts, there's no consensus. Some foresee
contagion: Turkey's problems will spread. Others envision a one-country
economic blip. **Which is it?**]{.underline} The answer obviously
matters. The global economy already faces obstacles to growth. American
interest rates are rising as the Federal Reserve tries to prevent higher
inflation. President Trump's trade wars are threatening. If we now add a
slowdown of "emerging market" economies -- China, Brazil and similar
"middle-income" nations -- the global expansion might sputter or halt.
[Turkey's experience is relevant. In recent months, its currency, the
lira, has collapsed. At the start of 2018, it was trading at roughly 4
lira to the dollar; now that's about 6 lira to the dollar.]{.underline}
This makes it harder for Turkish businesses and consumers to repay
debts, which -- more than in many other countries -- are often made in
dollars. To repay these debts, Turkish companies need to earn more lira,
which can be sold for dollars. The more lira go to repay dollar debts,
the fewer lira are left over to buy other things. Economic growth slows.
If debtors can't raise the dollars to repay their loans, they default.
Too many defaults, and growth stops. Turkey's debt problems are
undeniably daunting, notes economist Hung Tran of the Institute of
International Finance (IIF), an industry research and advocacy group.
Consider: Between now and the end of 2018, Turkey faces debt repayments
-- principal and interest -- of about \$120 billion; in 2019, the total
is about \$200 billion. By comparison, Turkey's economy -- gross
domestic product -- is about \$850 billion. Some of these loans could be
rolled over; how many is unclear. Many debts were incurred by banks or
private firms, encouraged by easy-money policies. The government pumped
up the economy in the wake of a failed military coup in 2016 and in
anticipation of a new election. The election was held in June 2018 and
won by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. He was surely helped by the
economic stimulus. Last year, Turkey's GDP grew 7 percent, up from 3.2
percent in 2016. To complicate matters further, Turkey and the Trump
administration are feuding over the Turks' detention of Andrew Brunson,
an American pastor accused of anti-state activities. Now comes the
reckoning. [Many observers believe that what happened in Turkey **will
stay in Turkey.** Its economy is simply too small -- about 1.4 percent
of global GDP, according to some estimates -- to influence the rest of
the world. "**It's mainly a Turkish issue**," says economist C. Fred
Bergsten of the Peterson Institute. He doesn't expect large spillover
effects, say a slowdown of growth in Europe or capital flight from other
"emerging market" countries, such as Brazil or India.]{.underline} Not
all economists are so hopeful. Writing in The Hill, Desmond Lachman of
the American Enterprise Institute predicts that ["Turkey will **default
on its debt** and impose capital controls." Capital controls are legal
restrictions on money movements in and out of a country. He expects
contagion -- capital flight from heavily indebted countries -- **that
will weaken the global recovery and hurt the U.S.
economy**.]{.underline} Economist Tran of the IIF thinks that
emerging-market countries that have problems similar to Turkey's -- poor
policies, maturing debts, sizable current account deficits -- are the
most vulnerable to capital flight. These include South Africa, Indonesia
and Egypt. [So far, the evidence is reassuring; the IIF's most recent
survey of capital movements didn't detect any sizable money surges since
the lira's latest large drop.]{.underline} Crowd psychology could
trigger a panic. If investors expect other investors to sell, there
could be a stampede for the door. This story isn't over yet. [What's
uncontroversial, at least among many economists, is that **Turkey will
need to go to the IMF to end the present crisis**. The]{.underline} IMF
would provide a hefty loan -- it's doubtful anyone else would -- and
impose "tough austerity policies" designed to improve the economy's
performance, says Jacob Funk Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute. By
their nature, these policies would be unpopular, especially with
Erdogan, because they "could weaken (his) hold on power," as Kirkegaard
puts it. It seems likely that he would resent and resist them as long as
possible. That could change everything. Stay tuned.

#### Turkish economy [resilient]{.underline}--hyperinflation is [normal]{.underline} for the economy

**Balcells 2-11** (Francesc Balcells is running the Global EM Debt Fund
at FIM partners. Formerly at PIMCO for eight years, managing EM hard and

resilience has defied worst fears", Financial Times,
<https://www.ft.com/content/1d8fd6dd-e951-49a1-bffa-b2c361c2d16a//BVN>
SC)

[The warnings back in 2011-2013 were ominous: "If the Turkish lira
breaks through 2 against the dollar, the economy will implode." Once the
2 was reached, the new implosion target moved to 3, then to 5, and here
we are at 13. **The economy is still standing**.]{.underline} An economy
with debt in dollars as high as Turkey's should seemingly have imploded
a long time ago under such currency volatility. The history of emerging
markets is littered with balance of payments crises under similar
foreign exchange depreciations. There might be several reasons for this
resilience. For one, up until earlier this year, [the Turkish
authorities did what they always had done in the past when confronted
with capital outflows and currency weakness: interest rate hikes, if
only belatedly and often in an obfuscated manner. **This boom-and-bust
way of managing the economy kept the system going for quite some
time**.]{.underline} That time is what gave economic actors the chance
to build buffers against an unbalanced economy. [Banks, for example,
kept balance sheets largely hedged on currency. By virtue of a build-up
of dollar deposits and a low level of foreign currency loans made
relative to them, banks also had excess dollars.]{.underline} So they
kept lending dollars to obtain cheap lira funding, creating in the
process another safety mechanism for themselves. But it hasn't been only
banks which have built resilience over time. [As dollarisation
progressed, households have continued to accumulate dollar assets but no
foreign exchange liabilities. This is because banks were forbidden to
lend foreign currency to households, **making them a lot more resilient
to currency risk**.]{.underline} This was perhaps the regulators'
greatest foresight. The creditor profile of the country has also changed
over time. Fickle portfolio flows have greatly reduced. Foreigners used
to own nearly 30 per cent of the local debt market but this number is
now less than 5 per cent (a mere \$3bn in absolute terms). Meanwhile
locals now own almost 50 per cent of the country's sovereign Eurobonds.
This has left Turkey more dependent on different types of external
creditor --- the syndicated loan market, trade finance, intra-corporate
lending, or domestic lenders. These creditors are more patient, more
long-term oriented than foreign portfolio investors. [The passing of
time has also allowed Turkish corporates, the weakest link in the
country's external balance sheet chain, to **reduce debt levels**
somewhat while building a positive net short-term foreign exchange
position.]{.underline} The problem, however, remains one of
co-ordination. While on paper each economic sector has enough liquidity
buffers of its own, they are all "joined at the hip". One sector drawing
on its foreign exchange assets has a ripple effect on the entire system,
as those assets will be residing in someone else's balance sheet.
Against that, the country is tentatively turning its persistent current
account deficit into a surplus by virtue of the very large lira
depreciation which boosts exports and contracts imports. Whether this
turn in the current account, if it materialises, is yet another
boom-and-bust episode or a structural manifestation of a policy-driven
rebalancing of the economy remains unclear. [All in all, it's been **a
surprisingly resilient journey**, though longer than many of us would
have anticipated. Turks also have suffered from high inflation and a
squeeze in purchasing power in dollars.]{.underline} And the fact that
**[Turkey hasn't "broken" yet]{.underline}** doesn't mean it still
can't.

#### Turkish economy [rebounding]{.underline} again

**Anadolu Agency 5-24** (Anadolu Agency is a news agency headquartered
in Ankara, Turkey, 5-24-22, "Turkey boasts 'diversified, resilient'
economy: Moody's executive", Daily Sabah,
https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkey-boasts-diversified-resilient-economy-moodys-executive)

[Risks aside, Turkey boasts a large, diversified, **resilient economy
with a solid banking sector**]{.underline}, an executive at Moody's
Investors Service, a sister company of the global ratings agency, said
Monday. ["They (Turkish banks) have had pretty good results. They are
solid,"]{.underline} Kathrin Muehlbronner, senior vice president within
Moody's Investors Service Sovereign Risk Group, told Anadolu Agency
(AA), [citing "stabilizing factors."]{.underline} ["**Exporters are
benefiting clearly very much from the (Turkish lira's) depreciation**,"
she said, praising the country's "large diversified resilient
economy."]{.underline} She noted that [Turkey may benefit from supply
chain shifts]{.underline} in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
"Turkey can benefit massively from a nearshoring of production by
European companies and (from its) Customs Union with the EU." She said
prospects for Turkish economic growth are optimistic, adding: ["Exports
are doing well. Lira depreciation helps. There are clear incentives such
as credit stimulus for exporters and investments."]{.underline}
Muehlbronner welcomed steps by the Turkish government to shield the
poorest households from inflation. Propelled by rising energy and
commodity prices, [Turkey's annual inflation runs at a 20-year high of
nearly 70% as of April, according to official data.]{.underline}
Consumer prices have been increasing despite tax cuts on basic goods and
government subsidies for utility bills to ease the burden on household
budgets. After it took a hit from the pandemic like the rest of the
world, Muehlbronner said she expects the Turkish tourism sector to have
a good season. [She underlined that the **Turkish economy may grow
faster** than Moody's forecast of 3% this year.]{.underline} On
inflation, Muehlbronner said the upward trend stemmed from the weaker
lira, especially through end-2021 and elevated commodity prices. ["We
think inflation will drop kind of mechanically at the end of the year
because of a base effect,"]{.underline} Muehlbronner noted. Listing
risks to the Turkish economy, she said high inflation, currency pressure
and loose monetary policy create downside risks for the country. The
Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) is expected to hold its
key policy rate unchanged at 14% for the fifth straight month on
Thursday, according to surveys. Inflation has surged since last autumn
as the lira weakened after the central bank in September embarked on a
500-basis point-easing cycle. [The government's foreign
exchange-protected lira deposits tool]{.underline}, she said, ["was
certainly a good step to stabilize the currency. And it has **reduced
dollarization of deposits by around 10 percentage
points."**]{.underline} Muehlbronner was referring to the scheme that
the government unveiled in December to boost lira deposits by protecting
them against exchange rate volatility. Ankara has called on individuals
and companies to convert their foreign exchange savings to lira to
support the currency. ["So, we're back to the levels of share of
deposits and dollars that we had before the latest currency crisis. So
that's certainly a positive step,"]{.underline} Muehlbronner added.

### 2AC -- AT: Nuclear Ukraine

#### Putin [won't]{.underline} use nuclear weapons--NATO will [retaliate]{.underline} if he does

**Ullman 2/16** (Harlan Ullman, Harlan Ullman is an Atlantic Council
senior advisor and UPI's Arnaud deBorchgrave Distinguished Columnist,
2/16/22, "Why Putin won't invade Ukraine",
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/why-putin-wont-invade-ukraine/>/RM

In regard to Ukraine, [Putin also knows that an armed attack or
aggressive use of force will make any chance of his achieving both his
priorities even less likely than landing an astronaut on the sun. He
also knows that the costs to Russia and to him personally will be high
and possibly unaffordable. Sanctions and further isolation will hurt.
Going to war, no matter the scope, or using cyber and influence
operations to cripple Ukraine, will absolutely foreclose any chance for
even part of Putin's demands being considered by NATO. The Alliance's
response to a major attack will make the actions it took after Russia's
2014 Crimean annexation appear anemic. It will expand its military
capability and the number of forces stationed in Europe---exactly the
opposite of Putin's intent. NATO members will develop and deploy more
advanced weapons, including new classes of missiles with low-yield
nuclear warheads.]{.underline} NATO badly needs a new strategic
framework (here, ironically, Putin is right for the wrong reasons). If
war breaks out in Ukraine, the Alliance will certainly move to a new
framework incorporating some of the actions mentioned above and announce
it during the Madrid summit in June---another outcome Putin won't like
one bit. [In an escalation, the West will impose sanctions more strictly
and robustly than before. How much this will dent Russia's economy or
Putin's inner circle is uncertain. But the Nord Stream 2 natural gas
pipeline will almost certainly be cancelled, denting Russia's energy
sector. Whatever credibility Putin may have gained will be lost given
the "big lie" of his assurances that force would not be used in Ukraine.
Of course, Russia will have accused the West of provoking violence
requiring an "appropriate response."]{.underline} If a subsequent
occupation of Ukraine were required, even of just a portion of the
country, body bags could be flowing back to Russia. And what is Putin's
exit strategy? No such plan following a Russian attack is obvious for
Moscow other than a prolonged twenty-first century version of the Cold
War, but one in which Moscow uses substantial force resulting in even
greater isolation. And that could doom Putin's rule in a way similar to
how Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev got fired two years after the
October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. An advantageous stalemate The
billion-ruble question is: How does this crisis end? Speculation over
invasion scenarios has ranged from a massive, overwhelming air, sea, and
land assault to a mix of cyber, special-forces, and influence-based
non-kinetic operations. Should Putin not grasp the predicament he has
imposed on himself, a limited move in the Donbas or seizing a land
bridge into Crimea would seem to be the lowest-risk and lowest-cost
option. He could then judge how NATO chooses to respond and wait. But
Putin would almost certainly suffer the same consequences as if he took
Kyiv and occupied much of the country. Assuming there is no military
action, Putin has two choices. First, he can prolong the crisis and
maintain the buildup on the Ukrainian border. That would be expensive
and wear down his forces. Staying on constant alert takes a toll on
people and pocketbooks. Or Putin could terminate the exercise with
Belarus on February 20 as scheduled, draw his troops back from the
Ukrainian border, claim victory, and continue to push for
negotiations---arguing that as the West wrongly predicted an attack, it
continues to fail to recognize Russian security interests and needs.
Russia will no doubt continue political and psychological pressure on
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to make concessions, either to
accept the Minsk 2 agreement (despite its grant of semi-autonomy to the
Donbas) or to suspend any request for NATO membership. And Russian
"active measures," such as disinformation campaigns, will continue to
target Ukraine with the aim of eroding Zelenskyy's standing and NATO
solidarity by claiming "hysteria" over an invasion that never occurred.
This scenario suits Putin's interests far better than an uncertain
military adventure, which is why he will choose it---and not because of
anything uttered from a White House podium, no matter how much credit
the administration will take for deterring a war.

#### Russia [won't escalate]{.underline} to nuclear weapons--he [loses]{.underline} China if they do

**Corera 4/26** (Gordon Corera, Security correspondent, BBC News, April
26, 2022, "Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?",
<https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60664169>//RM)

Putin claims Ukraine is part of Russia, so using nuclear weapons on its
territory seems bizarre. Russia itself is close by and \"the fallout
could cross boundaries\", warns Patricia Lewis. The only time nuclear
weapons have been used in conflict was by the US at the end of World War
Two against Japan. [Would Putin want to become the first leader to break
the taboo and use them? Some worry he has shown a willingness to do
things others thought he would not do, whether invading Ukraine or using
nerve agent in Salisbury. Dr Williams says there is a further reason why
Russia might not use nuclear weapons - China. \"Russia is heavily
dependent on Chinese support, but China has a \'no first use\' nuclear
doctrine. So if Putin did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for
China to stand by him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.\"
Could it lead to nuclear war? No one knows quite where the use of
tactical nuclear weapons would lead. It could escalate and Putin would
not want nuclear war. But miscalculation is always a risk. \"They would
imagine everyone would capitulate,\" says Patricia Lewis. \"What would
happen is that Nato would have to come in and respond.\"]{.underline}
The US says it is monitoring the situation closely. It has an extensive
intelligence gathering machine to watch Russian nuclear activity - for
instance whether tactical weapons are being moved out of storage, or if
there is any change in behaviour at launch sites. [So far, they say they
have not seen any significant changes. How the US and Nato would respond
to any nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the
situation further and risk all-out nuclear war but they also might want
to draw a line. This might mean a tough conventional rather than nuclear
response.]{.underline} But what would Russia then do? \"Once you have
crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no obvious stopping point,\"
says James Acton. \"I don\'t think anyone can have any confidence of
what that world would look like.\"
