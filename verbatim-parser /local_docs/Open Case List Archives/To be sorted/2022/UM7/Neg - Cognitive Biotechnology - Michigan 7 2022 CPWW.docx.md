4\. Medical & Human Performance Modification [DoD's medical needs are
mostly consistent with broader, civilian needs, albeit concentrated more
in certain areas, such as trauma.]{.underline} At the same time, the
[National Institutes of Health (NIH) dwarfs DoD's biomedical research
budget]{.underline}; the [private sector is also investing in this area,
and both the private sector and NIH are in a **substantially better
position** to support novel therapeutics through the regulatory
system]{.underline}. Because of the [novelty of synthetic biology and
the extra regulation required when using viable organisms in medical
treatments, the regulatory burden will probably be even heavier than for
existing treatments when using live organisms. DoD has unique human
performance applications]{.underline}, and the private sector is only
investing in a limited way through relevant medical R&D. In the same
way, medical funding is generating some relevant R&D at NIH and in other
basic research organizations, but it is usually not targeted at human
performance. [This field has what is probably the largest regulatory
challenge, especially when contemplating DoD research in this
area.]{.underline} Where enhancement is concerned, [the FDA does not
currently have a mechanism for approving new 'treatments,']{.underline}
as it requires them to treat a disease to be considered, and research in
military populations has additional hurdles. Assessment: At present,
[resources should primarily be directed elsewhere]{.underline}, with
some exceptions in the human performance field, which represents a major
opportunity for DoD and would substantially benefit from R&D investment;
[however, the regulatory hurdles and potential communications challenges
from the interaction between synthetic biology and human performance
suggest that **it is too early** for DoD to move into this
area]{.underline} unless DoD can identify civilian medical researchers
as early partners who will carry developments through testing and
regulatory approval. [Research should also focus away from modifying the
human genome and instead work on areas such as synthetic
probiotics.]{.underline}

Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has **[explicitly stated
intent to implement an aggressive modernization]{.underline}** plan [via
the National Technology Initiative]{.underline} (NTI). Designed [to
grant an **overmatch advantage**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} both
**[commercial and military domains]{.underline}** [against]{.underline}
Russia's current and near-term future key [competitors]{.underline}, the
NTI has been viewed as somewhat hampered by the nation's legacy of
government control, unchanging economic complexity, bureaucratic
inefficiency and overall lack of transparency. However, there are
apparent disparities between such assessment of the NTI and its
capabilities, and [Russia's]{.underline} continued invention and
successful deployment of advanced technologies. Unlike the overt claims
and predictions made by China's scientific and political communities
about the development and exercise of neuroS/T to re-balance global
power, [explication and demonstration(s) of Russian]{.underline} efforts
in [neuroS/T tend to be subtle]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [detailed
information]{.underline} about surveillance and extent of such
enterprise and activity [is]{.underline}, for the most part, restricted
to the [classified]{.underline} domain. In general, [Russian
endeavors]{.underline} in this space [tend to build upon]{.underline}
prior [work]{.underline} conducted [under the Soviet Union]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} while not broad in focus, [have gained]{.underline}
relative [sophistication]{.underline} and capability [in]{.underline}
particular [areas that have high applicability in non-kinetic disruptive
engagements]{.underline}. Russia's employments of [weaponized
information, and neurotropic agents]{.underline} have remained rather
low-key, if not clandestine (and perhaps covert), often
[entail]{.underline} nation-state or non-state actors as [proxies, and
are veiled]{.underline} by a successful misinformation campaign to
prevent accurate assessment of their existing and developing science and
technologies. Military science and technology efforts of the USSR were
advanced and sustained primarily due to the extensive
military-industrial complex which, by the mid-1970s through 1980s, is
estimated to have employed up to twenty percent of the workforce. This
enabled the USSR to become a world leader in science and technology,
ranked by the U.S. research community as second in the world for
clandestine S&T programs (only because the overall Soviet system of
research and development (R&D) was exceptionally inefficient, even
within the military sector). [The collapse of the USSR ended
the]{.underline} [Soviet military-industrial complex, which resulted in
significant decreases in overall spending and state support for R&D
programs.]{.underline} Any newly implemented reforms of the post-Soviet
state were relatively modest, generating suboptimal R&D results at best.
During this time, [**Russian R&D declined by**]{.underline}
approximately **[60%]{.underline}** and aside from the Ministries'
involvement with the military sector, there was a paucity of direct
cooperation between Russian R&D institutions and operational S&T
enterprises. This **[limited interaction]{.underline}**, was further
compounded by a **[lack of resources]{.underline}**, [inability to
bring]{.underline} new [technology to markets]{.underline}, [**absent
protections** for **i**]{.underline}ntellectual
**[p]{.underline}**roperty, [and]{.underline} "brain drain" [**exodus**
of]{.underline} talented [researchers]{.underline} to nations with more
modern, cutting-edged programs with better pay and opportunities for
advancement. Recognizing the inherent problems with the monoculture of
the Russian economic and S&T ecosystems, the [Putin]{.underline}
government [initiated a process of steering Russia toward]{.underline}
more lucrative, [high-tech enterprises]{.underline}. [The NTI is
ambitious]{.underline}, [with goals to]{.underline} fully
[realize]{.underline} a series of [S&T/R&D]{.underline} advancements [by
2035.]{.underline} The central objective of the NTI is establish "the
program for creation of fundamentally new markets and the creation of
conditions for global technological leadership of Russia by 2035." To
this end, NTI Experts and the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI)
identified nine emerging high-tech markets for prime focus and
penetrance, including neuroscience and technology (i.e., what the ASI
termed "NeuroNet"). Substantive investment in this market is aimed at
overcoming the post-Soviet "resource curse", by capitalizing on the
changes in global technology markets -- and engagement sectors -- to
expand both economic and military/ intelligence priorities and
capabilities. According to the ASI, NeuroNet is focused upon
"distributed artificial elements of consciousness and mentality", with
Russia's prioritization of neuroS/T being a key factor operative in
influence operations directed and global economies and power.
Non-kinetic operations represent the most viable intersection and
exercise of these commercial, military, and political priorities,
capabilities, and foci of global influence and effect(s).

Before projecting where BCI technology may be in coming years and
forecasting what is or is not possible, it is essential to understand
the technical challenges involved. These [technical challenges are not
trivial]{.underline} and may significantly alter how the DOD and USAF
use technology to enhance our war fighters. First, **[faulty
metaphors]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Hollywood
hype]{.underline}** have [influenced our perception of the
brain]{.underline}---an [actual]{.underline}, complete [understanding of
the brain and its functions might still be]{.underline} **[decades
away]{.underline}**. Second, [the body's **immune system**
responds]{.underline} when subject [to a]{.underline} [foreign
object.]{.underline} Third, achieving [**high** signal
**resolution**]{.underline}---[while]{.underline} also
[ensuring]{.underline} **[safety]{.underline}** with invasive
methods---[yields engineering challenges]{.underline}, [including issues
with]{.underline} **[power consumption, biosecurity,
communications]{.underline}** methods (wireless or wired),
[and]{.underline} **[decoder efficiency]{.underline}**. Finally,
[ethical, social, and legal implications arise with BCI
implants]{.underline}. These challenges, while not an all-encompassing
list, represent the obstacles that will guide how the USAF and DOD apply
these technologies in future efforts. The first challenge highlights how
far we have to go to gain a complete understanding of the brain. In the
last decade, genetic sequencing technology and new tools for mapping the
brain have led to an explosion in neuroscience research. Scientists can
now use these tools to map neuronal firing patterns in an attempt to
understand how different firing patterns lead to different actions.
However, [the brain contains]{.underline} between 80 and **[100 billion
neurons]{.underline}** [with each]{.underline} neuron
[having]{.underline} up to **[10,000 connections]{.underline}** to its
surrounding neurons.25 [Scientists are]{.underline} still [far from
understanding]{.underline} the dynamics of the [electrochemical
interactions between the neurons and how those]{.underline} interactions
[are translated into memories, behaviors, perceptions, and
actions]{.underline}. Often we seek the closest metaphor for the brain,
comparing the brain to a digital computer and its subcomponents. While
similarities exist (both are designed to process and store information),
mechanisms for their processes and are quite different. In reality, when
exposed to new experiences, [the brain changes]{.underline} in an
orderly way [based on the]{.underline} existing, [unique structure that
each person has developed]{.underline} over a lifetime of experiences.
Robert Epstein's article, "The Empty Brain," states [there is
no]{.underline} reason to believe that any [two of us]{.underline} are
[changed the same way by the same experience]{.underline}."26 For
example, the firing patterns on the brains of two air battle managers
(ABM) learning the same task would be dependent on their past
experiences. [This complicates]{.underline} the prospect of accurate
[memory prosthesis or]{.underline} the [transferring]{.underline} of
[knowledge]{.underline} and experience from one person to another. The
brain does indeed have a modular design, with certain areas designed for
specific functions (i.e., movement planning, movement execution,
aggression, attention, and so forth). This indicates that although the
brain activity of the two ABMs will not be identical, they will likely
be similar. There may be a quasi-transitive property within the brain
like in mathematics (i.e., 5 x 6 = 6 x 5), where neurons are arranged
differently but retain the same data. The first step in making an
informed prediction about the future of BCIs is to temper our
expectations. This can be accomplished by taking some time to understand
what metaphors are valid and invalid depending on what is being
compared. The second challenge to BCIs is [the]{.underline} body's
[natural immune response]{.underline} when subject to a foreign body.
This is particularly important for invasive BCIs that reside under the
skin. Invasive BCIs typically use an array of micro-electrodes in direct
contact with specific neurons in the brain. Once the body [recognizes
the electrode as a foreign body]{.underline}, [the immune system goes to
work]{.underline} much like it would in the case of a splinter. The
result is a process called [**tissue encapsulation**, in which the
electrode is surrounded by a fibrous capsule of tissue called a **glial
scar**]{.underline}. The Journal of Neuroscience Methods article states
the scar's purpose is believed to be separating "damaged neural tissue
from the rest of the body to maintain the blood-brain barrier."27 [This
capsule reduces]{.underline} the [signal]{.underline}recording ability
of the electrodes and sometimes results in the death of the particular
neuron, to the point where some BCIs become unusable [after]{.underline}
a few **[weeks]{.underline}**. Worth noting are many research efforts
attempting to solve the biocompatibility problem with tissue-response
modifying drugs and advanced material coatings like hydrogels (which
mimic soft body tissue).28 However, bodily response represents the most
significant challenge to achieving a chronic or long-term BCI in
clinical patients. Today's [BCIs are limited]{.underline} to clinical
studies under the close care of physicians. The [physicians have
to]{.underline} not only [work fast]{.underline} to gather data
[as]{.underline} the [encapsulation takes place but also]{.underline}
strictly [monitor]{.underline} the patient for a **[brain
infection]{.underline}**. Until the biocompatibility of medical devices
is improved, this challenge will likely limit the use of invasive BCIs
to clinical populations for the next decade. Therefore, this pushes DOD
and USAF near- and medium-term applications toward noninvasive methods.
The third challenge facing BCIs is overcoming [engineering hurdles to
achieve high signal resolution while also ensuring safety]{.underline}
with invasive methods. The goal with any BCI is to produce a
bidirectional communication with the brain. Often this is done via
electrodes interfacing directly with neurons. The objective is to
achieve high spatial and temporal resolution with the measurements. This
means knowledge of where and when the measurement happened. The more
electrodes that interface with the neurons, the higher the amount of
data the researcher receives. Three research areas categorize BCIs
today. The first is the insertion of an electrode that measures (or
excites) a single neuron. Electrode methods are invasive, requiring an
operation below the protective layer of skin that surrounds and protects
the brain. Electrodes are subject to tissue encapsulation and infection.
The second method involves taking measurements from the scalp using
electroencephalographic (EEG) activity.29 EEG methods are noninvasive
but are typically characterized by low spatial and temporal resolution.
The third method measures electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from the
surface of the brain rather than from inserting electrodes. An ECoG-mesh
would likely measure populations of neurons firing. This method is also
invasive but provides much higher measurement resolution than EEG
methods. Additionally, ECoG methods are useful for avoiding some of the
body's immune responses that create limitations for electrode methods.
In addition to resolution and safety, BCI engineering challenges also
exist in power consumption, biosecurity, communications methods
(wireless or wired), and decoder efficiency. [**Power consumption** and
biosecurity]{.underline} are fields that sometimes directly [compete
with each other]{.underline}. Typically medical devices strive for
[low-power consumption to reduce battery size and prolong
device]{.underline} [lifespan]{.underline}. However, there
[is]{.underline} an [inverse]{.underline} relationship
[between]{.underline} power requirements and efficient [biosecurity
measures]{.underline}, as [protecting signals through **encryption**
increases]{.underline} required [computations, driving the power
consumption up.]{.underline} [Wireless]{.underline} communication
methods are preferred over wired to reduce the chance of infection;
however, they [have]{.underline} their **[range
limitations]{.underline}** as the body is an excellent absorber of
electromagnetic radiation. Decoders are also a significant engineering
challenge, designed to accomplish the analyze and translate function of
a BCI. This is because [the brain is]{.underline} inherently
[plastic]{.underline}, meaning it can modify its structure and rewire
itself as we age. As a result, [the ability of a decoder to decipher the
intent]{.underline} [of neuronal firing]{.underline} patterns [will
**degrade** as the brain rewires]{.underline}.30 The decoder needs to be
able to understand and adapt to changes in the brain for the translate
function to work correctly. Otherwise, the decoder would need to be
retrained. These challenges are likely to be overcome as new methods for
low-power biosecurity and decoding brain signals are developed.
Additionally, advances in big data analytics and AI will help assist
bringing BCIs closer to reality. The fourth challenge involves
consideration of the [ethical, legal, and social implications
(ELSI]{.underline}) of BCIs, which [serves to **slow** the **growth** of
this technology]{.underline}. The ELSI process began as a research
program in the 1990s because of the HGP.31 The goal is to have an
independent assessment of the implications surrounding research. That
way, we may venture into the gray areas of acceptability, whether
ethically, socially, or legally. DARPA utilizes ELSI experts to help
"proactively identify potential issues related to the use of
neurotechnology."32 [These]{.underline} experts [supplement]{.underline}
the already [cumbersome]{.underline} process provided by [institutional
review boards]{.underline} (IRB). For the USAF, the review is
accomplished by the 711th Human Performance Wing's IRB out of
Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Their mission is to "facilitate excellence
in human performance and technological research that advances
war-fighting capabilities . . . by efficiently processing and
professionally evaluating proposals for scientific validity and
uncompromising protection of the rights and welfare of volunteer
subjects."33 Most would agree that the incorporation of a BCI to cure
disease, treat brain injury, or regain use of a lost limb are altruistic
efforts without ELSI concerns. These additional levels of review, though
necessary, serve to slow the development of BCIs and may ultimately
limit their applications when applied to healthy individuals. The four
challenges presented here represent hurdles that may slow, stop, or
divert this technology into something completely different than
expected. These [hurdles]{.underline} also [drive
uncertainty]{.underline} in the prediction of where this technology will
be in the next five, 10, or 20 years. Concerning the misconceptions
surrounding the brain and our biases created by Hollywood or
brain-computer metaphors, [efforts need to be taken to inform decision
makers what is within the realm of possibilities regarding
BCIs.]{.underline}

There is also a growing do-it-yourself ([DIY]{.underline})/
**[biohacking community]{.underline}** that [is dedicated to
modifying]{.underline} commercially available DTC products to perform
different functions, [and]{.underline}/or [creating]{.underline} new
[products capable of affecting neurobiological functions]{.underline}.
[Biohacking]{.underline} typically [implies modifications
for]{.underline} benevolent ends (i.e., "**[white-hat]{.underline}**"
[hacking]{.underline}), [inclusive of development of]{.underline}
**[agents and devices]{.underline}** [to **improve human
cognition**]{.underline}, **[emotion, and behavioral]{.underline}**
[performance]{.underline}. [However, there is also]{.underline} a
"**[black-hat]{.underline}**" [hacking]{.underline} community
[that]{.underline} engages DIY approaches to modifying neurobiology to
**[produce pathogens]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} to [incur other
disruptions]{.underline} in individual or community stability and
safety. [Biohacking can be articulated in]{.underline} three research
domains: [synthetic biology]{.underline} (e.g., genetic and molecular
editing); [biotechnology]{.underline} (human-machine interfaces,
technological implants, and prosthetics); [and biochemistry]{.underline}
(e.g., development of neurotropic agents that can be used either
singularly or in chemical cocktails). [These]{.underline} categories and
their products [are not mutually exclusive. DIY
scientists/biohackers]{.underline} often [work in coordination within an
informally organized community]{.underline}, and much of their [research
is made publicly available through]{.underline} open access [databases
and]{.underline} websites of [community laboratories]{.underline}. The
spirit of the DIY/biohacking community reflects a movement to make
biology "easier to engineer", and more publicly accessible and
available. In part, this is constituent to an expanding trend toward
"open source" biology that has influenced both research institutions and
the public. Additionally, "[open source" biology has captured an
economic]{.underline} market [niche]{.underline}: **[engineered and
modified organisms, drugs, and devices can be sold]{.underline}**;
[community laboratories can be purchased]{.underline} (by conventional
commercial entities); and both community laboratories and individual DIY
[biohackers can be subsidized]{.underline} through venture capital.
[With manuals and methods **available online**]{.underline}, [it
is]{.underline} relatively **[easy]{.underline}** [to establish and run
a laboratory, and interested individuals and groups can obtain guidance
on]{.underline} producing and/or manipulating a variety of
[neurobiological techniques and technologies]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} same opportunities also [pose]{.underline} potential
**[regulatory, health, and security risks]{.underline}**. [Independent
laboratories and researchers **do not**]{.underline} always **[abide
by]{.underline}** the comprehensive **[policies]{.underline}** [that
academic and industrial research entities must follow]{.underline}. As
well, [there is increasing use of the "dark web]{.underline}" (covertly
accessed Internet) by both "white-hat" and "black-hat" biohackers
[to]{.underline} facilitate [exchange]{.underline} of
[information]{.underline} in ways [that **impede
surveillance**]{.underline}. [This community presents particular
**dual-use** research concerns]{.underline} in that: 1. [outcomes and
products may be used or **misused** in ways that adversely impact
individual and **public health** and **safety**]{.underline}, [as well
as the integrity of]{.underline} flora and fauna in **[the
environment]{.underline}**; 2. [limitations]{.underline} and/or
lassitude [in]{.underline} research [practices and]{.underline}/or
laboratory [conditions]{.underline} may [incur]{.underline}
**[accidental release of]{.underline}** [information or]{.underline}
**[products]{.underline}** [that can pose health and environmental risks
and harms]{.underline}; and/or 3. [activities may be
subsidized]{.underline} [and]{.underline} outcomes and [products
utilized]{.underline} [by national and non-state venture capitalists
with explicit intent toward disrupting public safety, stability, and
health.]{.underline} [These]{.underline} possibilities evoke security
concerns on local, national, and international scales, and have
[warranted]{.underline} involvement of [crime prevention and public
safety agencies]{.underline} (e.g., the United States Federal Bureau of
Investigation) to establish dialogue with, and insight to the DIY
biohacking community. What is important to note is that [neuroscientific
and neurotechnological research and development is occurring on a
variety of levels]{.underline} (from large scale academic and industrial
laboratories to individual DIY experimenters) [and is]{.underline}
**[international]{.underline}**. In this latter regard, it has been
estimated that [a significant and growing percentage of neuroscientific
and technical research and development will be engaged]{.underline}
**[outside of the West]{.underline}** by 2025. This increases the
possibility for [dual-use research]{.underline} and DURC, and [generates
questions about what constitutes research for security
purposes]{.underline} (i.e., preparatory defense) [versus]{.underline}
military/[warfare]{.underline} (i.e., offensive capability)
[purposes]{.underline}.

**[LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS]{.underline}** [Inevitably, there will be
**instances** in which]{.underline} NGT and NI, as any new
[**neurotechnology**, will **fail** or incur **unexpected**, **adverse
effects**. How will **uncertainties**]{.underline}, the mechanistic
paradox, [and]{.underline} the [tech]{.underline}nological [imperative
figure in to these situations and relate to]{.underline} constructs of
[**responsibility** and potential culpability for resultant
harms]{.underline}? The question is difficult in [that it involves
practical, moral, and legal dimensions]{.underline}--- each with
somewhat varying premises. On the practical level, it is important to
consider that [any new technique or technology can manifest a variety of
potential consequences (and]{.underline}, therefore, [potential harms)
given]{.underline} the conditions of [novelty]{.underline}.
Axiomatically, [novelty entails]{.underline} some level of
[**uncertainty** and **unpredictability**]{.underline}, and [this may be
**amplified** given]{.underline} the [intersecting unknowns of
**neuroscience**, **genetics**, and **neurotechnology**]{.underline}
(Giordano 2010a, 2010b). [In the **moral domain**]{.underline}, it is
[important to examine]{.underline} the [role of the physician as a
steward of expert knowledge and to assess whether such stewardship has
been upheld in evaluating the contingencies of using or not using a
given neurotechnology in the care of a particular patient.]{.underline}
Thus, although a number of potential neurotechnologies, Neurogenetic and
Neural Tissue-Implantation Technology 63 including NGT and NI, could be
employed (based on the current state of research, product development,
and availability in the clinical milieu), the [**therapeutic** and
**moral fabric** of the medical fiduciary dictates that the physician
must discern whether and which **neurotechnologies** should be used to
**afford** each patient **maximal good.** Even in the **most ideal
situations**, negative outcomes are **possible**]{.underline}, and if
the regnant medical climate portends the future, then it is likely that
there will be at least some call for legal responsibility and
accountability for such occurrences. But [given the relative novelty of
these techniques and technologies, who can and **should** be held
legally responsible---the **companies** that produce devices and
implements used in NGT or NI?]{.underline} In light of the recent
groundswell of class-action suits against medical device and
pharmaceutical firms, [it is probable that companies involved in NGT,
NI, and related **neurotechnological development** will seek to
**insure** and **fortify** against any legal culpability for
**unanticipated** or **adverse** effects that these technologies might
incur]{.underline}. Prima facie, [the provision of informed
consent]{.underline} might [absolve physicians of]{.underline} (at
least) [legal responsibility for effects gone wrong]{.underline};
however, [this then reinitiates the discussion of how much information a
physician can provide]{.underline} (given the newness of these
interventions) [and should provide]{.underline} (given the intersecting
uncertainties and range of adverse effects they could evoke). And what
about patients? [How should]{.underline} those for whom other [forms of
**therapeutic intervention**]{.underline} have been unsuccessful
[approach]{.underline} the use of such [new techniques and
technologies]{.underline}? Of course, [this fosters a larger question
of]{.underline} just [how much information is enough]{.underline}, and
[how the **amount**, **type**, and **quality** of information relevant
to a particular intervention is weighed in]{.underline} patients'
overall [estimation of possible benefits and acceptable burdens and

[Since World War II, tech]{.underline}nology [superiority has been a
major landmark of the U.S. military]{.underline}.75 As I have shown,
[**human enhancement** is one of the most rapidly growing areas of
tech]{.underline}nology [with **military significance**]{.underline}.
[Successful implementation of human enhancement
tech]{.underline}nologies [will give the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [or any country]{.underline} that successfully
harnesses them, [an **undeniable advantage** over their opponents in
**warfare**]{.underline}. They have the potential to make it easier and
safer for soldiers to perform in combat but [they]{.underline} also
[have the potential to disrupt the international balance of
power]{.underline}. [In the future, the strength and power of a military
won't be judged purely by its size or skill, but also on the quality of
its enhanced soldiers]{.underline}. According to experts,76 "a weapon
system can no longer be evaluated or enhanced in isolation from its
human operator."77 [Soldiers are becoming a part of the
weapon]{.underline}. In short, "the complexity of combat has increased,
and with it the tempo of operations."78 [The international implications
are likely to be **two-fold**]{.underline}. On the one hand, [countries
that can afford to develop these technologies will]{.underline} all [be
racing against each other to develop human enhancement
tech]{.underline}nologies [the fastest and most efficient ways
possibly]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} likely [result is an **HET arms
race** between the wealthiest countries in the world]{.underline}. In
the past, arms races have had favorable results for advancing military
technologies. However, **[hasty implementation]{.underline}** before a
technology has been adequately tested or refined [can have **deadly
consequences**]{.underline}. This is especially true when human beings
are an integral part of the technology. The United States isn't the only
country pursuing human enhancement technology. [**China** and **Russia**
are likely to move much more quickly]{.underline} on this technology
than most other countries, but it is unlikely that other international
actors will be as open as the U.S. about what they are doing. The
advantage this technology provides will not likely go unnoticed. [There
is a potential threat "for adversaries to exploit advances in
H]{.underline}uman [P]{.underline}erformance [M]{.underline}odification,
[and]{.underline} thus [create a **threat to national
security**]{.underline}."79 [In creating new tech]{.underline}nologies
that benefit a state, [you're opening up that tech]{.underline}nology
[for potential **proliferation**]{.underline}. Once it has been created,
unless there is a standing governing body to police it, **[there is no
way of controlling who will get their hands on it]{.underline}**.
According to David Axe, "it's equally hard to tell to which terrorists,
militants and criminal groups these countries might have ties---and
whether new biological weaponry might proliferate these channels."80
With a lack of transparency[**, international mistrust** is likely to
stew]{.underline}. The second potential implication deals with the
relationship between the haves and the have-nots. [Countries that aren't
one of the first]{.underline} several [to implement h]{.underline}uman
[e]{.underline}nhancement [t]{.underline}echnologie[s]{.underline} in
the military [are likely to feel threatened by the increasing gap
between]{.underline} their **[military power]{.underline}** and the
military power of countries with HET. The [increase in power may seem
like a **provocation**]{.underline}. Thus, in the 21st century [the
development of h]{.underline}uman [e]{.underline}nhancement
[t]{.underline}echnology may also [trigger a **security dilemma**
between less technologically developed countries and superpowers like
the U.S]{.underline}.

[Future human enhancements would be obtained by]{.underline} different
means such as [genetic engineering, pharmacology, information
technology, molecular nanotech]{.underline}nology [or
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence.6 Transhumanists hope
that through the responsible use of science, technology and other
rational means we shall eventually manage to become posthuman. They
would develop a being with vastly greater capacities than current humans
have.7 It requires that everybody should have the opportunity to become
posthuman and that people should have the right to choose which
technologies they want to employ to become more developed.8 Bostrom
suggests about genetic enhancements: "We might speculate, instead, that
germ-line enhancements will lead to more love and parental dedication.
Some mothers and fathers might find it easier to love a child who,
thanks to enhancements, is bright, beautiful, healthy, and happy. The
practice of germ-line enhancement might lead to better treatment of
people with disabilities, because a general demystification of the
genetic contributions to human traits could make it clearer that people
with disabilities are not to blame for their disabilities and a
decreased incidence of some disabilities could lead to more assistance
being available for the remaining affected people to enable them to live
full, unrestricted lives through various technological and social
supports. Speculating about possible psychological or cultural effects
of germ-line engineering can therefore cut both ways. Good consequences
no less than bad ones are possible. In the absence of sound arguments
for the view that the negative consequences would predominate, such
speculations provide no reason against moving forward with the
technology."9 While [future tech]{.underline}nological
[capabilities]{.underline} carry immense potential for beneficial
deployments, they [could]{.underline} also [be misused and cause
enormous harm,]{.underline} to the extreme of [causing the
**extinction** of intelligent life]{.underline}. The [greatest future
risks are anthropogenic]{.underline}, not from nature. [Destructive uses
of advanced]{.underline} molecular [nanotech]{.underline}nology[,
designer pathogens, nuclear arms race,]{.underline} high-energy physics
experiments, and enhancing AI with an inappropriate goal system could
[cause the **world to end in a bang**]{.underline}.10 Other potentially
negative [outcomes]{.underline} include: [widening social
inequalities]{.underline}, a gradual [erosion of]{.underline} meaningful
[human relationships, and ecological diversity]{.underline}. Such risks
must be taken very seriously .11 The way in which we can avoid
existential disaster is by thoroughly controlling our evolution. It will
require the development of a singleton or a world order with one
independent decision making power. Permanent control of human
development requires global and solid coordination.12

pandemic will undoubtedly alter international biodefense efforts such as
pandemic preparedness and response. But states should be wary of
expanding biodefense infrastructure without properly addressing
advancements in biotechnology that could inflate the "[gray

of biodefense. The **[unclear distinction between]{.underline}**

biodefense task]{.underline}** **[means states have to consider the
capabilities and intentions of their adversaries]{.underline}**,
**[which are all the more unclear in a great power

threat](https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/04/17/new-killer-pathogens-countering-coming-bioweapons-threat-pub-76009) of
new gene-editing technologies such as Crispr, coupled with advancements
in synthetic biology, has not gone unnoticed. Crispr is a relatively
cheap and efficient genome editing tool that allows scientists to modify
and permanently alter DNA and RNA. Crispr is utilized
in [research](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/genomicresearch/genomeediting) on
the treatment of diseases such as cystic fibrosis, heart disease, and
even HIV. A biotechnology tool with clear promise, concerns over Crispr
are rooted in fear of unintended consequences, and in the potential for
nefarious actors to weaponize deadly pathogens. Concerns over synthetic
biology, the broad term used to describe the construction of new
"[biological entities](https://ebrc.org/what-is-synbio/)" from scratch,
cite similar worries over how an adversary could manipulate this new
technology. In the 2018 [National Defense
Strategy](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf) (NDS)
that laid the conceptual foundations for the revival of great power
competition, the United States named biotechnology as a technology that
alters the rapidly changing security environment, providing wider
accessibility of potential weapons to more actors. The U.S. director of
National Intelligence first included genome editing in a [2016 threat
assessment](https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/SSCI_Unclassified_2016_ATA_SFR%20_FINAL.pdf),
signaling the potential of dual-use biotechnology to have national
security implications if deliberately or unintentionally misused. More
recently, the United
States[ listed](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2020-Adherence-to-and-Compliance-with-Arms-Control-Nonproliferation-and-Disarmament-Agreements-and-Commitments-Compliance-Report-1.pdf) China,
Russia, and Iran as countries engaged in dual-use biotechnology research
with potential, but unconfirmed, implications for the Biological Weapons
Convention, or the BWC. The 2020 report also included a direct
indictment of North Korea as a country with an offensive biological
weapons program. This apprehension goes both ways. General fears
concerning the development of "genetic weapons" have appeared in
official Russian military rhetoric throughout the last two decades. In
2006, Russia submitted
a[ paper](https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/81FD1E9FD2A3A535C12571FE00499319/$file/BWC-6RC-S&T-RUSSIA-E-UNOFFICIAL.pdf) to
the Sixth BWC Review Conference on the possibility of advancements in
technology leading to the creation of "ethnic weapons." President
Vladimir Putin has
made[statements](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/24825) on
the potential of biotechnology to transform weapons and defense.
Russia's 2015 [National Security
Strategy](http://www.ieee.es/Galerias/fichero/OtrasPublicaciones/Internacional/2016/Russian-National-Security-Strategy-31Dec2015.pdf) highlighted
the threatening presence of U.S. military-biological laboratories on
Russian borders as well as the importance of developing critical
technologies such as genetic engineering for national security purposes.
**[China and Russia's commitment to [a high-tech
partnership](https://warontherocks.com/2020/08/the-resilience-of-sino-russian-high-tech-cooperation/) could
also contribute to the perceived ambiguity over dual-use
biotechnology]{.underline}**. The two countries agreed to collaborate on
the advancement of technologies such as artificial intelligence,
neuroscience, and biotechnology, as a means to strengthen their
"strategic partnership." But both China and Russia have signaled a
willingness to engage bilaterally with the United States on
biotechnology innovation, which could help promote transparency. China
bolstered its investment in biotechnology as a part of the [Made in

which benefitted U.S.-based biotechnology firms on the receiving end of
increased funding in 2018. That same year, the U.S. Committee on Foreign
Investments (CFIUS) added biotechnology to a list of industries with
restricted foreign direct investment, predominantly to [curb Chinese

protect intellectual property. Instead of promoting scientific exchange
and collaboration, this decision may have made international
biotechnology research more opaque. **[The U.S. military's investment in
biotechnology for biodefense also doesn't provide the needed assurance
to assuage state fears over dual-use research]{.underline}**. The
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or
DARPA's,[ interest](https://thebulletin.org/2018/07/darpas-prepare-program-preparing-for-what/) in
utilizing biotechnology for the improvement of the warfighter, along
with initiatives to [enhance

amend supply chain vulnerabilities using synthetic biology could
contribute to the biotechnology ambiguity dilemma. That **[states are
threatened by the potential dual-uses of biotechnology is
clear]{.underline}**, but how much they are willing to reveal about
their own capabilities is less certain. New avenues for discussion are
badly needed. The role of the BWC. The threat of dual-use biotechnology
has occupied the imaginations of state parties to the Biological Weapons
Convention since its inception in 1975. Now past its forty-fifth
anniversary, the BWC institutionalized a norm against the use,
development, and stockpiling of biological weapons. Review conferences,
held every five years, were created in part to address new developments
in science and technology as they pertain to the authority of the
convention. Annual intersessional meetings for continuing discussions
between BWC review conferences were added in 2007, but their
productivity has been questionable. A
2016 [study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/23779497.2016.1213135?needAccess=true) following
the progress of science and technology discussions, one of the
intersessional agenda items for the 2012-2015 period, found that an
average of only 4.5 hours a year was devoted to the topic. The 2016
review conference was prepared to address developments in science and
technology in its final report, but the Iranian
delegation [refused](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2017-01/news/disputes-mire-bwc-review-conference) to
advance discussions unless member states agreed to return to protocol
negotiations (a strategy that some analysts believe was a protest of the
continued sanctions on its nuclear program). Efforts to introduce a
verification protocol to monitor compliance with the BWC collapsed in
2001, and lack of a binding enforcement mechanism in the convention is
often cited as the BWC's biggest shortcoming. Iran's uncooperative
stance prevented state parties from producing a consensus document at
the end of the review conference and establishing an intersessional
program of work. As a result, the 2017 Meeting of State Parties was used
for this purpose, and substantive discussions were delayed until 2018.
While states did briefly discuss the dangerous potential of advancing
biotechnology applications in
their [2018](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-09/news/experts-debate-biological-weapons-challenges) and [2019](https://undocs.org/en/bwc/msp/2019/mx.2/2)meetings,
any definitive agreements will have to wait for the 2021 review
conference. Shrinking the gray zone. It is not surprising that a flood
of [analyses](https://warontherocks.com/2020/05/the-pandemic-and-americas-response-to-future-bioweapons/) and [op-eds](https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/23/the-havoc-wrought-by-covid-19-will-spark-new-concern-over-bio-weapons) are
considering how the pandemic might compare to or inspire the use of
sophisticated biological weapons, despite its natural origins. COVID-19
has certainly provided a partial answer to a question undoubtedly asked
by BW "[red
teams](https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/Center-projects/red-teaming-global-catastrophic-biological-risks.html)"
for decades: what could a global pandemic do to the international order
and the stability of nation-states? Malicious actors need not imagine
the consequences. That the U.S. State Department [overtly
implied](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pompeo-enormous-evidence-unproven-theory-coronavirus-lab/story?id=70472857) the
possibility that the COVID-19 virus was intentionally released from a
Chinese lab highlights the diplomatic challenges of addressing a
biological event, and the need to establish working pathways to avoid
escalation. Addressing and institutionalizing the analysis of
biotechnology is the necessary first step toward ensuring state parties
remain in sync on the changing relationship between biodefense,
biotechnology, and pandemic response. As a catalyst for change, the
COVID-19 pandemic could push states to make real progress in the 2021
review conference, but not without productive Meetings of Experts and
State Parties beforehand. Originally scheduled to occur in August and
December 2020, respectively, the two intersessional meetings have
been [moved](https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/A9F47CAD01A4E48BC12585BD0023D6A0/$file/Chairs+letter+28.07.20.pdf) to
December 2020 and April 2021 because of the pandemic, with the Ninth
Review Conference still scheduled to take place the following November.
At a minimum, states need to be prepared to imbed a permanent
biotechnology working group into the convention to continually address
and evaluate the impact of new technology. Otherwise, questions over
whether new developments in synthetic biology are [covered by the
convention](https://www.lawfareblog.com/some-synthetic-biology-may-not-be-covered-biological-weapons-convention) will
continue to make states worried about their adversaries research
developments, which could further encourage a biotechnology arms race.
The biggest challenge for the 2021 review conference will be getting
member states on the same page. The global impact of the COVID-19
pandemic will undoubtedly affect discussions and augment nations like
Iran's push for a verification protocol. States aren't likely to build a
consensus on this contentious issue before the next review conference,
and time spent on this issue will be wasted. States can't wait another
five years to address the rapidly changing pace of biotechnology. The
protocol question needs to be put on hold. States also shouldn't avoid
addressing the inevitable overlap between responding to natural versus
intentional biological episodes. Russia has maintained that [discussing
natural
epidemics](https://www.unog.ch/80256EDD006B8954/(httpAssets)/1320B623DA211B86C125795E002FF953/$file/Russia.pdf) has
no role at the BWC, but because strengthening biodefense is the best
response to both problems, bolstering biodefense without dialogue
creates a precarious security environment. Clarifying the intersection
between natural and deliberate pandemic response could help states gage
how their own biodefense efforts complement international biodefense
coordination. If states better understand their national role and
responsibilities in the international biodefense regime, they will be
less inclined to pursue unilateral defense initiatives with obscure
research trajectories. There is no doubt that biotechnology innovation
is essential, and military improvements are a natural progression of
advancing technology and research. But the return of **[great power
competition invites the creation of arms races in]{.underline}** new
frontiers, **[biotechnology]{.underline}** included. **[If individual
actors are left to]{.underline}** **[make assumptions
about]{.underline}** the potential **[dual-use
capabilities]{.underline}** **[of an adversary's
biotechnology]{.underline}** research, **[they]{.underline}**
**[will]{.underline}** have to **[assume the worst]{.underline}**. A
consensus approach to the growing dangers associated with biotechnology
could provide the necessary fodder to unite states for a shared
commitment to transparency. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us the
potential for a biological incident to upend global stability, and the
implications are sobering. States just might have their common ground.

#### Turn: Human enhancement in the military causes flood of issues: arms race, military divide, and kills cohesion

Implications for Geopolitics, Human Enhancement and Human Destiny
\[Transhumanism and War,

**[Human enhancement technologies are]{.underline}** expanding the
frontiers of biotechnology and **[changing the nature of
warfare]{.underline}**, **[international relations and
geopolitics]{.underline}**. Human enhancement refers to the suite of
techniques which alter the human body beyond its normal healthy state.
While 'therapy' is meant to 'fix' or 'heal' something damaged,
enhancement technologies aim to stimulate and augment the human body
beyond its natural capacities. Some of the possibilities available soon,
such as "personality pills", super-intelligent machines or gene therapy
to block normal aging, come with extremely disruptive side effects. As
is frequently the case with technological innovation, the origins of
enhancement technologies are closely linked to military research.
Soldiers equipped with devices for increased muscle strength, better
pain management or extra-alertness make ideal combatants. Yet whilst
administering pills that enable stress resistance or erase
post-traumatic stress might seem like ideal quick fixes, they raise
profound ethical and security concerns. In their most extreme form,
**[such techniques could push us]{.underline}** beyond what it means to
be human, effectively bringing us **[on the brink of
transhumanism]{.underline}**. **[Transhumanism challenges the very
notion of the human condition as fixed, rooted and
constant.]{.underline}**
[Interventions](http://isnblog.ethz.ch/security/inevitable-transhumanism-how-emerging-strategic-technologies-will-affect-the-future-of-humanity)
to improve our bodies, modify our pleasure centres, eradicate pathogenic
conditions, enhance cognitive functions or extend life will eventually
alter emotions (e.g. fear) which are the result of millennia of
evolution. The rise of the super soldier -- at any cost The search for
performance optimization via human enhancement in the military is not
new. Stimulant drugs have been used in the army for decades. For
instance,
[amphetamine](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a352591.pdf), a
synthetic drug which enhances the neurotransmitters adrenalin and
noradrenalin, started being widely available to US troops in the 1960s
for its effects in enhancing alertness and physical endurance. More
recently, in an effort to find safer alternatives, the military has
switched to the use of modafinil, a drug first used by US troops during
the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
[Modafinil](http://ethics.calpoly.edu/greenwall_report.pdf) acts as a
psycho-stimulant, enhances vigilance and overall cognitive and physical
performance even in sleep-deprived individuals. It is estimated that the
UK Ministry of Defence purchased 24,000 modafinil tablets in 2004. Apart
from the use of such enhancements in the military, we are increasingly
witnessing the rise of technologies that can alter human biology
irreversibly, especially by incorporating technology within the human
body. Such technologies are radically different from previous eras as
they are much more invasive and potentially irreversible, marking a new
phase in the quest to create super soldiers. The US Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is now at the forefront of developing
enhancement technologies. In the early 1990s, DARPA acquired an avid
interest in biology. DARPA's turn to [biotechnology and
biomimetics](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.03/bemore.html)
(getting inspiration from nature, the animal world and metabolic
flexibility) is now well on track, and garnering growing federal
funding. For the fiscal year 2015, DARPA's [proposed
budget](http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2014/03/05.aspx)
request was of 2.915 billion, a steady increase from previous years. The
projects for human augmentation resulted from the recognition that even
with the most sophisticated weapons, war remains dependent on soldiers
that are subject to physical, cognitive, or psychological
vulnerabilities. This sentiment was openly expressed by the Agency,
which stated that the human being was "[the weakest link in Defense
systems](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cb0d02d0-b894-11e2-869f-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3Oue8GUpr)".
[Techno-integration](http://publica.fraunhofer.de/documents/N-194631.html)
became critical to achieving this purpose. This requires creating a
symbiotic coupling between men and machines in order to enhance physical
and cognitive fitness. This mostly concerned restorative medicine for a
long time, but more recent advances in neural integration bring about
the real possibility that the peripheral nervous system could be coupled
with advanced technology with a simple plug. An extreme form of invasive
technology currently being explored is a [micro-processing
chip](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4572.htm) which
can be implanted beneath the skull and manipulated remotely. Experiments
with so-called "[non-invasive brain
stimulation](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/pentagon-experiments-with-electric-shocks-to-keep-drone-pilots-awake-9144361.html)"
at the US Air Force Research Lab, made public in early 2014, tried a new
technique to keep soldiers awake and alert with electric shocks. The
results were promising: the electro-stimulation tested much better than
the mere use of caffeine. The doses of electrical current were carefully
controlled and succeeded in making soldiers wide-awake, refreshed and
alert for as long as 30 hours. Although still at an experimental stage,
the initiative proves that hijacking the brain for the end of military
effectiveness will be used justify whatever scientific means. The basics
of
[neuro-stimulation](http://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2013/oct/07/neuroscience-psychology)
now allow us to employ methods to boost our ability to learn, pay
attention to the environment, better recall information, take risks or
exercise self-control. The amount of knowledge we have on the frontal
cortex already permits us to understand how to influence cognitive
processes. Two major approaches are Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
(TMS) and Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) and the latter
is already in use by the US military to improve the [performance of
drone pilots](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27343047). However,
scientists caution that TMS and TDS can produce many unintended effects.
The military's ambitions could soon catch up with the neuro-stimulation
technology to the extent that soldiers' reactions, responsiveness and
emotionality could be pre-programmed with precision. They could become
faster, more agile, alert, more receptive and fast learners, more
disciplined or docile or, if needed, less empathetic. Other projects
pursued by DARPA in partnership with various universities across the
United States include [programs such
as](http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2010/12/robots-ethics-war):
"Accelerated Learning", "Crystalline Cellulose Conversion to Glucose"
(enabling humans to eat grass and other non-digestible plants),
"Human-aided optical recognition", (neuro-optical binoculars to detect
threats), "RealNose", (extra sensors to detect chemicals as accurately
as a dog) and "Z-Man" (allowing humans to climb up walls like lizards).
While DARPA officially claims these projects are without invasive mental
or physical effects, controversies abound and many questions about their
long-lasting implications remain open. [Human
nature](http://www.sustainablehistory.com/emotional-amoral-egoism) is
frail, vulnerable and less adaptable than other species. It is therefore
not surprising that DARPA would explicitly defend human enhancement
projects based on a pragmatic calculation of cost, time and military
effectiveness: "the idea is not simply to replace people with machines,
but to team people with robots to create a more capable, agile and
cost-effective force that lowers the risks of US casualties."
Implications for international relations and geopolitics With these
developments, questions of law, international competition and ethics
will become more prominent as both states and societies will have to
respond to these technologies and their risks of spinning out of
control. **[Enhancement raises many ethical 'red flags']{.underline}**:
how far will the imperative of "[military
necessity](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/more-than-human-the-ethics-of-biologically-enhancing-soldiers/253217/)"
go in justifying biotechnological enhancement that would otherwise be
considered unacceptable? Could soldiers become dehumanized tools,
coerced into whatever is necessary to wage war? Are safety
considerations taken into account, and are norms of ethical medical
conduct extended to all enhancement technologies? Moreover, it will be
critical to explore whether enhancement is reversible or not and to what
extent a transhumanist soldier can switch back to the 'pre-enhanced'
state. Considerations of **[risks from enhancement and transhumanism
have been largely absent from the military]{.underline}**, but it is
high time the military gave more considerations to the ethical aspects
of enhancing soldiers. These should cover both long-term consequences
for the soldiers' health, as well as the **[inequalities created between
enhanced and non-enhanced soldiers]{.underline}**, since **[enhanced
soldiers might eventually need to be treated differently from the
average]{.underline}**, non-enhanced **[soldiers]{.underline}**.
**[[Questions of
responsibility](http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Articles/Detail/?lng=en&id=187086)
will ensue as well]{.underline}**. **[Should]{.underline}** the
**[enhanced soldier run out of control]{.underline}**, **[who will be
accountable]{.underline}**: the soldier, the engineer or medical teams
that enhanced him? Pressure could soon mount for the US to have an
ethical review of its enhancement programs, an expectation that is
easier to foresee in a country where demands for accountability can be
consequential even in an institution as secretive as the Army. However,
this might not be the case everywhere, which brings the need for global
discussions and standard-setting for enhancement technologies. **[Human
enhancement will be disruptive for the entire military
establishment]{.underline}** **[and have far-reaching international
relations and geopolitical consequences]{.underline}**. [At a unit
level](http://ethics.calpoly.edu/greenwall_report.pdf), **[war-fighters
might be enhanced differently]{.underline}**, or selectively,
**[creating thus a class of enhanced vs. "normal"
soldiers]{.underline}**. **[This will affect morale and unit cohesion
drastically]{.underline}**, potentially **[causing
resentment]{.underline}** in some and a false sense of entitlement in
others. **[Such asymmetry of capabilities will also reflect in
international competition]{.underline}** and international law, where
**[countries benefiting from advanced technologies of enhancement will
possess an advantage over those who will continue relying on
non-enhanced soldiers.]{.underline}** In the more near future, the
implications of human enhancement in international relations could
entail similar reactions to those provoked by the extensive [use of
drones](http://ethics.calpoly.edu/greenwall_report.pdf) by the United
States. **[While one country might regard enhancement as justifiable,
appropriate and defensible, others could perceive it as an unjust use of
capabilities]{.underline}**. **[This will further exacerbate the sense
of illegitimacy in war and disproportionate material and human
loss.]{.underline}** At the same time, and as was the case with other
technologies**[, it is not improbable to anticipate a race of
development]{.underline}** and acquisition **[of human
enhancement]{.underline}** **[technologies]{.underline}** by many other
countries in the coming decades, **[thus further complicating
international conflict resolution]{.underline}**, code of conduct and
international law. In addition, given the potential effects of these
technologies on emotions, remorselessness and increased physical power
(for instance through the use of powered exoskeletons), it should be
expected that the level of brutality in warfare could increase
significantly, thus complicating the implementation of international
treaties and post-conflict reconciliation and reconstruction efforts.

### 1NC -- Cohesion Turn

#### Turn: Cell Research is highly controversial across Europe -- causes infighting

Rosario **Isasi** et al. **6-7**-22 1Dr John T Macdonald Foundation

ethically sensitive cells and the evolution of European stem cell
policy, <https://doi.org/10.2217/rme-2022-0043>\]//WA

The past decades witnessed the slow evolution of Europe\'s heterogeneous
stem cell (SC) policy and substantial scientific advances in the field.
Parallel to these developments, professional organizations have grown in
influence. With the recently revised International Society for Stem Cell
Research\'s Guidelines as a backdrop, we address the evolution of SC
policies in 46 European countries and discuss how they fare against
evolving ethical standards, societal views, and scientific advances. We
identify areas of convergence, divergence, and the suitability of extant
governance mechanisms to meet their stewardship roles. Europe represents
a rich case study as it encompasses a wide range of policy approaches
present worldwide. Comparative studies provide an opportunity to promote
insight into national frameworks and to foster international
harmonization. Plain language summary **[European countries
have]{.underline}** adopted different types of **[rules]{.underline}**
or policies, including laws and professional standards, **[to
regulate]{.underline}** stem **[cell research]{.underline}**. These
differences are because **[each country has different]{.underline}**
history and **[cultures]{.underline}**. Also, **[individuals and
institutions]{.underline}** (e.g., **[religious leaders, politicians and
advocacy organizations]{.underline}**) **[have]{.underline}** different
degrees of **[power to influence the type of policies]{.underline}**
that are adopted in each country. Over the past decades, stem **[cell
policies have evolved slowly]{.underline}** even with significant
scientific advances. Yet, during this time, professional organizations
have grown in influence, for example, the prominent International
Society for Stem Cell Research, whose guidelines (or rules) are
considered 'best practices' in the field. In this article, we identify
and analyze stem cell policies in 46 European countries, comparing them
against the International Society for Stem Cell Research\'s new
Guidelines. In addition, we show the similarities and differences
amongst these policies. Europe presents an interesting case study
because the region includes a wide typology of policies like those
adopted in the rest of the world, making this comparison useful for
other countries as they consider the suitability of their own policies.
In Europe, the stem cell research--clinical translation continuum is
characterized by a heterogeneity of governance and policy frameworks
reflecting the continent\'s diverse socio-cultural, economic and
historical contexts. In the region, national and international sets of
'hard' (e.g., legislation, treaties) laws are supplemented by 'soft'
ones (e.g., professional guidelines, funding policies, codes of conduct)
offering different tools for enforceability and governance. Importantly,
regardless of the approach, ethical considerations have acquired
substantial importance as a normative tool for European policy making
\[[1](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B1)\].
Similarly, the public and the patient advocacy community have also
gained prominence as influential policy actors, while professional
organizations have maintained their persuasive role. Globally,
scientific advances in the stem cell (SC) field have occurred in
parallel with the growth of professional organizations operating at the
national and international stage. With different degrees of success,
these entities have exerted influence in shaping the contours of
responsible innovation, and thereby, fostering adaptive policy and
governance. A notable example of this is the International Society for
Stem Cell Research (ISSCR), whose Guidelines on stem cell research and
clinical translation (hereafter: Guidelines)
\[[2](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B2)\]
provide contemporary scientific, ethical and policy standards. Indeed,
globally, ISSCR guidelines have been deemed more than metaphorically
'customary law' ever since their inception in 2006, as they have
continued to gain legitimacy by raising awareness of ethical challenges,
guiding scientific practice, and aiding in the interpretation and
implementation of policy. Recently, ISSCR updated its Guidelines,
adopting strict recommendations for the regulation of clinical research
and translation of SC-based interventions and substantially
reconfiguring guidance for oversight of in vitro SC projects. Despite
criticisms based on the absence of enforcement mechanisms and internal
consistency
\[[3](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B3),[4](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B4)\],
among other reasons, the revised Guidelines have the potential to exert
influence in policy developments as they are designed to reflect
community standards and, in that way, they aim to complement national
frameworks for research governance. Moreover, although both hard and
soft laws affect the actual practice of SC research, it is unclear how
European policy frameworks fare against evolving international norms
represented, for instance, in the ISSCR guidelines. In addition, it is
unclear how and why policies within European countries diverge and
converge. Insights into these practices could lead to understanding
possible gaps, contradictions and difficulties in governance and policy.
Moreover, it could offer insights into how governance systems could
equip researchers to act responsibly during the innovation process. In
pursuit of these insights, this article addresses the evolution of SC
policies in 46 European countries. With the Guidelines as a backdrop, we
discuss central ethical and policy issues regarding contentious
applications, including criteria for permissibility, oversight, and
enforcement mechanisms. Comparative studies provide an opportunity to
promote insight into national frameworks and to foster international
harmonization. The European region represents a rich case-study as it
encompasses a wide range of policy approaches present across the globe.
Thus, evaluating areas of convergence, divergence and progression in
this region can contribute to policy debates and development worldwide.
Legislative building blocks past & present With no single policy
comprehensively addressing SC across the entire research cycle, European
SC policy frameworks are constituted by (i) a broad cluster of laws,
directives, principles and norms governing assisted reproductive
technologies (ART), biobanking, biomedical and genetics research which
(ii) traverse the permissive to restrictive continuum (Appendix A
Governance Approaches). Underpinning these models are foundational
principles reflecting a society\'s common vision, moral values, and
beliefs. Moreover, a 'common Ethics' in the SC field is apparent from
the ongoing adoption of research funding frameworks
\[[5](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B5)\],
which include provisions for the inescapably controversial human
embryonic SC (hESC) research as well as with the 1997 passing of the
European Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine
\[[6](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B6)\].
**[Across Europe]{.underline}**, as in other regions, the regulation
**[of SC research]{.underline}** **[has]{.underline}** generally
**[followed]{.underline}** a linear path, **[with
discussions]{.underline}** **[surrounding]{.underline}** **[the
human]{.underline}** embryo**[\'s]{.underline}** **[biological,
moral]{.underline}** and legal **[status]{.underline}** as an early
central figure in the framing of socio-ethical debates and policy
outcomes (e.g. Germany\'s Embryo Protection Act; Belgium\'s Law relating
to research on embryo in vitro). This approach stems from the fact that
early policy was embedded within normative frameworks governing ART
(e.g. in Estonia
\[[7](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B7)\]
and Greece
\[[8](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B8)\]).
As such, primary goals have centered on preserving human dignity (e.g.,
preventing commodification, protecting the interests of unborn children)
as well as integrity (e.g., cloning
\[[9](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B9)\]
and genetic engineering bans). During these early stages,
**[policy]{.underline}** reforms **[reacted to changes in societal
perceptions]{.underline}** (e.g., toward biological parenthood) and
increased technological uptake which required the promotion of the right
to benefit from scientific advances and to protect welfare interests
(e.g., facilitating ART research or expanding access to related
services)
\[[10](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B10)\].
Similarly, striving to reach political compromises, European policy
moved to regulate hESC research with blanket bans (e.g., Lithuania
\[[11](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B11)\]),
moratoria (e.g., The Netherlands
\[[12](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B12)\])
or strict laws guided by the principles of proportionality and
subsidiarity as pillars (e.g. UK, Czechia, France)
\[[13](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B13),[14](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B14)\].
From European funding policies to national laws, the passage of time has
not altered this decisive criterion: the use of embryos (and gametes) is
justified if it is the only means to achieve important scientific goals
for societal benefits. Furthermore, early socio-ethical debates on
genetic engineering, reproductive and research cloning were also
influential in the framing of policy responses
\[[15](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B15)\]
as reflected in the adoption of the Oviedo Convention
\[[16](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B16)\].
Importantly, the debates that took place during these times have now
been revisited with the advent of gene editing tools and the emergence
of SC-based embryo modeling as developments unforeseen by policymakers.
Stem cell-based embryo modeling & beyond Contemporaneous developments in
SC-based embryo modeling
\[[17](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B17)\],
organoid
\[[18](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B18)\]
and human--animal chimera research
\[[19](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B19)\]
have triggered calls for policy review
\[[20](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B20)\]
based on fears of potential loopholes inadvertently allowing
controversial research to proceed without appropriate governance
controls or societal support. For instance, advances in embryogenesis
allow for hESCs and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to be
coaxed to organize into structures that mimic aspects of human embryonic
development. These SC-based embryo models (SCB-EMs) have been used to
model post-implantation stages of human development from the formation
of the amniotic sac
\[[21](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B21)\]
to neurulation
\[[22](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B22)\].
Additionally, improvements in human-animal chimera research using SC may
enable investigators to study human development and organogenesis in an
unprecedented manner. Furthermore, gastruloid
\[[23](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B23)\]
research, which models events following the formation of the primitive
streak, provides another interesting case study, as their scientific
potential for disease modeling has driven a shift in well-established
policy. The possibility of yielding entities that might faithfully
replicate embryonic developmental processes
\[[24](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B24)\]
has prompted conceptual reexaminations, as SCB-EM do not fit neatly in
pre-existing regulatory categories defining human embryos, gametes, or
human research subjects. Because generally European national policies
were initially created to govern ART, they often contain statutory
decades-old definitions of what constitutes a human embryo (e.g.,
Bulgaria
\[[25](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B25)\],
Iceland
\[[26](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B26)\]
and Slovenia
\[[27](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B27)\])
(see [Figure 2](blob://f2.xhtml/) statutory definitions of the human
embryo). These definitions effectively establish distinct regulatory
pathways depending on the embryo\'s methods of creation, which is
illustrated in the (often arbitrary) demarcation between embryos created
by sperm-egg fertilization or by other means. An example is presented in
Spain
\[[28](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B28)\]
where an entity is deemed an 'embryo\' or \'pre-embryo\' by reference to
a human fertilized oocyte. Spanish law prohibits the creation of embryos
for research purposes but allows pre-embryo creation via human somatic
cell nuclear transfer to harvest stem cells. Other European laws
categorize an embryo in terms of its potential to develop into a human
individual or to reach a significant point on the developmental timeline
(e.g., Belgium
\[[29](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B29)\],
The Netherlands
\[[30](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B30)\]
and Malta
\[[31](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B31)\]).
In the UK, following legislative review
\[[32](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B32)\],
the term embryo was considerably expanded, from the product of complete
fertilization
\[[33](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B33)\]
to "an egg that is in the process of fertilization or is undergoing any
other process capable of resulting in an embryo"
\[[34](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B34)\]
using human cells; or an ad-mixed entity that is the product of hybrid
and chimeric processes. Importantly, here, expansive concepts and
research have been accompanied by modernized, robust licensing and
oversight systems
\[[35](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B35)\].
Largely, European countries have committed to ban embryo creation for
research. This commitment arises by the ratification of the Oviedo
Convention (albeit stipulated reservations). Furthermore, the Additional
Protocol prohibiting human cloning
\[[36](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B36)\]
or germline genetic engineering reflects European agreement that
restrained compromises are necessary to protect human dignity and
identity while advancing scientific progress (Appendix A lists countries
that have ratified the Additional Protocol). Even countries adopting
liberal approaches by permitting the creation of embryos for research
purposes via different methods (e.g., UK
\[[37](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B37)\],
Sweden
\[[38](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B38)\]
and Belgium
\[[39](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B39)\])
align with this restrained approach by committing to provide "adequate
protection of the embryo"where embryo research is allowed
\[[40](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B40)\].
In contrast, the ISSCR Guidelines diverge from common European policy by
permitting the creation of embryos for research if projects stop at
"well-defined timepoints" and undergo appropriate degrees of ethical
review. Furthermore, to allow validation of increasingly advanced SCB-EM
research, the Guidelines have issued a controversial
\[[41](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B41)\]
call for governments and oversight bodies to reappraise the '14-day
rule' -- a gold standard preventing human embryos cultured in vitrofrom
developing for longer than 14 days
\[[42](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B42)\].
In the EU, regardless of where a country sits in the policy
permissibility continuum, this rule continues to be ubiquitous (see
[Figure 1](blob://f1.xhtml/) for countries that have adopted the 14-day
rule). Similarly, the Guidelines sit in stark contrast with European
policy regulating research on human--animal chimeric embryos. They
recommend permitting human-animal chimera research and outline criteria
for ethical review, while exempting in vitro culture from specialized
review requirements. In contrast, almost half of European countries
adopt a range of prohibitions on hybrid and/or chimera creation (e.g.,
Cyprus
\[[43](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B43)\],
Portugal
\[[44](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B44)\],
Switzerland
\[[45](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B45)\])
([Figure 1](blob://f1.xhtml/)). Only the UK regulates the practice
extensively, while do not explicitly prohibit human--animal chimera
research but ban different types of activities (e.g., implantation).
Indeed, in most policies the term \'chimera\' is either not defined, or
prohibitions refer to the combination of human and animal reproductive
material, with unclear implications for human--animal chimera research
using hPSCs
\[[46](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B46)\].
Direction from the Guidelines alone might prove to be insufficient to
clarify the scope of extant legal prohibitions for research areas not
explicitly described in law. The gradual liberalization of EU national
policy A discrete trend toward policy liberalization continues to slowly
emerge in Europe, which in turn, may have transformational effects in
the entire region. Indeed, policy transfer might occur through joint
problem solving in challenging issues such as with the curtail of
unproven stem cell interventions or the regulation of interventions in
early human development (e.g., embryo or germline). Alternatively, the
promotion of more liberal policy models could happen by the active role
of countries or international actors promoting their own models to
foster their interests or seeking policy harmonization (ISSCR, European
Commission). Finally, it can ensue as result of pressure exerted in the
form of international scrutiny directing countries to legitimate their
policy approaches. Policy liberalization is particularly revealed in the
progression of French law, which lifted its restrictive approach of the
'90s toward hESC and chimeric research'
\[[47](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B47),[48](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B48)\].
In 2021, France became the first country to specifically regulate the
use of hPSC for gametes and SCB-EM creation, subject to the robust
governance of the Biomedicine Agency and of local institutional ethics
review bodies
\[[49](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B49)\].
Unlike many of its contemporaries, France did not place a legal temporal
limit on embryo cultivation until 2021. Following a previous National
Consultative Ethics Committee
\[[50](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B50)\]
recommendation that embryo culture and research must stop after 7 days
of development and, contemporaneous calls from researchers to not impose
strict time limits, the revised law implements the 14-day rule. In
addition, the law refines its prohibition on chimeric embryo research,
forbidding the modification of human embryos by adding cells from other
species but permitting the insertion of hPSC into animal embryos "for
the purpose of its transfer to the female", "subject to declaration to
the Biomedicine Agency"
\[[51](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B51)\].
Similarly, several other countries have relaxed restrictions on hESC
research over the past 15 years, while attempting to de-exceptionalize
the SC field. For example, in the mid-2000s, moratoria were dropped and
prohibitions on embryo research in countries such as Denmark
\[[52](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B52)\],
Norway
\[[53](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B53)\]
and Iceland
\[[54](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B54)\]
were rescinded in favor of regulations allowing research on
supernumerary embryos. Other countries shifted to allow cloning research
(e.g., in Spain
\[[55](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B55)\],
Iceland
\[[56](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B56)\]
and the U.K.
\[[57](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B57)\]).
The evolving power of stakeholders influenced some of these
developments, albeit with different degrees of success. For instance, in
Germany, the influence of the National Ethics Council and the German
Research Foundation
\[[58](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B58)\]
was effective for the relinquishment of blank prohibitions and for
relaxing cut-off dates for the import and use of hESC lines. Also, in
Ireland, the role of stakeholders (e.g., Catholic Church
\[[59](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B59)\])
was influential in maintaining a status quo
\[[60](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B60)\],
despite calls from their National Bioethics Committee and other actors
to adopt a more permissive approach
\[[61](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B61)\].
As a result, Ireland remains without specific stem cell legislation,
while embryo research is considered a permissible activity since a
ruling from its Supreme Court
\[[62](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B62)\]
provided legal certainty regarding the in vitro embryo\'s legal status.
Across European countries (as in the rest of the world),
**[religious]{.underline}**
\[[63](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B63)\]
**[and]{.underline}** other **[cultural authorities continue to wield
varying degrees of influence as stakeholders shaping
policies]{.underline}** related to embryo and stem cell research.
[Notable has been the uncompromising position of the Catholic
Church]{.underline}, yet its influence has varied. For instance, in
Italy
\[[64](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B64),[65](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B65)\]
it continues to be a prevalent stakeholder hindering progressive stem
cell policy, while in Spain, religious opposition was unable to stop
policy liberalization
\[[66](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B66),[67](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B67)\].
In secular moral frameworks, permitting (under regulation) new and
contentious uses of human pluripotent stem cells may be justified
according to their po≥tential for providing therapeutic benefit.
Research on somatic stem cells has historically been favored as an
alternative to research on the human embryo. However, it remains to be
seen how SCB-EM and chimeras combining hiPSC with animal embryos fit
within religious conceptions of the nature of human life. Following
decade-old attempts to shift an 'embryo'-centric approach to one that
focuses on governance, the Guidelines
\[[68](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B68)\]
encourage nations and professional bodies to move toward a dynamic model
of policy, where blanket bans are replaced by proportional and robust
governance. It is thus timely to probe Europe\'s current situation.
Challenging the status quo: the role of regulation & oversight **[The
dual mechanisms of licensing and ethics]{.underline}** oversight **[play
a pivotal role in fostering scientific]{.underline}**
**[integrity]{.underline}** by influencing collective behavior. These
deliberative bodies seek to rely on precedent, referencing previous
dilemmas to judge similar proposals by consistent standards. Across
Europe, governance is achieved through a plurality of actors and
mechanisms, where a collection of laws and best practices establish the
normative framework in which safety and ethical standards are
implemented
\[[69--72](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B69)\].
Stewardship over SC research practices is often exercised through
statutorily established licensing and oversight mechanisms. Ensuing
competency and reporting requirements that guide oversight bodies are
based on research stages such as tissue/embryo procurement, embryo
research, derivation, and uses of hPSCs (see [Figure
3](blob://f3.xhtml/) Governance mechanisms in selected countries). As
highlighted by ISSCR, prospective review and ongoing monitoring for
compliance with ethical standards must be conducted and vetted by an
independent committee. **[European]{.underline}** approaches converge in
this regard. They all **[establish local or national specialized
oversight bodies of multidisciplinary composition]{.underline}**
(e**[.g., biology, law, ethics and in some instances community
representatives) to conduct such activities]{.underline}**. Moreover,
most countries generally follow an ISSCR-style tiered approach to
oversight, at least with respect to embryo and hESC related research,
which are subject to specialized or centralized ethics review depending
on pre-determined criteria. In Europe, mostly due to historical and
political contexts, some entities charged with specialized oversight
have as core focus licensing and oversight of ART interventions or
embryo research activities (e.g., Belgium
\[[73](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B73)\],
Greece
\[[74](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B74)\],
Hungary
\[[75](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B75)\],
Montenegro
\[[76](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B76)\],
North Macedonia
\[[77](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B77)\],
Portugal
\[[78](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B78)\],
Slovenia
\[[79](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B79)\],
UK
\[[80](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B80)\]),
while others have a broader remit by evaluating biomedical research in
general (e.g., Cyprus
\[[81](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B81)\],
Czechia
\[[82](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B82)\],
France
\[[83](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B83)\],
Spain
\[[84](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B84)\],
Switzerland
\[[85](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B85)\])
at the local level (Appendix B governance bodies tasked with review of
embryo research). The ISSCR Guidelines, revised to reflect evolving
consensus within the field, are meant to complement existing systems of
oversight, aligning new research with pre-existing societal goals. Their
overarching goal is to guide researchers to seek appropriate levels of
ethical review for in vitro research involving entities that could be
deemed ethically or socially controversial. Among the substantial
changes introduced is the categorization of permissible types of
research and their corresponding oversight models. For instance, they
recommend that the derivation of hESC and research on "integrated"
SCB-EM be subject to the same oversight process. Notably, its previous
version called for heightened scrutiny for projects involving
embryo-like structures that might manifest "human organismal potential"
\[[86](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B86)\].
To this end, they abandon the latter nebulous and unmeasurable criterion
and replace it with a proxy for researchers 'intent and models' capacity
to "undergo further integrated development when cultured for additional
time in vitro"
\[[87](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B87)\].
Thus, reflecting that the inherent potential of human and human-like
organisms can only be realized through sustained and deliberate external
influences. But while this justification has evolved, the ISSCR has
remained consistent with recommendations to subject embryo modeling
using hPSC to a higher level of scrutiny than what might be required by
national laws. The Guidelines extend a premise fundamental to European
research governance, that research on entities with questionable moral
status should proceed with caution. However, SCB-EM in Europe appear to
be outside the purview of national systems of oversight designed to
apply and enforce ethical norms that govern embryo research. It remains
to be seen whether these changes will effectively impact European
policy. Governance & the role of criminal law Governance mechanisms,
such as those related to licensing and oversight, rest on legitimacy and
accountability. Governance approaches should endow researchers to act
responsibly through the research cycle while providing the necessary
tools for all stakeholders to seriously commit to their moral
responsibilities. In Europe, the publicly documented cases of violations
of SC-based laws were mostly misconduct cases of fraud
\[[88](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B88),[89](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B89)\]
and failure to obtain ethics approvals. As with the rest of the world,
punitive sanctions for violating research integrity adopt different
modalities depending on the policy\'s binding nature and the stringency
of governance mechanisms, amongst other factors. The trend to uphold
criminal law in biomedical research, while exceptional to the regulation
of science itself, has been widely adopted in European SC-related
policy. Indeed, a favored approach is the imposition of fines and harsh
prison terms for crossing statutory boundaries. Pecuniary administrative
or civil sanctions (e.g., malpractice, liability) are seldom adopted
([Figure 4](blob://f4.xhtml/) Sanctions for embryo and SC
research-related misconduct). **[The widespread association of criminal
sanctions with]{.underline}** **[misconduct]{.underline}** **[related
to]{.underline}** embryo and hESC **[research is quite notable across
European policies.]{.underline}** Criminal law constitutes an old and
powerful tool which societies around the world use to send the strongest
condemnatory message. At the same time, it achieves retribution,
denunciation and/or deterrence. However, the use of criminal law in the
biomedical research context should be used sparingly and limited to
morally reprehensible behavior. Instead, **[other types of
penalties]{.underline}**, **[such as moral and professional sanctions
embedded in soft law]{.underline}** (e.g., codes of conduct,
professional guidelines) could be equally powerful than criminal ones
and should actively be pursued. Professional organizations have a
central role in making effective the latter aided by governmental and
societal support. Legislative review in action Overall, **[European
countries]{.underline}** have several embedded mechanisms to evaluate
the strength of their policy frameworks and prompt change if required.
While uptake of the Guidelines is voluntary, the ISSCR aims to provoke
countries to evaluate whether the results of decades-old compromises,
which project pluralistic beliefs into research governance, **[regulate
emerging technologies as intended.]{.underline}** Reflecting the
importance of iterative, flexible regulation **[that keeps pace with
"ill-defined and often moving targets]{.underline}**"
\[[90](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B90)\],
some European countries have adopted statutorily mandated periodic
reviews to assess the implementation and effects of their laws (e.g.,
France
\[[91](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B91)\],
Germany
\[[92](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B92)\]
and The Netherlands
\[[93](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B93)\]).
An illustrative example of this is found in France, where parallel to
ISSCR\'s policy revision process, the government conducted the mandated
periodic review of its Bioethics Law
\[[94](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B94)\].
As with the Guidelines, this process also concluded with significant
modifications. For instance, prior approval from the Biomedicine Agency
is no longer required for hESC research. Additionally, research to form
gametes or embryo models from hPSC, along with certain types of chimera
research, can proceed as planned under a presumption of approval, unless
the Biomedicine Agency opposes the proposed project within a set period.
As outlined in an impact report that accompanied scheduled Parliamentary
review
\[[95](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B95)\],
the relaxation of requirements was due to the need to resolve
regulation-induced delays which hamstrung French development in the
field relative to countries like the UK, Spain, Belgium and the USA. The
report shared consensus that hESCs were not "potential persons" and
thus, hESC research was ethically distinct from research on the embryo.
However, the National Consultative Ethics Committee remarked that both
hESC and hiPSC can be used to produce "ethically sensitive cells"
\[[96](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B96)\].
Thus, the law was modified to avoid litigation that would inevitably
ensue if decisions on the acceptability of contentious hPSC research
were left entirely to the discretion of the Biomedicine Agency.
France\'s legal foundations for the governance of biomedical research
may facilitate adaptation as the bioethics law is entirely contained
within the public health code, a feature which enable policy change when
it can be justified as serving the broad and malleable goals of public
health. But France pairs this feature with a tool available to
legislators across EU: scheduled general parliamentary review of
legislation every 5--7 years (the exact interval has varied over time)
which must be preceded with public debate for "any reform project on
ethical problems and social issues raised by advances in knowledge in
the fields of biology, medicine and health"
\[[97](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B97)\].
Another example is found in The Netherlands, where the Embryo Law also
incorporates scheduled review, ordered by the Ministry of Health,
Welfare and Sport and conducted by academic researchers, every 5 years
\[[98](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B98)\].
In the most recent review, the Minister announced an intent to regulate
the insertion of hiPSC into animal embryos under this law
\[[99](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B99)\].
In previous years, a moratorium on the creation of embryos for research
purposes morphed into a general ban, subject to societal debate. The
Dutch Minister\'s review also stressed a need for "broad discussion"
about the moral dilemmas arising from embryo-like structures cultured
from iPSCs. French and Dutch experiences facilitating renewed public
engagement with ethical dilemmas may prove instructive for other
countries seeking to update legislation while balancing pluralistic
moral concerns. Policy decisions informed by a broad range of
stakeholders and enacted by officials who can be held democratically
accountable may align scientific progress with diverse societal
priorities. While French and Dutch legislative review provisions seem to
have catalyzed alignment with international norms, mechanisms for
legislative evaluation do not guarantee change. However, they are still
useful: for example, German legislative dormancy in the face of
criticism may be interpreted as an affirmation of existing provisions.
Review of German legislation by federally appointed experts has taken
place continuously, and in recent years, consensus has built around a
need for substantial revisions. The Stem Cell Act requires biannual
evaluation by the Bundestag
\[[100](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B100)\],
and an associated ordinance calls for an annual activity report from the
Central Commission for Stem Cell Research, a federally appointed
committee which issues a non-binding opinion on every German proposal
for research involving hESCs
\[[101](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B101)\].
For years, the Commission\'s reports have called for further relaxation
of the statutory cut-off date for the derivation of hESC lines allowed
to be imported for research uses
\[[102](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B102)\].
In addition, reports have called for other changes to keep with the
spirit of the law. For instance, the Act requires that scientific
research questions must have been clarified as far as possible with
animal cells or experiments. However, as pointed out by the Commission,
"in the future, cells derived from hESCs can contribute to significantly
reducing the number of animals currently used for medical or
pharmaceutical purposes". Proposals with this aim in view would not be
eligible for approval under the act in its current iteration. In its
most recent report, the Bundestag also endorsed review of the ban on the
use of hESC outside of a "research context" and stated that the
"discourse about the ethical-legal classification" of "embryoids" should
be "actively guided by science"
\[[103](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B103)\].
Finally, in 2014, the Conference of Health Ministers assigned the German
Ethics Council, an independent council of experts
\[[104](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B104)\]
with evaluating current developments in the field. A critical
recommendation of the Council was to clarify and standardize the
statutory definitions surrounding the human embryo across Germany\'s
Stem Cell Act and Embryo Protection Act
\[[105](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B105)\]
to ensure entities like SCB-EM do not escape the reach of the law. To
date, however, none of these concerns have been addressed in
legislation. The UK presents a different situation, where persistent
court challenges did not impede the flexibilization of policy. For
instance, in 2008, the Christian Legal Centre and Comment on
Reproductive Ethics asked for a judicial review of the HFEA\'s decision
to approve research using human--animal cytoplasmic hybrid embryos,
contesting the HFEA\'s licensing powers and the rationality of their
decisions, as they believed that such powers only covered fully human
embryos, not human hybrid embryos
\[[106](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B106)\].
In contrast, the HFEA argued that the term \'human embryo\' was not
defined by the Act and their interpretation relied on scientific
expertise. The court ruled that the claimant\'s case to be unarguable,
that the HFEA pursued appropriate scientific guidance, and that the Act
allowed for revision and reinterpretation following scientific
advancements. Following this, revisions to the Act continued to follow a
permissive path. Conclusion By eschewing bright-line prohibitions and
eliminating ethical distinctions based on hPSCs provenance, the ISSCR
Guidelines might have moved the forum for policy debates back to the
halls of national Parliaments. They have further attempted to direct
them to existing systems of ethical review in which research is "widely
considered ethically acceptable"\[[107](#B107)\]. The flexibility
conferred by professional guidance (soft law) informed by
discipline-specific expertise suggests this form of governance might be
better suited to adapt to new ethical dilemmas posed by scientific
developments. Yet, public deliberation is essential if a policy is to
reflect societal values and priorities and thereby gain legitimacy. Over
the past decade, scientific organizations have repeatedly called for
broad stakeholder engagement to reflect on and adapt governance
strategies to address new ethical dilemmas that accompany scientific
progress. True public deliberation on policy questions pertaining to
stem cell research requires models for public engagement which have not
yet materialized, perhaps due to lack of incentives
\[[108](file:///C:\Users\caitl\Downloads\WIP%207-7%20Research%20Biotech.docx#B108)\].
**[Legislative review processes]{.underline}** such as those adopted in
France, the UK and Denmark, **[adapted to solicit stakeholder
perspectives on the governance of related emerging
technologies,]{.underline}** may provide useful models to make
technocratic governance process more accessible and reflective of public
interests. Because of the absence of true commitment to inclusiveness in
policy debates, we do not anticipate a change in the status quo. Future
perspective In Europe, existing pathways to assess the suitability of
policy and governance frameworks have not been widely used. As stagnant
norms continue to govern a dynamic field, it is difficult to assess
whether these frameworks are still fulfilling their stewardship roles
and how they might evolve in the next decades. Responsible innovation is
predicated on the capacity to adapt in response to changing
environments. As science and society co-evolve, are extant policy
frameworks meeting stakeholders\' expectations as well as safeguarding
important human interests? Promoting and delivering social value? Do
they continue to satisfactorily reflect the socio-ethical principles
that originally underpinned them? What is the weight of political,
economic and other contextual factors in the adoption and implementation
of policy? These are central questions to elucidate the social processes
leading to, or required for, policy reform. The answers to these
questions could also assist in evaluating whether governance structures
are or will remain legitimate and sustainable in the future. These are
all fundamental factors to support responsible research clinical
translation, and we anticipate (or at least hope) that addressing these
will occupy a central role in future policy and governance debates as
well as their outcomes.

**[Biotechnologies]{.underline}**, alike other human activities, are
related to a variety of risks. For instance they **[can threat human
life and compromise its quality]{.underline}**, endanger the integrity
of environment and finally, they can undermine economy and thus have
impact on welfare and security. **[Dangerous activities are supervised
and to some extend prohibited in most countries]{.underline}**. The
special problem with biotechnologies is to quickly recog- nize the risks
and dangers in this field. For this pur- pose, general rules and
measures can be insuffi- cient. Therefore special regulations concerning
biotechnologies are needed. In order to secure this, social debates1
accompany activities which several people see as dangerous due to their
specific per- ception of somatic, psychological, religious, cultur- al,
environmental, economic and social risks. Controversial Biotechnologies
Every use of biological material and processes can be labelled as
biotechnology. There are numerous traditional biotechnologies.
Nevertheless, this term is coined mostly for recent technologies, or for
mere research in them. Many **[research practices based on radical
manip- ulation of human biological]{.underline}** material **[are
controver- sial,]{.underline}** especially those which result in
creation of new life, or its destruction. **[The branches
of]{.underline}** **[stem cell reasearch, genetic manipulation and
mixing of biological material]{.underline}** (chimeras and hybrids2)
**[are]{.underline}** well known. Apart from those, new methods of
healthcare with similar consequences shall be added, for example
assisted reproduction. Radical interventions in other species,
especially genetic manipulation, are similarly **[controversial due to
their risks for both environment and humans]{.underline}**. Sometimes,
developed biotechnologies, which show no adverse impact on human life
and envi- ronment, affect economy and welfare. The position towards
biotechnologies often derives from positions towards related activities.
For example, several routine health care practices have similar
consequences for human life as the above-mentioned biotechnologies.
Abortion and euthanasia are prominent sources of controversy. The debate
on stem cell research is strongly con- nected to them. Technologies
which are not based on biology can also be controversial due to their
impact on the biosphere. Nuclear energy is disputed in several countries
due to its risks and nuclear waste. Recently used information
technologies raise ques- tions due to its impact on privacy. Future
contro- versies can arise from development of nanotech- nologies.
**[Bio]{.underline}**- and other **[technologies]{.underline}** ca**[n
be controversial in both the research- and the
development-phase]{.underline}** and in subsequent routine use if they
promise to be successful from a technical and a financial point of view.
Ideologies as Fuel for Controversies For many, standards for solution of
life situations, including **[controversies related to biotechnologies,
derive from]{.underline}** various **[ideologies]{.underline}** and
doctrines, including questions of **[religion]{.underline}**,
religion-based **[morality]{.underline}** and idelogies which can be
labelled as quasi-religious, such as humanism, socialism, con-
servativism, liberalism, pacifism, "humanright- ism",3 or
environmentalism. **[These ideologies have impact on
bioethics]{.underline}**. Bioethics as such is an academic discipline
which analyses moral aspects of medicine and biotech- nologies in a
scientific manner, using philosophy and other social sciences, and
articulates opinions on them. Bioethics is an extension of medical
ethics which solely reflects the attention of physi- cians to moral
aspects of health care. For the analysis of the relation between the
European Union and controversial biotechnologies, three ideologies are
important. The "Black"4 Christian criticism5 of several biotechnologies
and routine practices originates from the appreciation of human life in
its margin- al forms which is not generally recognized in all European
countries. Moreover, also within the the several member states the
questions related to the beginning and the end of human life are not
fully answered and thus discussed controversially. Several member states
show the tendency to accept human life in prenatal forms. Furthermore,
criticism aimed not only at biotechnologies, but also at many other
modern human activities, can derive from environmental- ism6. This
ideology is based on the appreciation of environment as supreme value
endangered by humans. "Green" criticism is also influential in several
European countries. The strongest forms of opposition may even lead to
civil disobedience. Several **[biotechnologies are]{.underline}** also
**[criticized by socialists and]{.underline}** human right
**[activists]{.underline}**. For instance, "red" criticism perceives
some biotechnologies as a danger for equality and social stability.7 The
criti- cism finds wide support in Europe with long tradi- tion of
striving for social justice and equality. Counter-values are, however,
articulated too. New health care methods are demanded and wel- comed.
Wealth is pleasant. New technologies are inherently good, if not proven
otherwise. Furthermore, criticism is questioned whether its is really in
compliance with values proclaimed by their adherents.8 Country as
Appropriate Forum for Solution of Controversies Biotechnologies are
developed and used interna- tionally and knowledge about them is
exchanged globally. Nevertheless, **[controversies arise and are settled
separately in]{.underline}** particular countries **[due to dif- ferent
religious, moral, cultural and political views]{.underline}**. However,
there is a homogenous attitude towards certain biotechnologies in many
countries. Here, consensus is easily transformed in law. Some other
technologies remain controversial on the national level as well,9 which
can result in compro- mises. In those cases the majority has to decide
the matter. If the political majorities have changed, new policies and
laws can often easily follow.10 Nevertheless, one has to consider that
elites always play a prominent role in the political decision-mak- ing.
In countries with authoritarian regimes, poli- cy is formulated by
governing elites. However, tra- ditions and beliefs are usually taken
into considera- tion. Within the social debate, films of the sci-fi
genre often play an important role in the public imagina- tion of risks
related to them.11 Trivially speaking, the reality is, however, quite
boring, because no horrible threats have been identified until today.
Controversies related to biotechnologies can be per- ceived by close
observers, involved persons and experts as important. Nevertheless, the
interest of the public in them is often limited and volatile. As a
consequence, the circle of so-called experts remains quite small. Thus a
few experts can enjoy considerable influence on new regulations.
National Policies and Laws The solution of the discussed controversies
can only be carried out by national policies and laws. Let us assume
that a worldwide principle of law, which means that individuals can do
everything what is not prohibited. Most countries, furthermore, rec-
ognize the right to conduct research as a funda- mental freedom12 or at
least recognize the academic freedom.13 Consequently, any restrictions
of research in biotechnologies have to be checked on their compliance
with the basic constitutional prin- ciples of the concerned state.
Developed countries now regulate risky and con- troversial
biotechnologies with specific laws14, because the application of general
legislation is often incovenient. The results can be unsuitable because
competing values must be examined by authorities and judges. In this
context, specific leg- islation provides greater legal certainty. Even
spe- cific legislation, however, remains often vague. Therefore,
administrative practice is important. Measures of administrative law are
applied. Restrictions are listed, licencing for controlled activities is
introduced and non-compliance is sup- pressed. Special bodies are
established for examina- tion and supervision of controversial
biotechnolo- gies. Committees of ethics15 composed of experts on
technology, lawyers, bioethicists, clergymen and representants of
various attitudes shall seek justifi- cation for decisions on
controversial projects. However, policy is not limited to the dichotomy
per- mitted versus prohibited. **[States can incourage (or discourage)
research, development and use of biotechnologies]{.underline}** with
various incentives or with absence of them, such as tax exemptions,
subsi- dies, and patent protection. Furthermore, public institutions
often engage in research, development and promotion of biotechnologies.
Laws related to these incentives and to this engagement also incite
disputes if biotechnology is controversial. Therefore, such legislation
often enjoys similar attention. In the European Union, Directive
98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions has
harmonized laws of member states. Its adoption and implementation in
several mem- ber states faced considerable opposition. International
Standards for Controversial Biotechnologies There are no two groups of
countries with opossing policies towards controversial biotechnologies.
Instead, [various combinations of restrictive and lib- eral approaches
mixed with different methods of support can be observed]{.underline}.
Very unusual alliances would be possible if controversial
biotechnologies were in foreground of international relations.16 On the
other hand, **[countries with similar political, economic and social
conditions, which are close allies, disagree often profoundly on
controversial biotechnologies.]{.underline}**17 Under these conditions a
worldwide standardisa- tion of biotechnologies will be difficult to
achieve. The engagement of United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is limited to declarations18 and reports.
Although those instruments are not directly legally binding, they show
influences on the national regulations. In addition, the Food and
Agriculture Organization Global Nature of Contemporary Biotechnologies
Despite climatic and other differences, there is only one biosphere and
only one human species on our planet. Thus, most biotechnologies can be
used worldwide. **[Research and development of biotechnologies is
expensive]{.underline}**. These features make them suitable object of
international use because they need to be paid off. Another ground for
internationalization are their economic advantages. Consequently, there
are numerous cross-border activities related to biotechnologies.
Firstly, exchange of methods and technologies shall be mentioned, both
for free and for remuneration if protected with patents or confidential.
Furthermore, international trade in services, including cooperation in
research pro- jects, trade in related goods (equipment and sub-
stances), migration of researchers and experts and investment related to
biotechnologies are common institutes. Science is now concentrated in
the most devel- oped countries: in the United States of America, in West
Europe, in Japan and in few other most devel- oped countries. There is
edge of effective science21 in many less developed countries. Finally,
progress in biotechnologies is often achieved in poor, but populous
countries capable to mobilize ressources, for instance in China or in
India. There is a lack of research and development of biotechnologies in
poorer countries of Africa, Asia and America. Nevertheless, they can be
introduced there and controversies can arise there, too. Response of
International Economic Law Research and development is excluded from
coun- tries with restrictive policy. Therefore, it can move to other
countries if conditions are suitable there. This diversion, however,
seems to be limited.22 **[The impact on international trade is more
signif- icant]{.underline}**. For instance, [there were several
long-lasting disputes related to]{.underline} controversial
[biotechnologies]{.underline} in the World Trade Organization [related
to restrictions on importation of meat from animals treated with
hormones23]{.underline}. Food made from genetically modified organisms
also incited international disagree- ment.24 No Consensus of European
Countries There are values shared by all European countries, their
representatives and people, such as the conti- nental idea of human
rights.25 Their liberties are protected and harsh treatment (death
penalty, tor- ture) is excluded. Other European values are democ- racy
and welfare, based on equality. Nevertheless, **[there is a lack of
consensus in many border issues among European]{.underline}** peoples.
**[This lack becomes obvious in connection with several controversial
biotechnologies and methods of bio- medicine.]{.underline}** The level
of economic and social development plays no role. There are comparable
countries with opposing views on biomedical issues.26 On the con- trary,
religiosity of population and insistence of elites on particular values
seem to be crucial.27 **[Because of these differences it is doubtable,
whether there is a single European bioethics despite close exchange of
ideas among European scholars.28]{.underline}** Role of the Council of
Europe Speaking about controversial biotechnologies, the Council of
Europe shall be mentioned before the European Union. Membership confirms
accepta- tion of European standard of human rights. The Convention for
the Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedoms and protocols to it,29
are silent on controversial issues of biomedicine. The European Court
for Human Rights avoids to interpret the Convention, establishing values
not common for European countries in cases of abor- tion and euthanasia.
This tolerance of different approaches is known in the case-law of the
Court as margin of appreciation enjoyed by particular juris- diction.30
However, there is little case-law on biotechnolo- gies. **[It is
difficult to interpret fundamental rights and freedoms as relevant for
several controversial biotechnologies without undue activism beyond
development of interpretation of the Convention as a "living
document".]{.underline}** The Oviedo Convention31, which adresses health
care, its content,32 the debate about it,33 and limit- ed
participation34 of member states of the Council of Europe confirm this
lack of European consensus on several crucial issues of bioethics. These
conditions do not exclude activities of experts attached to the Council
of Europe resulting in reports and conclusions, sometimes endorsed by
the Committee of Ministers and by Parliamentary Assembly. Relevant
Features of the European Union One of the principal tasks of the
European Union35 is advanced economic integration of member states.36
There is no comparable international eco- nomic integration in the world
until now. From an institutional and a legal point of view, the European
Union has gone further than any other international organisation. It
shows a supra- national structure, its laws enjoy direct effect and
primacy.37 Member states can thus be forced to apply standards they
refuse. Nevertheless, the European Union is no state and thus has
limited opportunities of pushing through its opinions. Many observers
are convinced that these short- comings are caused by absence of a
nation in a political sense (demos).38 Language of wider com- munication
is needed.39 This absence excludes gen- uine European politics.
**[Public debates become more difficult beacuse of lingual borders,
including dis- cussion about controversial biotechnologies, albeit
public usually shows little interest in them. This discussion cannot be
replaced with dialogue of experts and academics.]{.underline}**
Comparison to the United States of America Due to many similarities, the
United States of America can be compared with the European Union. There
are, however, some crucial differ- ences. The United States have a
stable base for statehood. Americans form one nation with one language.
Therefore, centralised power becomes possible. There are however,
different religiosity and cul- ture in the United States. Americans are
not a homogenous nation40 from in these aspects, which is similar to
European nations. The American feder- alism accomodates this
heterogenity. The competence for regulation of controversial
biotechnologies is partially centralized, especially if it is necessary
for free interstate commerce. The Federal competences were interpreted
broadly in the last century in the United States.41 Nevertheless, they
have not yet been consequently used to regulate biotechnology. Still,
Federal government is fiscally dominant. It spends huge money on
research, including biotech- nologies. Therefore, dispute on financing
is the most important issue of federal policy on controver- sial
biotechnologies.42 It should be noted that **[sever- al biotechnologies
discussed are not controversial in the United States as they are in
Europe]{.underline}**.43 Restrictions of European Member States in the
Light of Basic Economic Freedoms Controversial biotechnologies,
including research and development related to them, form a part of
economy. Therefore, principles and standards relat- ed to the internal
market of the European Union are applicable. "The principle of
principles" of European eco- nomic integration is equality.44 No
discrimination of foreign products and factors of production is allowed.
Furthermore, equally applied requirements which hinder interstate trade
can also be scruti- nized whether they are justified with reasons of
general interest and whether they are necessary and proportional. If
there is no danger for the public health of con- sumers or the integrity
of the environment, goods must be allowed. It is hard to imagine
acceptation of obstacles related to moral aspects of production of these
goods or even research leading to them. Due to reluctance of many
Europeans, genetical- ly modified organisms were treated with suspicion
in the European Union for one decade. The approach has been relaxed
later.45 Extraordinary restrictions can be hardly accepted due to its
impli- cations for interstate trade in goods.46 Similar attitudes can be
expected towards ser- vices related to controversial biotechnologies.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to analyse the issue here due to
heterogenity of services and modes of their cross-border trade.47 In
general, economic activity without cross bor- der elements and
consequences is left to national regulation, if there is no
harmonization. Therefore, different standards are acceptable if applied
with- out discrimination.48 Enterprises from abroad using freedom of
establishment cannot import lenient rules. What would not be accepted in
the European Union? Attempts of member state "to export restric- tions"
to countries with liberal approach, for exam- ple: (1) bans applied on
researchers -- citizens to par- ticipate abroad on research prohibited
at home, (2) restrictions applied on investors in controversial
biotechnologies abroad, (3) bans on exportation and importation of
services and goods49 which are inputs or outputs of controversial
biotechnologies, and (4) consumption abroad of services which result
from controversial biotechnologies. The European Union will also treat
with suspi- cion (5) restrictions on cooperation of domestic research
companies and institutions with foreign entities involved in banned
research, or (6) curtail- ing of such cooperation with public money.
Such "exportation" of restrictions (boycotts and embargos) is used
against states which threaten peace. It covers biotechnologies which can
be used for making of biological weapons. There are, how- ever, few
examples of such approaches in the European Union.50 Member states which
restrict particular biotechnology accept consequences of economic
integration. In some cases, the membership in the European Union seems
to be more important than absolute insistence on values.51 Therefore, it
is possible to label these values as sec- ondary ones. Due to this, none
of the disputed biotechnologies causes long-lasting tensions among
member states of the European Union. Harmonization of Standards The
principal competence for harmonization and unification by the European
Union is justified with needs of economic integration.52 Several
controversial biotechnologies are obvi- ously covered by it, such as
patents for biotechno- logical inventions,53 production and distribution
of genetically modified food,54 and development of novel
pharmaceuticals.55 And the European Union has indeed shown the ability
to regulate those topics. Most member states accept this with their
approval in the Council, although these legislative interventions
encounter criticism. "Blacks", "greens" and "reds" influential in
several member states expressed concerns or opposed it. Due to the
competence of the European Union in agriculture and energy policy,
controversial support of biofuel was launched several years ago.56 Other
controversial biotechnologies, however, fall outside the competences of
the European Union. Certainly, there is some distortion caused by
existing differences, for example, reproductive tourism.57 Many member
states support liberal approaches. Therefore, Europe-wide restrictions
can hardly pass the Council from a political point of view. Albeit,
there are repeated calls for such Europe- anisation of restrictions by
politicians of member states which have adopted restrictive policy. This
tendency to impose standards resulting from moral conviction on other
people and nations is under- standable from a psychological point of
view.58 On the contrary, member states with liberal approach to
particular controversial biotechnology do not need Europe-wide
liberalization. It would complicate relations with member states which
insist on restrictions. Genuine and False "Soft Law" The European Union
encourages discussions about policies in areas outside its competence or
outside its political capacity. Controversial biotechnologies are no
exception. Permanent bodies have been established59 and ad hoc groups of
experts are called from time to time to advise on particular issues.
Certainly, these activities deliver interesting studies of laws and
practices in member states and elsewhere. Interesting generalisation is
formulat- ed. Nevertheless, such production can be hardly regarded as
soft law, although it is often flanked with recommendations. There is
limited, post- poned and indirect transformation of ideas into proposals
of legislation. The impact on bioethics shall not also be exaggerated
due to number of these reports. The European Parliament tries to promote
values considered by majority even on legislation clearly outside
competences of the European Union with recommendations in several
sensitive issues (repro- 57 For analysis of reproductive tourism in the
European Union see Pennings G., Legal harmonization and reproductive
tourism, Human Reproduction, vol. 19, no. 12, pp. 2689-2694. 58 See
Pennings G. (infra), "Most opponents of reproduc- tive traveling start
from the premise that the tougher and more restrictive legislation is
also morally superi- or. (\...) apparently, people are more convinced of
the moral correctness of their prohibitions than of the cor- rectness of
their permissions". 59 European Group of Ethics in Science and New
Technologies (EGE) was established by the Commis- sion (see decision
2005/383/EC). ductive health).60 I find this approach unhappy for
political reasons.61 Furthermore, its feasible appli- cation on
controversial biotechnologies is limited.62 Common Research Policy as
Field for Europeisation of Controversies **[Due to the]{.underline}**
described **[lack of competence and capac- ity to adress controversial
biotechnologies]{.underline}**, the recent development in European Union
is compara- ble to the one in the United States of America.
**[Controversies mutate into dispute on financing of controversial
research]{.underline}**. A significant amount of the EU-budget is spent
on research.63 Also, the amount spent on biotech- nologies has increased
in the last years,64 which has got a clear base in primary law65 and
detailled legislation.66 Chronic controversies are awaked when frame-
work programs are submitted for aproval. Several member states usually
object European financing of particular controversial biotechnologies.67
Some measures of the policy can be vetoed. Otherwise, other member
states feel it suitable to take into account concerns of these states.
Therefore, com- promise solutions have been achieved.68 Restrictions of
European financing can be, how- ever, easily set off with financing of
member states with liberal approach. Member states of European Union
have more money than the European Union. Future Role of the European
Union The Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe tried to push
the organizational structure of the European Union closer to those of
Federations. Nevertheless, it does not make the EU a state. This
ambitious project failed in a first step. By now, the Treaty of Lisbon
tries to retain as many changes as possible envisaged by the
Constitution including several related to biotech- nologies.69
Nevertheless, there are weak political and legal conditions for a
profound change of the European Union at the moment. Therefore, **[the
process of harmonization is difficult even in smaller fields such as
controversial biotechnologies.]{.underline}** Possible Engagement of the
European Union Can the European Union adopt laws on controver- sial
biotechnologies? Yes. The controversy, howev- er, cannot occur among
member states. For example, some heinous research activities which are
criminalized in many member states can be added to the list of crimes,
which the European Union contributes to their prosecution and punish-
ment.70 Several member states would introduce rel- evant laws more
quickly than without such engage- ment. Europe-wide consensus can be
integrated into foreign policy if other countries have different
approaches towards particular biotechnology. At the moment, however, I
do not identify any such case. Success, however, should not be expected.
Furthermore, there seem to be other priorities in European diplomacy at
the moment. I suggest European engagement for a greater transparency.71
The European Union is a communi- ty of closely integrated nations, which
a high level of trust is necessary for. Therefore, other European
nations shall have the right to know about contro- versial
biotechnologies and research in them, in particular member states. The
enumerated contro- versial biotechnologies and research related to them
shall be reported to the European Union and information shall be later
disclosed worldwide. I admit that there is -- if at all -- only a
dubious com- petence even for this measure. The Czech Republic and
Controversial Biotechnologies Opinions on laws and ethics related to
biomedicine and biotechnologies are rarely presented interna- tionally
by people from post-communist east European countries for several
reasons. Therefore, I want to finish the paper with short information
about the position of my country in biotechnologies and a discussion of
controversies related to them. The Czech Republic is a new member state
of the European Union since 2004. It was admitted to the EU together
with other post-socialist countries. The Czech economy has been quickly
approach- ing richer West European economies. The Czechs enjoy fruits of
modernization in recent times. The Czech democracy is regarded as
stabilized. Efficacy of public administration has been enhanced in the
last decade. Nevertheless, there are several shortcomings. For example,
the judiciary is slow and debates on vari- ous issues including
controversial biomedicine and biotechnologies are primitive compared to
West European countries. The public spending on research and develop-
ment is low if compared with the United States and with Western and
Northern Europe.72 Nevertheless, there are examples of successful
international coop- erations of Czech research institutions and teams.
The general approach towards controversial biotechnologies in the Czech
Republic is optimistic, which is due to the fact that science is
appreciated in Czech society. Different political and economic regimes
have changed nothing on it. To some extend, it is possible to hear
"black" criticism. Nevertheless, it is almost deprived of influence.73
Czechs belong to the least religious people of Europe, which makes the
authority of churches very weak. "Green" criticism is stronger than in
any other post-socialist country. Nevertheless, its achievements are
also limited. The understanding for harmonization measures unnecessary
for the internal market will, however, be low. The Czech Republic shows
reluctance for further integration, being hardly capable to ratify new
primary law.74 There is not much of an academic debate on eth- ical and
legal aspects of controversial biotechnolo- gies.75 On the contrary,
those topics are imported from abroad into Czech bioethics

### 1NC -- Overmatch Turn

#### Pursuit of advanced conventional weaponry locks the US into overmatch military strategy

**Klare '18** -- is professor emeritus of peace and world-security
studies at Hampshire College and senior visiting fellow at the Arms
Control Association in Washington, DC (Michael T., "Why 'Overmatch' Is
Overkill", 12/20/18, The Nation,

"[For decades, our adversaries have studied our methods and invested
specifically in capabilities that mitigate our strengths]{.underline},"
Michael Griffin, the undersecretary of defense for research and
engineering, told the House Armed Services Committee in April. "**[They
are systematically and strategically developing and fielding advanced
systems more rapidly than us. This erodes the advantage that
DOD]{.underline}** \[the Department of Defense\] **[has maintained in
conventional warfare and impedes upon our ability to project
power]{.underline}**." ("Power projection," in Pentagon-speak, means the
ability to attack and invade countries across the globe.) "In **[this
increasingly competitive environment,]{.underline}**" Griffin continued,
"**[the department must pay much more attention to future readiness and
regaining our Joint Force conventional overmatch]{.underline}**."
**[This means not only more things]{.underline}**---more tanks, planes,
missiles, and so on---**[but more capable things]{.underline}**.
**[Technology is seen as a "leveler" in the emerging strategic
competition, because it has allowed China, Russia, and others to find
ways to counter America's advantages in conventional military
hardware]{.underline}**. **[By investing in AI, cyber, robotics, and
other technologies available from commercial sources, those countries
have been able]{.underline}**---or so we're being told---**[to eat away
at America's technological superiority]{.underline}**. **[The response
to this challenge is obvious: Spend more money on
technology]{.underline}**---a lot more money. [THE IMPLICATIONS OF
OVERMATCH]{.underline} With virtually no public or congressional
discussion, [overmatch has become the driving principle of US foreign
and military policy]{.underline}. [This means]{.underline}, at the very
least, [that US military spending will continue to exceed that of all
potential adversaries and that the country's arsenals will be
perpetually replenished with new and more capable weapons.]{.underline}
The Pentagon's proposed budget for fiscal year 2019, released last
February, calls for spending \$686 billion---an increase of \$74
billion, or 12 percent, over FY 2018. (These figures do not encompass
spending on nuclear weapons via the Department of Energy or other
security-related expenditures outside the Department of Defense.) But
this is merely a start. **[To maintain overmatch, the
Pentagon]{.underline}**---and its supporters in Congress and the White
House---**[must keep enhancing the military's
capabilities]{.underline}** **[to defeat China and/or Russia in a
full-scale confrontation]{.underline}**. "While our trajectory is in the
right direction," Mattis told Congress in April, "**[our work has just
begun.]{.underline}**" [Among his stated goals]{.underline}: to expand
the Navy from an existing force of 280 ships to 355; [to acquire new
high-tech conventional weapons capable of overpowering Chinese and
Russian defenses against American attack]{.underline}; and to replace
almost the entire US nuclear stockpile with new, more capable atomic
weapons.

#### Pursuing overmatch sleepwalks the world into nuclear armageddon

[CONTENDING WITH OVERMATCH There's no getting away from it: overmatch
will govern US foreign and military policy for years into the
future]{.underline}. **[It will increase the risk of great-power
war]{.underline}** and encroach upon civilian life. **[The Democrats in
Congress cannot stop it,]{.underline}** partly because they lack the
power to do so and partly **[because most of them also subscribe to the
notion of permanent US military superiority]{.underline}**. [Resistance
from the peace and antinuclear movements]{.underline}, such as can be
mustered, [is unlikely to slow the pace of expanding
militarization]{.underline}. **[What is needed]{.underline}**,
therefore, **[is a clear-headed critique of overmatch and a strategy for
contesting its most dangerous components]{.underline}**. [Overmatch
rests on the assumption that the United States can and should devote
whatever resources it takes to preserve a significant military lead over
all potential competitors indefinitely]{.underline}. **[This is both
practically and morally flawed]{.underline}**. **[America's competitors
will always find new ways to overcome US advantages]{.underline}**,
**[while any sustained drive to stay ahead of all conceivable threats
will eventually drain this country of its economic, scientific, and
technological assets]{.underline}**. As the architects of the original
US-Soviet arms-control agreements eventually concluded, negotiating
parity in weapons capabilities is a much more sensible strategy. [The
moral flaws in overmatch derive from its repudiation of reciprocity in
international relations]{.underline}. During the Cold War, [the leaders
of the United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline}---no matter how
much they detested each other---[determined that it was necessary to
meet periodically to address global dangers lest they provoke a conflict
that could spark nuclear Armageddon]{.underline}. **[The advocates of
overmatch have no such inclinations]{.underline}**: For them, the only
acceptable position for every potential US rival is subordination to
Washington in world affairs. **[Though no doubt a pleasing prospect to
the occupants of the White House, this is an unacceptable condition that
will goad countries like China and Russia to engage in a perpetual
struggle to overcome their inferior status]{.underline}**---**[a
struggle that will result in a monumentally costly arms race and perhaps
even global war]{.underline}**.

#### Drives AI integrated hyperwar -- ensures extinction

**Klare '18** -- is professor emeritus of peace and world-security
studies at Hampshire College and senior visiting fellow at the Arms

[There could be no more consequential decision than launching atomic
weapons and possibly triggering a nuclear holocaust]{.underline}.
President John F. Kennedy faced just such a moment during the Cuban
Missile Crisis of 1962 and, after envisioning the catastrophic outcome
of a US-Soviet nuclear exchange, he came to the conclusion that the
atomic powers should impose tough barriers on the precipitous use of
such weaponry. Among the measures he and other global leaders adopted
were guidelines requiring that senior officials, not just military
personnel, have a role in any nuclear-launch decision. That was then, of
course, and this is now. [And what a now it is!]{.underline} **[With
artificial intelligence]{.underline}**, or AI, **[soon to play an
ever-increasing role in military affairs, as in virtually everything
else in our lives, the role of humans, even in nuclear decision-making,
is likely to be progressively diminished]{.underline}**. In fact, [in
some future AI-saturated world, it could disappear entirely, leaving
machines to determine humanity's fate]{.underline}. **[This isn't idle
conjecture based on science fiction movies or dystopian
novels]{.underline}**. **[It's all too real, all too here and
now]{.underline}**, or at least here and soon to be. **[As the Pentagon
and the military commands of the other great powers look to the future,
what they see is a highly contested battlefield]{.underline}**---some
have called it a "**[hyperwar" environment]{.underline}**---**[where
vast swarms of AI-guided robotic weapons will fight each other at speeds
far exceeding the ability of human commanders to follow the course of a
battle]{.underline}**. At such a time, it is thought, **[commanders
might increasingly be forced to rely on ever more intelligent machines
to make decisions on what weaponry to employ when and
where.]{.underline}** At first, this may not extend to nuclear weapons,
but **[as the speed of battle increases and the "firebreak" between them
and conventional weaponry shrinks, it may prove impossible to prevent
the creeping automatization of even nuclear-launch decision-making. Such
an outcome can only grow more likely as the US military completes a
top-to-bottom realignment intended to transform it from a fundamentally
small-war, counter-terrorist organization back into one focused on
peer-against-peer combat with China and Russia]{.underline}**. This
shift was mandated by the Department of Defense in its December 2017
National Security Strategy. Rather than focusing mainly on weaponry and
tactics aimed at combating poorly armed insurgents in never-ending
small-scale conflicts, [the American military is now being redesigned to
fight increasingly well-equipped Chinese and Russian forces in
multi-dimensional]{.underline} (air, sea, land, space, cyberspace)
[engagements involving multiple attack systems]{.underline} (tanks,
planes, missiles, rockets) [operating with minimal human
oversight]{.underline}. "**[The major effect/result of all these
capabilities coming together will be an innovation warfare has never
seen before: the minimization of human decision-making in the vast
majority of processes traditionally required to wage
war]{.underline}**," observed retired Marine General John Allen and AI
entrepreneur Amir Hussain. "**[In this coming age of hyperwar, we will
see humans providing broad, high-level inputs while machines do the
planning, executing, and adapting to the reality of the mission and take
on the burden of thousands of individual decisions with no additional
input." That "minimization of human decision-making" will have profound
implications for the future of combat]{.underline}**. Ordinarily,
national leaders seek to control the pace and direction of battle to
ensure the best possible outcome, even if that means halting the
fighting to avoid greater losses or prevent humanitarian disaster.
**[Machines]{.underline}**, even very smart machines, **[are unlikely to
be capable of assessing the social and political context of combat, so
activating them might well lead to situations of uncontrolled
escalation.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Overmatch Turn

#### Conventional weapons are the key driver of the overmatch strategy

**Klare '18** -- is professor emeritus of peace and world-security
studies at Hampshire College and senior visiting fellow at the Arms
Control Association in Washington, DC (Michael T., "Alexa, Send Nukes",
12/18/18, The Nation,

Even five years ago, [there were few in the military establishment who
gave much thought to the role of AI or robotics when it came to major
combat operations]{.underline}. [Yes]{.underline}, remotely piloted
aircraft (RPA), or [drones]{.underline}, [have been widely used in
Africa and the Greater Middle East to hunt down enemy combatants, but
those are largely ancillary]{.underline} (and sometimes CIA)
[operations]{.underline}, intended to relieve pressure on US commandos
and allied forces facing scattered bands of violent extremists. In
addition, [today's RPAs are still controlled by human
operators]{.underline}, even if from remote locations, [and make little
use, as yet, of AI-powered target-identification and attack
systems]{.underline}. [**In the future, however, such systems are
expected to populate much of any battlespace, replacing humans in many
or even most combat functions.** To speed this transformation, the
D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
[is]{.underline} already [spending hundreds of millions of dollars on
AI-related research.]{.underline} "We cannot expect success fighting
tomorrow's conflicts with yesterday's thinking, weapons, or equipment,"
Mattis told Congress in April. **[To ensure continued military
supremacy]{.underline}**, he added, [**the Pentagon would have to focus
more "investment in technological innovation to increase lethality,
including research into advanced autonomous systems, artificial
intelligence, and hypersonics."** Why the sudden emphasis on AI and
robotics? It begins, of course, with the astonishing progress made by
the tech community]{.underline}---much of it based in Silicon Valley,
California---[in enhancing AI and applying it to a multitude of
functions, including image identification and voice
recognition]{.underline}. One of those applications, Alexa Voice
Services, is the computer system behind Amazon's smart speaker that not
only can use the Internet to do your bidding but interpret your
commands. ("Alexa, play classical music." "Alexa, tell me today's
weather." "Alexa, turn the lights on.") Another is the kind of
self-driving vehicle technology that is expected to revolutionize
transportation. [Artificial Intelligence is an "omni-use"
technology]{.underline}, explain analysts at the Congressional Research
Service, a non-partisan information agency,"[as it has the potential to
be integrated into virtually everything]{.underline}." [It's also a
"dual-use" technology in that it can be applied as aptly to military as
civilian purposes]{.underline}. Self-driving cars, for instance, rely on
specialized algorithms to process data from an array of sensors
monitoring traffic conditions and so decide which routes to take, when
to change lanes, and so on. The same technology and reconfigured
versions of the same algorithms will one day be applied to self-driving
tanks set loose on future battlefields. Similarly, someday drone
aircraft---without human operators in distant locales---will be capable
of scouring a battlefield for designated targets (tanks, radar systems,
combatants), determining that something it "sees" is indeed on its
target list, and "deciding" to launch a missile at it. **[It doesn't
take a particularly nimble brain to realize why Pentagon officials would
seek to harness such technology: they think it will give them a
significant advantage in future wars.]{.underline}** Any [full-scale
conflict between the US and China or Russia]{.underline} (or both)
[would]{.underline}, to say the least, [be extraordinarily violent, with
possibly hundreds of warships and many thousands of aircraft and armored
vehicles all focused in densely packed battlespaces]{.underline}. [In
such an environment, speed in decision-making, deployment, and
engagement will undoubtedly prove a critical asset]{.underline}.
**[Given future super-smart, precision-guided weaponry, whoever fires
first will have a better chance of success, or even survival, than a
slower-firing adversary]{.underline}**. Humans can move swiftly in such
situations when forced to do so, but **[future machines will act far
more swiftly]{.underline}**, while keeping track of more battlefield
variables. As General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told Congress in 2017, "[It is very compelling when one looks at
the capabilities that artificial intelligence can bring to the speed and
accuracy of command and control and the capabilities that advanced
robotics might bring to a complex battlespace, particularly
machine-to-machine interaction in space and cyberspace, where speed is
of the essence]{.underline}." **[Aside from aiming to exploit AI in the
development of its own weaponry, US military officials are intensely
aware that their principal adversaries are also pushing ahead in the
weaponization of AI and robotics, seeking novel ways to overcome
America's advantages in conventional weaponry]{.underline}**. According
to the Congressional Research Service, for instance, [China is investing
heavily in the development of artificial intelligence and its
application to military purposes.]{.underline} Though lacking the tech
base of either China or the United States, [Russia is similarly rushing
the development of AI and robotics]{.underline}. **[Any significant
Chinese or Russian lead in such emerging technologies that might
threaten this country's military superiority would be intolerable to the
Pentagon.]{.underline}** Not surprisingly then, in the fashion of past
arms races (from the pre-World War I development of battleships to Cold
War nuclear weaponry), [an "arms race in AI" is now underway, with the
US, China, Russia, and other nation]{.underline}s (including Britain,
Israel, and South Korea) [seeking to gain a critical advantage in the
weaponization of artificial intelligence and robotics]{.underline}.
Pentagon officials regularly cite Chinese advances in AI when seeking
congressional funding for their projects, just as Chinese and Russian
military officials undoubtedly cite American ones to fund their own pet
projects. [In true arms race fashion, this dynamic is already
accelerating the pace of development and deployment of AI-empowered
systems and ensuring their future prominence in warfare.]{.underline}

#### It\'ll be integrated into conventional warfighting strategies that ensure escalation to full-blow nuclear war

**Klare '18** -- is professor emeritus of peace and world-security

Such a **[danger arises from the convergence of multiple advances in
technology: not just AI and robotics, but the development of
conventional strike capabilities like hypersonic missiles capable of
flying at five or more times the speed of sound, electromagnetic rail
guns, and high-energy lasers]{.underline}**. **[Such weaponry, though
non-nuclear, when combined with AI surveillance and
target-identification systems, could even attack an enemy's mobile
retaliatory weapons and so threaten to eliminate its ability to launch a
response to any nuclear attack]{.underline}**. **[Given such a "use 'em
or lose 'em" scenario, any power might be inclined not to wait but to
launch its nukes at the first sign of possible attack]{.underline}**,
**[or]{.underline}** even, fearing loss of control in an uncertain,
fast-paced engagement, **[delegate launch authority to its
machines]{.underline}**. And once that occurred, **[it could prove
almost impossible to prevent further escalation.]{.underline}** The
question then arises: Would machines make better decisions than humans
in such a situation? They certainly are capable of processing vast
amounts of information over brief periods of time and weighing the pros
and cons of alternative actions in a thoroughly unemotional manner. But
machines also make military mistakes and, above all, they lack the
ability to reflect on a situation and conclude: Stop this madness. No
battle advantage is worth global human annihilation. As Paul Scharre put
it in Army of None, a new book on AI and warfare, "[Humans are not
perfect, but they can empathize with their opponents and see the bigger
picture. Unlike humans, autonomous weapons would have no ability to
understand the consequences of their actions, no ability to step back
from the brink of war."]{.underline} **[So maybe we should think twice
about giving some future militarized version of Alexa the power to
launch a machine-made Armageddon]{.underline}**.

[Conclusion]{.underline} In the previous sections, [we presented **three
epistemic problems** that may arise in contexts of using **BT**
and]{.underline} exemplary **[B-INT]{.underline}**, namely: [**B-INTs**
do not work properly (due to **technical device
failures**]{.underline}), [B-INTs generate **justified** **true**
**beliefs** in recipients whereas these beliefs do not constitute
**knowledge** (i.e. these beliefs are Gettier cases), and B-INTs
generate knowledge depending on certain purposes of their
use.]{.underline} Subsequently, we pointed out [several issues of
epistemic injustice]{.underline}, which may [arise from **actuations**
of these **epistemic** **problems**]{.underline}. We mentioned
[automation bias]{.underline} as one such problem, which [becomes even
more problematic if its consequences are generalized]{.underline}.
Moreover, we discussed [the problem behind the belief-forming process
that occurs when]{.underline} the origin of [one's knowledge is
not]{.underline}, or only accidentally, [related to the person or thing
one has knowledge of]{.underline}. We called this the requirement of
person-oriented knowledge and contrasted it with a consequentialist
understanding of applying the concept of knowledge. To illustrate our
point, we showed that [the personoriented concept of knowledge is
violated, among other things, when the police uses **racial
profiling**]{.underline}. Viewed more generally, [we argued that
whenever decision-making follows a **statistical rationale**, it is
crucial]{.underline} that [we add other layers of knowledge-formation
rather than merely the statistical numbers]{.underline} (e.g. ethical or
historical information). This holds true for racial profiling as well as
for statistical inferences that an algorithm might use. Finally, we
discussed [a shift towards **power-relations** in which mutual human
recognition is replaced by machines which eventually make humans
superfluous.]{.underline} It is important to note that [by assuming the
**epistemic point of view** we argue that assessing and evaluating
algorithms requires much more than the traditional canon of issues (e.g.
**data protection, privacy**]{.underline}). We also wish to emphasize
that [it is not enough to say that the quality of an algorithm's outcome
depends on the quality of the input]{.underline}. Rather, we hold that
[even if the outcome is correct, true and one cause for knowledge (i.e.
for instance, the algorithm as well as its training data are unbiased
and free of any misconceptions), in epistemic terms the user or a third
party can still be harmed]{.underline}, either [because of **potential
social consequences** of an algorithm forming cases of Gettier beliefs
or because of possible consequences resulting from it generating
knowledge with regard to a certain purpose]{.underline}. This insight
needs to complement non-epistemic evaluations and must guide future work
on the ethics of algorithms.

### 1NC -- Unethical

#### Neurotechnology has the potential to [alter personalities]{.underline} and [morality]{.underline} -- striking a [myriad]{.underline} of ethical concerns.

[**Neurotechnology** raises **ethical** questions]{.underline} that are
[associated with what we call our "**self**" or "**soul**," complex
philosophical concepts with many presuppositions]{.underline} (Vogeley
and Gallagher, 2011). [The ethical debate usually draws on the concept
of personhood as a "modern" notion that includes core aspects that we
typically ascribe to our self or soul]{.underline} (Merkel et al.,
2007). [These include **self-consciousness, responsibility**,
**planning** of the **individual** **future**, and **similar
dimensions**]{.underline}. In our deliberations, [we should first make
ourselves aware of the notions of "person" and "personal identity" as
fundamental concepts of ethics]{.underline}. **[Integrity]{.underline}**
and [dignity of a person are the most relevant criteria for the ethical
evaluation of technological interventions]{.underline}. The concept of
[**personhood** always has **normative implications**, because we not
only describe certain attributes and capabilities of a person, but we
want to have them **recognized**, **acknowledged** and
**guaranteed**.]{.underline} For example, the principle of "informed
consent," which is so important in clinical practice, refers to the
notion of personhood (cf. Beauchamp and Childress, 2008). Patients must
consciously authorize a neurotechnological intervention before it is
conducted. Along similar lines, the concept of a person can provide an
ethical benchmark, assuming that we do not want to impair personal
capabilities such as autonomy and responsibility by interventions in the
brain. [Neurotechnological interventions are ethically not acceptable if
remaining a person is at ris]{.underline}k. The current practice of
[neurotechnological interventions is, explicitly and **implicitly**,
**orientated** toward the concept of **personhood**]{.underline}.

Yet, [the situation is more **complicated**]{.underline}---as [it is so
often the case in **ethical evaluations**]{.underline} (Schermer, 2011).
[Although a patient typically does remain a person after an intervention
in the strict philosophical sense of the term]{.underline}, ~~he or
she~~ [\[they\] could be left with an altered personality, with
unfamiliar character traits and new or previously subliminal behavioral
patterns]{.underline}. Upon the use of DBS in PD patients, an altered
personality can be diagnosed in many cases. Some of them are subtle, but
they may also be quite severe. [We have seen the onset of a depressive
disorder that had not existed prior to the intervention. There are cases
of disproportionate euphoria occurring in patients]{.underline}, who
before DBS onset had been known for their "rational" behavior, but are
now inclined to risky financial decisions, for example. [What we observe
here is not so much an **impairment of personhood**, but **alterations**
of **personality** and **character traits.**]{.underline}

[Is the patient\'s personal identity threatened in these
cases]{.underline}? The concept of personal identity refers to the
question of to which degree and under which circumstances a person
remains the same over time, above and beyond physical identity.
[Answering this question requires that we develop concepts and provide
criteria which allow us to establish the "sameness" of a person over
time]{.underline}, a complicated problem that is ethically relevant,
however. [Not only the interaction with other humans, but also the
appreciation of moral capabilities---such as the ability to make a
promise and keep it---are firmly rooted in the assumption that we and
the others remain "**the same**" beyond any doubt]{.underline}. In the
international debate on this (see Baylis, 2013), there is the tacit
assumption that, even in the face of distinct and visible personality
changes, personal identity is not compromised. Drawing on concepts of
narrative identity we can assume the "sameness" of a person, because
human beings experience themselves as being the same though the
narrative of their life history. Even the sizeable gaps implicated by
illness or a debilitating therapy such as DBS are perceived as an
integral part of one\'s own history, of one\'s identity. In his book
Deep in the Brain, the sociologist Helmut Dubiel elaborated on his
personal experience with Parkinson\'s Disease and DBS (Dubiel, 2009).
His struggle to understand the technology in his head, and how it
affects his daily life, can be considered an example of how
neurotechnology can be integrated in someone\'s life, his experiential
horizon, his self-concept and self-image. Even in such a severe case,
personal identity is not put in question at all. Despite all personal
distortions and weird experiences, Dubiel remains the same.

Yet, there are also examples where this constancy can no longer be
assumed. Medical ethicist Walter [Glannon describes the story of a
patient who, after having undergone DBS, entered a state of euphoria
such that his family could no longer recognize him as the one they knew
before]{.underline} (Glannon, 2009a). [The patient himself, however,
felt very happy in his condition; not only were the negative symptoms of
Parkinson\'s Disease suppressed to a large extent, but also did he just
feel "happier" as a result of his stimulation-induced mania. When a
decision had to be made as to whether he should be admitted to a mental
institution as he could no longer live on his own, several dilemmas
became apparent: In which "state" should a person be asked for his
informed consent on a treatment? Should the **patient** be consulted
**before** or **after** the **stimulation** in cases like the one
reported above? Which of the patient\'s "**states**" qualifies him or
her as "**self-responsible**"? But we must also take into account the
family environment and the health care system: How much "**alienation**"
must relatives accept? Should **society** cover the costs for
hospitalization?]{.underline}

[**As trade tensions rise** between the U.S. and China,
r]{.underline}are [e]{.underline}arth [m]{.underline}ineral[s
are]{.underline} once [again in the political spotlight]{.underline}.
Today Chinese mines and processing facilities provide most of the
world\'s supply, and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hinted about using
this as political leverage in trade negotiations with U.S. President
Donald Trump\'s administration. But in the long run, many [experts say
the global market involving these materials would likely survive **even
if China completely stopped exporting them**]{.underline}. The 17 rare
earth elements, which cluster near the bottom of the periodic table,
play a vital role in several industries: consumer electronics including
Apple AirPods and iPhones, green technologies such as General Electric
wind turbines and Tesla electric cars, medical tools including Philips
Healthcare scanners, and military hardware such as F-35 jet fighters.
The U.S. government lists them among minerals deemed critical to the
country\'s economic and national security, and the Trump administration
notably exempted rare earth elements from tariffs it imposed on \$300
billion worth of Chinese goods. On the other side of the trade conflict,
Xi recently made a politically symbolic visit to one of China\'s main
rare earth mining and processing facilities, and China used tariffs of
its own to target a U.S. rare earth mine in California. Such political
posturing on both sides, however, may overemphasize the world\'s
reliance on China\'s supply of rare earth elements. \"Politicians get
too alarmed or too wrapped up in the idea of political manipulation of
markets,\" says Eugene Gholz, an associate professor of political
science at the University of Notre Dame. \"There\'s a big difference
between individual companies making or losing money, and the large-scale
ability to get political influence in this particular market.\" [The
\"rare\"]{.underline} in the name of this group of elements
[is]{.underline} actually somewhat [misleading]{.underline}; the U.S.
Geological Survey [describes them as \"**relatively abundant** in the
Earth\'s crust.\"]{.underline} But extraction is complicated by the fact
that in the ground, such elements are jumbled together with many other
minerals in different concentrations. The raw ores go through a first
round of processing to produce concentrates, which head to another
facility where high-purity rare earth elements are isolated. Such
facilities perform complex chemical processes that most commonly involve
a procedure called solvent extraction, in which the dissolved materials
go through hundreds of liquid-containing chambers that separate
individual elements or compounds---steps that may be repeated hundreds
or even thousands of times. Once purified, they can be processed into
oxides, phosphors, metals, alloys and magnets that take advantage of
these elements\' unique magnetic, luminescent or electrochemical
properties. The strong and lightweight nature of rare earth magnets,
metals and alloys have made them especially valuable in high-tech
products. [China currently has most of the world\'s separation
facilities---but if it ever were to stop exporting the purified
materials, **other options exist**]{.underline}. In the short term,
[U.S. companies that rely on these minerals would likely have
**inventory stockpiles** for brief supply shortages]{.underline}, Gholz
says, who served from 2010 to 2012 as senior advisor to the Pentagon\'s
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial
Base Policy. [To stretch those stockpiles out, the overall market could
prioritize r]{.underline}are [e]{.underline}arth [e]{.underline}lement[s
for crucial applications]{.underline} such as military and medical
technologies, while forcing makers of headphones or golf bags to pay
more. \"I don\'t think there is an obvious supply gap or hole where
someone will not be able to get a Prius or Tesla or whatever they\'re
looking at,\" Gholz says. [In the event of a longer Chinese supply
interruption, the U.S. rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, Calif.,
would]{.underline} likely [become the first place to step up
production]{.underline}, Gholz explains. The mine\'s previous owner,
Molycorp, spent approximately \$1.5 billion building a new separation
facility for producing rare earth concentrates. It did not, however,
complete the downstream processing needed to produce purified rare earth
materials before the company went bankrupt in 2015 because of Chinese
competition. The mine\'s new owner, MP Materials, plans to reactivate
and complete the mothballed facility for fresh operation starting in
2020. Another alternative is Australian company Lynas Corp., the
world\'s only significant rare earths producer outside China. It
currently operates a mine at Mount Weld in Australia, and sends ores to
a separation facility in Malaysia that can purify the rare earth
materials---but a complication has arisen from the fact that some ores
contain radioactive thorium. Environmental concerns about low-level
radioactive waste from the separation facility recently led Lynas to
announce it will move some some of the \"upstream\" processing (which
involves the radioactivity) back to Australia, while keeping
\"downstream\" processing in Malaysia. The company has also announced it
will work with Texas-based Blue Line Corp. to build a new
[separation]{.underline} facility in the U.S. for operations starting in
2022 at the earliest. Beyond existing mines, [companies that dig for
other resources]{.underline} might [start extracting r]{.underline}are
[e]{.underline}arth [e]{.underline}lement[s from deposits of different
materials]{.underline}. For example, [the U.S. could someday obtain
these elements as byproducts from power plant coal ash and coal mining
waste. And radioactive material mixed in with ores could end up being
positive]{.underline}: If thorium-based nuclear plants prove viable,
expanded thorium mining would also turn up usable rare earth minerals.
Researchers have even begun investigating a large concentration of rare
earth elements in deep-sea mud from an ocean floor deposit near Japan.
Some industries that rely on rare earth elements are going outside the
box and looking for ways to bypass mining entirely. After all, such
operations in China and elsewhere have significant environmental impacts
that can threaten human health in the absence of strict regulation. The
presence of radioactive thorium in some ore is one example. In addition,
some mining and separation processes involve chemicals that produce
toxic wastewater. All of these dangerous byproducts require scrupulous
storage and disposal. [With China threatening to weaponize its advantage
when it comes to r]{.underline}are [e]{.underline}arth
[e]{.underline}lement[s]{.underline}, more [companies]{.underline} may
[invest in innovations that could **replace these
materials**]{.underline} with something else. Gholz points to a [2010
incident]{.underline} in which [China temporarily cut off Japan from its
supply of r]{.underline}are [e]{.underline}arth
[e]{.underline}lement[s]{.underline}. [After]{.underline}ward, [Japanese
automakers]{.underline} such as Toyota and Honda [began developing
hybrid car motors that greatly **reduced** or even **eliminated**
r]{.underline}are [e]{.underline}arth
[e]{.underline}lement[s]{.underline}, such as terbium and dysprosium,
from the powerful magnets used in electric motors. During the 2010
supply scare, [other large industries that used r]{.underline}are
[e]{.underline}arth [e]{.underline}lement[s]{.underline} also
[discovered **they could do without**]{.underline} some of
**[them]{.underline}**. Oil refinery operators temporarily stopped using
the rare earth element lanthanum, which improves oil refining
efficiency, when the price went up. The glassmaking industry largely
abandoned using the rare earth element cerium for polishing. Although
industries related to national security would be unable to entirely
forgo rare earth minerals, Gholz thinks [the U.S. military\'s demand
could be \"**easily satisfied by non-Chinese production**\"]{.underline}
because this need represents less than 5 percent of the total market. In
any case, a variety of [industries]{.underline} will continue to rely
heavily on rare earth minerals. To obtain them without depending on
Chinese or U.S. mines, they [could **recycle**]{.underline} those
[elements already used]{.underline} in products, says Eric Schelter, a
professor of chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, whose research
projects include developing new chemical processes for separating rare
earth elements from ore. \"The appeal here is that there has already
been a significant energy input and waste output to purify rare earth
elements from their ore materials,\" he says. \"Simply throwing them
away is therefore wasteful, considering that in technological devices,
they are typically relatively pure compared to their ores.\" He pointed
to many research projects at both academic and government labs: the
latter include the U.S. Department of Energy\'s Critical Materials
Institute at the Ames Laboratory and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
For example, rare earth elements such as neodymium and dysprosium are
frequently combined in permanent magnets. To separate them, Schelter\'s
lab has developed chemical processes that can selectively dissolve one
rare earth element while the other remains solid. It\'s a \"fast and
efficient approach to metals separation,\" he says, but the cost is
currently not competitive with mining. Still, he thinks that could
change because the market price of rare earth elements is currently kept
\"artificially low\"---it does not account for the cost of waste
treatment and handling during the mining and separation processes. If
the recycled versions of these materials were marketed as cleaner
alternatives to mined rare earth elements, it might encourage companies
seeking a greener image to pay more for them. \"Consumers recognize the
importance of free trade coffee and consequences of blood diamonds,\"
Schelter says. \"It stands to reason that ethical cobalt and clean or
recycled rare earth elements can contribute to a more sustainable
picture for this industry.\"

### 1NC -- BCIs fail

#### Doesn't solve -- too many compounding risks

[Safety risks can be grouped by]{.underline} BCI component: [electrodes,
power supply, or data processing]{.underline}. Some safety risks
associated with each component occur at surgical implantation or device
set-up and others occur later in the life of the device (Mak and Wolpaw
2009). As these [devices]{.underline} are inducing foreign material into
the body, they [generate problems of biocompatibility]{.underline}. In
addition, the nature of [BCI]{.underline} as a rapidly evolving field
[generates risks associated with available materials but also
uncertainties as to device capabilities over time.]{.underline}

**[Bleeding and infection]{.underline}** are known risks of surgical
implantation. Limited systematic data exists in BCI, such as bleeding
and infection (Mak and Wolpaw 2009). In DBS the [perioperative risks of
**hemorrhage**]{.underline} are 2--4 % [and]{.underline} of
**[infection]{.underline}** 2--6 % (Foley 2015). Less is known about
[local tissue damage as electrodes are passed through cortical or
subcortical tissues]{.underline} (McGie 2013).

Electrodes can undergo [tissue encapsulation]{.underline} through
formation of a capsule or [scar around the electrode]{.underline} by
surrounding neurons, [or biochemical isolation through inhibition
of]{.underline} axonal [growth]{.underline} and pulling away of recorded
neurons---both of which [lead to a **degradation in BCI signal
quality**]{.underline}. If encapsulation leads to decreased fidelity of
signal detection, [higher]{.underline} levels of [stimulation may be
required to overcome encapsulation resistance]{.underline}, with
resultant tissue damage and spread of stimulation beyond the original
field.

**[Electrodes corrode]{.underline}** over time [and can]{.underline} be
[pull]{.underline}ed [away from target tissue]{.underline} if tethered
too firmly to wired processing and power systems (vs. wireless). While
there are noted longevity successes of electrodes---for instance, a
patient with locked-in syndrome due to ALS retaining 83 % accuracy at 2
years (Sellars 2010) and a subject with brainstem stroke maintaining
some control over a robotic limb after 5 years (Hochberg et al. 2012),
[loss of functioning]{.underline} electrodes [over time]{.underline} is
a well-known and translation-limiting problem in BCI.

The potential of stimulation to induce **[neuroplasticity
changes]{.underline}** in brain signaling is known, but poorly
understood, particularly in the case of chronic stimulation (McGie
2013). Most risk-related data on chronic electrocorticography (Ecog)
comes from 7 to 10 days of implantation associated with epilepsy surgery
monitoring. Theoretical risks of neuroplasticity include [lowered
seizure thresholds, neoplastic cellular cascades, and disrupted cell
signaling through local pH changes.]{.underline}

Advancements in electrode design may lead to **[obsolescence of
implanted electrodes]{.underline}**. [Early adopters]{.underline} of BCI
[may be disadvantaged if they require explantation]{.underline} of
outmoded technology, such as if power and computation [systems are
**not**]{.underline} made **[backward compatible]{.underline}** with
"old" electrodes. Early adopters may also be suboptimal candidates for
next generation technology. [Implant-induced changes]{.underline} in
brain chemistry and structure may [alter the safety or
efficacy]{.underline} profile [of]{.underline}, or be an exclusionary
criterion for, [re-implantation]{.underline}. Early adopter risk in
neural engineering research has not received significant attention
(Finder 2012).

BCI systems require a source of [power]{.underline} and this
[generates]{.underline} associated [safety issues]{.underline}. Some of
these issues arise from bringing power to implanted electrodes. Current
wired systems, such as battery-powered systems, use wires that pass from
outside the skin, through the skull, and into the epidural space,
subdural space, or into brain tissue to reach and power electrodes. The
[tissue interface with the wired system can lead to **skin erosion** and
**abnormal bone growth**.]{.underline} Standard [wired]{.underline} DBS
[systems require periodic battery replacement]{.underline} (about every
5 years) and attendant surgical risks (Larson 2014).

An optimally efficient wireless transfer of energy minimizes absorption
of energy by tissue as it travels from energy source to target. Though
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) standards exist for safe exposure levels
to radio frequency of electromagnetic fields, human safety data on the
short and long term effects of frequency and power densities needed for
BCI devices is limited.

Processors can be affixed to implanted electrodes or located at a
distance from them, such as outside the skin. Just as power must be
delivered to electrodes, [data must be transported away from
electrodes]{.underline} and into a processor. [Wired data transmission
systems run risks of **skin erosion and tissue disruption**]{.underline}
similar to those of wired power systems, whereas [wireless
transmission]{.underline} systems sidestep these risks but
[offer]{.underline} [tradeoffs of lower bandwidth and increased **data
security risks**]{.underline} (McGie 2013). [Encryption]{.underline} of
electrode data at the source [can ameliorate wireless security risks,
though increase energy and chip size demands.]{.underline}

Given Moore's law, [advancements]{.underline} in the processing power of
implanted processors [are likely]{.underline}. Should chips be designed
to be regularly explanted? Does implanting a chip and designing a system
around it, with a currently acceptable set of data speed and energy
tradeoffs, put a subject at risk of being excluded from future devices?
[Trying to anticipate advancements]{.underline} in processing
capabilities [and making near term sacrifices]{.underline} to
accommodate them, [has attendant costs.]{.underline}

[Individuals who are impaired]{.underline} in any number of ways--[owing
to depression, anxiety, dementia, traumatic brain injury, or other
conditions]{.underline}---[may not be able to give informed
consent]{.underline} for research participation. Decision-making
capacity requires the ability to understand study information, reason
about the risks, appreciate the consequences of possible study outcomes,
and choose whether or not to enroll (Appelbaum and Grisso 2001).
Cognitive impairment has been of particular concern in DBS research.
Parkinson's disease, the most common indication for DBS implantation, is
comorbid with dementia in 30 % of patients (Aarsland et al. 2005) and a
study of DBS candidates with advanced Parkinson's disease in one center
found over 70 % with cognitive deficits on neuropsychological testing
(Costello et al. 2011). As a consequence, cognitive impairment is
considered a contraindication to DBS implantation (Lang et al. 2006).
Research into DBS as a treatment for depression has raised questions
about affective impairment and decision-making, though depression has
not been shown to correlate with decisional incapacity in subjects
considering enrollment in DBS trial research (Schermer 2011; Skuban et
al. 2011).

[Cognitive impairment can reduce the capacity to give consent in BCI
research]{.underline} (Hochberg and Cochrane 2013). Early research in
BCI has focused on motor or sensory impairment, enrolling subjects with
conditions like spinal cord injury or ALS. Cognitive impairment can be
comorbid with motor or sensory impairments targeted by BCI. For
instance, frontotemporal dementia is found in 15 % of patients with ALS
(Ringholz et al. 2005) and 30 % of ALS patients exhibit executive
dysfunction sufficiently severe to be considered cognitively impaired
(Consonni et al. 2013). Traumatic brain injury can causes cognitive
impairment that impairs the ability to consent (Johnson-Green 2010). BCI
has also been proposed as a treatment for cognitive impairment. Based on
preliminary studies of DBS in Alzheimer's disease, some have speculated
that BCI may be a viable approach to treatment of dementia (Liberati et
al. 2011). Research in populations with dementia raise well known issues
of capacity to consent and re-consent.

Decision-making capacity may be unproblematic at study outset but
[individuals may become impaired during the course of BCI
research]{.underline}. [**Impairment** may result **from**]{.underline}
natural progression of a disease or from **[device
function]{.underline}**. For instance, progressive cognitive impairment
in epilepsy is common, either due to ongoing seizure activity or due to
side effects of antiepileptic medications (Seidenberg et al. 2007). BCI
systems for detecting and treating seizures, such as Neuropace, have an
expected lifespan of at least 5 years. It is not currently known what
percentage of individuals with an implanted BCI seizure-detection system
will progress to significant cognitive impairment due to underlying
epilepsy, nor are long term cognitive side effects of BCI surgical
implantation and chronic stimulation known. Whether neurostimulation can
cause or exacerbate cognitive decline, for instance in Parkinson's
disease, is a matter of controversy (Morishita et al. 2014).

Interval development of cognitive impairment in BCI research raises
informed consent problems of two sorts. (1) Consent for ongoing
participation in research may become void if decision-making capacity
becomes sufficiently impaired. Except where otherwise specified,
suspected decisional impairment requires re-consent for continued study
participation. (2) BCI systems may become less reliable in the setting
of cognitive impairment. For instance, a BCI seizure detection system
may require that individuals report accurate information back to
researchers ("I felt an aura" or "I had 2 seizures last week") in order
to optimize device functioning and provide actionable information to
subjects (e.g., "you have a high likelihood of experiencing a seizure
within the next 2 min"). Devices that rely on preserved subject
cognition may fail to function optimally or may even lead to unsafe
situations (e.g., continued driving). Further, BCI systems that invest
subjects with cognitive control over device function provide an
additional layer of concern. BCI devices may 1 day allow individuals to
modulate device activity through thought alone. A BCI that allows an
individual to control an essential tremor through formation of motor
intentions (e.g., "I want to stop shaking now") is currently underway
(Herron and Chizeck 2014). It is an open question whether
patient-controlled BCI devices will work or work safely in the setting
of cognitive impairment.

An additional layer of concern attends studies in which [a BCI
device]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} a way or [the only way to
assess cognitive impairment]{.underline}. For instance, how well
individuals use a BCI over time provides information about various
aspects of cognition---attention, concentration, memory, motivation,
judgment and so on. A change in patterns of cognitive functioning, as
recorded by a device, may signal the onset or progression of a disease,
such as dementia. Privileged access to such information generates
obligations on the part of BCI researchers to ensure that such relevant
"incidental findings" are communicated to subjects in a timely and
clinically appropriate manner. Models for communicating incidental
findings in neuroscience are in development (Drazin et al. 2013). In
populations with impaired communication, like locked-in syndrome (LIS),
BCI devices may become the only way to assess for cognitive decline over
time (Kübler and Birbaumer 2008). This is particularly important in
light of evidence that the progressive loss of communication resulting
from LIS may cause cognitive impairment (the "extinction of thought"
hypothesis) (Kübler and Birbaumer 2008). A window into a subject's
mental life creates obligations on the part of BCI researchers to
develop protocols for ongoing assessment of consent and assent.

Communicative impairment affects the ability to express decisions about
BCI research participation (Clausen 2011). As mentioned previously, loss
of communication is a feature of some populations targeted by BCI
research, such as ALS and LIS. Consent processes in subjects with
impaired communication can be demanding and resource intensive,
requiring nuance beyond "yes" or "no" questions (Glannon 2014). For
subjects enrolling in BCI research after loss of communication
abilities---such as advanced ALS, LIS, or individuals in a minimally
conscious state (MCS), the problem is stark: can subjects be enrolled in
BCI research without their initial consent? If BCI is the only
reasonable option for reestablishing communication, can consent be
presumed until a subject becomes able to communicate whether or not to
continue participating? What would count as sufficient evidence of
decision-making capacity in this population? The potential harms of
study participation may be significant---brain surgery and physically
and emotionally demanding BCI training---but the opportunity cost of
life devoid of communication is also a significant harm. Work on ethical
guidelines for DBS in disorders of consciousness is a step in the right
direction (Patuzzo and Manganotti 2014), but BCI may present additional
challenges (e.g., burdens of training) that need to be addressed in this
population (Glannon 2014; McCullagh et al. 2014).

Therapeutic misconception and [**unrealistic expectations** are concerns
in BCI]{.underline} as well. The therapeutic misconception is
particularly challenging in the absence of a clear research-therapy
distinction (Vlek et al. 2012). In the design of most pharmacologic
trials, for instance, research intervention parameters are set in
advance, often rigidly so (e.g., drug A or drug B or placebo, or drug A
at low, medium, or high dose, etc.). With the parameters of an
intervention set in advance, it is reasonable for subject expectations
of benefit to be dichotomous. "If I get drug A, my cancer may shrink;
but if I get placebo, it will likely not." [In BCI]{.underline}
[trials]{.underline}, however, [the intervention can be iterative
and]{.underline} largely [open-ended]{.underline}. After surgical
implantation, [device function is optimized over time]{.underline},
often in ways that are [not fully codifiable]{.underline} in advance.
[Leads may fail]{.underline}, more efficient ways to deliver power or
extract information may be discovered, or data computation shortcuts may
be discovered. [Making "technical" adjustments]{.underline} is often
[unavoidable]{.underline} and may be unethical not to implement.
Further, given all that is invested on the part of the subject and the
research team, both parties may continue to work and make study
adjustments until a beneficial result is achieved. As such, though
labeled "research," a BCI trial shares features of a therapeutic
intervention.

[Management of expectations is a challenge in BCI research]{.underline}
(Haselager et al. 2009; Glannon 2014; Schneider et al. 2012). Physical
and emotional investment on the part of subjects is substantial (McGie
et al. 2013; Mak and Wolpaw 2009). McCullagh et al. (2014) notes that in
participating in a BCI protocol "which may often seem monotonous, the
need for sustained attention and/or concentration, and allocating
sufficient personal time often for repeated recording sessions, means
that BCI investigation is particularly demanding on the motivation of
the subject, who may become fatigued or even exasperated by poor
achievable results." More broadly, 15--**[30 % of subjects
fail]{.underline}** [to use a BCI system]{.underline} effectively, a
phenomenon that has been [called "**BCI illiteracy**]{.underline}"
(Kubler and Muller 2007). Failure to prepare both subjects and family
for the possibility of BCI illiteracy can lead to disappointment.

Current [BCI research has as its backdrop]{.underline} the genre of
[science fiction]{.underline}, from Mary Shelly's Frankenstein to Star
Trek cyborgs. [**Media portrayals** of BCI]{.underline} achievements,
suc[h a person with paraplegia grasping a water bottle with a
BCI-controlled robotic arm]{.underline}
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogBX18maUiM) [or a person with a
wearable BCI controlled exoskeleton kicking a soccer ball]{.underline}
at the 2014 World Cup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WO71e0XLqs),
[raise the floor of expectations]{.underline} for BCI, in part by
[**blur**ring **lines between science fiction and
reality**]{.underline}. [Short videos]{.underline} of BCI successes,
whether produced by scientists, news media, industry or others, [are
easily decontextualized]{.underline}. As has been noted in DBS, video is
particularly powerful at elevating expectations (Bell et al. 2010).
[Left out of view is]{.underline} a background of **[highly selected
subjects]{.underline}**, months or **[years of]{.underline}** [tedious
trial and error]{.underline} **[training]{.underline}**, [narrowing of
scope around]{.underline} **[specific tasks]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} the [opportunity costs of spending
substantial]{.underline} scientific and societal [resources to make
discrete BCI-related tasks possible]{.underline}. It is not surprising
that absent this framing context[, resultant public expectations are
high, and lead to a BCI expectation gap]{.underline}. This has led to a
call for fostering [relationships between scientists and
media]{.underline} that are more conducive to accurate reporting on the
current state and future potential of BCI (Haselager et al. 2009). BCI
researchers should be mindful [that though media coverage of BCI carries
a largely positive valence]{.underline} at present, [this could
change]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} is evidenced by **[the history of
psychosurgery]{.underline}** (Skuban et al. 2011).

Expectations of subjects as to [what happens after study]{.underline}
completion [are]{.underline} particularly [challenging]{.underline} for
researchers to address (Schneider et al. 2012). What happens to the
subject with an implanted BCI system after study outcomes have been
achieved? Do subjects have the option to keep using a system after the
study ends if they endorse benefit, or must it be disabled, or even
explanted? Who pays for medical care associated with BCI systems after
the study ends, say to treat skull bone erosion, or to replace
batteries? Who updates software or monitors for malfunctions? [The
current funding structure of BCI does not uniformly include mechanisms
for addressing]{.underline} these [questions]{.underline}, and private
foundations or other sources are not a sustainable model as BCI research
continues to expand. BCI researchers have an obligation to communicate
at study onset the uncertainty that currently exists about post-study
care and to work during and after study completion to protect subjects
from abandonment (Schneider et al. 2012).

### 2NC -- BCIs Fail

#### Innovation in BCIs [fail]{.underline}\-\--future predictions are [impossible]{.underline} and numerous barriers [doom]{.underline} effective DoD guidance

**Vahle 20** (Mark W. Vahle \| 'OPPORTUNITIES AND IMPLICATIONS OF
BRAINCOMPUTER INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY' \|
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1122494.pdf> \| DOA: 7/7/2022 \|
SAoki)

The first step in the projection of any disruptive technology is to
understand the limitations of prediction. [BCIs]{.underline} and related
technology [are]{.underline} not limited to one field but represent [an
interdisciplinary effort]{.underline} as described earlier. This
interdisciplinary effort implies that **[advances in one field tend to
influence other areas]{.underline}**. Since these areas of study all
seem to be growing exponentially, [predicting where one domain will
be]{.underline} in the next five, 10, or 20 years [seems
**futile**]{.underline}. While general technological trends can be
extrapolated, the further from the present we get, the larger the
uncertainty volume gets and therefore we have less predictability. [This
is particularly true concerning BCIs]{.underline} [because the
tech]{.underline}nology [requires huge]{.underline} technological
[jumps]{.underline} in many different fields. According to its mission
statement, DARPA is seeking technologies that create transformational
change rather than incremental improvements. Their
[investments]{.underline} in basic research f[ocus on "moonshot"-type
problems, and]{.underline} as a result they [often
**fail**]{.underline}. [Failure within **BCI**-related research may lead
to **massive shifts** in tech]{.underline}nology. Since a large number
of technical hurdles have been overcome in the past few years,
considerable challenges still exist that may [slow, stop, or
divert]{.underline} the [tech]{.underline}nology [into something
**completely different** from expectations]{.underline}. The next
section introduces and describes four challenges that BCIs face. These
[challenges will guide how the DOD]{.underline} and USAF [apply this
tech]{.underline}nology. Technical Hurdles Before projecting where BCI
technology may be in coming years and forecasting what is or is not
possible, it is essential to understand the technical challenges
involved. These technical challenges are not trivial and may
significantly alter how the DOD and USAF use technology to enhance our
war fighters. First, faulty metaphors and Hollywood hype have influenced
our perception of the brain---[an actual, complete understanding of the
brain and its functions]{.underline} might **[still be decades
away]{.underline}**. Second, **[the body's immune system responds when
subject to a foreign object]{.underline}**. Third, [achieving high
signal resolution---while also ensuring safety with invasive
methods---yields engineering challenges, including issues with power
consumption, biosecurity, communications methods]{.underline} (wireless
or wired), [and decoder efficiency]{.underline}. Finally, ethical,
social, and legal implications arise with BCI implants. These
challenges, while not an all-encompassing list, represent the obstacles
that will guide how the USAF and DOD apply these technologies in future
efforts. The first challenge highlights how far we have to go to gain a
complete understanding of the brain. In the last decade, genetic
sequencing technology and new tools for mapping the brain have led to an
explosion in neuroscience 9 research. Scientists can now use these tools
to map neuronal firing patterns in an attempt to understand how
different firing patterns lead to different actions. However, [the brain
contains between 80 and 100 billion neurons]{.underline} with each
neuron having up to 10,000 connections to its surrounding neurons.25
[Scientists are still **far from understanding** the dynamics of the
**electrochemical interactions** between the neurons and how those
interactions are translated into memories, behaviors, perceptions, and
actions]{.underline}. Often we seek the closest metaphor for the brain,
comparing the brain to a digital computer and its subcomponents. While
similarities exist (both are designed to process and store information),
mechanisms for their processes and are quite different. In reality, when
exposed to new experiences, the brain changes in an orderly way based on
the existing, unique structure that each person has developed over a
lifetime of experiences. Robert Epstein's article, "The Empty Brain,"
states there is no reason to believe that any two of us are changed the
same way by the same experience."26 For example, the firing patterns on
the brains of two air battle managers (ABM) learning the same task would
be dependent on their past experiences. This complicates the prospect of
accurate memory prosthesis or the transferring of knowledge and
experience from one person to another. The brain does indeed have a
modular design, with certain areas designed for specific functions
(i.e., movement planning, movement execution, aggression, attention, and
so forth). This indicates that although the brain activity of the two
ABMs will not be identical, they will likely be similar. There may be a
quasi-transitive property within the brain like in mathematics (i.e., 5
x 6 = 6 x 5), where neurons are arranged differently but retain the same
data. [The first step in making an informed prediction about the future
of BCIs is to temper our expectations]{.underline}. This can be
accomplished by taking some time to understand what metaphors are valid
and invalid depending on what is being compared. The second challenge to
BCIs is the body's natural immune response when subject to a foreign
body. This is particularly important for invasive BCIs that reside under
the skin. Invasive [BCIs]{.underline} typically [use an array of
micro-electrodes]{.underline} in direct contact with specific neurons in
the brain. [Once the body recognizes the electrode as a foreign body,
the **immune system goes to work** much like it would in the case of a
splinter]{.underline}. The [result is]{.underline} a process called
**[tissue encapsulation]{.underline}**, in which the electrode is
surrounded by a fibrous capsule of tissue called a glial scar. The
Journal of Neuroscience Methods article states the scar's purpose is
believed to be separating "damaged neural tissue from the rest of the
body to maintain the blood-brain barrier."27 [This]{.underline} capsule
[reduces the signal recording ability of the electrodes and sometimes
results in the death of the particular neuron, to the point
where]{.underline} some **[BCIs become unusable]{.underline}** after a
few 10 weeks. Worth noting are many research efforts attempting to solve
the biocompatibility problem with tissue-response modifying drugs and
advanced material coatings like hydrogels (which mimic soft body
tissue).28 However, bodily response represents the most significant
challenge to achieving a chronic or long-term BCI in clinical patients.
Today's BCIs are limited to clinical studies under the close care of
physicians. The physicians have to not only work fast to gather data as
the encapsulation takes place but also strictly monitor the patient for
a brain infection. Until the biocompatibility of medical devices is
improved, this challenge will likely limit the use of invasive BCIs to
clinical populations for the next decade. Therefore, this pushes DOD and
USAF near- and medium-term applications toward noninvasive methods. The
third challenge facing BCIs is overcoming engineering hurdles to achieve
high signal resolution while also ensuring safety with invasive methods.
The goal with any BCI is to produce a bidirectional communication with
the brain. Often this is done via electrodes interfacing directly with
neurons. The objective is to achieve high spatial and temporal
resolution with the measurements. This means knowledge of where and when
the measurement happened. The more electrodes that interface with the
neurons, the higher the amount of data the researcher receives. Three
research areas categorize BCIs today. The first is the insertion of an
electrode that measures (or excites) a single neuron. [Electrode methods
are invasive, requiring an operation below the protective layer of skin
that surrounds and protects the brain. Electrodes are subject to tissue
encapsulation and infection]{.underline}. The second method involves
taking measurements from the scalp using electroencephalographic (EEG)
activity.29 EEG methods are noninvasive but are typically characterized
by low spatial and temporal resolution. The third method measures
electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity from the surface of the brain
rather than from inserting electrodes. An ECoG-mesh would likely measure
populations of neurons firing. This method is also invasive but provides
much higher measurement resolution than EEG methods. Additionally, ECoG
methods are useful for avoiding some of the body's immune responses that
create limitations for electrode methods. In addition to resolution and
safety, [BCI engineering challenges]{.underline} also [exist in power
consumption, biosecurity, communications methods]{.underline} (wireless
or wired), [and decoder efficiency]{.underline}. [Power consumption and
biosecurity are fields that sometimes **directly compete** with each
other]{.underline}. Typically medical devices strive for low-power
consumption to reduce battery size and prolong device lifespan. However,
there is an inverse relationship between power requirements and
efficient biosecurity measures, as protecting signals through encryption
increases required computations, driving 11 the power consumption up.
Wireless communication methods are preferred over wired to reduce the
chance of infection; however, they have their range limitations as the
body is an excellent absorber of electromagnetic radiation. Decoders are
also a significant engineering challenge, designed to accomplish the
analyze and translate function of a BCI. This is because the brain is
inherently plastic, meaning it can modify its structure and rewire
itself as we age. As a result, the ability of a decoder to decipher the
intent of neuronal firing patterns will degrade as the brain rewires.30
The decoder needs to be able to understand and adapt to changes in the
brain for the translate function to work correctly. Otherwise, the
decoder would need to be retrained. These challenges are likely to be
overcome as new methods for low-power biosecurity and decoding brain
signals are developed. Additionally, advances in big data analytics and
AI will help assist bringing BCIs closer to reality.

What is clear, however, is that the media bears significant
responsibility to publish appropriately balanced and accurate
information for its potential impact on BCI end-users. Editors and
publishers are therefore obligated to maintain the truth and integrity
of their reporting on BCI technology (as well as in general) \[22, 32\].
Multiple journalist organizations2 cite among their agreed-on principles
of ethical and responsible journalism the principles of truthfulness and
accuracy \[44-47\]. We argue that truthfulness with respect to reporting
on BCIs includes acknowledgement of their limitations as well as
strengths, and accuracy includes thorough analysis of the technology's
current state of the art and issues related to it. Our analysis
indicates that the [current state of BCI reporting in the media does not
uphold these values and obligations]{.underline}, as evidenced by (among
other things) the lack of ethics and risk analysis and [the large body
of articles]{.underline} (25.3%) [discuss]{.underline}ing [the
tech]{.underline}nology [in **overly positive** and **unrealistic** ways
**not supported by research**]{.underline} (Tables 1b and 2b) \[29\].
[These articles depicting extraordinary and fanciful future uses of BCIs
are indicative of a feature of media publishing that **warrants
attention**]{.underline}. When it comes to [science media and reporting
on BCIs]{.underline}, we [are]{.underline} unfortunately observing
narratives rooted (to borrow the words of Harry Frankfurt) in bullshit.
Bullshit (**[BS]{.underline}** from here on), to Frankfurt, does not
consist of deliberate falsehoods or lies. Instead, [it
involves]{.underline} (somewhat reckless) [**manipulations of** elements
of **the truth**]{.underline} of a subject in order to fake the
appearance of authority on a subject, **[to]{.underline}** the end of
**[satisfy]{.underline}**ing [a **personal agenda**]{.underline} \[48\].
The ethical problem with BS is that it is designed to persuade the
public of a particular point of view \[25\], rather than adhering to
principles of journalistic integrity and fulfil obligations to educate
the public \[32, 33, What [we see]{.underline} in our sample is [a large
number of articles that make enthusiastic claims that are **large
extrapolations** on what is or may technically be possible for BCIs
while **ignoring** or **skewing** other important facts, or claims whose
feasibility may never be verifiable or falsifiable]{.underline} (as with
press coverage of one Russian billionaire, Dmitry Itskov, promising to
use BCI technology to grant humans immortality by the year 2045 or using
BCIs to sense the environment of Mars while in Brazil, Table 2b).
Additionally, [these articles]{.underline} more [frequently make bold
predictions that are more likely to **fail**]{.underline} -- for example
the quote about restoring normal motor function to ~~paralysed~~
individuals within five years, a claim made in 2007 that has gone
unfulfilled (see Table 2a and 2b for example quotes). [The
predictions]{.underline} made by these articles [are]{.underline}
especially [problematic because they]{.underline} can seriously
[**distort perception** of what is or will be possible with BCIs, while
also **giving little to no information on associated
risk**]{.underline}. Because of the positive bent of these articles,
this distortion could be coupled with unwarranted inflation of end-user
hopes \[24, 38, 39\]; these hopes could be shattered should predictions
fail. Frankfurt's point about personal agendas motivating such BS is key
-- it has been suggested that stories like in these overly positive
articles (and positive narratives in general) get spread in news media
so prolifically because editors view them as particularly newsworthy
\[25\]. In other words, the personal agenda behind engagement in
oversimplified "biofantasies" surrounding BCIs is to sell a story, which
is aided by the speculation and opinion of the writer. This idea is
supported by the fact that on the rare occasions where actual
participants in BCI clinical trials were interviewed, the positive
aspects of their experiences were emphasized (Table 2b). There was a
lack of follow-up reporting on these individuals after the end of their
clinical trials, potentially eclipsing any difficulties involved with
transitioning back to life without BCIs \[36\]. The motives behind these
cases of BS are not necessarily malicious -- that is, the goal of these
[journalists]{.underline} is not necessarily to intentionally spread
misinformation. Nonetheless, they [partake in BS since they often
neglect to include critical information to balance the positive
narratives]{.underline} when they ought to. On the other hand, positive
narratives can be good so as to prevent unwarranted fear from developing
around BCIs. This presents a serious moral dilemma: how can the media
publish successful stories on BCIs and other biotechnology that are
newsworthy, align with core journalistic principles, and at the same
time be considerate of the many issues facing the technology and its
end-users, while minimally contributing to BS and biofantasy? No system
is currently in place to maintain accountability to such an ideal
standard of reporting, and it remains unclear what it would take to
achieve this \[36\], but it is plain what we have at stake: what do
physicians and researchers do if they have to tell prospective BCI
end-users that the technology cannot do what they think it will?

[The]{.underline} brain-computer interface ([BCI]{.underline}) has been
[associated with the EEG signal features and system]{.underline}. The
extraction of EEG features is necessary to provide valuable information
to the automated and semi-automated systems, which helps in many
applications on a real-time basis. It is also very [popular for brain
activities tool for clinical purpose and used for military medicine,
advancements in biometric fields]{.underline}. The electrical brain
activity can be inferred from different regions, different physiological
and pathological brain states by placing electrodes on the surface of
the scalp \[1\]. [The potential measured from electrodes are used to
classify the brain activity. They are represented by highly complex,
non-stationary and nonlinear biological systems]{.underline}. The
separation of a signal into their components is a great interest in
these applications. The linear and nonlinear EEG signal processing
methods would be used to distinguish or predict these brain activities.
Therefore, time-frequency methods show the promising result \[2\]. The
signal feature extraction methods use linear analysis in time-frequency
domains such as fast Fourier transform (FFT), discrete wavelet transform
(DWT), and eigenvectors \[3\]. The nonlinear methods such as principal
component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and
blind source separation (BSS) \[4\] have been studied to extract the
target components from the raw EEG signals. Wavelets, PCA and ICA are
still hot topics for the decomposition but still have limitations. PCA
and ICA based methods are used to decompose the recorded data as
off-line analysis. It also depended on the independence of signals,
while the sparsity is recently highlighted and this concepts effectively
provide a representation in the linear analysis to be treated as mixed
signals. Wavelet based approaches have high expectations for online EEG
signal decomposition with less computational costs and preserve
time-frequency characteristics in the raw EEG signal to a maximum
extent. The design of wavelet function has a set of restrictions to
decomposition of raw EEG signal accurately \[3, 5\]. Shifts and dilation
of a mother wavelet function has generated a series of orthogonal
spaces. However, wavelets have been used to analyze the EEG signals both
in frequency and time domain at a different level. The wavelets analysis
has multi-resolution capability benefit over Fourier transform and
cosine transform. The different families (Daubechies, Coiflets, and
Symlets) in discrete variant have been used for classification of
feature components \[6, 7\]. The wavelet function design has a complex
issue, working with wavelet transform. [The speed and accuracy of
feature extractions from EEG signals are the critical issues in many
applications and wavelet as temporal-spectral analysis of EEG method has
been discussed as a solution for unstable signals if the mother wavelet
has not introduced appropriately. **The wavelet function does not
categorize the EEG signal features accurately.** Without accurate
models, the nonlinear biological system applications of classical
parametric and nonparametric signal processing methods based on
stationary assumptions often **fail** to provide satisfactory
results]{.underline}. The conventional convolution based implementation
of the DWT has high computational complexity and memory requirements

### 1NC -- No Impact to BCIs

#### Their applications of BCI are neuroscience theater -- its only role is medical

[Rock-climb without fear. Play a symphony in your head. See radar with
superhuman vision. Discover the nature of consciousness. Cure blindness,
paralysis, deafness, and mental illness]{.underline}. Those are just a
few of the applications that Elon Musk and employees at his
four-year-old neuroscience company Neuralink believe electronic
brain-computer interfaces will one day bring about. [None of these
advances are close]{.underline} at hand, [and]{.underline} some [are
**unlikely to ever come**]{.underline} about. But in a "product update"
streamed over YouTube on Friday, Musk, also the founder of SpaceX and
Tesla Motors, joined staffers wearing black masks to discuss the
company's work toward an affordable, reliable brain implant that Musk
believes billions of consumers will clamor for in the future. "In a lot
of ways," Musk said, "It's kind of like a Fitbit in your skull, with
tiny wires." Although the online event was described as a product
demonstration, there is as yet nothing that anyone can buy or use from
Neuralink. (This is for the best, since most [of the company's medical
claims remain highly speculative]{.underline}.) It is, however,
engineering a super-dense electrode technology that is being tested on
animals. Neuralink isn't the first to believe that brain implants could
extend or restore human capabilities. Researchers began placing probes
in the brains of paralyzed people in the late 1990s in order to show
that signals could let them move robot arms or computer cursors. And
mice with visual implants really can perceive infrared rays. Building on
that work, [Neuralink says it hopes to]{.underline} further
[develop]{.underline} such brain-computer interfaces (or [BCIs) to the
point where one can be installed in a doctor's office in under an
hour.]{.underline} "This actually does work," Musk said of people who
have controlled computers with brain signals. "It's just not something
the average person can use effectively." Throughout the event, Musk
deftly avoided giving timelines or committing to schedules on questions
such as when Neuralink's system might be tested in human subjects. As
yet, four years after its formation, [Neuralink has provided **no
evidence**]{.underline} that it can (or has even tried to) treat
depression, insomnia, or a dozen other diseases that Musk mentioned in a
slide. [One difficulty]{.underline} ahead of the company is [perfecting
microwires that can survive the "corrosive" context of a living brain
for a decade]{.underline}. That problem alone [could take years to
solve]{.underline}. The primary objective of [the streamed
demo]{.underline}, instead, [was to stir excitement]{.underline},
recruit engineers to the company (which already employs about 100
people), and build the kind of fan base that has cheered on Musk's other
ventures and has helped propel the gravity-defying stock price of
electric-car maker Tesla. In tweets leading up to the event, [Musk had
promised]{.underline} fans [a mind-blowing demonstration]{.underline} of
neurons firing inside a living brain---though he didn't say of what
species. Minutes into the livestream, assistants drew a black curtain to
reveal [three small pigs]{.underline} in fenced enclosures; these were
the subjects of the company's implant experiments. The brain of one pig
contained an implant, and hidden speakers briefly chimed out ringtones
that Musk said were recordings of the animal's neurons firing in real
time. For those awaiting the "matrix in the matrix," as Musk had hinted
on Twitter, the cute-animal interlude was not exactly what they hoped
for. To neuroscientists, [it was **nothing new**]{.underline}; in their
labs the buzz and crackle of electrical [impulses]{.underline} recorded
from animal brains (and some human ones) [has been heard for
decades]{.underline}. A year ago, Neuralink presented a sewing-machine
robot able to plunge a thousand ultra-fine electrodes into a rodent's
brain. These probes are what measure the electrical signals emitted by
neurons; the speed and patterns of those signals are ultimately a basis
for movement, thoughts, and recall of memories. In the new livestream,
Musk appeared beside an updated prototype of the sewing robot encased
within a smooth, white plastic helmet. Into such surgical headgear, Musk
believes, billions of consumers will one day willingly place their
heads, submitting as an automated saw carves out a circle of bone and a
robot threads electronics into their brains. The futuristic casing was
created by the industrial design firm Woke Studio, in Vancouver. Its
lead designer, Afshin Mehin, says he strived to make something "clean,
modern, but still friendly-feeling" for what would be voluntary brain
surgery with inevitable risks. To neuroscientists, the most intriguing
development shown Friday may have been what Musk called "the link," a
silver-dollar-sized disk containing computer chips, which compresses and
then wirelessly transmits signals recorded from the electrodes. The link
is about as thick as the human skull, and Musk said it could plop neatly
onto the surface of the brain through a drill hole that could then be
sealed with superglue. "I could have a Neuralink right now and you
wouldn't know it," Musk said. The link can be charged wirelessly via an
induction coil, and Musk suggested that people in the future would plug
in before they go to sleep to power up their implants. He thinks an
implant also needs to be easy to install and remove, so that people can
get new ones as technology improves. You wouldn't want to be stuck with
version 1.0 of a brain implant forever. Outdated neural hardware left
behind in people's bodies is a real problem already encountered by
research subjects. The implant Neuralink is testing on its pigs has
1,000 channels and is likely to read from a similar number of neurons.
Musk says his goal to increase that by a factor of "100, then 1,000,
then, 10,000" to read more completely from the brain. Such exponential
goals for the technology don't necessarily address specific medical
needs. Although Musk claims implants "could solve paralysis, blindness,
hearing," as often [what is missing is]{.underline}n't 10 times as many
electrodes, but [scientific knowledge about what electrochemical
imbalance creates, say, depression in the first place]{.underline}.
Despite the long list of medical applications Musk presented, [Neuralink
didn't show it's ready to commit]{.underline} to any one of them. During
the event, the company did not disclose plans to start a clinical trial,
a surprise to those who believed that would be its next logical step. A
neurosurgeon who works with the company, Matthew MacDougall, did say the
company was considering trying the implant on paralyzed people---for
instance, to allow them to type on a computer, or form words. Musk went
further: "I think long-term you can restore someone full body motion."
It is unclear how serious the company is about treating disease at all.
[Musk]{.underline} continually drift[ed away from medicine and back to a
much more futuristic "general population device,"]{.underline} which he
called the company's "overall" aim. He believes that people should
connect directly to computers in order to keep pace with artificial
intelligence. "On a species level, it's important to figure out how we
coexist with advanced AI, achieving some AI symbiosis," he said, "such
that the future of world is controlled by the combined will of the
people of the earth. That might be the most important thing that a
device like this achieves." [How brain implants would bring
about]{.underline} such [a collective world electronic mind, Musk did
not say]{.underline}. Maybe in the next update.

Elon Musk has a knack for accomplishing feats that others consider
improbable. From blasting rockets into space to becoming the king of the
EV industry, Musk is determined to make history. His latest passion
project is Neuralink---a company that is developing a brain implant that
will link the human brain directly to computers. [He claims]{.underline}
this brain-computer interface ([BCI) will enable humans to carry out
actions through thought alone]{.underline}. One of Musk's first goals:
[helping paraplegics regain]{.underline} their
[independence]{.underline}. But it doesn't stop there. The company's
technology, Musk hopes, will one day not only treat but [cure brain
disorders and]{.underline} [even save memories]{.underline} so people
can revisit them like photo albums. Helping paraplegics walk and curing
brain disorders are certainly noble goals. And, hey, ordering a pizza
just by thinking about it sounds cool. But many experts are concerned
that [Musk is **seriously overhyping**]{.underline} what
[Neuralink]{.underline}'s implants will be able to accomplish. "Unlike
Tesla or SpaceX, [we are not talking about technologica]{.underline}l
problems [or infrastructure problems]{.underline}. [These are
**fundamental science problems**]{.underline}," Christof Koch, a
researcher at the Allen Institute for Brain Science, told Fortune in a
recent magazine feature. Here, Fortune tackles Musk's biggest claims
about what Neuralink's brain implant can do: 1. Neuralink's [brain
implant will save us from A.I. annihilation]{.underline} "Even in a
benign A.I. scenario, we will be left behind. But with a brain-machine
interface, we can actually go along for the ride," says Musk. First off,
the kind of [superintelligence]{.underline} Musk is afraid of [remains
science fiction]{.underline}, with computer scientists divided on when,
and even whether, it will ever arrive. Many think it is at least a few
decades off. Secondly, Musk envisions his [brain-computer interface as a
two-way]{.underline} [communication mechanism]{.underline}, so even if
Neuralink succeeds in delivering on Musk's grand vision, its brain
implants [could]{.underline} just as easily [be used by superintelligent
machines to **control humans**]{.underline} as they could be a means for
humans to ensure their dominance over superintelligent machines. And
either way, [the technological advances necessary to enable]{.underline}
that kind of [high-bandwidth brain-computer mind-meld are]{.underline}
also years, if not **[decades, away]{.underline}**. 2. The [BCI will
restore mobility]{.underline} for people with spinal cord injuries In
April 2020, a team of researchers reported that they had successfully
restored sensation to the hand of a research participant with a severe
spinal cord injury using a BCI system. We think that Musk's claim of
restoring mobility with a BCI is well within reach. But questions remain
about [how much functionality]{.underline} such [systems
will]{.underline} be able to [produce]{.underline} and [how easy it will
be for patients to learn to use them.]{.underline}
[Questions]{.underline} also [remain about the longer-term safety
of]{.underline} having [implants in the]{.underline} human
[brain.]{.underline} 3. The [BCI will treat neurological
conditions]{.underline} like Parkinson's disease There is current
technology such as deep brain stimulation that can already do some of
this. Neuralink could potentially further advance on these treatments.
But the current configuration of the [Neuralink]{.underline} device,
which has electrodes implanted close to the surface of the outer layer
of the brain, known as the cortex, [is]{.underline} [not set up to
conduct deep brain stimulation]{.underline}. 4. The brain chip will
[give superhuman abilities to able-bodied people]{.underline} While it
might allow able-bodied people to type or play a video game through
thought alone, [scientists]{.underline} still **[don't know how to
interpret]{.underline}** brain activity associated with more **[complex,
conceptual thoughts]{.underline}**. What's more, it's not clear medical
regulators will allow able-bodied individuals to have chips implanted,
as the **[risks]{.underline}** [of the implants and the
surgery]{.underline} to implant them [might be hard to
justify.]{.underline} 5. [They will]{.underline} be able to [insert the
brain chip in less than an hour without general anesthesia]{.underline}
Each of the 64 threads that carry electrodes for monitoring brain
activity is much thinner than even the finest human hair. These
electrodes feed into the Link device itself, which is about the diameter
of a quarter and about five times as thick and sits in a hole drilled
into the skull. The brain itself has no pain receptors, and brain
surgery is already often carried out under local anesthesia. So it is
possible Neuralink will be able to deliver on this promise. However,
[the surgical robot]{.underline} it plans to use to implant its BCI [has
not]{.underline} yet [been proved in clinical testing]{.underline}, and
[there could certainly be risks associated with drilling into the skull
and bleeding during electrode implantation]{.underline}.

Adversary Access to New Information In addition to the risk of having
signals jammed, [there is a risk of adversaries intercepting and using
signals]{.underline}. [Technologies that provide access to an operator's
emotional or cognitive states could]{.underline} potentially [be a
treasure trove for adversary intelligence collection]{.underline}.
**[Russia has]{.underline}** reportedly **[targeted NATO]{.underline}**
soldier **[smartphones]{.underline}** [for information]{.underline} on
operations and troop strength, while **[the Chinese government
has]{.underline}** reportedly **[hacked military]{.underline}**
contractor **[computers]{.underline}** [to extract highly sensitive data
about future submarine warfare]{.underline}.120 [BCI]{.underline}
technologies [that permit direct access to the brains of service members
could]{.underline} plausibly [provide near-peer competitors with
valuable information]{.underline} regarding the U.S. disposition of
forces, organizational frictions, and vulnerabilities among individual
service members themselves. [The]{.underline} degree of
[vulnerability]{.underline} of operators' brains [would]{.underline}
likely [depend on the fidelity of the BCI]{.underline} technology
employed, the amount of sensitive information that operators had access
to, [and the robustness of]{.underline} physical and behavior
[countermeasures]{.underline} designed [to thwart adversary hacking
attempts]{.underline}. New Areas of Exposure to Harm or Influence Red
team participants noted that because [BCI]{.underline} technologies may
directly connect to an operator's brain, they may [present new areas
of]{.underline} potential [exploitation]{.underline}. Physical
vulnerabilities would likely be most acute with the invasive variant of
the technology. Already, [unconventional attacks]{.underline} are
suspected of [caus]{.underline}ing **[traumatic brain injuries to U.S.
government employees in China]{.underline}** and Cuba.121 If
[adversaries are currently experimenting with **disrupting the human
brain at a distance using ultrasonic frequencies, microwaves**, or other
methods]{.underline}, [implants could provide direct entry]{.underline}
[into the brain for damage]{.underline}. Just as it is possible to hack
a pacemaker or insulin pump, it is quite conceivable---albeit far in the
future---that [someone could hack a BCI and send]{.underline} cognitive
[commands or]{.underline} even [thoughts]{.underline} to the brain.122
Reports of [**Russian** pinpoint **propaganda**]{.underline}, [text
messages]{.underline} that seek [to demoralize]{.underline} individual
[Ukrainian soldiers through threats and false reports]{.underline} of
leadership desertion, offer one insight into how [technology can enhance
emotional manipulation tactics]{.underline}.123 Hacking BCI capabilities
could theoretically provide adversaries with direct pathways into the
emotional and cognitive centers of operators' brains to [sow confusion
or emotional distress]{.underline}. In the extreme, [adversary hacking
into BCI devices that influence the motor cortex of human operators
could theoretically send false directions or elicit unintended
actions]{.underline}, [such as **friendly fire**]{.underline}, although
such influence may be technically difficult to achieve in the near term.
Even [an attack that broadly degraded gross motor skills could prove
debilitating]{.underline} during combat.

Research exploring [the merging of man and machine via]{.underline}
brain machine interfaces, or [BCIs]{.underline} (brain computer
interfaces) [has been advancing for decades]{.underline}.Footnote 15 The
various [iterations of the technologies]{.underline} can [allow for
multi-directional communication between the brain and one or more
devices]{.underline} by way of software and hardware[. The technology
has long raised ethical concerns related to a myriad of issues ranging
from questioning free-will to human enhancement]{.underline}.Footnote 16
, Footnote17 , Footnote18 However, [BCIs]{.underline} can also raise
additional ethical concerns as they [become subject to
**biocybersecurity threats**]{.underline}. Although current technology
does not easily allow for decoding and assigning meaning to the
electrical impulses collected by these machines, especially out of
context, [there are efforts tha]{.underline}t aim to
[enable]{.underline} tools like artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**) [to decode the information]{.underline}, even
[**extracting** passable **images**]{.underline} from the signals
received from the brain.Footnote 19 [Those signals]{.underline}, if
intercepted could [become privacy concerns]{.underline} for the
individual who generated them, even [being used to infer cognitive
abilities and personality traits of the users]{.underline}.Footnote 20
[Data from BCIs can reflect on the user's physical health, cognition,
and mental health]{.underline}.Footnote 21 Those signals could also be
used to access things that are unlocked via emerging brainwave
biometrics.Footnote 22 , Footnote23 [The data]{.underline} can also be
employed to understand the decision making processes of individuals;
such an understanding, if misappropriated [could be employed and
exploited]{.underline} to that individual's detriment. BCIs provide
additional concerns given their extensive usage in a multitude of
different settings, each setting creating their own biocybersecurity
concerns. They are used professionally in clinical care, in neuroscience
research, and even in the home for both medical and recreational
usesFootnote 24. Regardless of the setting of its use, however, there is
a need to provide cyber protection for each element of the process
connecting the human mind to a machine. These processes at risk include
signal acquisition from the brain, preprocessing of the signal,
extraction of features from the signal, classification and translation
of the signal, and even user feedback after examining the output. The
risks of ethical concerns are exacerbated by the reality that the [data
are often **not encrypted**]{.underline} [as they pass between various
software and hardware devices]{.underline}---sometimes wired, and
sometimes wirelessly---[opening up the system to increasing
threats]{.underline}. Even if the mostly unintelligible data within
these devices does not impinge on the ultimate privacy of the
individual, as per current conventional wisdom, the data are still per
se the property of the user, and the taking of the data could be an
ethical, if not legal misappropriation of the user's property. In
general, the **[hacking]{.underline}** [of these systems can have
repercussions]{.underline} regarding the integrity and usability of the
device, [data can be altered both incoming and outgoing]{.underline},
artificial information or noise can be added, and privacy of the user's
data can be impinged. Even the ultimate safety of the user and those
around herFootnote 25: BCIs are often attached to devices such as
prostheticsFootnote 26 and rehabilitative exoskeletons.Footnote 27 [If
the interface becomes compromised via a hack]{.underline}, either
through inserted malicious code, or over the air via unsecured wireless
transmission between the BCI and the device[, a hacker could **take
control of the device**]{.underline}, [even **committing a crime**. It
would be difficult to prove that the crime was committed by a hack and
not by the owner of the prosthetic]{.underline}.Footnote 28 Not only are
the hardware devices often problematic vis-à-vis cyber protection, but
the underlying software is often opensource and potentially
untrustworthy. That code can create further concerns. Increasingly,
[BCIs are **incorporating AI** into the analysis]{.underline} of the
harvested neural signals. The complexity of AI, especially
[the]{.underline} somewhat [opacity of AI decisions]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} their sometimes-[unexpected results]{.underline},
[provide]{.underline} additional [opportunities for hackers
to]{.underline} conceal malicious code within the BCI software. That
malicious code could **[hijack, change, or obfuscate]{.underline}** [the
neural signals collected by the BCIs.]{.underline}

In their paper titled "Unethical Research: How to Create a Malevolent
Artificial Intelligence", Pistono and Yampolskiy (2016) described
possible developments towards a future unethical AI. The authors argue
that, [unlike in the domain of cybersecurity]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} a certain [balance is ensured]{.underline} [by a
research concept covering]{.underline} both potential [malicious
exploits and]{.underline} measures to maintain [safety]{.underline}, [AI
Safety]{.underline} researchers so far only [focused on the general
conditions of implementing safe AI systems, while possible malicious
exploits]{.underline} on such [remained disregarded]{.underline}.
According to them, [the lack of information]{.underline} resulting out
of it [should be resolved]{.underline}, since [the consequences of an
intentional **malicious exploit on superintelligent AI** systems in the
future could be **devastating for humanity**]{.underline}. In our
opinion [these claims are accurate]{.underline} for the following
reasons: first the previous [publications in]{.underline} the field of
[AI]{.underline} safety before, predominantly [contained considerations
on how to design safe AIs]{.underline} and a deeper differentiated
analysis was missing, although [there is no reason why malicious
exploits should not be performed intentionally]{.underline} alike [on AI
systems]{.underline}, since the same principle of taking advantage of
security holes in cybersecurity can be transferred to AIs as being
software/hardware entities. Secondly, [the level of intelligence of AIs
steadily increases]{.underline}, it is to be expected that
**[superintelligence will be reached]{.underline}** in the not so far
future (Bostrom 2014; Chalmers 2010) and [an intentionally crafted
attack]{.underline} especially using a superintelligent system [would
imply unforeseen and unintelligible effects]{.underline} for human
experts whose [minds are]{.underline} going to be overcharged or [too
slow to counteract]{.underline}. A type of "[Hazardous Intelligent
Software]{.underline}" [may]{.underline} even [stay
undetected]{.underline} a long time because of the gap of intelligence
-- just [like monkeys cannot comprehend complex human behavior
patterns]{.underline}. It will therefore offer exceptionally much power
to the attacker to harm humans and as stated in the paper, it is known
in history that "[absolute power corrupts absolutely]{.underline}".

The authors described a variety of reasons why several stakeholders like
[military, governments, corporations, \*malicious individuals
or]{.underline} even [AI Safety researchers with unethical intentions
could]{.underline} intend to [implement a MAI]{.underline} ranking from
acquiring control and dominance, gaining financial benefits, to
**[initiating the extinction of \*humanity]{.underline}** among other
things. In any case, [there is a]{.underline} kind of [cooperation
between a human entity and an artificial one to achieve an unethical
objective]{.underline}, whereby mostly the human entity initiates the
cooperation with a malicious intent. Our view is that the intensity of
such an alarming human-machine cooperation could be much higher in the
future, since -- according to the foreseeable scientific progress in
fields like Bionics, Nanorobotics or **[Brain-Computer
Interfaces]{.underline}** (BCI) research -- it could be possible to
**[merge human and intelligent artificial entities]{.underline}** [to
obtain a]{.underline} **[hybrid system]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
an **[enhanced cognitive performance]{.underline}**, [which could be
used to follow]{.underline} similar **[unethical
objectives]{.underline}** as mentioned earlier and would concern the
same stakeholders. For instance, [\*malicious individuals
could]{.underline} as well maliciously intend to [merge
with]{.underline} an [AI]{.underline} entity to become more intelligent
or get greater knowledge than their fellow men and in doing so, to be
able [to manipulate and control others]{.underline} on a large scale or
[the military could encourage]{.underline} [cyborgization]{.underline}
techniques [to]{.underline} be able to [deploy cyborg
armies]{.underline} in wars [wiping out opponents through intellectual,
strategical]{.underline} or/[and]{.underline} possibly [physical
superiority]{.underline}. In this paper, we analyze the concept of a
human-machine intelligence merger with intentional malice in design
which we call Malevolent Cyborgization, and relate it to the MAI concept
introduced by Pistono and Yampolskiy.

As humans become more closely intertwined with machines through
[BCI]{.underline}, technology [could have profound implications for the
interpersonal relationships that]{.underline} have [traditionally played
a preeminent role in warfighting]{.underline}. The
[implications]{.underline} [may be difficult to predict]{.underline}. On
the one hand, an ability to directly sense the thoughts and emotions of
other members of a combat team could increase unit cohesion. On the
other, there is evidence that advances in [virtual
communication]{.underline} technologies that permit "chat-room
coordinated strikes" may already **[reduce emotional and psychological
bonds among soldiers]{.underline}**.128 To the extent that they would
replace traditional interactions among members of a military unit,
future [BCI capabilities could]{.underline} fundamentally
[alter]{.underline} the nature of these [human
relationships]{.underline}. An increasing use of robotics and AI in
combat could compound this challenge. In fact, preliminary research on
robots on the battlefield has indicated the development of strong
human-robot attachment, or even a feeling of "[self-extension into the
robot]{.underline}," that might **[influence]{.underline}** [operational
**decisionmaking**]{.underline}.129 More broadly, the introduction of
[new BCI technologies raises questions about the future structure of the
human force]{.underline}. [What does a]{.underline} company or [platoon
look like when]{.underline} some or all of [the force is neurally
plugged into]{.underline} various [weapon systems]{.underline}, drones,
or robots? Will these capabilities be integrated, or will they be
assigned to specialized detachments? How might it affect unit cohesion
when [senior officers]{.underline} can [monitor]{.underline} service
members' [emotions o]{.underline}r even [thoughts]{.underline}, and when
[some]{.underline} unit [members have]{.underline} access to
[BCI]{.underline} capabilities [while others do not]{.underline}?
[Erosion of]{.underline} Unit [Leadership]{.underline} Technologies that
[permit senior officers to]{.underline} monitor and
[communicate]{.underline} directly [with the]{.underline} [brains of
combat personnel could]{.underline} potentially [**undermine** effective
squad-level **leadership**]{.underline}, extending micromanagement to
new frontiers. In one hypothetical dynamic, BCI technologies could
exacerbate an existing trend toward what has been dubbed the tactical
general: [Senior officers]{.underline}, empowered through such new
technologies as drone feeds, may tend to [use these technologies to
exert greater control over operators in the field]{.underline}.130
Future BCI technologies that permit direct brain-to-brain communication
could potentially exacerbate this dynamic, [contributing to a more
robotic, **less adaptive and resilient** approach to unit-level
leadership]{.underline}. [Unit-level leadership could also be
jeopardized]{.underline} by BCI technologies that provide senior
leadership with access to individuals' physiological, emotional, and
cognitive states. Traditionally, it has been the role of a squad leader
to understand the physical and emotional states of his or her team
through months of relationships, evaluation, training, and combat
experience. [Technologies that allowed senior officers to bypass
unit-level leaders and second-guess their judgments might be undermining
unit leadership rather than supporting it.]{.underline}

#### China is not revisionist -- the aff is a preventative measure that starts conflict.

All things being equal, [China is portrayed as a revisionist threat to
the USA and the existing international order]{.underline} (Layne, 2020),
it is [a new 'communist rival' that 'seek global influence' and will
inevitably seek to challenge the position of the USA and revise the
existing international order]{.underline} (Westad, 2019, p. 87). China
will, furthermore, most likely 'present a stronger ideological challenge
than the Soviet Union did' (Campbell & Sullivan, 2019). In Thucydides'
famous historical account of the Peloponnesian War, we are told that it
was the rise of Athens and the fear this fuelled in Sparta that led to
the outbreak of the conflict. What many scholars leave out, however, is
that it was **[Sparta]{.underline}**, and **[not Athens]{.underline}**,
that **[initiated the war]{.underline}** [by giving the latter an
ultimatum]{.underline} to roll back from Potidaea, restore independence
to Aegina, and repeal the Megarian decree, or face confrontation.
[Athens simply refused to submit]{.underline} (Thucydides, 2009). What
[Sparta]{.underline} did was to [initiate a war against Athens before
the latter would surpass the former in terms of material capabilities
and geopolitical influence]{.underline}. If the Spartans had waited for
Athens to overtake their city-state, it was assumed that a Spartan
triumph would have been less probable as relative strength increases the
likelihood of victory, that is, it would be more likely for Sparta to
win a war against Athens while the former still had the upper hand
(Jianren, 2019). In international relations parlance, [this
is]{.underline} today referred to as [a preventive war]{.underline}
(Levy, 1987; Organski, 1968). There are in fact many historical
analogies where [a dominant **great power** has been **dissatisfied**
with the shifting balance of power in favour of a rising great power,
and,]{.underline} consequently, [has sought to initiate **a preventive
war**]{.underline} [to halt, or **reverse, an ongoing power
transition**]{.underline} process in order [to maintain its relative
power and influence]{.underline}. As one scholar argues, '[the single
greatest constraint on the emergence of any new power is the possibility
that its actions will trigger counterbalancing behavior or perhaps a
preventive attack' by an established great power]{.underline}
(Montgomery, 2016, p. 6).5 This logic is based on an expected-utility
framework in which a declining great power will desire to fight a war at
a point in time when it is still stronger than a rising challenger, as
the probability of victory would be higher at such a moment, compared to
a situation in which war is delayed to a point in time where the rising
power has overtaken the hegemon (Jianren, 2019). In addition to the case
of Sparta, [the idea of preventive war was also dominant in German
military thinking and war preparations during the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries against a rising Russia]{.underline} in the
East (and towards France in the West). German officials argued that [a
preventive war should be launched before Russia could manage to overtake
Germany in terms of relative power]{.underline} as this would make
victory more likely and reduce the costs of war (Snyder, 1984).
Similarly, policy makers in the USA did also push for a preventive war
against the Soviet Union and China in the early years of the Cold War
'on the theory that it would be easier to defeat them now than later
when their industrial and military strength has increased further'
(Organski, 1968, p. 348).6 According to the famous historian A.J.P.
Taylor, '[every war between the Great Powers]{.underline} \[in the
1848--1918 period\] [started as a preventive war, not a war of
conquest']{.underline} (Levy, 1987, p. 84). While established great
powers have tended to launch preventive wars, [rising great
powers]{.underline}, such as Athens, [were left with the choice to
submit to the will of the strong or respond in kind to avoid any
losses]{.underline} to their newly acquired power and influence. '[So
make up your minds here and now,']{.underline} Pericles argued at an
assembly in Athens to debate the Spartan ultimatum, 'either to submit
before any harm is done, or, if it is to be war (and in my view that is
the best course), to make no concessions for reasons either great or
small, and to refuse to live in constant fear for our own possessions'
(Thucydides, 2009, Ch. 141).

[Although there are many historical cases that illustrate
how]{.underline} established [great powers have initiated preventive
wars]{.underline} against rising great powers during power transition
processes, [there are no such cases to be found from the second half of
the twentieth century onwards]{.underline}. [The reason]{.underline} for
this [is]{.underline} mainly attributed to the existence of [nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} by the great powers and that this [**mutual
deterrent** capability has **made hegemonic wars**]{.underline} between
them **[less likely]{.underline}**. This is due to the fact that
[nuclear weapons significantly]{.underline} have [reduced the
probability of victory]{.underline} [and increased the costs of an
all-out military confrontation]{.underline} [through
']{.underline}mutually assured destruction/[MAD']{.underline} between
the great powers (Betts, 1985; Keohane, 1984; Monteiro, 2014; Can &
Chan, 2020).7 As such, it was the existence of [MAD]{.underline}, the
argument goes, that [prevented the USA from launching a preventive war
against the Soviet Union in the 1950s and early 1960s]{.underline} to
halt the latter's emergence into a peer competitor (Layne, 2020).
According to strategic competition theory, it is, therefore, more
probable, [in the age of MAD]{.underline}, that **[great
powers]{.underline}**, [**during** periods of power **transition**, will
**limit** their **competition** and rivalry **to the diplomatic
domain**]{.underline} where they will seek to increase their relative
strategic advantage in the world while weakening their competitors'
[without engaging in direct military confrontation]{.underline} with
each other, that is, for diplomatic paradigm shifts to occur in the
bilateral relationship as the rising great power approaches parity with
the hegemonic power (Jianren 2019[). A diplomatic paradigm shift
can]{.underline} furthermore simply [be understood as 'changes in a
state's guiding principles, policy goals, and policy priority, of its
foreign policy focus']{.underline} (Jianren, 2019, p. 20). For the
purpose of our argument, we here focus on diplomatic paradigm shifts in
the foreign policy posture of a declining versus a rising great power
towards each other during a power transition process. In line with the
preventive war model, we argue that [a diplomatic paradigm shift should
be expected to first occur in the existing hegemonic power towards the
rising great power,]{.underline} the purpose of which is [to halt, or
reverse, the power transition process]{.underline} [which is working in
favour of the latter]{.underline}. [The policy focus]{.underline} of the
existing hegemonic power [will]{.underline} very much [be concentrated
around the attempt to weaken the increasing strategic influence of the
rising great power, be it political, economic or military]{.underline}.
This paradigm shift in [the existing hegemon's foreign policy
goals]{.underline} towards the rising power [will]{.underline}
consequently [lead to a 'response']{.underline} [by the rising great
power whereby it will seek to transform its own foreign policy posture
to minimise]{.underline} and/or avoid [damage or losses]{.underline}
that it might incur on the continuation of its development and expansion
of its strategic influence, in opposition to the hegemon's attempt to
reverse the transition process (Jianren, 2019). Rather than locating the
question of systemic dissatisfaction and initiation of a great power
strategic challenge in the agency of the rising power during a power
transition, we instead argue that [dissatisfaction and initiation of
great power strategic competition should be identified in the **agency
of the existing hegemonic power**]{.underline} (Yilmaz & Xiangyu, 2019).
The next section of this article provides a case study to test the
explanatory power of our argument.

### 2NC -- China Not Revisionist

#### The US is instigating conflict -- China is defensive and responsive -- the aff makes things worse

**[Empirical observations]{.underline}** reinforce the argument outlined
in previous section, as [can be witnessed]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
the [changing]{.underline} focus in [US foreign policy towards
China]{.underline} in the early 2010s, when the power transition process
between China and the USA accelerated following the global financial
crisis of 2008 and after China overtook Japan to become the 2nd largest
economy in the world. The first indication of this paradigm shift in the
USA was [the]{.underline} so-called '[Pivot to Asia'
strategy]{.underline}, famously announced by then Secretary of State
Clinton (2011)8 and [laid the groundwork for a shift in US foreign
policy priority]{.underline} from fighting terrorism in the Middle East
and Central Asia to great power competition in East Asia (Shambaugh,
2018). This strategy, later defined as the 'Rebalance to Asia', aimed to
increase US military, economic and political influence in the region
while weakening the influence, and contain the rise, of China (Jianren,
2019; Takahashi, 2021). [The motivation for this rebalance was primarily
taken to be China's increasing weight in the Asia-Pacific
region]{.underline}, its assertiveness relating to its territorial
claims in the East and South China Seas from 2009 onwards, and its
alleged reluctance to abide by the norms and values of the liberal
international order (Friedberg, 2015; Shifrinson, 2018b; Strangio,
2020). More specifically, [the USA sought to strengthen its own
influence and weaken China's by increasing its political, military and
economic presence in the Asia-Pacific]{.underline}. In the military and
political dimensions, [the USA reinforced its forward deployment and
commitments]{.underline} to existing allies, [began 'freedom of
navigation operations',]{.underline} and tried to [forge new security
partnerships with]{.underline} countries such as [India and
Vietnam]{.underline}, while a more active participation in regional
multilateral organisations, such as the [forging of partnership with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)]{.underline} and [the
East Asian Summit (EAS]{.underline}), were strengthened to promote the
image of USA as a 'resident power' (Takahashi, 2021; White House, 2011).
The economic dimension of the strategy was aimed to underpin the desired
political [and]{.underline} military involvement of the USA in the
region and was manifested through [the]{.underline} proposal to form a
[Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)]{.underline} for trade and investment
(Kirshner, 2021). With the TPP, the USA essentially sought to forge a
trade alliance whose entry requirements were designed to exclude China.
Increasingly, it became clear that Washington desired to push China out
from the evolving regional politico-economic architecture and isolate
it, unless Beijing accepted continued US regional dominance and abide by
the norms and values of the liberal international order (Jianren, 2019;
Can & Chan, 2020). [China's response]{.underline} to this paradigm shift
in the USA came in 2013, after Xi Jinping's proposal to Barack Obama
[that both countries should forge a 'new type of great power
relationship' to mitigate a clash of interests]{.underline}, that is,
[the Thucydides' Trap]{.underline}, [was **turned down by the
USA**]{.underline} (Nakazawa, 2021). The first indication of China's
diplomatic paradigm shift was the transformation of the policy of
'[keeping a low profile']{.underline} from the Deng Xiaoping era [to
'striving for achievement']{.underline} as announced by Xi Jinping in
late 2013. With this paradigm shift, priority was given to create a more
favourable environment for the continuation of China's national
rejuvenation by establishing friendly relations with countries from Asia
to Africa and Europe, aimed to win over political support from them as a
reaction to the USA balancing attempt: the so-called 'go-west' strategy
(Nakazawa, 2021; Yan, 2014). According to some observers, 'keeping a low
profile' of the Deng era had not prevented the USA from seeking to
contain China, and Xi Jinping had, therefore, to adapt a new and more
pro-active foreign policy paradigm to assure the international community
of China's benign intentions and willingness for cooperation and
integration with the world to offset the US containment strategy (Yan,
2014). [The new orientation]{.underline} in Chinese foreign policy [was
paralleled with acceleration of China's military
modernisation]{.underline} process that had begun in the 1990s and the
advancement of [the Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2AD) strategy]{.underline}
which aimed [to reduce the viability of any US and allied military
intervention close to China's shores]{.underline} and keep them at bay
(Beckley, 2017; Campbell & Doshi, 2021). This was accompanied by the
announcement of [the Silk Road Economic Belt]{.underline}, [the
Twenty-First Century Maritime Silk Road and]{.underline} the formation
of [the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank]{.underline} (AIIB). All
[these]{.underline} ambitious endeavours [aimed to improve China's
defensive capabilities]{.underline}, and dialogue and cooperation
between China and the international community, and thus [to minimise any
losses from the challenge posed by a dissatisfied US 'Rebalance to Asia'
strategy]{.underline} (Jianren, 2019).

## Case -- Cohesion

### 1NC -- AT: Cohesion Impact

#### Alliance cohesion makes conflict more likely -- changes the threat perception of the "defensive" alliance

**Kenwick et al. 15** (Michael R. Kenwick \| John A. Vasquez \| Matthew
A. Powers \| 'Do Alliances Really Deter?' \|
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/681958?origin=JSTOR-pdf> \| DOA:
7/6/2022 \| SAoki)

Another theme in the literature is [that a defensive alliance can create
a moral hazard]{.underline} in that the presence of a defensive alliance
[emboldens a weak ally to take "aggressive" action because it fears of
reprisal are lessened or because it is emboldened to take action because
it can rely on the support of a powerful ally]{.underline} (Snyder
1984).2 Alternatively, one could argue that even if the weaker state is
not emboldened to take aggressive action it will simply be less
restrained and compliant when bargaining with potential challengers. The
security dilemma, the steps-to-war, and moral hazard offer an
explanation as to why [defensive alliances]{.underline} might
**[increase the probability of conflict rather than
deterrence]{.underline}**. This expectation of deterrence failure is
stated as: The Steps-to-War Hypothesis: [Defensive alliance formation
will more often be associated with **deterrence failure** than
deterrence success in regard to the onset of **interstate disputes and
war**]{.underline}. Each of these hypotheses makes contradictory claims.
Supporters of a broad conception of deterrence would expect the
deterrence hypothesis pass testing and the steps-to-war hypothesis to be
falsified. The steps-to-war hypothesis embodies the logic of the
security dilemma and more specifically, Senese and Vasquez's (2008)
claim that [defensive alliances]{.underline}, like all alliances,
[**increase threat perception** and are **more apt to be followed by
war** than cases where no alliances are present]{.underline}. It would
therefore be expected not only that the deterrence hypothesis would be
rejected but that the steps-to-war hypothesis will pass testing. In the
event both hypotheses uniformly fail and a null finding is uncovered,
this would suggest that alliances are ineffective deterrents, but do not
share a positive association with interstate conflict, as the
steps-to-war explanation would posit. Determining whether deterrence
actually occurs is fraught with many problems of inference (see Levy
1989). While recent studies have made considerable headway in addressing
some of these problems, we outline four issues common to this recent
body of work that preclude the ability to adjudicate between the
competing expectations outlined in the previous section. The first of
these issues revolves around a tendency to conflate the effect of having
an alliance with the effect of forming an alliance. Much of the recent
work on alliances examines deterrence by assessing whether states with
particular alliance types are more or less likely to have disputes
initiated against them when compared to states without such alliances
(e.g., Benson 2011; Johnson and Leeds 2011; Kang 2012; Leeds 2003).
Though intuitively appealing, this approach is problematic when testing
the stepsto-war hypothesis because it fails to take into account the
specific mechanism linking alliance formation with increases in the
probability of conflict. The logic of this hypothesis suggests that it
is not necessarily the presence of a defensive alliance that will prove
threatening, but rather [the **formation of** these alliances that alter
the status quo, may be **perceived as a hostile action** and, perpetuate
a security dilemma between potential combatants]{.underline}. These
explanations therefore focus on alliance formation and do not
necessarily make predictions about the long-term effects of having
alliances. The deterrence hypothesis, on the other hand, predicts that
defensive alliances should always deter, regardless of the time since
formation. The relevant period of observation for adjudicating between
these competing expectations is therefore the time around formation, and
not the time encompassed by the whole lifespan of an alliance. The
second problem endemic to existing studies of extended deterrence is the
commonplace assumption that the relationship between alliances and
deterrence has remained unchanged over the past two centuries. Indeed,
there are strong theoretical grounds to expect that the introduction of
nuclear weapons at the conclusion of World War II fundamentally altered
the logic of deterrence. Prior to the nuclear era, alliances represented
a means by which a state could suddenly and dramatically increase its
ability to wage and win a conventional war. Even so, [the potential
attacker in these cases---seeing that its intended target is actively
seeking to increase its power---may successfully offset the alliance by
seeking out its own alliance partners to assist it in attacking the
target]{.underline} (Snyder 1984). In this conventional framework,
deterrence occurs when a state increases its capabilities by such an
extent as to make the prospects of victory too low for potential
opponents. By comparison, [the logic of nuclear deterrence is
clearer]{.underline} on why war should be prevented. In contrast to the
conventional framework, where deterrence is induced by shifts in
conventional military capabilities, [nuclear deterrence rests on the
logic of m]{.underline}utually [a]{.underline}ssured
[d]{.underline}estruction and the notion that nuclear armaments make
wars unwinnable, effectively removing the Clausewitzian rationale for
pursuing war as a means of attaining political objectives. No goal is
worth the complete destruction of a society, and if neither side can
attain its goals, then the irrationality of such a war is even more
evident (Kahn 1960). Total nuclear war therefore brings about a
revolution in the way international politics is conducted and makes such
wars unthinkable. In short, failing to control for nuclear weapons
applies the more convincing logic of nuclear deterrence to a domain
where it may be less applicable. A third problem centers on the common
use of militarized disputes as the exclusive means of testing deterrence
arguments (e.g., Benson 2011; Kang 2012; Leeds 2003). The issue here is
that the logic of deterrence is most often linked with whether a
potential challenger will attack a target holding an alliance (Smith
1995). Indeed, [defensive alliances are most often **operationally
defined** as those that **promise a state will come to the aid of
another "in the event of attack** on the partner's sovereignty or
territorial integrity"]{.underline} (Leeds et al. 2002, 241). [The
reason]{.underline} these [alliances should also deter low level
military actions such as threats to use force, displays of force, or
actions such as border fortifications is **not clearly
specified**]{.underline}.

In this article, we will explore [the emerging field of military
neurotechnology]{.underline} and the way it [challenges the boundaries
of war]{.underline}. We will argue that these technologies can be used
not only to enhance the cognitive performance of warfighters, but also
[as a means to **exploit a**]{.underline}rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [in autonomous and robotic weapons
systems]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, however,
[requires]{.underline} the practice of [a collaborative network command
**and a governing framework of cyborg ethics**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [secure human control and responsibility in military
operations]{.underline}. The **[discussion]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} these governing [principles adheres to]{.underline} the
tradition of [military studies]{.underline}. Hence, we do not aim to
present a neuroscientific research program. Nor do we wish to embark on
technical solutions in disciplines such as artificial intelligence and
robotics. Rather, the intention is to make the highly specialized
language of these sciences accessible to an audience of military
practitioners and policymakers, bringing technological advances and
challenges into the discussion of future warfighting.

\"It is currently estimated that [**AI and robotic systems** will be
**ubiquitous** across the operational framework of
**2035**]{.underline}.\" (RAS MDO white paper 2018: 25)

Are we on the verge of a robotic revolution of military affairs? Will
intelligent machines take control of the future battlefield and replace
human warfighters? Recent advances in military neurotechnologies,
robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) have evoked the transgressive
image of the \'cyborg warrior\', a weaponized brain-computer network
powered by AI and neurocognitive augmentation. In the wake of these
emergent military technologies, some of our most fundamental assumptions
and definitions of human intelligence, autonomy, and responsibility have
been challenged. These concepts are central to our understanding of
lawful and ethical conduct of war. They are also closely associated with
human agency and the ability to make context-dependent decisions and
critical evaluations in matters of life and death. The question that
begs to be answered is whether - and how - these concepts can be applied
to cyborg systems that, per definition, are not entirely human? What
kind of military capacity is a cyborg warrior? A warfighter or a weapons
system? A human or a machine? In the following, we will argue that the
cyborg warrior is neither a human subject nor a piece of military
hardware, but a heterogeneous assemblage - or rather a \'nexus\' - of
human and non-human capacities, transmitting and decoding streams of
information in military battle networks. As such, we prefer to talk
about cyborg and neurocognitive weapons systems, stressing the intrinsic
entanglement of human and artificial intelligence challenging
traditional human-machine distinctions and dichotomies.

The article falls in four parts: The first part presents some basic
concepts and definitions of cyborg technologies and neuroweapons as part
of an emerging neuroscientific security discourse. The second part of
the article sets the general framework and context of multi-domain
warfare in which these technologies are shaped and applied as military
capabilities. The third part introduces the concepts of \'collaborative
risk mediation\' and \'composite intentionality\' stressing the mutual
entanglement and \'interference\' of human and artificial intelligence
in the emerging domain of neurospace. In the last part of the article,
we address the urgent need of governing principles and guidelines,
including the legal and ethical aspects of cyborg warfare. Thus, we call
for interdisciplinary discussion of the emergent frontiers and practices
of neurospace and the negotiation of neuroethical standards in the
international security community. At the center of these discussions, we
pose the question of \'meaningful human control\' and responsibility in
networked military command.

The Neuroscientific Security Discourse and the Realm of the Cyborg
Warrior

As a first step in our inquiry, we need to distinguish between
neurotechnology, which is used to detect, affect, and target human brain
activity (e.g.: improve, repair, degrade or manipulate cognitive
skills), on the one hand, and AI, which is used in computers, sensors,
and robotic systems, on the other hand. A \'neural network\' is a
specific form of AI, consisting of a set of algorithms resembling the
working human brain. A \'neuron\' in a neural network is a mathematical
function that collects and classifies information according to a
specific architecture (Chen 2019). Neurocognitive or cyborg networks, on
the other hand, are hybrid systems of human and artificial intelligence,
i.e. brain-computer networks that integrate the cognitive advantages of
humans and computers. For many years, the two sciences, [the science of
the human brain and the science of AI, have developed side by
side,]{.underline} mutually inspiring and informing each other. [Now,
the scientific exploration of **neurotechnology and AI is rapidly
converging**]{.underline} [and accelerating]{.underline} the development
of n[eural feedback systems that allow a two-way
communication]{.underline} stream [between the]{.underline} human [brain
and]{.underline} the [computer]{.underline}. [The convergence of AI and
neurotechnology and the implications of]{.underline}
**[integrating]{.underline}**, [not just combining or \'teaming\' human
and machine cognition]{.underline},\[4\] is the focus of our interest.
[Humans and computers work together]{.underline} everywhere. This is not
new. However, [until recently they have done so as separate
entities]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} **[separation is beginning to
erode]{.underline}**, as [ubiquitous **AI and neurotechnological
advances** have **made the distinction between human and machine
cognition unclear and** in some cases even **obsolete**.]{.underline}
When we refer to [\'cyborg and neurocognitive weapons
systems\']{.underline}, and [not just one or the other]{.underline}, it
is [precisely because]{.underline} we want to stress [this increasing
interference of human and non-human cognition, which goes]{.underline}
**[way beyond]{.underline}** - and has to be distinguished from - [other
**hybrid tech**nologies such as bionic limbs and advanced hearing or
visual aids]{.underline}.

For this same reason, it is important not to confuse the notion of the
cyborg warrior with the concept of the \'centaur warfighter\' (Scharre
2018: 321), which is often used as a metaphor for human-machine teaming.
The two concepts are closely related, but not synonymous. This
distinction can be expressed as the difference between integration and
automation of machine intelligence, perception, and reasoning. Whereas
[centaur human-machine teaming]{.underline} [consists of humans plus
machines]{.underline}, [with machines performing]{.underline} clearly
[demarcated automated functions]{.underline}, the [cyborg warrior
functions as a neurally enhanced and integrated system
architecture,\[]{.underline}5\] **[merging human and machine
cognition]{.underline}**. [Centaur human-machine teaming does
not]{.underline} necessarily [imply]{.underline} [cognitive or sensory
enhancement]{.underline} of the human operator. [Human and machine
cognition is not neurally integrated]{.underline}. Instead, [humans and
machines perform different]{.underline} role-specific [tasks that
are]{.underline} largely [based on]{.underline} [predetermined decision
models where the machine\'s role is conditioned by]{.underline} one or
more [rule sets]{.underline} (Murray & Yanagi 2015: 17).

As opposed to centaur human-machine teaming, [cyborgs have no
preprogrammed role specifications but adapt continuously]{.underline} to
shifting situations and demands in the operational environment.
According to Kline and Clynes (1961), [such systems can be]{.underline}
regarded as **[\'cybernetic organisms]{.underline}**\' (i.e. cyborgs) in
that they [entail both natural and artificial systems that are
functional, portable, and]{.underline}/or [**biologically
integrated**]{.underline} (Wurzman & Giordano 2015: 90). As such,
[cybernetic and cyborg systems can be]{.underline} seen as
[\"sophisticated distributed human-machine networks]{.underline}, such
as [integrated software or robotic augmentations]{.underline} to
human-controlled activity, [that would **fuse and coordinate** the
distinct cognitive advantages of **humans and computers**]{.underline}\"
(Wurzman & Giordano 2015: 90). Consequently, [cyborg
technologies]{.underline} used in a networked risk environment will
\"[reflect a combination of autonomous initiative and original problem
solving by both human and machine]{.underline}. [This means **shared
agency and responsibility** in military decisions]{.underline}\" (Murray
& Yanagi 2015: 17).

[The attribution of shared agency and responsibility to humans and
machines is central to the definition of cyborg and neurocognitive
weapons]{.underline} systems [and demarcates a shift from automated
decision]{.underline} support [to]{.underline} [collaborative
information]{.underline} and risk [management]{.underline}, with human
and machine intelligence mediating and co-shaping the perception,
organization, and distribution of risk. The advantage of [such
systems]{.underline} is [increased flexibility and accountability
insuring human judgment and responsibility]{.underline} over engagements
[while simultaneously leveraging the precision and speed of
AI.]{.underline} [This]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} particularly
[urgent when cyborg tech]{.underline}nologies [are]{.underline} used as
[offensive]{.underline} weapons systems (Murray & Yanagi 2015: 17).

**[Existential risk is the paradigm for AGI ethics]{.underline}**.
[Existential risk]{.underline} is defined as "one that [threatens to
cause the extinction of]{.underline} [Earth]{.underline}-originating
[intelligent life]{.underline} or the permanent and drastic failure of
that life to realize its potential" (Bostrom 2014: 15). [AGI poses
existential risk due to a]{.underline} possible '**[intelligence
explosion']{.underline}** [upon becoming]{.underline} [capable of
designing and editing itself]{.underline} and other machines. This
[runaway intelligence]{.underline} gap [makes AGI **powerful and

detrimental to ethical cosmic outcomes]{.underline}. [Existential
risks]{.underline} can be thought of statistically as a black swan (see
Taleb 2007) or tail risk. Put simply, a black swan is a
probabilistically unlikely event that has ruinous consequences, and thus
[must be judged more upon the scale of its impacts than its
likelihood]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} **[over a long enough
time]{.underline}**-horizon said **[ruinous outcome is
guaranteed]{.underline}**. Accordingly, practitioners "should [assume
that AGI may present]{.underline} serious [risks to
humanity's]{.underline} very [existence]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
carefully [restrain]{.underline} our [research]{.underline} directions
[accordingly]{.underline}" (Yampolskiy and Fox 2013: 14). [It
is]{.underline} important not to fall prey to motivated and
anthropocentric reasoning when considering AGI existential risk, for as
Eliezer Yudkowsky puts it: "[AI does not hate you, nor does it love you,
but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something
else]{.underline}" (Yudkowsky 2008: 27).

Human society has lived with the reality of existential risk for upwards
of 60 years (nuclear weapons, climate change), and apocalyptic themes
are woven into many theological traditions, so the concept of
species-wide annihilation is hardly foreign. There is no particular
reason for the two discourses to conceive of existential risk
differently---it is an oddly egalitarian topic, equally relevant to all
and of the utmost regardless of your intellectual orientation. Yet, [AGI
also holds great promise for]{.underline} ethical and humanitarian
well-being, perhaps even '[solving' other existential risks]{.underline}
like climate change---leading experts believe a backbone of highly
coordinated technological infrastructures is critical for this task (see
Hawken 2017), a job AGI could fulfill. It is therefore ["a sharper
double-edge sword than any other]{.underline}. [It]{.underline}
[constitutes]{.underline} at once **[the greatest]{.underline}**
conceivable **[source of existential risk]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} global catastrophic risk, [and our most promising
means of mitigating such risk]{.underline}" (Cortese 2014: 7). Both
groups noted that [**AGI** will be the "**most important event in** the
**history** of humanity]{.underline}" (Totschnig 2017: 908). [It poses
an existential risk,]{.underline} yet we already live in a world full of
plausible earth-ending threats. Unlike nuclear weapons or climate
change, [AGI contains constructive as well as destructive potential for
the fate of humanity]{.underline}.

AGI both sharpens and multiplies our moral obligation towards future
generations of humans. Recent scholarship suggests that humans should
consider more deeply their impact on the unborn, owing to the increased
productivity of all forms of capital over time (Cowen 2018), the greater
qualitative and quantitative scope future generations have to morally
affect the world (Greaves 2017), and the uninhabited swathes of space
and time that technology might one day populate with human lives
(Bostrom 2003a; Beckstead 2013). Despite extensive discussion, there was
little to distinguish technicians from PADs on this topic. I find
concern that **[AGI]{.underline}** has no intrinsic terminus (i.e., it
**[does not die]{.underline}**), [making it]{.underline} both "[capable
of playing a]{.underline} much '[longer']{.underline} [and more
deceptive game]{.underline} than the typical human" (Danaher 2015: 8),
while the "marginal cost of creating an additional artificial
intelligence after you have built the first one is close to zero"
(Bostrom 2003b: 762). The consensus that [AGI is an existential
risk]{.underline} also [implies]{.underline} consensus on [its
**significance for all future humans**]{.underline}, since [this incurs
the **termination of all potential lives** and inherently **weds AGI
ethics to the unborn**]{.underline}. As such, it is hard to conceive why
PADs and technicians would view this issue differently. The open
question is whether an [AGI can replicate human
consciousnesses]{.underline}, possibly creating a vast community of
replicated minds and greatly expanding the amount of subjective human
experience in the future relative to the amount of human organisms. This
refracts the scale of moral significance, as "[even if a small
fraction]{.underline} of these lives [were to exist in hellish
circumstances, the amount of **suffering** would be **vastly greater
than** that produced by **all the atrocities**, abuses, and natural
causes **in Earth's history** so far]{.underline}" (Sotala and Gloor
2017: 389). Accordingly, "[the creation of such artificial intellects
will have wide-ranging consequences for almost all social, political,
economic, commercial, technological, scientific, and environmental
issues that humanity will confront in this century]{.underline}"
(Bostrom 2003b: 764).

The introduction of transgenic crops into the food supply has
[highlighted]{.underline} both the successes and the failures of [the
international trade system]{.underline}. On one hand, [the GATT and the
WTO have ensured that domestic and international markets have become
ever more entwined]{.underline}, thus allowing producers and consumers

hand, [such institutions are not well designed to mediate political
disputes between domestic players]{.underline} arising from the
application of trade law. The introduction of new technologies for food
products illustrates this dilemma. **[The present open trade environment
allows domestic political and regulatory differences to spill over into

remains unresolved, it pales in comparison to the looming dispute over

[appeared]{.underline} largely [unable to assume a critical stance
toward biotech]{.underline}. Instead [they take at face value simplistic
business models that don't stand up to relevant scientific
scrutiny]{.underline}. Under what often seems to be a reflexive granting
of the benefitof-the-doubt, [news coverage]{.underline} and commentary
typically [has]{.underline} offered up [a pre-bundled formula for
assessing the technology de jour:]{.underline} quote a critic, often
mouthing a trope about the untowardness of "[playing God]{.underline},"

the **demise of genetic determinism** means no one can be any good at

risks of trying to do so. [The package has proven to be a **powerful
normalizing force**]{.underline}. Another force, **[neutralizing
dissent]{.underline}**, [involves]{.underline} actually [inviting
critics to the table]{.underline}. Once seated, they can acclimate to
the heat of biotech trends intensifying despite unaddressed
controversies. The authors of Evolving Ourselves: Redesigning the Future
of Humanity -- One Gene at a Time are co-founders of Excel Venture
Management, "which builds start-ups in synthetic biology, big data, and
new genetic technologies." After announcing the inevitability of
redesigned humans, they invite the public to help get us there. "Humans
are on the way to becoming something else. Something of their own
design," they declare. "We are trying out various temporary solutions
and recommendations before making permanent alternations. But [the
direction is clear]{.underline}." Their suggestion for how to have [a
"sensible conversation" about "rapid unnatural evolution"]{.underline}
is to ask for, "[an ongoing ethics and permitted uses
conversation]{.underline}." "\[H\]elp us develop a set of guiding
principles," they invite (Enriquez and Gullans, 2016, pp. 262--264).
Then, [they frame the intended dialogue by feeding readers suggestions
about what to ask for on the road to their biotech

**[Civilian political authority over military leadership is a bedrock
principle of the U.S. Constitution]{.underline}**, so fundamental to the
American system of government that it has rarely been questioned. But
since President Donald Trump entered office in 2017, his administration
has systematically eroded the norms that have supported this
constitutional principle for generations. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration has consistently [elevated military voices
over]{.underline} those of experienced [civil servants]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the development of [foreign policy]{.underline}, and
funding cuts to nondefense federal agencies, along with the resignations
of many career civil servants, have left government offices woefully
understaffed. As a result, [policy planning and the guidance of
strategic defense initiatives---which have historically been the purview
of senior civil servants---have increasingly been ceded to those in
uniform]{.underline}. [Civilian authority over the armed forces is
weaker now than at any point]{.underline} in living memory, and the
Trump administration is increasingly engaging with the world in ways
that mirror military preferences. [The]{.underline} [resulting foreign
policy is]{.underline} eerily reminiscent of [the "cult of the
offensive]{.underline}": [an **overconfidence in offensive military
advantage** that can lead to **rapid escalation**]{.underline}; such
overconfidence is widely believed to have contributed to the outbreak of
World War I. Unless civilian control over the military can be
reestablished, [the United States risks sleepwalking its way into
another world war.]{.underline} SERVING CIVILIAN GOALS [By giving
civilian leaders authority over the military]{.underline}, the framers
of [the]{.underline} U.S. [Constitution]{.underline} were not merely
assigning elected officials a few oversight duties. They [were creating
a system in which defense planning would be guided by civilian needs and
the military would carry out its activities in the service of civilian
goals.]{.underline} Since Trump's civilian "[America first]{.underline}"
plan was announced early in the 2016 presidential campaign, many members
of the U.S. foreign policy community have viewed the agenda a[s an
inherent danger to national security]{.underline}. [Even more worrisome
for]{.underline} those concerned about the [continuing stability of
civil-military relations]{.underline}, many of the [cabinet
nominees]{.underline} whom the new administration found acceptable [were
military officers, such as General James Mattis, General John Kelly, and
Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster.]{.underline} From the beginning of
the Trump era, the national security establishment made a Faustian
bargain: in an effort to constrain the new president, it looked the
other way as extraordinary numbers of active duty and retired military
officers were appointed to positions usually reserved for civilian
experts. As the "adults in the room," these career military officials
hoped to protect American alliances and constrain Trump's worst
impulses. Although few of these officers questioned the principle of
civilian control, their narrow interpretation of civilian oversight
meant that broader norms of civilian guidance became a kind of
collateral damage in the struggle to contain the chaos. This political
bargain gave the more experienced military officers at the highest
levels of the administration, some of whom had served together for
decades, a natural advantage over their civilian counterparts. Their
shared service gave them a common language and, most important, an
outlook that allowed them to easily sideline civilian outsiders like
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Homeland Security
Kirstjen Nielsen, and later, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. When
leaders are appointed at the top levels of government, they staff their
organizations with people whom they trust to execute their plans. Most
[civilian leaders have diverse professional networks]{.underline} to
draw upon, [but]{.underline} career [military officers tend to know few
qualified people]{.underline} outside of veterans' organizations. As a
result, many of the lower-level staff posts within the Trump
administration have also been filled with retired military officers. In
the office of the secretary of defense, [uniformed officers continue to
execute civilian responsibilities]{.underline}. And although sluggish
hiring and retention difficulties have played a role, Mattis's admitted
preference for military officers over career civil servants during his
tenure exacerbated the imbalance. When the department did hire
civilians, it often placed them in "acting" roles with little power and
even less influence. The result is that [uniformed officers of the
military have developed and enacted policy for the secretary of
defense]{.underline}---such [that]{.underline} it [does not]{.underline}
necessarily [reflect the priorities of civilians]{.underline} in the
administration. Indeed, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy
Commission noted in November 2018 that "[there is an imbalance in
civil-military relations on critical issues of strategy development and
implementation. Civilian voices appear relatively muted on issues at the
center of U.S. defense and national security policy."]{.underline}
DIFFERING VIEWS OF THE WORLD [Military officers and civilians see
foreign affairs differently]{.underline}. [Military
officers]{.underline} tend to [assume worst-case intentions]{.underline}
and capabilities in order to be best prepared for potential threats.
When called upon to act, [they]{.underline} often [prefer solutions that
enable them to take the offensive]{.underline}. When civilians lose
their voice in the process, [military preferences shape security
strategy in ways that]{.underline} [reflect]{.underline} these
[institutional biases toward action and confrontation]{.underline}. And
as civilian control of the U.S. armed forces has declined,
[these]{.underline} preferences [have increasingly dominated American
foreign policy]{.underline}. Thus, [the current imbalance in
civil-military relations has led to a foreign policy that has heightened
international tensions, closed off avenues for productive diplomacy, and
increased the risk of]{.underline} inadvertent [**escalation**
or]{.underline} even **[accidental war.]{.underline}** Mattis and
McMaster principally authored the 2017 United States National Security
Strategy and the 2018 National Defense Strategy. These documents defined
security almost exclusively in terms of great-power competition and
state actors, emphasizing the threat from China in particular. The
strategies largely approach the world as a zero-sum competition in which
maintaining an advantage matters far more than cooperating for mutual
benefit. [Current U.S. strategy]{.underline} therefore
[filters]{.underline} the meaning of [the changing geopolitical
environment]{.underline} almost exclusively [through military
perceptions of threat.]{.underline} [In]{.underline} the event of [a war
with China or Russia, the military would face a daunting
task]{.underline} in the South China Sea or in the Baltic states. [Its
instinct]{.underline}, then, [is to develop]{.underline} the
[strategies]{.underline} and build the capabilities [that are most
likely to win such a confrontation at the lowest cost
possible.]{.underline} But [these strategies can have dangerous
consequences]{.underline}. [With]{.underline} their emphasis on
"[globally integrated operations]{.underline}," [senior]{.underline}
[military commanders are developing retaliatory military
strategies]{.underline} [that emphasize speed and could lead to **quick
escalation**]{.underline}, effectively [**limiting** the options
of]{.underline} political bodies like [the]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**orth **[A]{.underline}**tlantic
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil in the event of a conflict. And
[by]{.underline} officially [labeling China]{.underline} a
"[revisionist]{.underline}" state, Mattis and McMaster assume its
hostility, forcing [decision-makers to start from the
premise]{.underline} [that diplomatic approaches are unproductive and
preventive action is the only way to contain China's
ambitions]{.underline}. **[Military leaders need civilian
input]{.underline}** in order [to mitigate these risks]{.underline}.
[Military]{.underline} operational [preferences privilege offensive
action]{.underline}---[civilian]{.underline} officials [are]{.underline}
best [positioned to articulate the pitfalls]{.underline} of such an
approach, [lest the concern about a great-power war become a
self-fulfilling prophecy.]{.underline} The military naturally seeks to
modernize and acquire new weapons systems. In response to this desire,
the Trump administration withdrew from at least three major arms control
agreements, and it looks unlikely to renew the New START agreement with
Russia. But without arms control, [the United States]{.underline} not
only [risks setting off **arms races**]{.underline} [but also loses
transparency into its adversaries' systems, capabilities, and
intent]{.underline}. [Decision-makers]{.underline} must then [adopt the
military's worst-case assumptions in the event of a crisis, and they are
**likely to miscalculate**]{.underline}. [The military's priority of
seeking]{.underline} ever **[more lethal and modern weapons increases
the risks of nuclear use and proliferation]{.underline}**. The 2018
Nuclear Posture Review advocated for the development and deployment of
low-yield nuclear weapons in response to Russia's alleged intention to
use limited nuclear strikes in regional conflicts. But by acquiring
nuclear weapons specifically designed to be used in a much wider set of
circumstances than the current inventory, [the military has]{.underline}
effectively [lowered the threshold for using nuclear
weapons]{.underline}---a fact that did not escape congressional leaders
during their hearings on the document. Furthermore, as the United States
modernizes its arsenal, [states with vulnerable stockpiles may feel the
need to invest even more in their nuclear program]{.underline}s,
increasing their inventories and investing in second-strike
capabilities. The United States has proposed to develop new weapons
systems capable of dismantling nascent nuclear programs. Some states may
therefore conclude that [nuclear latency]{.underline}---the ability to
develop a nuclear weapons program from existing peaceful
infrastructure---[is no longer a sufficient deterrent and **choose to
proliferate** instead.]{.underline} The United States is rushing even
now to introduce [hypersonic weapons]{.underline} into its arsenal. Such
missiles [serve]{.underline} essentially [no defensive
purpose]{.underline}---and [their development is leading to **a new
nuclear arms race.**]{.underline} REASSERTING CIVILIAN CONTROL [The
White House and Congress must]{.underline} **[reestablish strong
civilian control over military priorities]{.underline}** if the United
States is [to]{.underline} find diplomatic solutions that can help
[**avoid** another **great-power war**.]{.underline} The next
administration, whether under Joe Biden or Donald Trump, should [refrain
from equating military experience with foreign policy
expertise]{.underline}. Rather, at the top levels of government, [the
president should reset the balance of power toward
civilians]{.underline}, appointing officials whose backgrounds yield a
variety of perspectives on foreign policymaking. The next president's
priority upon taking office should be to fill positions within the
civilian office of the secretary of defense that have been largely taken
over by uniformed military officers. These new [civilians should be
hired in a manner that maximizes the office's demographic, experiential,
and intellectual diversit]{.underline}y. Current hiring laws privilege
hiring veterans, which limits the diversity of those in policymaking
positions. Civilian hiring initiatives must therefore act as a
counterweight to that tendency. Finally, the administration should
comprehensively review engagements, programs, and posture to ensure that
U.S. actions are in fact aligned with strategic intent. Such a review
should encompass all [military programs]{.underline}. Many may [seem
like good ideas in isolation, but in combination they may prove to be
provocative or threatening]{.underline}. [Civilian leaders should make
political determinations about the risks and rewards of military
spending on offensive weapons programs]{.underline}; in particular, they
should review the constraints on the new Space Force that may be
necessary in order to both encourage service pride and avoid an arms
race and conflict. [In 1962]{.underline}, the Soviet Union placed
nuclear missiles just 90 miles from the United States' shore. President
John F. Kennedy and the rest of the [civilian leadership did not allow
the military to]{.underline} continue with its standard operating
procedures and preferred courses of action. Instead, they carefully
orchestrated a series of signals that narrowly avoided the outbreak of
[open hostilities]{.underline} between the world's two nuclear
superpowers. Current U.S. policy resembles the firm civilian control and
oversight of the Kennedy administration far less than it does the
posture of the great powers before the outbreak of World War I. Civilian
leadership was either co-opted or pushed aside as French, German, and
Russian militaries pursued strategies that prioritize offensive
operations and doctrines---leading to the now famous cult of the
offensive. [Privileging the military's perceptions of threat over those
of diplomats **makes war**]{.underline} all but **[inevitable. Without
strong civilian oversight, the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[risks]{.underline}** [this]{.underline}
**[catastrophic fate.]{.underline}**

\-\--solves basically the same as the DoD

The value of this can first be seen in our application of his 1996
concept of four-dimensional combat in the battlespace to the problem of
homeland security (the homeland space) and even the activity of
four-dimensional diplomacy (as the counterpart of national power to
combat) in the diplomacy space. We have often argued in our seminars
that [if the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[S]{.underline}tate [would decide to more squarely mimic the integration
of tech]{.underline}nological [imagination and corresponding application
of science and engineering activities into the process of diplomacy as
has been the empirical record of the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense -- [we could expect similar types
of operational transformation with regard to **diplomatic policy
outcomes** in terms both nation-state behaviors and U.S. diplomatic
doctrines.]{.underline} First -- this view of international relations in
the Skolnikoff tradition -- applied more narrowly to the scope of
national and homeland security is the direct legacy of the product of
formula for national power that was the product in the end of war
dialogue between President Franklin Roosevelt and M.I.T. engineer Dr.
Vannevar Bush. The latter's famous letter written to the president in
response to Roosevelt's 1945 inquiry about the role of science and
engineering in the future of the American State after the war, Science:
The Endless Frontier informs what we now refer to as the model of
American science and engineering -- "Mission Science" with the Manhattan
Project conspicuously ever-present as the iconic event and example of
the process and outcome of our science and technology enterprise. This
model has generally followed a pattern of producing excellence in
science and engineering at the largest collection of universities in the
world, combined with a market economy, supporting private sector, and
fueled by the largest GDP in the world. It is not beyond the pale -- to
even critique some modern day political scientists who continue to
describe the world of political and economic power in almost purely
normative philosophical terms without making nary a reference to the
fundamental physical forces (as explained by the disciplines of physics
-- chemistrybiology) and corresponding technologies (applied knowledge
as in computer science -- the various engineering disciplines -- etc.).
Invoking the dialogue between President Roosevelt and Dr. Bush one more
time -- it should be remembered that the president did not write to Dr.
Bush asking him for an investigation into how wartime discoveries from
researchers into the rhetoric and philosophy of Plato and Aristotle
helped America defeat fascism or how it would help it to develop
American power toward successfully competing vis-à-vis the Soviet Union.
Not that these ideas are not important -- we argue that their worth is
self-evident. However we posit, as in the Skolnikoff tradition, that
American power arising from the Roosevelt-Bush dialogue was
fundamentally a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)
activity and remains so today. Operationally, [this system has produced
tremendous political and economic power for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates that directly correlates to the very real physical
and kinetic power that the scientists and engineers have successfully
derived (science/knowledge) and produced (engineering) as tasked by
their political leaders and benefactors. Interestingly and conversely,
this system has not always produced the most comprehensively
knowledgeable nor capable leaders or thinkers with regard to individuals
who are typically trained at the most advanced levels of knowledge and
practice in matters of, for example, physics and engineering, and
simultaneously political/economic science and law. This has and does
indeed occur over time in smaller numbers and we cite Libicki's work as
an example of such innovative thinking and we go further to argue that
to begin this process at the undergraduate level by integrating science
and engineering students with social science students in common courses
in both science and politics [may allow us to innovate]{.underline} yet
again **[in a more competitive world]{.underline}** and with regard to
more complex problems as we are about to investigate in this article.
Consider, for example, [a future where the foreign service officer is as
well trained in the use of i]{.underline}nformation
[t]{.underline}echnology tools -- in the field -- as is the typical
combat soldier deployed in Afghanistan today. Beyond the obligatory
smartphone -- the army is rapidly developing complete systems of
dedicated applications (apps) connected to networks of machines,
weapons, humans, and data that are solutions to a variety of dynamic
environmental problems. [Juxtaposed against the operational methods of
the State Department, the technological gap between the American soldier
and the American foreign-service officer appears to remain rather
stark]{.underline} (and this is something more than a cultural
artifact).

[The United States must pump billions of dollars into artificial
intelligence research if the nation wants to be "AI-ready" by 2025 and
successfully compete with great power competitors China and
Russia,]{.underline} according to new findings from a congressionally
chartered panel. [The National Security Commission]{.underline} on
Artificial Intelligence --- which was established under the fiscal year
2019 National Defense Authorization Act to examine ways to advance the
development of AI for national security and defense purposes ---
[recently released its final report to Congress in March after two years
of work. "To win in AI, we need more money, more talent \[and\] stronger
leadership,"]{.underline} said Chairman Eric Schmidt, the former head of
Google's parent company Alphabet. The 700-plus page report includes
recommendations to the Biden administration and Congress that will
require sweeping changes to better posture the nation for competition
with other AI-enabled nations, such as China and Russia. The technology
will impact the United States profoundly in the coming years, but
despite some "exciting experimentation" and a few small programs[, "the
U.S. government is a long way from being 'AI-ready,']{.underline}"
according to the report. The Defense Department and intelligence
community must be AI-ready by 2025 to avoid falling behind, the
commissioners said. Reaching that goal will require the government to
create a Technology Competitiveness Council akin to the National
Security Council, said former Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Work.
"[The U.S. has no mechanism to organize for a tech
competition,"]{.underline} he said. The National Security Council was
created at the beginning of the Cold War to manage a long-term
competition with the Soviet Union, he noted. "[We need the same type of
approach \[for the current era of great power competition\] at the White
House level by **establishing the Technology Competitiveness
Council**]{.underline}, \[which\] [we believe should be chaired by the
vice president and includes all the cabinet secretaries to develop and
oversee a strategic national approach to emerging technologies like
AI]{.underline}," he added during a public meeting where the commission
voted on the report before transmitting it to the Biden administration
and Capitol Hill. The government will also need to make major
investments in research to spur domestic AI innovation, Schmidt said.
["We do need more money, particularly in AI R&D, so that by 2026 we get
to \$32 billion per year,]{.underline}" he said. [Schmidt has previously
said that China is rapidly catching up to the United States in AI,
noting that the nation is only a year or two ahead of Beijing. China has
made "a massive investment in this area with many, many, many smart
people working on it]{.underline}. We have every reason to think that
the competition with China will increase," Schmidt said during the
meeting. The commission's report is split into two parts: "Defending
America in the AI Era" and "Winning the Technology Competition." The
first focuses on implications and applications for AI for defense and
national security, Schmidt said. The second recommends actions that the
government must take to promote AI innovation to improve national
competitiveness and protect critical U.S. advantages in the bigger
strategic competition with China. [The report features four pillars of
action including leadership, talent, hardware and
innovation.]{.underline} "If I've learned anything in studying the way
the government works, leadership --- especially from the top --- is
critical to get the bureaucracy to move to the next challenge and the
next opportunity," Schmidt said. [Meanwhile, **there is a "huge talent
deficit" in the federal workforce**]{.underline}, he said. "We need to
build new talent and expand existing programs in government," Schmidt
said. "We need the world's best to come and stay to cultivate homegrown
talent." [One key recommendation of the report is to scale up digital
talent within the government.]{.underline} This includes establishing
new talent pipelines, including a U.S. Digital Service Academy to train
current and future employees. The commissioners also called for a
civilian National Digital Reserve Corps to recruit skilled employees
including industry experts, academics and college graduates.
Additionally, there needs to be a Digital Corps, which would be modeled
on the Army Medical Corps. When it comes to hardware, it is critical the
nation stays ahead, Schmidt said. However, it is very close to losing
its edge when it comes to microelectronics --- which underpin some of
the Defense Department's key capabilities including artificial
intelligence, advanced manufacturing and space systems --- because of
the United States' reliance on Taiwan. ["We need to revitalize domestic
semiconductor manufacturing and ensure that we're two generations ahead
of China,"]{.underline} he said. **[Work noted that Taiwan is
potentially vulnerable]{.underline}**. If ["China absorbed Taiwan ---
which is the source of many of the world's hardware --- that would
really be a competitive problem for us,"]{.underline} he said. Fostering
domestic innovation will come with a high price, Schmidt said. "AI
research is going to be incredibly expensive," he said. "We need the
government to help set up the conditions for accessible domestic AI
innovation." The commission worked on its report with a great sense of
urgency, Work said. [Each of the 15 commissioners believe that
AI-enabled systems will pose a threat to free and open societies in the
futur]{.underline}e. "[AI tools will be weapons of first resort,
particularly between great powers]{.underline}," he said. The U.S. armed
services' competitive military technical advantage could be lost within
the next decade if the nation does not accelerate the adoption of
artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies across its
missions, Work said. "[Our major military rivals are really all-in on
military AI applications," he said. "Defending against AI-capable
adversaries without employing AI is an invitation to disaster.
AI-enabled applications will operate at machine speeds]{.underline} and
humans simply will not be able to keep up with them without help from
their own algorithms and their own AI." Speaking during a plenary
meeting discussing a draft version of the report in January,
commissioner Chris Darby, president and CEO of In-Q-Tel, an independent,
non-profit strategic investor for the CIA and the broader U.S.
intelligence community, said the United States faces five AI-related
threats which illustrate a new society level of conflict that the United
States must organize and defend against. The first is AI-enabled
information operations. "[AI applications and associated technologies
will increase the magnitude, the precision \[and\] persistence of
maligned information ops,"]{.underline} he said. The government should
create a joint interagency task force within the Office of the Director
of National Intelligence to lead and integrate public-private efforts to
counter foreign-sourced maligned information. The second is targeted
data harvesting, Darby said. Information security and integrity must be
viewed through a national security lens. The government must protect its
own data from adversarial interference or theft by defending against
attacks. The third threat is AI-enhanced cyber capabilities. "Though the
threats are still developing, in the future, AI-automated and enabled
malware could make compromises such as the SolarWinds cyber attack
orders of magnitude more effective, delivering greater precision,
tailoring speeds, stealth and persistence at scale," he said, referring
to a massive hack that rocked the government and was discovered in
December. Government agencies have pointed the blame at Russia, and it
is believed that the breach went undetected for many months. To close
gaps in the nation's cyber defenses, the United States should continue
to adopt recommendations suggested by the U.S. Cyberspace Solarium
Commission, which last year released a major report to Congress, Darby
said. The document --- which featured 80 recommendations to lawmakers
--- broke its recommendations into six pillars, including: reform the
U.S. government's structure and organization for cyberspace; strengthen
norms and non-military tools; promote national resilience; reshape the
cyber ecosystem; operationalize cybersecurity collaboration with the
private sector; and preserve and employ the military instrument of
national power. Additionally, to head off future threats and accelerate
countermeasures to current threats, the government should develop and
deploy AI-enabled information sharing, anomaly detection and malware
mitigation across its networks, Darby said. A fourth threat the United
States must be aware of is adversarial AI against U.S. platforms, Darby
said. These types of acts are here today and already impacting
commercial machine learning systems, he added. "Among other moves to
improve AI assurance, the government should create government-wide red
teams to attack and harden our own AI applications," Darby said. [The
fifth threat is more troublesome against the backdrop of the COVID-19
pandemic: **AI-enabled biotechnology**]{.underline}. New [technologies
such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ---
more commonly known as CRISPR --- enable gene editing and make biology
programmable,]{.underline} he said. "Biotech, sadly, can also have a
dark side," Darby side. "[AI may enable the engineering of genetically
targeted pathogens or the **mental and physical bio-enhancement of ...
adversary combatants.**]{.underline}" To address this, the [government
should increase the profile of biosecurity issues within U.S. national
security agencies]{.underline}, as well as update the National
Biodefense Strategy to include a wider vision of biothreats, Darby said.
Commissioner Katharina McFarland, chair of the National Academies of
Science Board of Army Research and Development, said the application of
biotechnology can protect the United States against some threats as well
as create new ones. "As we see the democratization of biotechnology and
the expansion of ... dual-use applications, we need to be of course
sensitive to \... nations that don't share our values, but work with the
nations that do share our values to strengthen our ability to use these
technologies appropriately and defend against when they're not used
appropriately," she said. Commissioner Safra Catz, CEO of Oracle Corp.,
said the report is meant to be a wake-up call for the government. "There
are some very, very bold actions we're asking for," she said. "This is
pretty much the critical moment for our country and the investment
that's necessary." Jim Shaw, executive vice president of engineering at
the Crystal Group, a Hiawatha, Iowa-based manufacturer of
high-performance computers, artificial intelligence systems and rugged
computing platforms, said the commission's report is a good start, but
more work needs to be done. "We're late to the game," he said. "That's
one of the things that we probably need to just recognize right away.
This is becoming an urgent need for us to spend resources to gain skill
sets and talent ... through universities and industry to try to,
frankly, catch up with China and Russia." The Pentagon and Congress
should get on board with the commission's recommendations, and take them
even further, he said. "My hope is that it will snowball into quite a
bit of activity," Shaw said. "That's essential for us to preserve" the
nation's edge.

or chemical weapons will mean consideration of the **highly
transnational nature** of **nanotechnology** **research** and
**development**]{.underline}. Traditional and innovative new approaches
to nonproliferation and counterproliferation are important policy
elements to reduce the risk of misuse of nanotechnology. [Although the
United States and the international community are currently attempting
to limit the threat of biotechnology, serious discussion and
anticipation of the potential future threats of nanotechnology should be
initiated now]{.underline}. [Greater engagement]{.underline} by the
research community is [perennially called for by pundits, policy makers,
scientists, and the security community]{.underline}. For example, [the
report by the **Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities** of the
United States Regarding **Weapons of Mass Destruction** recommends that
the U.S. intelligence community "work with the Biological Sciences
Community" because the "Intelligence Community simply does not have the
in-depth technical knowledge about biological weapons that it has about
nuclear weapons]{.underline}."13 It is unlikely that the intelligence
community's expertise on nanotechnology exceeds that of biotechnology.
There is also an urgent need for people outside of the experimental

engage with individuals in the technical security studies community.

Action is needed to anticipate the threat of nanotechnology for
offensive chemical and biological weapons applications. The threat from
nanotechnology varies. The required technical knowledge and materials
may exceed the capabilities of non-state actors. On the other hand,
state-based programs may not face these limitations. The time to develop
and establish policy to neutralize potential misuses, whether by states
or non-state actors, is now, rather than when such research applications
appear inevitable. A better alignment of research priorities and
planning guidance for nanotechnology will be needed to innovate and
protect against newly emerging and growing threats. Reducing risks from
the misuse of nanotechnology as applied to chemical and biological
weapons means recognizing the globalized nature of nanotech research and
development. [Addressing the **threats** and **opportunities** presented
by nanotechnology and other emerging technologies will require a
**strategic vision** to foster revolutionary science. To be effective,
such a vision will encompass truly **multidisciplinary approaches** and
incorporate comprehensive capability and threat analyses. Improved
**monitoring**, **cooperation**, and **understanding** of **technical

challenges and threats that may be wielded through application of these
technologies is critical. [The development of countermeasures to those
threats is a national and international security concern]{.underline},
and [strong defensive capabilities are also important as a protective
measure and as a deterrent]{.underline}. For now, the penultimate
limitation is the infancy of the technology, but that restriction will
not hold indefinitely. The laws of physics remain the final regulating
influence on nanotechnology.

[There is a further impetus to national efforts to improve and
consolidate relative standing in]{.underline} this field: Nanotechnology
is the principal enabler of the Convergence of Technologies (CT). Its
advocates foresee a 'single engineering paradigm' which will combine
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, robotics, and
**[cognitive science]{.underline}**.19 CT planning and prognostication
has a strongly Realist cast, expressed most succinctly by former US
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich in the
agenda-setting US National Science Foundation/Department of Commerce
Report: '[If we want this economy to grow, we have to be the leading
scientific country in the world. If we want to be physically safe for
the next 30 years, we have to be the leading scientific country in the
world. If we want to be healthy as we age, we have to be the leading
scientific country in the world**. It would be literally madness to
offer anything except an increase in scientific
funding**]{.underline}.'20 The same report also contains the following
argument: [Government has an important role in setting long-term
research priorities, respecting the ethical and social aspects of
potential uses of technology, and ensuring economic conditions that
facilitate the rapid invention and deployment of beneficial
tech]{.underline}nologies. [Tech]{.underline}nological [superiority is
the **fundamental basis** of]{.underline} the [economic prosperity and
national security of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, and
[continued progress in]{.underline} \[nano-, [biological]{.underline},
information [and cognitive]{.underline}\] [tech]{.underline}nologies [is
an essential component]{.underline} for government agencies [to
accomplish their missions]{.underline}. Science and engineering must
offer society new visions of what it is possible to achieve through
interdisciplinary research projects designed to promote technological
convergence.21 But 'what it is possible to achieve' is not necessarily
identical with 'beneficial technologies', particularly when the
possibilities are so numerous, and so far-reaching in their
implications. In a sober reflection on what 'transformative
technologies' might entail, the principal EU report on CT noted that
'Each \[of the likely characteristics of CT applications\] presents an
opportunity to solve societal problems, to benefit individuals, and to
generate wealth. Each of these also poses threats to culture and
tradition, to human integrity and autonomy, perhaps to political and
economic stability.'22 Yet as the conviction hardens that [nations must
secure a firm place in]{.underline} the [development]{.underline} of
nanotechnology and CT, considerable efforts are being made to further
embed nanotechnology by creating strong linkages between public and
private actors as well as between once distinct scientific disciplines
and research centres, in order to establish and maintain momentum.23 In
the US, effort devoted to entrenching nanotechnology was conceived as
essential from the start and was crucially formative of the National
Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI): The orchestration of all the government
agencies behind the NNI concept was critical in getting the 'jump start'
that was achieved. NNI was conceived as an inclusive process where
various stakeholders would be involved. In 1999 we envisioned 'a grand
coalition' of academic, industry, government, states, local
organizations, and the public that would advance nanotechnology.
Twenty-five agencies covered most relevant areas in national interest in
NNI in 2006, and industry already is investing more for R&D in the US.
\[\...\] We identified nanotechnology as a 'dormant' \[science and
engineering\] opportunity, but with an 'immense' potential. Creating a
chorus to support nanotechnology, from 1990 to March 1999, was an
important preliminary step.24 One of the effects of linking together
government departments, private institutions, corporations, and
universities in this way is that the extent to which the [furtherance
of]{.underline} nanotechnology and technological
[convergence]{.underline} are [seen as key national
endeavour]{.underline}s is both widened and [reinforced through a dense
network of interlocking interests]{.underline}. In light of this and the
capabilities and disposition of other states, concerns about the
environmental, social, and ethical implications of nanotechnology and
CT25 are acknowledged at a strategic level, but in ways unlikely to
disrupt planned momentum. So it is that the primary EU report on CT
states: [Tremendous transformative potential comes with tremendous
anxieties. These anxieties need to be taken into account. When they are,
converging technologies can develop in a supportive
climate]{.underline}. To the extent that public concerns are included in
the process, [researchers and investors can proceed without fear of
finding their work over-regulated or rejected]{.underline}.26

AGUSTIN RAHHHHHH

Over the last decade, military theorists and authors in the fields of
future warfare and strategy have examined in detail the potential
impacts of an ongoing revolution in information technology. There has
been a particular focus on the impacts of automation and artificial
intelligence on military and national security affairs. This attention
on silicon-based disruption has nonetheless meant that sufficient
attention may not have been paid to other equally profound technological
developments. One of those developments is the field of biotechnology.
There have been some breathtaking achievements in the biological realm
over the last decade. Human genome sequencing has progressed from a
multi-year and multi-billion dollar undertaking to a much cheaper and
quicker process, [far outstripping Moore\'s
Law](https://www.genome.gov/27541954/dna-sequencing-costs-data/). Just
as those concerned with national security affairs must monitor
disruptive silicon-based technologies, leaders must also be literate in
the key biological issues likely to impact the future security of
nations. One of **[the most significant]{.underline}** **[matters in
biotechnology]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** that of **[human
augmentation and whether nations should augment military personnel to
stay at the leading edge of capability]{.underline}**. A first order
issue will be group cohesion. Military institutions have deep experience
integrating newcomers into their ranks. Fundamental to effective future
teaming will be evolving this approach to establish trust and group
cohesion between normal humans and those who are augmented. The degree
to which military leaders can and should trust augmented personnel to
make decisions about saving and taking lives is likely to be an
evolutionary process. It also remains to be seen whether or not teams
comprised of augmented and non-augmented humans are capable of
developing
[trust](https://csbaonline.org/research/publications/human-machine-teaming-for-future-ground-forces/publication).
Experimentation and trials are needed to establish whether augmented
people will bias away from decisions and input from non-augmented people
and vice versa. While institutions can learn from historical integration
challenges, there is one essential difference with augmented humans.
Previously, integration of new groups into the military dealt with human
beings. If augmentation using neurotechnology significantly enhances
cognitive function, this may represent a separate and distinct group of
future Homo sapiens. **[The]{.underline}** second **[challenge will be
accessibility]{.underline}**. **[Military institutions will need to
decide]{.underline}** what **[proportion]{.underline}** **[of its forces
will be augmented]{.underline}**. Given that **[early generations of
this biotechnology may be expensive]{.underline}**, it is unlikely an
entire military institution can be augmented. If so, who will be
augmented and why? [Military institutions will need to develop a value
proposition to ensure physical and cognitive augmentation]{.underline}
**[produces superior outcomes to the use of un-augmented
personnel]{.underline}**. Yet another question to ask is whether
military personnel will be de-augmented on leaving the service. **[The
transition of augmented personnel into a largely unaugmented populace
may be traumatic for military personnel]{.underline}**, and for society
more broadly. Even more severe in its repercussions may be transitioning
de-augmented personnel into a populace where augmentation is ubiquitous.
The third challenge will be conceptual. One Chinese scientist, [writing
in 2006](https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/171/11/1150/4577887),
has proposed military biotechnology offers the chance to shift to a "new
balance between defence and attack, giving rise to a new concept of
warfare, a new balance of military force, and new attacking power."
While the emphasis of this particular article was on a more merciful
form of warfare---about which we should be skeptical---it nonetheless
highlights the requirement to rethink what biotechnology and human
augmentation means for how military institutions develop warfighting
concepts. When humans arrive with cognitive enhancement, a range of
tactical, operational, and strategic concepts may become irrelevant.
Strategic thinking, using a combination of biological and silicon-based
technologies could take organisations in very different directions than
is presently the case. It also bears examining whether those with
augmentation will enable greater diversity of performance (particularly
in the intellectual realm) or if it will lead to increased
homogenisation of physical and cognitive performance. The fourth
challenge is obsolescence. A fundamental challenge for humans waging war
is that, despite technological advances, one of the weakest links is the
physical capacity of the human. As Patrick Lin was written, [technology
makes up for our absurd
frailty](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/02/more-than-human-the-ethics-of-biologically-enhancing-soldiers/253217/).
Therefore, might normal humans without augmentation become irrelevant in
a new construct where military institutions possess large numbers of
physically and cognitively augmented personnel? It remains to be seen
whether unaugmented humans might able to compete with physically and
cognitively augmented military personnel. The augmentation of humans for
different physical and cognitive functions may also drive change in how
military institutions operate, plan, and think strategically. A fifth
challenge is military education and training. Traditional military
training emphases the teaching of humans to achieve learning outcomes
and missions as individuals and teams. In an integrated
augmented/non-augmented institution, training methods must evolve to
account for the different and improved capabilities of augmented
personnel and to blend the capabilities of augmented and non-augmented
personnel. Similarly, education for military leaders currently seeks to
achieve their intellectual development in the art and science of war. If
humans augmented with cognitive enhancements are present, both
institutional and individual professional military education will also
need to evolve. Learning delivery, as well as key learning outcomes,
will have to be re-examined to account for the enhanced physical and
cognitive performance of this new segment of the military workforce.
Even issues as basic as fitness assessments must be re-examined.
Potentially, military organisations could drop physical assessments by
automatically augmenting people to the institutionally desired level of
performance. The sixth challenge is one of choice. Command structures
demand a reduction in an individual's free will to refuse such that
informed consent is not quite the same as for the general population.
And when experimental augmentation options progress to become approved
interventions, can we equate a parent considering whether to choose an
approved cognitive augmentation option for their child to a soldier
contemplating the same when operating alongside augmented peers where
the stakes are orders of magnitude greater? [How much
choice](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001289)
will military personnel have in the augmentation process? Will this be
on a volunteer basis or by direction, and what are the moral, legal, and
ethical implications of these stances? Speculation that augmentation may
become mandatory for some professions [may also apply to the
military](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00107/full).
The final issue addressed in this article is one of ethics. Research
communities are grappling with the [ethical and moral
implications](https://www.myvmc.com/news/ethical-issues-surrounding-implantable-brain-technologies/)
of augmentation for society as a whole. While the first concern in
evaluating the military applications of biotechnology is international
humanitarian law, [bioethics must also be
considered](http://ethics.calpoly.edu/greenwall_report.pdf). Ethical
considerations pervade almost every aspect of human augmentation, and
there are ethical considerations threaded through the other challenges
raised in this article. For example, beyond the first order questions of
whether we should augment soldiers are issues such as how much
augmentation should be allowable. Military institutions should also
assess the cumulative effects of multiple augmentations and the
consequences of converging augmentation. There may also be a point at
which a highly augmented human may cross the human-machine barrier, as
well as a range of unanticipated capabilities that emerge from different
augmentation combinations. A WAY AHEAD These issues must be informed by
those within the biotechnology community, but they alone cannot solve
them. Broader involvement by senior military, government, and community
leaders is required. One expert in biotechnology [has
written](https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1472-698X-2-3)
that "clearly the new forms of power being unleashed by bio-technology
will have to be harnessed and used with greater wisdom than power has
been used in the past." If military institutions are to demonstrate
wisdom in their investments in biotechnology, they must explore societal
impacts as well as effects within military institutions. "SPLITTING
HUMANKIND INTO BIOLOGICAL CASTES WILL DESTROY THE FOUNDATIONS OF LIBERAL
IDEOLOGY. LIBERALISM STILL PRESUPPOSES THAT ALL HUMAN BEINGS HAVE EQUAL
VALUE AND AUTHORITY." **[It is likely]{.underline}** some
**[augmentation will be]{.underline}**---at least
initially---**[expensive]{.underline}**. It may be beyond the means of
most people **[in]{.underline}** society and, potentially, **[many
government and corporate institutions]{.underline}**. If only military
personnel might be augmented, what are the impacts on civil-military
relationships, and who would make this decision? In this construct, it
could be unethical to deny the benefits of augmentation to wider
society. However as [Yuval Harari has
noted](https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464345/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543706204&sr=8-2&keywords=homo+deus),
this may see a differentiation in [how society
views](https://archive.industry.gov.au/industry/IndustrySectors/nanotechnology/Publications/Documents/Emergingtechstudybio.pdf)
augmented and non-augmented people---"Splitting humankind into
biological castes will destroy the foundations of liberal ideology.
Liberalism still presupposes that all human beings have equal value and
authority." In Western democracies, this poses profound questions about
[conferred
advantage](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2014.00228/full),
societal sense of fairness and equality, and the value of individuals
within society. In Western democratic systems, development of
regulation, policy, and legal frameworks is [not keeping

with the current tempo of complicated technological advancements. It
cannot be assumed other states are allowing these deficits to slow their
efforts in
[biotechnology](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06847-7), not
to mention the unregulated efforts of non-state actors. While the focus
of the fourth industrial revolution remains predominantly on
technologies, perhaps for Australia (and other democracies) it is also
these areas which require a

June 22, 2022, Turkey's wartime bridge to the West is collapsing,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/turkeysource/turkeys-wartime-bridge-to-the-west-is-collapsing//RM)

For the first time in a while, Turkey was not only acting in line with
transatlantic allies but also taking a lead in the region in a way that
has bolstered its importance as a key NATO member. [US officials have
gone as far as to suggest that Turkey transfer its S-400 missile-defense
systems to Ukraine in a bid to finally solve the problem of Russian air
defense systems stationed in a NATO member state and the consequent
Western sanctions imposed on Ankara. **Turkey has bluntly rejected that
proposal.**]{.underline} Instead, it has slowly allowed domestic
problems, regional geopolitics, and pragmatism to dictate its approach
to the war. As a result, [Turkish leadership once again appears eager to
continue business as usual with an increasingly isolated
Russia.]{.underline} Shifting winds Though only obliged to close the
Bosporus and Dardanelles straits for the naval ships of states at war
under Article 19 of the Montreux Convention, Ankara has denied access to
non-littoral NATO states as well. [Turkey's fears of losing out to the
West in its ambitions for a kind of regional ownership of the Black Sea
prevailed over the security threats posed by Russia. Turkey's desire to
limit the presence of NATO vessels in the Black Sea, which might lead to
further escalation with Russia, is understandable---even if not in line
with the Alliance's objectives]{.underline}. It is harder to justify the
statements of Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar wondering whether
mines discovered in the Black Sea had been laid there deliberately to
create an excuse for NATO minesweepers to enter those waters. Turkey is
also blocking the quick addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO, trying
to use the situation to solve its own problems and voice its own
security concerns. It is highly unlikely that Turkish leadership will
block the membership of the two Nordic countries in the long term.
Nevertheless, its current diplomatic bargaining has revealed major
differences in threat perceptions as seen from Ankara and other
capitals. While for most of the European states, the major threat on
NATO's eastern borders is a revisionist Russia, for Turkey it is Kurdish
People's Protection Units (YPG) and Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) fighters
operating in Syria and allegedly finding a safe haven in Finland and
Sweden. Obviously, [skyrocketing anti-American sentiments in Turkey and
a traditional mistrust for the West limit the possibilities for
cooperation on Ukraine]{.underline}. Whereas the majority of Turks
support Ukraine in this war, [polls show that more than 48 percent blame
the United States or NATO for the conflict while only 34 percent hold
Russia responsible]{.underline}. There is a widespread belief in Turkish
society that the war in Ukraine is just another regional conflict
instigated by Western powers after Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and
others. Russia's invasions and aggression in in South Ossetia, Abkhazia,
Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, and more recently in Ukraine and Syria
don't evoke a similar response among Turks. [Populist rhetoric,
burgeoning ahead of next year's elections, as well as massive
anti-Western propaganda on Turkish media mostly featuring retired
generals, nationalist pundits, and (pro-)Russian experts with a strong
Eurasianist agenda, do not help either. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's
economic and strategic agendas also depend on close coordination with
Moscow. Russia supplies almost half of Turkish domestic gas demand,
provides technology for the country's first nuclear power plant in
Akkuyu, and serves as the source of more than five million tourists
annually. The Kremlin's support is also vital for Turkey to maintain its
presence in the South Caucasus and Middle East.]{.underline} The recent
meeting of Çavuşoğlu with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in
Ankara clearly showed that [Turkey is keen to stick to mechanisms for
cooperation with Russia]{.underline}, like the Astana Platform in Syria
or the 3+3 format in the South Caucuses (which also involves Iran,
Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan). Instead of using this crisis as a
chance to decrease its strategic dependence on Russia[, Turkey seems
eager to bind itself even more to Moscow within new
formats.]{.underline} Money matters Ukraine has so far largely respected
Turkey's sensitivities and not pushed too hard on sanctions, instead
focusing on arms supplies and Ankara's mediator role. However, that
dynamic is coming under stress with Russian oligarchs using Turkey as a
safe haven to bypass European Union restrictions. According to Lavrov's
recent statements, [Russia-Turkey bilateral trade doubled in the first
quarter of 2022, and there are now ongoing talks on expanding the use of
Russia's MIR payments system in Turkey]{.underline}. In March, Erdoğan
suggested to Putin that their countries switch to national currencies or
gold in commercial deals instead of the dollar or euro. Izzet
Ekmekcibashi, the head of the Turkish-Russian Business Council (DEIK),
said that more than one thousand new Russian companies opened in Turkey
in March alone. Most recently, a well-connected Turkish journalist
reported on a Russian-Turkish agreement to move the European
headquarters of forty-three leading Russian companies including Gazprom
to Turkey. [Turkish-Russian cooperation in tourism has also quickly
developed.]{.underline} Turkish media outlets have reported that Turkish
carriers are operating 438 flights per week to Russia this summer at a
time when sanctions have made it difficult for Moscow to arrange
flights. According to the pro-government Sabah newspaper, Turkish
Airlines has signed a deal to bring 1.5 million Russian tourists over in
2022. The newspaper's report suggests that Ankara also plans to issue
loans under state guarantees to support Turkish travel companies working
with Russian tourists and back a new airline with the specific mandate
of transporting Russian tourists to Turkey. [Ankara]{.underline}, which
earlier called on Moscow to end its blockade of Ukrainian ports so grain
exports could restart[, is now taking a more pro-Russia position,
advocating for the international community to help unblock not only
Ukraine's but also Russia's trade in grain and fertilizers through safe
logistics, ship insurance, and a return of Russian banks to the SWIFT
system]{.underline}. During Lavrov's recent visit to Turkey, Çavuşoğlu
said that Turkey considered Moscow's demands "reasonable" and "feasible"
and backed easing Western sanctions against Russia. [There is also ample
evidence of Ankara's involvement in the illegal shipment and trade of
Ukrainian grain stolen by Russian forces to the Middle East via the
Turkish ports of Samsun, Derince, Bandırma, and Iskenderun. So far,
despite strong evidence of Russian crimes and official appeals from
Ukraine, Turkish authorities have remained silent on these cases. These
moves]{.underline} [by Turkey don't just undermine its credibility as a
mediator between Ukraine and Russia but also raise questions about
Ankara's geopolitical choices in a broader regional and transatlantic
framework]{.underline}. As it leans toward Russia in a bid for stability
at home, Turkey risks finding itself estranged from the West and aligned
with a pariah state on the international arena. The Ukrainian case will
become a major test for Turkey. Whether Ankara prefers to use it to
bridge the gaps with the West or to burn the bridges remains to be seen.

#### Anti-western sentiment [ties]{.underline} Russia and Turkey together--NATO recentralization [wrecks]{.underline} this relationship

[The war in Ukraine is set to]{.underline} increase the pressure on
Turkey's balancing policy, shed light on the role of anti-Westernism in
Ankara-Moscow relations, and [**reshape Tur­key's relations with Russia
and the West**.]{.underline} The balancing policy will face a less
permissive environment. However, a rupture in Turkey-Russia relations is
not to be expected. Given the prohibitive cost of a breakdown, Ankara
will strive to maintain functional bilateral relations with Moscow. More
broadly, despite the changed con­text, Turkey will continue to seek
autonomy in its foreign and security policy. This quest precedes the
balancing policy and was not driven solely by discontent with the West.
It was also informed by Turkey's reading of the global order becoming
more multipolar and less Western-centric. In spite of similarities in
their narratives, the Turkish and Russian anti-Westernisms manifest
themselves differently in policy terms. Finally, Russia's geopolitical
revisionism is set to drive Turkey and the West relatively closer
together in matters geopolitical and strategic, provided that Turkey's
current blockage of Sweden and Finland's NATO membership bid is resolved
in the not too distant future. [The pace and depth of developments in
Turkish-Russian relations since 2016 has been intriguing. **Discontent
with the West has been a major driver for rapidly improv­ing ties.** In
fact, one could argue that it was anti-Westernism that created Turkey's
geo­political balancing policy between Russia and the West]{.underline},
coupled with the understand­ing that a multipolar global order was in the
making. The close relationship with Russia has led to further rifts
between Tur­key and the West. However, despite their shared discontent
with the West, Russian and Turkish anti-Westernism differ in nature,
origin and manifestation. Turkish anti-Westernism tends to be selective
and policy-focused, whereas the Russian version is more structural and
encompassing. For instance, Russian For­eign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke
of ending US and western dominance of the inter­national system as the
core goal of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Unlike Russia, Turkey also
benefits from the Western-centric inter­national system it criticises.
These differences carry major policy implications. The invasion of
Ukraine has also injected a whole set of new dynamics into the
Turkey-Russia-West triangle. [Ankara's geopolitical balancing policy is
now entering **difficult terrain**, if not becoming unfeasible, as NATO
and the West treat Russia explicitly as an enemy.]{.underline} The cost
of such a policy is likely to increase. But even if balancing became
unfeasible, Ankara would still strive to maintain some form of
function­ing bilateral relationship with Moscow. Geopolitical Balancing
Policy and Functional Bilateral Relations The major difference between
Turkey's geopolitical balancing policy and its quest to maintain
functional bilateral relations with Russia is the scope of cooperation.
A functional bilateral relationship meant cultivating economic, energy
and political ties, but did not extend into the strategic realms of
geopolitical and defence industry cooperation. Geopolitical balancing
in­volves strategic cooperation, military pro­curement (purchasing the
Russian S‑400 air defence system), and geopolitical engagement in
conflict zones in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh. [The **balancing
policy is driven by discontent with the West** and rests on a particular
reading of global poli­tics, which Ankara sees becoming increas­ingly
multipolar and less Western-centric (if not post-Western). It has also
been informed by Ankara's assessment that the **West lacks internal
cohesion**, seeing signs of fragmentation between Europe and the United
States]{.underline} (especially during the Trump presidency) and within
Europe post-Brexit.

#### Russia-Turkey relations are key to Turkish economy--the ties are deepening now [BUT]{.underline} investment in NATO leaves Turkey in its most vulnerable state

'Extremely vulnerable' [Turkey's "economic crisis" is the "most
important factor in its calculations"]{.underline}, Howard Eissenstat, a
Turkey expert at St. Lawrence University in New York state and the
Middle East Institute in Washington DC, put it to FRANCE 24. The Turkish
lira lost 47 percent of its value over the past year, as prices soared
by over 54 percent. This 20-year inflation high marked a new nadir in
the currency crisis wracking Turkey since 2018, a crisis experts blame
on Erdogan's belief -- contrary to all economic evidence -- that higher
interest rates cause inflation. [Turkey does not want to "antagonise
Russia"]{.underline}, Eissenstat noted, because it **[is "extremely
vulnerable to a loss of Russian wheat, gas and oil"]{.underline}**.
[Russia is in effect a **vital trading partner** for the beleaguered
Turkish economy, providing **45 percent of its natural gas** and a
**colossal 70 percent of its wheat**. The latter is an especially
high-priority import, seeing as escalating bread prices are a major
source of discontent in Turkey. **Russia is** also **Turkey's biggest
source of tourists**, with its 4.7 million visitors accounting for 19
percent of all travellers to the country in 2021.]{.underline}
'Competitive co-operation' Historically, Turkey and Russia have a track
record of antagonising each other, most notably when the clashing
geostrategic manoeuvrings of Tsarist Russia and the Ottoman Empire saw
them fight on more than 10 occasions from the sixteenth century to the
twentieth century. At the outset of the Cold War, Kemalist Turkey's
axiomatic anti-communism and pro-Western ethos prompted it to join NATO
and host US nuclear missiles, a major source of Soviet vexation until
they were removed after the Cuban Missile Crisis. The most recent
Russo-Turkish diplomatic crisis flared in 2015, when Turkey shot down a
Russian jet near the Syrian border. But a formal apology from Erdogan
soon ended Moscow's retaliatory sanctions -- inaugurating a rapid thaw
in relations that weathered Russia and Turkey backing opposing sides in
the Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh wars. This recent paradigm in
Russo-Turkish relations is best described as "competitive co-operation",
the German Marshall Fund's Unluhisarcikli said, in which supporting
rival forces abroad "doesn't prevent them from cooperating in the fields
of energy and trade". A year on from that swiftly resolved spat with
Russia, a dramatic coup attempt sparked a pervasive crackdown as Ankara
held responsible Islamic cleric Fetullah Gulen and his movement.
Erdogan's government felt the West was not supportive enough after this
would-be putsch. Thus the [failed coup set the stage for Turkey-Russia
ties to deepen]{.underline}, explained Reilly Barry, a Turkey researcher
at Harvard University. Following the putsch attempt, Russian President
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} "successfully [sowed more seeds of doubt
into Erdogan's mind that the West is not his ultimate protector and
security assurance, and achieved his desired effect to create a wedge
among NATO allies when Turkey purchased the S-400 missile system from
Russia, a major red line for a NATO country to cross]{.underline}\",
Barry told FRANCE 24. "So, the Turkish government has formulated a
stance on seeing Russia as a potential major power protector in cases
when Western relations and alliances do not suit Turkey's best
interests." In this context, "having been close with Russia and Putin
lately more so than at any other time in recent history, **[it would
make Turkey extremely vulnerable to be condemning Russia in the language
that the US and Western European countries are]{.underline}**", Barry
continued. "It is also important to remember the US and other countries
do not share a sea with Russia and are not only separated by one other
country \[Georgia\]," she added.

The second scenario, called Mayhem and Chaos, is the opposite of the

others discuss turning off the valves. We need to take our steps with
this sensitivity in mind," he said, adding that Turkish officials are
currently in contact with Russian counterparts to arrange a meeting.
["We will continue phone diplomacy and I hope we achieve favorable

Turkey\'s stance regarding Ukraine\'s territorial integrity to Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a recent phone call and that Turkey
does not accept any actions violating the Minsk agreements. \"I told him
that we are ready to undertake the responsibility to ensure that the

the ongoing tensions pose a threat to security in the Black Sea. \"Our

only instrument left to display a common stance. "In this
videoconference meeting, NATO needs to decide on its stance and do
whatever necessary," Erdoğan said, adding that no troops have been sent
to Ukraine so far, but Russia has amassed soldiers near the Ukrainian
border. "Of course, you don't need to be an oracle to know what's coming
in the face of this picture," Erdoğan said, adding that Turkey will
display its final stance regarding the issue after the meeting. However,
the president highlighted that Turkey has already sided with Ukraine
regarding Russia's annexation of Crimea and Putin's recent recognition
by rejecting it for violating Ukraine's territorial integrity. [NATO
member Turkey, which shares a maritime border with both Ukraine and
Russia in the Black Sea, has good ties with both its neighbors and has
offered to mediate the crisis, while warning Moscow against invading

defense and energy, Turkey has opposed Moscow's policies in Syria and
Libya, as well as its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. It
has also sold sophisticated drones to Ukraine, angering
Russia.]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed

#### Ukraine war escalation goes [nuclear]{.underline}

**Brookes 3/31** (Peter Brookes, Senior Research Fellow, Center for
National Defense, Peter researches and develops Heritage's policy on
weapons of mass destruction and counter proliferation, Mar 31st, 2022,
How Russia Might Deploy Nukes in Ukraine War,
https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/how-russia-might-deploy-nukes-ukraine-war//RM)

With Russian forces struggling mightily to subjugate Ukraine in the face
of incredible resistance from both the Ukrainian army and ordinary
citizens, observers are concerned about the Kremlin escalating the war
with the use of nuclear weapons. At this point, it's arguably "low
risk," but it's not "no risk." [Moscow could certainly decide to move
the war from conventional to nuclear at any time. As such, we must take
the threat of the use of Russian nuclear weapons very seriously, surveil
it intensely, and prepare for the possibility of a nuclear
event.]{.underline} But under what circumstances might Russia use a nuke
against Ukraine---or as part of the Ukraine conflict? Dmitry Medvedev,
former Russian president and current deputy chairman of the Russian
Security Council, outlined Moscow's policy on using nuclear weapons in
an interview Saturday, according to The Guardian: [Number one is the
situation when Russia is struck by a nuclear missile. The second case is
any use of other nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies. The third
is an attack on a critical infrastructure that will have paralyzed our
nuclear deterrent forces, and the fourth case is when an act of
aggression is committed against Russia and its allies, which jeopardized
the existence of the country itself, even without the use of nuclear
weapons, that is, with the use of conventional weapons.]{.underline}
That's relatively clear, but that's not all. [Russia also has a
secretive "escalate to deescalate" doctrine for the use of nuclear
weapons that Medvedev didn't mention---unsurprisingly---in that list of
four conditions. This unspoken possibility is perhaps the most likely
scenario of all. Let's face it: The war isn't going well for Vladimir
Putin & Co. What the Kremlin thought would be a three-day dash to Kyiv
has turned into a monthlong slog, which has seen Russian forces losing
general officers, troops, and equipment at an alarming
rate.]{.underline} The outcome---once thought to overwhelmingly favor
Moscow---is up for grabs. That state of affairs doesn't bode well for
the Kremlin and its cronies. Even authoritarian leaders care about
public opinion at home and the effect it might have on the regime's
control over the country. [Losing the war in Ukraine would have
repercussions on Russia internationally, too, including significant
reputational costs, likely diplomatic pariah status, punishing economic
costs, and a demoralized, depleted military. In other words, losing in
Ukraine will be plenty painful for Putin and his pals---and this is
when, unfortunately, the use of nuclear weapons potentially comes into
play for the Russians. Indeed, Putin might use a nuke (or more) in an
(as yet unproven) "escalate to deescalate" plan for advancing Russia's
unjust goals in Ukraine.]{.underline} Although there is debate about the
effectiveness of using a nuke on the battlefield in Ukraine,
alternatively Russia could pop off a low-yield, tactical (aka
battlefield) nuke over an unpopulated area, or even the Arctic Ocean.
The point would be to send a clear signal to the U.S., NATO, and others
who are supporting the Ukrainian political and military resistance that
their backing must end---immediately. [If they choose otherwise, the
risk would be that Moscow might escalate from a single, low-yield
battlefield nuke over an unpopulated territory to high-yield theater or
intercontinental-range nukes targeting populated areas in these
countries.]{.underline} The Kremlin might calculate that Ukraine's
supporters (e.g., NATO) don't have the political will to risk a wider
conflict or chance a move up the nuclear-escalation ladder. Ukraine's
backers---and Ukraine itself---would have to make some fateful choices.
[Using the "escalate to deescalate" nuclear stratagem, Moscow
potentially could force any number of advantageous political and
military outcomes to the war in Ukraine, including a victory that avoids
the unpleasantries of a loss.]{.underline} Of course, the use of a
nuclear weapon in war for the first time since World War II is a
troubling idea to contemplate. But we must understand that the Russian
political and military playbook includes pages on the use of nukes.
[Consequently, we must consider Russia's use of nuclear weapons a real
possibility, monitor the movement of Russian nuclear forces with vigor,
and prepare for making the tough choices that the possibility of a
nuclear event would bring.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- UQ

#### Russia-Turkey relations are [high now]{.underline}--BUT they are on the brink

**The European Institute for International Law and International
Relations, 7-5**-20**22**, \"How do Russia and Turkey manage to maintain
a privileged relationship despite their differences on many issues?,\"
European Institute for International Law and International Relations,
https://www.eiir.eu/international-relations/europe/how-do-russia-and-turkey-manage-to-maintain-a-privileged-relationship-despite-their-differences-on-many-issues///DS

First of all[, **the good personal chemistry between the two**
presidents plays its role. Putin and Erdogan are both adepts of speaking
frankly, and they present this as an asset in inter-state relations,
making it possible to overcome differences and blockages.]{.underline}
In fact, each time the different stands they have on Syria, Armenia,
NATO, Libya... threatened to reach the point of crisis[, the two heads
of state met or spoke to each other, finding an agreement to overcome it
while acknowledging the persistent disagreements. **Erdogan and Putin
also agree on the way they treat opposition** in their respective
countries, which is brutal to say the least.]{.underline} They both also
agree on the strongman image they intend to project, both internally and
on the international scene. A turning point in the closeness between the
two presidents was Putin's expressed support for Erdogan after the
failed coup in 2016, while Western countries, for their part, criticized
the massive repression that followed that event in Turkey. What role
does [the West]{.underline} play in the current convergence between
Moscow and Ankara? This [is another major point of convergence between
the two countries.]{.underline} Wether one sees it negatively or
positively, and with obviously very different historical contexts, [both
countries consider that the West has refused their will of cooperation
and integration. They also believe that their Western partners have
ignored their security interests as they see them. For example, on the
Kurdish question for Turkey, the enlargement of NATO for
Russia.]{.underline} Turkey, like Russia, is interested in the idea of a
less Western-centric multipolar world, in which regional powers see
their role enhanced. But the anti-Western posture is clearly more
structural in the case of Russia (which sees itself as a global power)
than in the case of Turkey (who wants to extend its influence but on
different regional scales). Thus, for Russia we are dealing with
questions of principle, of world vision. For Turkey we are probably
dealing with something more situational, more fluid because it is more
negotiable, and this can constitute a fragility in the bilateral
relationship. This is perhaps why [the Russians have been keen, over the
last decade, to involve Turkey in economic cooperations that have a
strategic scope, creating long-term dependence (nuclear, energy...). The
rejection of Western policies is ultimately a common objective. Syria,
Libya, the Caucasus -- topics where the interests of Ankara and Moscow
are far from fully converging. But the one objective of marginalizing
Western countries, and showing the decline of their authority on the
international scene reconcile them.]{.underline} During the
Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in 2020, the Minsk group (of which France and
the United States are co-chairs with Russia) was not very active and the
ceasefire agreement was steered exclusively by Russia and consultations
with Turkey. Considering the tensions with the Europeans in the eastern
Mediterranean, Turkey sees it as useful to be able to display a capacity
for coordination with Russia. As for Moscow, it likes to emphasize the
spirit of cooperation that governs its relations with Ankara in the
Black Sea. Turkey has positioned itself in the Black Sea as a littoral
power tending to oppose the plans of Alliance members who are pushing
for a stronger NATO presence. This, of course, suits Russia. Turkey has
developed its relations with Kiev, affirming its support for the
territorial integrity of Ukraine, condemning the annexation of Crimea
and developing Ukrainian-Turkish arms projects. What impact does the war
in Ukraine have on relations between Russia and Turkey? Before the war,
Russian officials have repeatedly denounced the arms cooperation between
Turkey and Ukraine. Turkey also participated in the first summit of the
"Crimea Platform", initiated by Ukraine August 2021, in Kiev. As long as
this policy is not explicitly part of a NATO strategy towards Ukraine,
Moscow can accept the development of Ukrainian-Turkish ties. But when
Russia complained, before the war in Ukraine, about the development of
cooperation between the latter and the Nato countries, and if it was
mainly aimed at the role of the Americans or the British, it also had in
mind the Turkish drones. For the moment, [**Turkey gives the impression
of remaining in its posture of Russia-West balance** : it condemns the
invasion, it closes the straits to warships, but it does not take
sanctions against Russia, continues to work with it in the economic
field, and seeks to pose as a mediator.]{.underline} Everything depends
on what Turkey wants to do with the opportunity that the war in Ukraine
potentially represents for it: continue its game of balance between the
West and the Russians as in recent years; or repair its relations with
its NATO allies? It seems that the first option prevails at this stage
-- let's not forget that Turkey is very dependent on Russia economically
(energy, tourism...). It seems to want to make its usefulness known to
the various players in the context of this war, which is upsetting many
balances, and to gain an additional regional and international aura from
it (and to make people forget its economic crisis?). To what extent does
the desire to expand their respective influences constitute limits to
their political and economic cooperation? So far, [the two actors are
playing in the same arena, sometimes with more or less serious
friction]{.underline}. But their order of priorities is different. For
Turkey, it is the Middle East and the Mediterranean, while Russia's
foreign policy remains focused on maintaining its weight in the
ex-Soviet space. [This could change if Turkey were to become more
enterprising in this space that Russia claims as its sphere of
influence. Moscow is keeping a tight rein on Ankara's desire to develop
its presence in Central Asia in the name of historical, linguistic and
cultural kinship.]{.underline} Above all, with the war in Ukraine, one
wonders if Turkey, a member of NATO, will be able to continue for long
on its line of a transactional attitude in which it plays the Russian
card in its negotiations with its Western partners, and the anti-Western
card in its power relations with Moscow. [Correct **relations with
Turkey are perceived in Moscow as an asset** in relation to several
major strategic issues.]{.underline} The impression has often been given
that Turkey is more or less leading the game. Meaning, on the
international stage, and in particular in its relations with Western
countries and some of its neighbors, Russia has not exactly shown
flexibility lately, with an often offensive, if not aggressive,
behaviour. In this context, [the manifest effort of Russian diplomacy to
find points of agreement with a Turkey that does not hesitate to impose
its pace and its interests offers a striking contrast! This is because
correct relations with Turkey are perceived in Moscow as an asset in
relation to several major strategic issues.]{.underline} The Black
Sea-Mediterranean stage is a key issue. Russia proceeds by priorities :
[Turkey is not a convenient partner in Syria]{.underline} (where it
tends to take advantage, at present, of the Russian withdrawal linked to
the war in Ukraine), [but this is acceptable, as long as it remains on
the right line in the Black Sea, an arch-strategic zone for Moscow.
However, **one of the** **major objectives of Russian foreign policy**
in recent **years has been to divide by all means the NATO alliance**,
which it sees as strong militarily but weak politically.]{.underline}
Hence the efforts to quickly complete the contract for the sale of the
S-400 anti-aircraft system. One of the reasons why Ankara worked to
improve its relationship with Moscow was probably its perception that
its Western allies would not necessarily be of much help in the event of
a problem with Russia, and that it was therefore necessary to manage and
stabilize this relationship as best as possible in autonomy. Regardless
the extremely controversial democratic system reigning in Turkey, this
is more "looking out for themselves" behaviour than "challenging NATO"
behaviour.

are still meaningful differences between the West on the one side, and
Russia and other oligarchical authoritarian states on the other ---
despite the emergence of Trump and other conservative-nationalist

misleading to speak of a new Cold War, there does appear to be a new
ideological divide emerging between Russia and the West that has a clear
national security dimension. If this continues over the coming decade,
Turkey will face the same question as during the Cold War: Which side is
it on? [In light of the transformations that have occurred in the
**Turkish foreign policy elite**, it seems much more likely for Turkey

power,111 Turkey as a formidable regional power. And there are also
significant push factors in Turkey's relations with the West. [Unless

President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Tuesday that [**attempts to

order for what he called a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.
Sixty one years to the day since the Soviet Union\'s Yuri Gagarin
blasted off into the history books by becoming the first man in space,
Putin travelled to the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia\'s Far East, 3,450
miles (5550 km) east of Moscow. [\"The sanctions were total, the
isolation was complete but the Soviet Union was still first in
space,\"]{.underline} Putin said, according to Russian state television.
[\"**We don\'t intend to be isolated**,\" Putin said. \"**It is
impossible to severely isolate anyone in the modern world - especially

successes such as Gagarin\'s flight and the 1957 launch of Sputnik 1,
the first artificial satellite from earth, have a particular pertinence
for Russia: both events shocked the United States. [The launch of
Sputnik 1 prompted the United States to create NASA in a bid to catch up
with Moscow.]{.underline} Putin says the \"special military operation\"
in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to
threaten Russia - including via the NATO military alliance - and that
Moscow had to defend Russian-speaking people in Ukraine from
persecution. He said on Tuesday that the had no doubts Russia would
achieve all of its objectives in Ukraine - a conflict he cast as both
inevitable and essential to defend Russia in the long term. \"Its goals
are absolutely clear and noble,\" Putin said. \"It\'s clear that we
didn\'t have a choice. It was the right decision.\" [Ukrainian forces
have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping
sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

the biggest fall in gross domestic product since the years following the
1991 fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}, former finance minister

SC)

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has **upended the geopolitical
calculations** of countries around the world. For Turkey, a NATO member
that has **performed a delicate balancing act between Kyiv and Moscow**,
the war is forcing some hard choices.]{.underline} Like his World War
II-era predecessor Ismet Inonu, [Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan
seeks to keep Turkey out of today's conflict as much as possible, while
maximizing his own room to maneuver.]{.underline} Amid the escalating
conflict and humanitarian disaster, however, Ankara faces growing
pressure to pick sides. Turkey faces a range of vulnerabilities from
either an emboldened or a desperate Russia. **[Erdogan's strategy
therefore centers on supporting Ukraine without jeopardizing ties with
Moscow.]{.underline}** Over the longer term, the course of the war
itself will do much to determine how Ankara maintains this balancing
act. Strong, unified NATO support for Ukraine, along with Russian
military setbacks, would provide the best opportunity to reinforce
Ankara's commitment to Ukraine---and to the alliance. Russia and Turkey
have for centuries been rivals across a wide geographic space
encompassing the Balkans, the Caucasus, the Black Sea, and Central Asia.
[Vulnerability to Russian military power throughout these regions has
encouraged Turkish leaders to seek allies:]{.underline} Britain and
France in the Crimean War, Germany in World War I, and NATO in the Cold
War. When the international environment has been less threatening,
though, [Turkey has looked to Russia (and the Soviet Union) for economic
opportunities and as a partner for boosting its own strategic
autonomy.]{.underline} The Soviet Union's collapse created a series of
buffer states (including Ukraine) that shielded Turkey from Russian
military power, allowing Ankara to pursue a more forward-leaning policy
in Eurasia. It also opened up new opportunities for Turkish companies in
Russia, which became a major source of tourists to Turkey's
Mediterranean resorts as well as a lucrative market for exporters and
construction companies (many with close ties to Erdogan's Justice and
Development Party). Turkey also turned to Russia for energy, at one
point getting the majority of its natural gas from Russia, and signing a
deal with Russia's state-owned Rosatom to build Turkey's first nuclear
power plant at Akkuyu. [**Ties with Russia also allowed Ankara to hedge
against what it perceived to be excessive dependence on the West amid
tensions over Washington's role in the Syrian conflict.** Erdogan's
purchase of the Russian-made S-400 air defense system after he was
unable to strike a deal with the United States for the Patriot system
sent a message to Turkey's NATO allies that Ankara had other
options.]{.underline} Some voices in Turkish political and military
circles would like to go further, seeing Russia's pursuit of a
non-Western security order in Eurasia as preferable to continued
dependence on NATO. Improved relations with Moscow also reflected a
growing closeness between Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin,
who was the first foreign leader to call Erdogan after the failed 2016
coup attempt, and whose strongman rule contrasted with mounting U.S. and
European criticism over Turkey's democratic backsliding. Russia and
Turkey nevertheless remain geopolitical rivals. Their forces and proxies
have clashed repeatedly---in Syria, Libya, and the South Caucasus. In
February 2020, Russian forces (or Russian-backed Syrian forces) bombed
Turkish positions near Idlib, Syria, killing over 30 Turkish soldiers.
Nor was Russia the only target of Turkey's Eurasian outreach. [Ukraine
is also important to Turkey as both an economic and a geopolitical
partner. Trade between the two countries has increased
rapidly]{.underline} since Ukraine's 2013-2014 Revolution of Dignity,
reaching \$7.4 billion in 2021. Ankara and Kyiv also signed a free trade
agreement on the eve of the most recent Russian invasion. Since 2019,
Turkey has also supplied Ukraine with military assistance, notably the
Bayraktar TB2 armed drones that were instrumental in Azerbaijan's
victory over Russian ally Armenia in Nagorno-Karabakh and that have
inflicted significant casualties on Russian-backed forces in both Libya
and the Donbass. During Erdogan's visit to Kyiv at the start of
February, the two countries agreed to set up a factory to produce drones
inside Ukraine. Turkey's security is much better served by an
independent Ukraine than a Ukraine under Russian military-political
domination. Further territorial changes at Ukraine's expense would allow
Moscow to bolster its naval presence along the northern Black Sea coast.
(Russia's post-2014 militarization of Crimea has already tipped the
balance of power in the Black Sea against Turkey.) While the bulk of
refugees fleeing Ukraine have so far gone westward, a longer conflict
could also send refugee flows to Turkey, a country still struggling with
the effects of large-scale migration from Middle Eastern conflicts.
Turkey also remains susceptible to Russian retaliation. Despite some
diversification in recent years and new offshore discoveries, Turkey is
dependent on Russia for the bulk of its gas and a significant percentage
of its oil. With Turkey's inflation likely to be above 40 percent for
the year, turbulence in energy markets could have damaging effects not
just on Turkey's economy but on Erdogan's political fortunes ahead of
elections next year. Even with its military tied down in Ukraine, Russia
retains the capacity to hit back at Turkish interests. Idlib remains a
particular liability, packed as it is with refugees and a motley
collection of rebels who would likely flee for the Turkish border in the
event of an offensive on the city. [Because of all this, and because its
relationship with Moscow is important to Erdogan's larger geopolitical
ambitions, **Turkish support for Ukraine has been real---but
cautious.**]{.underline} On the first day of the conflict, Erdogan
characterized the Russian attack as "unacceptable" and "contrary to
international law." Turkey has since reiterated long-standing
commitments to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity
(including Crimea, the annexation of which Ankara has insisted it will
never recognize). Yet [many Turkish statements during the first week or
so of the conflict lacked the moral clarity of those from its Western
counterparts, instead **calling on both Russia and Ukraine to find a
diplomatic solution.**]{.underline} With the conflict worsening and
Western unity holding, Ankara grew slightly bolder. In a March 6
telephone call with Putin, Erdogan called for a cease-fire, the opening
of a humanitarian corridor, and a peace agreement. Turkey has also
continued to supply both humanitarian assistance and military equipment
to Ukraine. Perhaps its most visible contribution has been continuing to
supply drones to Ukraine---deflecting Russian criticism with the
disingenuous claim that such sales are purely private transactions. At
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's request, Turkey also agreed to
invoke the 1936 Montreux Convention, which allows Ankara to regulate the
passage of warships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits---the
first time since World War II it has done so. The decision required a
formal determination that the Russia-Ukraine conflict qualified as a
war---thereby rejecting Putin's description of a "special military
operation." Effectively, the decision to invoke Montreux means that
Turkey can prevent Russia from reinforcing its naval forces already
present in the Black Sea with ships based outside the Black Sea. (The
bulk of Russia's navy remains engaged in the Eastern Mediterranean off
Syria.) Particularly if the conflict drags on, closure of the straits
could degrade Moscow's naval and amphibious capabilities. [Still,
**Turkey's rhetoric remains cautious**, and it continues its policy of
engagement with Moscow. **Erdogan has spoken with Putin on multiple
occasions** since the start of the war, and Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov is set to attend the Antalya Diplomacy Forum in Turkey
later this week, where he plans to meet his Ukrainian counterpart,
Dmytro Kuleba.]{.underline}

The article mainly contends that since [the real and expected benefits
from the European Union (EU) and NATO were not delivered sufficiently
from Turkey's perspective, **Turkey looked for alternatives and
collaborated with Russia more intensely in recent years.** Turkey's
cooperation with Russia was also facilitated by several global,
political, economic, conjectural, security-related, and individual-level
factors.]{.underline} Another argument of the study is that despite
Turkey's intensive collaboration with Russia, it is not feasible for
Turkey to build a strategic partnership with it in the short- and
medium-term at the expense of its relations with NATO and the EU. The
main reasons for this are, in addition to the institutional and social
shortcomings, geostrategic divergences, Russia's inadequacy as an
economic actor, the pitfalls of an asymmetric relationship with Russia,
the security risks posed by Russia, NATO's continuing importance for
Turkey's security needs, and the incompatibility of Russia's and
Turkey's political systems. Keywords: EU; NATO; Russia; strategic
partnership; Turkish foreign policy Introduction [The arrival of the
Russian S-400 air defence system in Turkey in July 2019 was welcomed
enthusiastically by many in Turkey. This breakthrough event was even
described by some in Turkey as the **"country's liberation from the
West"**]{.underline} (Tol and Taşpınar 2019, 107). Almost a decade ago,
the question started to be asked as to whether Turkey was drifting away
from the West, especially since it had approached Iran and voted against
sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme in the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC) as well as clashed with Israel over the Mavi
Marmara incident in 2010. This time, however, this question is more
pronounced and the likelihood of a strategic shift became more tangible
with the arrival of a weapon system from a country that has been
confronting the West recently. [Given that Turkey's relations with the
United States and the European Union (EU) have been at a nadir in recent
years, **many regarded the acquisition of the Russian weapon system as a
precursor of Turkey's withdrawal** from the North Atlantic Alliance
(North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO)]{.underline} and the EU. In
addition to many other factors, [Moscow's and Ankara's bitter relations
with the West are a major reason why the two countries have closed ranks
in recent years.]{.underline} A milestone for Moscow's relationship with
the West was its annexation of Crimea in March 2014 while the coup plot
against the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi,
AKP) government in Turkey in July 2016 marked a watershed in Ankara's
relations with the West. Russia had to confront a series of economic
sanctions from the West after 2014 while Turkey was deeply disappointed
with its Western allies for their slow and reluctant condemnation of the
coup attempt. Ankara has even aired doubts that the West might have been
behind the coup attempt. [These events have helped peak the two
countries' deeply-ingrained sense of distrust towards the West. As one
observer put, "Despite their obvious differences and even antagonisms,
**Russia and Turkey are united by one thing---the fact that they are two
great powers connected historically, culturally, and geographically to a
Europe that never fully accepted them as one of their
own"**]{.underline} (Lukyanov, People with Big Ambitions, The Moscow
Times, 19 July 2016). A major objective of this article is to unpack the
puzzle of whether Russia could replace the EU and NATO as a strategic
partner for Turkey. The article contends that in addition to some
factors facilitating the Russo--Turkish rapprochement[, Turkey searched
for alternatives, collaborating with Russia owing to the decline in the
real and expected benefits from the EU and NATO from the Turkish
perspective.]{.underline} Another major contention of this article is
that despite the close collaboration between Moscow and Ankara, in
particular after the coup attempt against the Turkish Government in July
2016, it is hard for Turkey to forge a strategic partnership with Russia
because of significant divergent geostrategic interests, Russia's
inadequacy as an economic actor, the downsides of an asymmetric
relationship with Russia, the security risks posed by Russia, the
continuing importance of NATO for Turkey's security as well as the
incompatibility of Turkey's and Russia's political systems. Moreover,
the absence of a solid social basis and the lack of institutionalization
in their relations further make it infeasible for Turkey to switch from
the Transatlantic Alliance to Russia. The study is divided into three
sections. The first part concerns the motives that brought Moscow and
Ankara together, including, first and foremost, their strained
relationship with the West, economic interests, conjectural factors such
as the Syrian conflict, transformation of the global governance system,
and similarity of their political culture based on security and personal
harmony between the leaders. The second part draws attention to the
limitations in the relationship, and the third part explains why a
strategic partnership between Turkey and Ankara and at the expense of
Turkey's partnership with the EU and NATO is not feasible in the
foreseeable future. Finally, the conclusion wraps up the article.

banks",
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214845018304010#!//BVN>
SC)

In this paper, [we aim to analyze **the impact of the Turkish lira
currency shock** on the stock returns of 29 major banks in
Europe.]{.underline} Literature after the global economic crisis of
2008, deals mostly with the financial spillovers of shocks in the US or
Europe to emerging markets rather than vice versa and on a macro level
(Stracca, 2014; Kim, Kim, & Lee, 2015; Chen, Filardo and Zhu, 2016;
Fadejava, Feldkircher, & Reininger, 2017; Fratzscher, Duca and Straub,
2016). As a result, we look at data on some of the largest banks in
Europe from both high and low risk economies. Our results illustrate the
investors\' sentiment of how resilient banks would be to possible bank
defaults with spillover effects. **[The stocks of the overall banking
sample react negatively to the crisis in Turkey and results indicate
that banks that recently increased their leverage or experienced a
decrease in liquidity or profitability have also been subject to higher
abnormal losses on the event day and a day after the event, where the
losses in general were the most severe.]{.underline}** Nevertheless,
leverage, liquidity and performance ratios are by themselves not
sufficient to assess the financial soundness of banks, since the risk is
more related to the quality than the quantity of the assets they carry.
Across countries, [we find Greece, Italy and Spain, the three economies
of PIIGS analyzed in this paper, to be significantly related to the
Turkish currency shock. Banks of Greece show **the highest abnormal
losses**, which indicates that geographical proximity can be a factor in
speculative attacks and/or crisis spillovers.]{.underline} Moreover,
[banks located in countries with lower systematic risk such as Germany,
Netherlands and France **react strongly to the Turkish lira
crisis**.]{.underline} Therefore, investors do not appear sensitive to
whether a bank is operating in a less or more healthy banking system. In
addition, losses of banks are not necessarily proportionate to the size
of their exposures, with the exception of Turkish banks, which have been
the most vulnerable. Spanish and Italian banks, which carry the largest
amount of loans extended to Turkey do not seem to display the highest
abnormal losses among the European banks. [German banks, on the other
hand, have no subsidiaries in Turkey and their claims are small relative
to their capital (2.4%) and yet they disclose **significant abnormal
losses**.]{.underline} In fact, the underlying risk resulting from
banks\' exposures to Turkey is difficult to assess, as there are many
indirect factors that might influence the operation of banks such as

Russia's atrocities against Ukrainian civilians and its escalated
warfare in southeastern Ukraine have swept aside last month's public
discussion of peace options as the countries briefly held talks in
Turkey. [Yet even in the darkest moments, all sides in this war,
including the United States and Europe, have strong interests in
maintaining channels for negotiation that can be used when opportunity
re-emerges. Protecting that interest means understanding and maintaining
Turkey's role in facilitating talks---and its potential to serve more
actively as a mediator.]{.underline} By at least some norms of peace
processes, [Turkey is an atypical mediator---but policymakers would do
well to note strengths, not widely recognized, that it can bring to this
role. While analysts have suggested China, Israel, India and others as
possible mediators---and while no options should be ignored---Turkey has
emerged as the most immediately useful go-between. It is no accident
that Turkey was Kyiv's and Moscow's preferred choice for their brief
attempts at negotiations in March. By design, Turkey's role in those
talks was limited to facilitation, providing a secure space and
even-handed treatment of Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, but without
injecting Turkish observations or proposals]{.underline}. Particularly
for Russia, Turkey can seem like an illogical choice as mediator. It is
not neutral between the combatants, but rather is a member of NATO,
which Russia's government has declared an enemy. Turkey has supported
Ukraine with humanitarian gestures, evacuating some 16,000 civilians
from combat zones and receiving nearly 60,000 Ukrainian refugees so far.
It has even sold Turkish-built, armed, aerial drones that Ukrainians
have deployed against Russian ground offensives. Also, Russia and Turkey
have had their own conflicts, both historically and in recent years.
[Yet part of Turkey's utility as an interlocutor for Russia may be some
of these very qualities. Any eventual Russian-Ukrainian agreement will
need acceptance---and likely, reconstruction funds---from the United
States and Europe. As a NATO member, Turkey can offer influence with its
U.S. and European allies in securing that support. Turkey has built
credibility by developing a specific capacity for mediation over recent
decades, and by showing itself to Russia and Ukraine as an independent
actor that, while a NATO member, is not unduly influenced by the United
States or Europe. Even now, with heightened battlefield violence and
accusatory rhetoric from both sides, Turkey is continuing its go-between
role. Its diplomats are continuing meetings with both sides separately
and keeping lines of communication open. This creates an asset for
managing, and hopefully limiting, the conflict---one that policymakers
should not ignore.]{.underline}

#### Turkey plays a [key role]{.underline} in Ukraine

Turkey is in a unique position to mediate",
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/29/opinions/turkey-mediator-russia-ukraine-dalay/index.html>//RM)

As Russian and Ukrainian delegations arrive Tuesday in Istanbul for
peace talks, Turkey\'s unique political position is under the spotlight.
Could the nation that straddles Europe and the Middle East emerge as
peacemaker? As the war grinds on, a growing list of countries are
exploring the possibility of mediating, stepping in to avert further
bloodshed and the conflict spreading beyond Ukraine\'s borders. [Earlier
this month, Turkey hosted Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers for a
trilateral meeting in its southern city of Antalya. Afterward, the
Turkish foreign minister visited both Moscow and Kyiv. Likewise, Israeli
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett visited Moscow for the same
purpose]{.underline}. And China has signaled readiness for mediation.
Potentially other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates, India or
South Africa, might get in line to broker some kind of resolution.
[Almost all countries that have vied for the mediation role have also
engaged in a strategic balancing act between the West and Russia for
some time. Serving an intermediary role is a way for them to prevent
further catastrophe in the conflict, and project international stature.
But it is also a way for them to avoid making difficult choices the war
might force upon them, such as choosing or tilting toward one side more
clearly.]{.underline} But the list of fence-sitters in the
Russia-Ukraine conflict is not confined to mediators. Many more
countries have chosen to remain \"neutral,\" including Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan and Morocco. The rationale for abstaining differs
between countries, but some reasons cut across. The international system
is changing. And the idea that the world is no longer Western-centric,
and increasingly multipolar, is widespread in the non-Western world. It
informs their policies toward Russia, and toward China as well. [As long
as the dominant narrative of this war is put in a West/NATO versus
Russia dichotomy, it will have little resonance in the non-Western
world. Plus, the fence-sitting approach is also a way of signaling
discontent with the US/Western policy.]{.underline} It was illustrative
that the rulers of the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who depend on the US for
their security, refrained from taking calls from President Joe Biden
earlier this month. This snub was meant to convey their displeasure with
the United States for Washington\'s insufficient support for their
botched Yemen campaign. From food and energy supplies to geopolitical
vulnerabilities, many other factors also define their approach. For
instance, in spite of its close military ties with the US, Egypt depends
heavily on Moscow in terms of its food security. It also closely
cooperates with Russia in Libya, with both supporting the warlord
Khalifa Haftar. (Kyiv accuses Haftar of sending mercenaries to aid
Russia in Ukraine.) Likewise India, in spite of needing the West as a
countervailing force against China, has long maintained close ties with
Moscow; has purchased the Russian-made S-400 missile systems; and has
pursued a policy of balancing between Russia and the West. [ut of all
these countries sitting on the fence and trying to mediate, Turkey has a
unique profile and position. It is a NATO member, an organization for
which Russia and previously the Soviet Union served as raison d\'être or
the foundational threat.]{.underline} Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan has been increasingly castigating the Western-centric
international system. But as a member of many Western institutions,
Turkey is also a beneficiary, and in a sense, part of the geopolitical
West. Meanwhile, Turkey also has maritime borders with both Ukraine and
Russia. Plus, Turkey is Russia\'s largest trade partner in the Middle
East and North Africa region. And it has competed and cooperated with
Russia through conflict zones in Syria, Libya and Nagorno-Karabakh in
recent years. Compared to other contenders for mediation, Turkey has the
highest stakes in this conflict. The war is fundamentally changing the
geopolitics and balance of power in the Black Sea region, and Turkey is
a major Black Sea power. [Turkey will probably play a humanitarian role
soon, too, as the number of refugees \-- already in the millions \--
rises. French President Emanuel Macron\'s announcement that France,
Turkey and Greece will undertake a joint evacuation mission in Mariupol
is a harbinger of a humanitarian role that might become more salient in
Erdogan\'s policy down the road.]{.underline} In spite of its policy of
not provoking Russia, Turkey is simultaneously not pursuing a policy of
equidistance. It sells armed drones to Ukraine, which are exacting
significant losses on Russian targets, and has closed the Turkish
straits to warships. In addition to Russia dominating the Black Sea, it
has a sizable Mediterranean presence where it is deeply involved in
conflicts spots in Syria and Libya. Turkey\'s sea closure will put
pressure on Russian policy in these conflict zones if the war is
prolonged. [Yet unlike other NATO members, Turkey has neither joined the
Western sanctions against Moscow nor closed its airspace to Russia.
Doing so would have probably triggered a Russian veto against Turkey\'s
quest for mediating the conflict. And there are an increasing number of
anti-war Russian activists and pro-Kremlin figures heading to Turkey.
Turkey is basically trying to be pro-Ukraine without becoming too
aggressively anti-Russia. Its capital city, Ankara, is too deeply
exposed to Russia both economically and geopolitically. Russia is
Turkey\'s largest source of tourists, grain imports and
gas.]{.underline} In any case, at this stage, there is not yet any sign
of the West pushing Turkey more strongly in joining the sanction regime
against Moscow. And despite Turkey\'s efforts, the conflict is not ripe
for mediation yet, because Moscow still appears to be hellbent on the
military option. This does not mean that efforts or talks will cease in
this conflict; to the contrary, we are likely to see more. Russia wants
to give the impression it is interested in diplomacy to buy time and
prevent further Western sanctions, but to no avail. No breakthrough
should be expected anytime soon. In spite of this, keeping the idea of a
diplomatic process alive is still important. Plus, the mediation serves
Turkey\'s interests well. It boosts its international stature; turns
Turkey into one of the major centers of diplomacy in this conflict; and
delays some of the difficult decisions that it might face down the road.
hat said, as the war drags on, Turkey\'s previous strategic juggling act
may no longer be feasible, particularly as Russia is now more openly
treated as an enemy of NATO and European security. From imperial Ottoman
times to the present, Turkey and Russia have fought each other 13 times,
but they have also cooperated. In the past, grievances vis-à-vis the
West, or even anti-Westernism, have usually driven them closer to each
other. Now, Russia\'s geopolitical revisionism and Putin\'s dramatic
shift in post-Soviet ambitions will drive an uneasy Turkey closer toward
the West.

intervention in the conflict goes too far. Again on Tuesday, in an
interview with CNN, Putin's chief spokesperson refused to rule out the
use of nuclear arms in the conflict. So far, Biden has sought to dial
down the tensions. The Pentagon has not changed the alert status of U.S.
nuclear forces and military leaders have publicly said they have not
detected Russian actions suggesting they are preparing to use nuclear
weapons. The Pentagon also took the unusual step early in the conflict
of putting off a regularly scheduled test of an intercontinental
ballistic missile to avoid fueling nuclear tensions. Yet as the conflict
drags on, and Russia's conventional forces suffer surprisingly heavy
losses while its economy reels, [the prospect that **Putin might resort

been a chance of mistakes, but I think the chances are much higher,"
said former Sen. Sam Nunn, the longtime chair of the Armed Services

"I think we are in a different era in terms of blunders." It is a
high-wire act confronting Biden as he tries to stiffen the spines of
NATO countries for what is expected to be a long struggle. Allies are
helping Ukraine fend off its bigger aggressor --- including sending more
arms and U.S. troops to defend NATO's eastern borders --- while not
pushing Putin over the edge. Russia invaded Ukraine as cooperation
between Washington and Moscow on nuclear arms control has been
unraveling in recent years. The two countries have walked away from
several treaties to control the deadliest weapons, including one that
outlawed intermediate-range nuclear missiles that could threaten Europe.
The only remaining nuclear pact between the two sides is the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which limits deployed strategic weapons
to 1,550 each. Biden and Putin agreed last year to extend it until 2026.
But the treaty does not cover any of the thousands of smaller, or
"battlefield," nuclear weapons in their respective arsenals, including
at least 2,000 in Russian stockpiles, according to public estimates. Gas

Images The dearth of diplomacy and growing distrust only fuels the risk
of "mushroom clouds appearing on the battlefield," Izumi Nakamitsu,
United Nations high representative for disarmament affairs, warned on
Tuesday. She hearkened back to the numerous instances during the
decades-long standoff between the United States and then-Soviet Union
when the two sides nearly came to nuclear blows. But diplomacy --- and a
good bit of luck --- prevailed. "We are all aware of the close calls and
near-misses," she said at an event hosted by The Stimson Center.
"Unfortunately, I fear we have forgotten many of those difficult
lessons. A simple glance at a headline today can point to how acute
nuclear risks have become." Those concerns are shared across the
spectrum by advocates for nuclear disarmament and those who believe a
more robust U.S. nuclear arsenal is needed to deter adversaries. "I
really am worried here that [the war is going so badly for Putin ... it
raises the possibility of **Putin feeling like he needs to escalate to
win his way out of this conflict**]{.underline}," said Tim Morrison, a
former Trump White House nuclear policy adviser who is now a researcher
at the Hudson Institute, a hawkish think tank. That, he continued, "is
right in the wheelhouse of Russian \[military\] doctrine for a low-yield
nuclear or even chemical \[weapons\] use." Morrison added that he fears
the situation could unravel to the point where Putin is "raising the
ante, climbing the rungs of the escalation ladder to make the point to
NATO 'hey, you guys really need to knock it off with arming the
Ukrainians, I will no longer tolerate this.'" Russia has already
ratcheted up the war with its hypersonic missile launch in Ukraine last
week, and it has also been accused of dropping phosphorus bombs, which
are banned under the Geneva Convention (though using the chemical to
obscure troop movements or illuminate targets is not). "A simple glance
at a headline today can point to how acute nuclear risks have become."
Izumi Nakamitsu, United Nations high representative for disarmament
affairs NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said on Wednesday the
alliance will be assisting Ukraine with specialized equipment in the
event of a Russian attack with chemical, biological or nuclear weapons.
Gottemoeller said she fears that Moscow's use of a tactical nuclear
weapon is a serious possibility. ["Putin is capable of anything," she
said. "He could declare there is an existential threat from a NATO ally
resupplying the Ukrainians." 'You're not going to necessarily know'

Nunn has been sounding the alarm about the threat of an accidental
nuclear exchange as a result of a cyber attack on nuclear
command-and-control systems --- including by malign actors not directly
involved in the conflict who could be confused for a nuclear adversary.
"Third parties, third countries, might interfere in terms of
command-and-control or warning systems," he said of potential hackers.
["Interference in command-and-control could be taken in this kind of
atmosphere as probably a deliberate act."]{.underline} Nunn successfully
lobbied Congress last year to require the Pentagon to conduct a
"failsafe review" of the U.S. nuclear arsenal "to prevent cyber-related
and other risks that could lead to the unauthorized or inadvertent use
of nuclear weapons as the result of an accident, misinterpretation,
miscalculation, terrorism, unexpected technological breakthrough, or
deliberate act." Further complicating the task of U.S. and allied
commanders to decipher Russian intentions, said Morrison, is the fact
that so many Russian battlefield systems are also designed to unleash
both conventional and nuclear or chemical warheads. In other words, it
could be exceedingly difficult to know when the Russian military has
decided to pursue a nuclear option. "One of the problems with Russian
nuclear forces is how many of their systems are dual-capable," Morrison
said. "So you're not going to necessarily know if the S-300 or that
long-range \[missile or artillery\] battery is packing a conventional
warhead or a nuclear one." US Ambassador to UN: \'The world narrowly

Ukrainian officials said their forces had withdrawn from Lysychansk
after fierce fighting to preserve lives from the Russians' relentless
assault[. The slow Russian advance across the region it has targeted
since the invasion began in February has been facilitated by
overwhelming artillery power that has leveled cities and towns and left
a trail of wounded and dead prompting comparisons with the devastation
of World War I in Europe.]{.underline} Russian Defense Minister Sergei
Shoigu said in a statement that Russian troops and pro-Kremlin
separatists of the self-declared Luhansk People's Republic "have
established full control" over Lysychansk "and a number of nearby
settlements." [The Ukrainian military's general staff said Sunday that
Ukrainian forces were forced to withdraw from Lysychansk after waging a
stiff but losing battle.]{.underline} Ukraine had tried to defend
Lysychansk for weeks[. The military said it decided to withdraw
because]{.underline} remaining in the city would bring "[fatal
consequences," given **the Russian forces' "overwhelming advantage**" in
"artillery, aviation, ammunition and personnel."]{.underline} The
decision was "made to save the lives of Ukrainian defenders," according
to a statement posted on Facebook. Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky vowed to return. "If the command of our army withdraws people
from certain points of the front where the enemy has the greatest fire
superiority, in particular this applies to Lysychansk, it means only one
thing: We will return thanks to our tactics, thanks to the increase in
the supply of modern weapons," Zelensky said in his nightly address
Sunday. "Ukraine does not give anything up." The city is a key target in
Russia's battle to capture the Donbas region, the heavily industrialized
area bordering Russia that is partly controlled by separatists loyal to
Moscow. In 2014, they unilaterally established two independent
"republics" in the Donbas region. 'They're in hell': Hail of Russian
artillery tests Ukrainian morale Russian President Vladimir Putin cited
false claims of Ukrainian "genocide" against Russian-speaking residents
there as justification for his invasion. Russia's latest advances in
eastern Ukraine add to creeping doubts among U.S. lawmakers and
observers of the war that the Ukrainian government can stop Putin from
seizing territory. [Optimism sparked by the defeat of his forces in the
battle for Kyiv in the spring has faded as **Russian artillery hammers

takes" to ensure a Russian defeat. "We continue to fight. Unfortunately,
the steel willpower and patriotism are not enough to achieve success ---
**we need the technical resources**,"]{.underline} the Ukrainian
military's statement added. Why is Ukraine's Donbas region a target for
Russian forces? Ukrainian troops withdrew just over a week ago from
Severodonetsk, a city across the Donets River to the east. Russia's
capture of Lysychansk, if confirmed, would be a major victory that gives
its troops clear access to Donetsk, the other region that makes up
Donbas. Biden administration officials say Putin's gains have been
uneven and have come at a significant cost, highlighting the steep death
toll among Russian troops. But Ukrainian forces also are paying a heavy
price, which U.S. military officials rarely acknowledge. Ukraine

Donbas is the primary goal of Moscow's military operation in Ukraine,
after it failed to capture the capital, Kyiv, and other areas in the
initial weeks of the war. [Russian troops and their allies have been
making steady gains in the east, as officials in Kyiv say they are
outgunned and running out of ammunition.]{.underline} Ukrainian Defense
Ministry spokesman Yuriy Sak told the BBC earlier Sunday that Ukraine
controls other cities in Donetsk and argued that "the battle for the
Donbas is not over yet." Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region,
said earlier in the day that in attacking Lysychansk, Russian fighters
used tactics even more brutal than in Severodonetsk to overcome
resistance. Photos showed bombed-out residential buildings in Lysychansk
early Sunday, amid a barrage reminiscent of the destruction of
Severodonetsk. As recently as Saturday, a Russian-backed politician said
Lysychansk was "completely surrounded," but defense officials in Ukraine
said they still had control of the city. Those counterclaims were
probably "outdated or erroneous," according to an analysis from the
Washington-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) think tank. It
cited unconfirmed videos showing Russian forces erecting a red "victory"
flag in Lysychansk and "casually walking around" its neighborhoods.
"Ukrainian forces likely conducted a deliberate withdrawal from
Lysychansk, resulting in the Russian seizure of the city on July 2," it
said. [As Russia issued its claim of control over Lysychansk on Sunday,
Slovyansk, a town about 50 miles west in Donetsk, came under intense
shelling]{.underline} that killed at least six people, local officials
said. Mayor Vadym Lyakh said in a video on Telegram that "the biggest
shelling of Slovyansk recently" had left "a large number of wounded and
dead." Tetyana Ignatchenko, a spokeswoman for the Donetsk region, told
Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne News that at least six people were
killed and 15 were injured in the shelling. She added that missiles hit
the town of Kramatorsk, to the south of Slovyansk. In its assessment
Saturday, [the ISW said Russia was likely to fully take over the Luhansk
region "in coming days" and would probably "then prioritize drives on
Ukrainian positions in Siversk before turning to Slovyansk and Bakhmut,"

Turkey said Sunday that Turkish authorities have detained a
Russian-flagged cargo ship loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain. Millions
of metric tons of grain await export from Ukraine, blockaded by Russia's
control of Black Sea shipping lanes. The export blockades have resulted
in global food shortages and rising prices, which have particularly
affected poorer countries. Three people were killed in Russian strikes
early Sunday in the Kharkiv region, Ukrainian officials said. Cities
across Kharkiv were shelled Saturday and Sunday, according to regional
governor Oleh Synyehubov. In one district, Russian forces "burned farm
buildings, garages, and shelled open areas," he added. Russian forces

#### NATO success causes Russia to use tactical nukes in Ukraine -- escalates to full nuclear war

\"Ukraine war: Could Russia use tactical nuclear weapons?,\" BBC News,
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60664169\]//MaizeDS

Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, President [Vladimir Putin said he was
moving his \"**deterrent forces\" - meaning nuclear weapons - to
\"combat ready\" status**. This]{.underline} [has raised fears that
**Moscow could use \"tactical\" nuclear weapons** - not an all-out
nuclear war, but still a dramatic development. Tactical nuclear weapons
are those which could be used over relatively short
distances.]{.underline} This distinguishes them from \"strategic\"
nuclear weapons. In the Cold War, these were the bombs which the two
superpowers, the US and Soviet Union, could launch over long distances
at each other\'s homeland. The term \"tactical\" nevertheless
incorporates many types of weapon, including smaller bombs and missiles
used as \"battlefield\" weapons. [Russia is thought to have about 2,000
tactical nuclear weapons. These can be placed on various types of
missiles which are normally used to deliver conventional explosives.
They can even be fired as artillery shells on a battlefield. They have
also been developed for aircraft and ships - for instance torpedoes and
depth charges to target submarines.]{.underline} These warheads are
believed to be in storage facilities, rather than deployed and ready to
fire. But one concern is [that Russia could be more willing to use
smaller tactical weapons than larger strategic missiles.]{.underline}
\"[They might not see it as crossing this big nuclear threshold. They
could see it as part of their conventional forces,\"]{.underline} says
Dr Patricia Lewis, head of the international security programme at the
Chatham House think tank. [Tactical nuclear weapons vary enormously in
size and power. The smallest can be one kiloton or less]{.underline}
(equivalent to a thousand tonnes of the explosive TNT) - [the larger
ones perhaps as big as 100 kilotons]{.underline}. The effects would
depend on the size of the warhead, how far above the ground it detonates
and the local environment. But as a comparison, [the atomic bomb that
killed around 146,000 people in Hiroshima]{.underline}, Japan, during
World War Two, [was 15 kilotons**. Russia\'s largest strategic weapons
are thought to be at least 800 kilotons**]{.underline}. President Putin
has made more than one reference to Russia\'s nuclear weapons -
apparently to try to create a sense of fear. US spies see this as a
signal to the West to persuade it not to intervene more in Ukraine, not
as a sign he is planning nuclear war. But others worry that even though
the chances are low, [it is possible Russia, in certain conditions,
might be tempted to use a smaller tactical weapon in Ukraine. \"Putin is
comfortable in the \'stability-instability\' world, while the West is
deterred by his nuclear bluster as if Nato\'s billion-dollar deterrent
is nothing but a paper tiger,\"]{.underline} tweeted Dr Mariana
Budjeryn, a nuclear expert with the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs, at the Harvard Kennedy School[. US intelligence
say Russia has a theory called \"escalate to de-escalate\" if it is in a
conflict with Nato. This involves doing something dramatic - such as
using a tactical weapon on the battlefield, or as a demonstration
somewhere - or threatening to do so. The idea is to frighten the other
side into backing down. The concern is that **if Putin feels cornered
and that his strategy in Ukraine is failing, he could use tactical
nuclear weapons as a \"game changer\"**, to break a stalemate or avoid
defeat.]{.underline} But the situation would likely have to get worse in
Ukraine - or back in Russia - for him to consider this. James Acton, a
[nuclear expert]{.underline} at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Pace in Washington DC, says: \"[I am legitimately worried that in that
circumstance Putin might use a nuclear weapon, most likely on the ground
in Ukraine to terrify everyone and get his way.]{.underline} We are not
at that point yet.\" Dr Heather Williams, nuclear expert at Kings
College London, says one problem is that it is unclear what \"winning\"
in Ukraine would look like for Putin - and thus what might drive Russia
to use a nuclear weapon. Putin claims Ukraine is part of Russia, so
using nuclear weapons on its territory seems bizarre. Russia itself is
close by and \"the fallout could cross boundaries\", warns Patricia
Lewis. The only time nuclear weapons have been used in conflict was by
the US at the end of World War Two against Japan. Would Putin want to
become the first leader to break the taboo and use them? [Some worry he
has shown a willingness to do things others thought he would not do,
whether invading Ukraine or using nerve agent in Salisbury]{.underline}.
Dr Williams says there is a further reason why Russia might not use
nuclear weapons - China. \"Russia is heavily dependent on Chinese
support, but China has a \'no first use\' nuclear doctrine. So if Putin
did use them, it would be incredibly difficult for China to stand by
him. If he used them, he would probably lose China.\" No one knows quite
where the use of tactical nuclear weapons would lead. [It could
escalate]{.underline} and Putin would not want nuclear war. [But
miscalculation is always a risk.]{.underline} \"They would imagine
everyone would capitulate,\" says Patricia Lewis. \"What would happen is
[that Nato would have to come in and respond]{.underline}.\" The US says
it is monitoring the situation closely. It has an extensive intelligence
gathering machine to watch Russian nuclear activity - for instance
whether tactical weapons are being moved out of storage, or if there is
any change in behaviour at launch sites. So far, they say they have not
seen any significant changes. [How the US and Nato would respond to any
nuclear use is hard to predict. They may not want to escalate the
situation further and risk **all-out nuclear war** but they also might
want to draw a line.]{.underline} This might mean a tough conventional
rather than nuclear response. But what would Russia then do? \"[**Once
you have crossed the nuclear threshold, there is no** obvious **stopping
point**,\"]{.underline} says James Acton[. \"I don\'t think anyone can
have any confidence of what that world would look like.\"]{.underline}

State ideology was also correlated with the timing of state legislative
response relative to other states. As the state innovation literature
suggested, [liberal states appeared more likely to pioneer genetic
policy approaches. Conservatives, on the other hand, were more likely to
adopt policies late, and they were more likely to ''go further'' when
they did act.]{.underline} Also of interest, [both groups were morally
suspicious of biotechnology use. Liberals were morally suspicious of
genetic technology and law enforcement.]{.underline} [Conservatives were
morally suspicious of genetic technology and biomedicine]{.underline}
(human cloning) [and genetic privacy.]{.underline} Also of interest is
the way ideology did not separate states on certain types of programs.
For instance, state promotion of biotech using tax credits or state
grants was popular among all types of state actors. Similarly, biotech
regulation in the form of GMO permits was found evenly in both liberal
and conservative states. [The political identity of biotechnology has
significant policy implications. If science or technology comes to be
defined as a partisan issue, public policy will become a battle of
partisan values and concerns over its use.]{.underline} This is
warranted in a deliberative society but might **[become a tool of
political competition rather than a discussion on the
merits.]{.underline}** A [related factor is the unwillingness to
compromise on moral or partisan issues]{.underline}, when compromise is
actually quite a prudent approach. One has only to witness the partisan
debates and resulting state legislation about stem cell research or
health care reform to appreciate these realities. On the other hand, [if
science stays relatively nonpartisan, compromise and pragmatic policy
development is possible.]{.underline} As with [economic or genetic
counselor policies, the questions center more on ''what works'' than
''what is right'' to advance state policy goals.]{.underline}

media companies to find false information on their sites as a good
rather than a bad idea for society (38% to 31%).

[Less than half of the public believes]{.underline} these

cautious take on these new and emerging developments stems from doubt
that these potential human enhancements would make life better than it
is now or that reliance on AI would improve on human judgment or
performance]{.underline}. On these questions, less than half of the
public is convinced improvements would result. For example, [**32%** of
Americans think]{.underline} that [**robotic exoskeletons** with

#### BCI technology calls into question [the ethical aspects]{.underline} of the technology--means we face issues of [human autonomy]{.underline}

Interface (BCI), 2013, pp. 72-75, doi: 10.1109/IWW-BCI.2013.6506635.)

Ethical and Social Issues [Future BCI applications that provide users
with physical and cognitive rehabilitation and enhancement **inevitably
raise ethical and social issues**.]{.underline} It is expected to set
off public debates on what is acceptable and what should be restricted.
[These controversies will also affect the public acceptance of BCI
technology in our society \[12\].]{.underline} Privacy In a BCI system,
it is performed to record brain activities and to process the measured
signal before translating to the predefined control commands. [That is,
it acquires neuronal data acquired through either an invasive or a
non-invasive manner. For a high accuracy, the interface often uses
information that is personalized to fit the subject\'s individual
characteristics. There is no doubt that these data must be encrypted to
protect the privacy of a BCI user \[9\].]{.underline} This issue runs
parallel to the neuroethical debates surrounding neuroimaging and mind
reading. Liability [The issue of liability, one of the typical issues in
neuroethics, especially in drug research, also occurs in BCI
research.]{.underline} Signal acquisition and processing steps are
important in BCI since they allow to extract meaningful features from
the subject\'s brain data and to interpret them by machine learning
techniques. However, even after the machine has been trained to classify
signals from the brain, there is always the possibility of
misinterpretation. [When an error occurs in the analysis process, **the
BCI will produce a command that is not intended by the user**. In such
cases where a discrepancy occurs between the user\'s intentions and the
generated commands, **we face the issue of liability**]{.underline}
\[11\]. If a BCI robot "accidently" breaks something or harms another
being, "who" or "what" should take the responsibility for the damage?
How can we determine whether the actual intention of the user was
malignant or not? Personal Identity BCI installment may trigger changes
in the cognitive and perceptive abilities of a subject. The effects of
BCI on an individual\'s personhood may lead to the debate whether the
alteration in oneself can also be accepted as the same personal identity
\[10\]. Especially when the technology is expected to improve the
user\'s ability to move and communicate in any way despite potential
risks and side effects, [BCI suggests a similar controversial issue in
neuroethics regarding the enhancement of human abilities through medical
measures such as drugs or BCI.]{.underline} Fairness Research on BCI is
still in its early stages and for now limited to therapeutic or
rehabilitative devices such as robot arms and wheelchairs. However,
neuroscientists prospect the spread of BCI into applications for the
general public as well and in the future BCI could be used to enhance
the physical abilities. In this case we can predict the issue of
fairness. Can we call a competition between an "enhanced" BCI user with
and an ordinary person fair? It would become an important matter of
deciding how far this enhancement can be allowed in the perspective of
impartiality and justice. Team Responsibility Because interdisciplinary
BCI research requires experts from many fields from neuroscientists,
psychologists, engineers, surgeons, and computer scientists, it is
important that there must be a rigid protocol on team responsibility
among researchers. Work should be distributed reasonably and fairly, and
the credits should follow as well \[8\]. Responsibility and liability
for any decision made for the patient and the research must remain clear
within the team. Team responsibility is required especially for a group
of researchers who come from different areas to cooperate and draw
successful outcomes. Access to Technology Access to information on a
piece of technology, in this case BCI, should be distributed fairly upon
the general public. This is also a consensus in the medical field as
well \[17\]. It may be quite challenging to achieve a completely equal
distribution of the BCI technology. Nevertheless, scientists and
researchers must strive to educate and inform the society about the
results of basic or clinical researches through appropriate publication
of articles in public. SECTION IV.Discussions: Ethical Principles [**It
can be controversial** among BCI researchers **whether a** potential
effect of a **BCI technology is ethical or not**. However, there are
certain fundamental principles that need to be applied during the
decision-making process in order to prevent such ethical or social
issues. Three core values that have been applied in the medical field
still remain valid in this developing field of BCI. **Respect for
Autonomy BCI applications must respect the autonomy of the subject**.
Patients must have a complete understanding about any medical or
technical procedures taken on them including the purpose, procedures,
and expected benefits, and potential risks \[8\]. In case of locked-in
syndrome (LIS) **patients who lack any voluntary motor control** except
eye movement including blinking, communicating with the patient and
acquiring a complete informed consent **may be more challenging**
\[18\].]{.underline} Nevertheless, they must be given the rights to
participate in decision-making which implies that for each and every
intervention proposed by the research team there must be reasonable
alternatives. Beneficence Before installing any device directly or
indirectly to the human nervous system, the beneficence of the
technology must be carefully reviewed. BCI technology that aims to aid
paralyzed patients will certainly have its benefits. However, the
research team must not only focus on the positive aspects of the
application but also weigh out the risks and side effects fairly and
accurately as well \[17\]. For example, BCI connected to the motor areas
of the human brain may enable the subject to move more freely through
the device and at the same time limit other aspects of communication and
movement. It is an important issue to decide whether the benefits of the
intervention outweigh the negative effects. Non-Maleficence [BCI devices
and researches **should be ethical** with respect to individual users
and the surrounding social environments. It is essential to investigate
and monitor the social impacts of BCIs extensively. Just like any other
medical procedures, the research should **not cause any harm or danger**
to other human beings around the user]{.underline} \[17\]. This
evaluation should not only be limited to the current generation, but
also keep a keen eye on the potential effects on the next generation.
SECTION V.Conclusion and Further Research BCI technologies have the
potential to affect many aspects of everyday life. In this paper, we
introduced state-of-the-art BCI technologies and applications available
to both patients who have limited motor abilities and the normal
subjects. Although the BCI technology is promising in terms of enhancing
the human performances, we need to consider its potential side effects
to individuals and the whole society. There are many ethical concerns
that need to be taken care of in the process of researching and
installing the interface upon a human subject. The privacy of the
individual, especially the data acquired from the human brain, must be
carefully encrypted and protected. Regarding to the teamwork, the
workload and the credits should be distributed fairly and appropriately
including the responsibility from each and every decision made. In
addition to this, there is a rising concern about the potential effects,
which BCI installation can lead to, in terms of an individual\'s
cognition, perception abilities, and personality. BCI researchers and
users have not yet established a shared protocol for BCI use. [Ethical
dilemmas and concerns **must be adequately addressed** publicly with the
cooperation of from various experts such as neuroscientists and
engineers to non-experts including potential BCI users and their
families.]{.underline} With the appropriate assessment and regulations,
ethical issues rising from BCI research and application procedure will
be able to come to an optimistic conclusion.

### 1NC -- Super Soldiers/Overmatch Links

#### Super soldiers create an [ethical]{.underline} dilemma where surgeons [take risks]{.underline} on untested operations

**Galliot & Lotz 16** (Galliott, Jai, and Lotz, Mianna. Super Soldiers :
The Ethical, Legal and Social Implications. Routledge, 2016. pg.
126-135)

Surgical innovation is largely motivated by the desire to improve upon
existing surgical interventions. Improvements can occur across various
dimensions of surgery. Common targets of surgical innovation include:
decreasing the duration of surgery; using less invasive techniques;
shortening hospital stays; improving patient outcomes; or curing the
previously incurable. As the examples discussed in the previous section
suggest, the targets of surgical innovation have changed as medical
science has developed: Larrey's amputation protocol was aimed at
controlling life-threatening infection, whereas the advent of
antibiotics has rendered the surgical control of infection less urgent.
However, the primary ethical motivation for surgical innovation has not
changed. Beneficence -- that is, better surgical experiences and
outcomes for individual patients -- has always been the common primary
goal of innovating surgeons. Of course, there are also other potential
or actual motives such as the surgeon's desire to pioneer new techniques
and to be recognised as a leader in the field; the desire (individual or
corporate) to develop a financially rewarding innovation; and the need
to find new efficiencies in the use of healthcare resources. At times
such motives can lead to conflicts of interest, as we discuss below. In
the context of military surgical innovation, an additional consideration
arises. This relates to the patient qua soldier, and the need of the
military for soldiers who are as fit as possible or who can return to
active service as rapidly as possible following injury. Thus, as well as
the recognised ethical issues arising from civilian surgical innovation
(Johnson and Rogers 2012), [military surgical innovation introduces the
**ethical complexity** of interventions performed on patients in order
to benefit not only themselves, but also the military those patients
serve: there is an imperative to combine good medicine with good
tactics]{.underline} (Blackbourne et al. 2012, p. S389). Our discussion
here focuses on issues of Ethical Considerations in Military Surgical
Innovation 127 harms to patients/soldiers, informed consent for surgical
innovation in the military context, and conflicts of interest associated
with military surgical innovation. Before turning to specific ethical
issues, it is worth considering whether or not there is a duty to
innovate in surgery, and if so, how the military context might affect
this. Unlike at least some branches of medicine, surgeons are both
diagnosticians and intimately associated with the quality of the
intervention that they deliver; they are part of the therapeutic
modality and as such, personally responsible for the quality of the
surgery they perform. Whether or not the patient does well is dependent
to a significant degree upon the skills of the individual surgeon. This
feature is evident in the historical accounts of military surgical
innovation discussed in the previous section: Larrey and Gillies were
not only innovators in terms of changing care protocols and extending
the treatment options available, they were also regarded as extremely
talented surgeons (Williams 1843; Bamji 2006). This feature of surgery,
that surgeons themselves are an inherent part of the therapy, creates an
obligation for surgeons constantly to strive to improve their
techniques, through research, innovation and repetition. But this can be
ethically challenging for the following reasons. [First, the outcomes of
surgical innovations **cannot always be predicted** in advance, making
it difficult for surgeons to be confident that they are acting in the
best interests of their patients when they innovate. Second, adopting
new techniques entails a learning curve during which the first cohort of
patients exposed to the new technique will be **disadvantaged** compared
with patients treated when the surgeon is more practiced. Third, as the
boundaries between innovation and research are not well demarcated, this
can lead to role confusion for the surgeon who is both researcher and
practitioner]{.underline} (Rogers and Johnson 2013). In the military
context, the pressures to innovate may be magnified. Combat in war may
provide the only source of particular types of injuries and wounds, and
thus the only opportunity to develop new treatments. As mentioned above,
the use of IEDs in Afghanistan and Iraq has led to new types of injuries
with specific characteristics including limb amputations and extensive
abdominal and genitourinary soft tissue injuries contaminated with dirt
and other debris (Blackbourne et al. 2012). Given the unique
characteristics of these injuries, [any innovations in managing soldiers
wounded by IEDs has to occur in the care of those patients; it is not
possible to generate the relevant knowledge from another patient cohort
as there is no comparable civilian weapon or pattern of
injuries.]{.underline} Thus in situations of military conflict that
generate unique injuries, the duty to innovate falls heavily upon
military surgeons, as it is only in this context that relevant
innovation can occur. We now turn to specific ethical issues arising
through surgical innovation. Patient Harms and Benefits Innovations in
surgery have the potential to benefit patients, but equally, innovations
may lead to patient harm. [Patients may have **increased morbidity and
mortality** following innovative procedures, despite the beneficent
intent of the 128 Super Soldiers innovation. The history of surgical
innovation is replete with examples of wellintentioned innovations that
left patients either **no better or worse** off than if they had
received the standard procedure.]{.underline} Examples include ligation
of the internal mammary artery for angina which was eventually found to
be no better than placebo (Beecher 1961), freezing of the stomach lining
as a treatment for gastric ulcers (Frader and Caniano 1998) and
insertion of the DePuy articular surface replacement hip prosthesis,
which had high rates of failure and other complications (Cohen 2012).
The underlying challenge regarding innovation is that the effects of the
innovation are unknown at the time that it is performed. Thus it is
impossible to predict whether or not the innovation will be better than
the existing alternative, or whether patients will be harmed. For
innovations that occur in emergency life-threatening situations, trying
something new can be justified as there may be no alternative. In these
situations, even if the innovation is unsuccessful, the patient is no
worse off than they would have been absent the innovation. Here the harm
to the patient is not the direct result of the innovation; rather the
innovation failed to ameliorate a life-threatening emergency. Planned
innovations bear a different burden of responsibility, in that with a
planned innovation, there is time to consider and anticipate potential
harms, even though these may not always be accurately predicted.
However, it is not possible to identify in advance unanticipated harms,
thus even with the best planned innovation there will always be the risk
of harm. Where the innovation is performed to enhance rather than to
address an existing health problem, the responsibility becomes
correspondingly higher: surgical enhancement involves a healthy patient
(in the case of soldiers, usually an extremely fit person) subjected to
a surgical intervention that is not therapeutically indicated. Such
intervention entails at least some morbidity (pain, scarring, exposure
to anaesthesia, anatomical modification), not all of which is
reversible. Thus the provision of innovative surgical enhancements
requires critical and independent assessment of the potential for harms,
the justifications for the enhancement and the likely effects (physical,
psychological) on the recipient. Indeed, it is unclear whether surgical
innovation that aims at enhancement can be thought of as motivated by
beneficence, which we identified as the primary goal of past and present
surgical innovation[. As well as unavoidable harms from the procedure
itself, innovative surgery **can be harmful** to patients during its
development phase due to the learning curve.]{.underline} When surgeons
take up a new procedure, they are more likely to encounter complications
and take longer, than once they have fully mastered the new technique.
Thus [even innovations that prove in time to be safer and more effective
than their predecessors can lead to harm for patients treated in the
early phases of the introduction of the innovation.]{.underline}
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy provides a clear example of this; when the
procedure was first introduced there were high rates of bile duct damage
compared to the open procedure (Moore, Bennett and Meyers 1995). Once
established, however, laparoscopic cholecystectomy rapidly achieved
better outcomes for patients than the open procedure. Estimates of the
Ethical Considerations in Military Surgical Innovation 129 number of
cases needed to perfect surgical techniques vary, but may be as high as
200 (Voitk, Tsao and Ignatius 2001). [The learning curve presents an
additional **ethical challenge** when the group of patients who undergo
surgery during the learning curve differs demographically from groups
who will later benefit from the surgery.]{.underline} The development of
facial reconstructive surgery presents just such a case, as contemporary
recipients of cosmetic plastic surgery, that is, healthy individuals
whose aim is to improve their appearance, benefit from techniques
developed on wounded soldiers. [It is not obvious how to address this
ethical challenge.]{.underline} There does not seem to be anything
inappropriate about the early facial reconstructive surgery performed on
the soldiers, undertaken in the interests of securing the best possible
functional and aesthetic outcomes for those patients. Nor do current
cosmetic procedures harm or disrespect past soldiers in any meaningful
sense. Given the high number of operations performed in times of war,
perhaps the first step is to recognise that [soldiers have been and will
continue to be over-represented in the learning curves for some surgical
procedures,]{.underline} particularly procedures that aim to repair or
reconstruct wounded bone and tissue. It is important to ensure that the
lessons learned on soldiers -- both those with civilian application and
those unique to conflict injuries -- stay learned, to minimise the
unnecessary suffering of future soldiers. Military history is full of
innovations that were forgotten and had to be relearned in the next war,
including Larrey's innovations in triage, transport and en-route care,
which were ignored by the British during the Crimean War (Manring et al.
2009). In terms of recognising the over-representation of soldiers in
surgical learning curves for some widely used civilian procedures such
as cosmetic surgery, most countries have social practices for
recognising the sacrifices of soldiers, as well as social structures to
support returned soldiers, and these might be the most appropriate
forums for recognising this particular contribution. [The deleterious
impact of the learning curve upon surgical outcomes also leads **to
challenges in knowing when to evaluate innovations** and when to abandon
them as harmful or ineffective.]{.underline} If no allowance is made for
the learning curve, we risk abandoning procedures that may turn out to
be beneficial once surgeons have perfected their techniques, but on the
other hand, undue allowance for initial poor outcomes may lead to
harmful innovations remaining in practice for prolonged periods. This
challenge applies equally in military and civilian circumstances. One
proposed solution to this is a system of data collection and evaluation
starting when the innovation is first implemented (McCulloch et al.
2013). This approach is being used with some success in the US military
context to evaluate a new system of managing combat casualties known as
the Joint Trauma System (JTS). The JTS is described as 'a novel
systematic and integrated approach to organize and coordinate combat
casualty care' (Blackbourne et al. 2012, pS388). A Joint Theater Trauma
Registry (JTTR), commenced in 2005, supports the JTS. The JTTR records a
variety of data providing vital information to drive improvements in
clinical care, as well as generate new knowledge (Blackbourne et al.
2012). Blackbourne et al. note that although the JTTR was not set up as
a research data 130 Super Soldiers tool, knowledge generated from the
registry about the JTS has revolutionised field trauma care and fostered
advances in military medicine. The JTTR provides an excellent model for
maximising knowledge about the introduction of an innovation. The highly
regulated context of the military has enabled the development of a
comprehensive registry tracking the outcomes of the new trauma
management system, thus maximising benefits and leading to the earliest
possible identification of harms.2 Informed Consent Informed consent
refers to the permission given by a patient for a medical or surgical
intervention. Healthcare interventions are ethically justifiable only if
the patient concerned is competent to make a decision; has been provided
with, and fully understands relevant information about the procedure;
and is making the decision freely and voluntarily. [Military surgical
innovation poses a number of challenges to informed consent. First,
patients may not be competent to give consent for innovations provided
as part of the management of trauma, as they may be unconscious, in pain
or under the influence of analgesic drugs.]{.underline} In these
situations, consent is not possible; [the surgical innovation **must be
ethically justified** on the grounds that it is in the patient's
interests.]{.underline} The prospective collection of data on military
surgical interventions, particularly innovative interventions, as
recommended in the above section, can act as a further safeguard of the
interests of soldiers receiving unplanned innovative care. In contrast,
patients are usually competent to consent to planned innovations, such
as procedures to implant rehabilitative or enhancing prostheses.
However, there are other threats to informed consent in these
situations, relating to the provision and understanding of information,
and the voluntariness of the decision. As detailed above, by their very
nature, there are unknown risks associated with surgical innovations.
Even where innovations are meticulously planned in advance, it is
impossible to eliminate the 'unknown unknowns' -- unanticipated adverse
outcomes. [This feature leads to a moral obligation to consider whether
or not innovative surgery is a type of research, and should therefore
**use the standards of research consent rather than those of routine
clinical care**]{.underline} (Lotz 2013). The standards for consent to
research are more demanding than those of clinical practice, in part to
ensure that participants understand that the research is aimed at
generating knowledge about the intervention, and that, in advance of
that process, it is not possible to provide a full account of the likely
harms and benefits.

#### Biologically enhanced soldiers are [unethically]{.underline} designed to kill--makes us forget that war [should]{.underline} always be avoided

**Galliot & Lotz 16** (Galliott, Jai, and Lotz, Mianna. Super Soldiers :
The Ethical, Legal and Social Implications. Routledge, 2016. pg. 53-61)

In the first instance, [any discussion of **biogenetically enhanced
soldiers** should be a powerful wake-up call. That we might need to
change anything substantial about human beings so that they can be
(more) effective in their militarist roles is **deeply
unsettling**.]{.underline} It implies that war is becoming so
complicated, rapid, and foggy that human soldiers in their unaltered
state cannot adequately keep up with its pace and demands. Perhaps this
has always been true, although the situation seems exacerbated in the
context of contemporary warfare, accompanied by everevolving
technological capabilities. [Military necessity demands that, in order
for militaries and individual soldiers to keep up -- in order for them
to have a legitimate chance at protecting themselves and the citizens
they represent, and overcoming their adversaries -- they need to design
technologies and themselves **to be better** than their
opponents.]{.underline} In contexts where opponents are less advanced in
this regard, this imperative will be less pronounced. Yet, while the
continued development of military technologies is a centuries-old
endeavour, and it has long been recognised that military forces with
'the strongest' and 'the best' soldiers and technologies are more likely
to be victorious, new developments in robotics, nanotechnology and
biotechnology mean that these technologies are becoming more
sophisticated, rapidly evolving and intrusive.1 Even in the face of
heated debate on the ethics of human enhancement (in both military and
civilian contexts), some such enhancements are already available, and,
if things keep going as they are, more are likely to emerge in the
future. Even if we assume that there is nothing inherently morally
unacceptable about (safe) human enhancements, [the morality of specific
modes of enhancement depends on the context in which they are used, and
the end(s) that they are being used to achieve. For example, while there
may be nothing inherently morally unacceptable about enhancing humans to
be more patient through pharmaceutical means (say), enhancing
individuals to be more patient so that they could be **more
effective**]{.underline} 1 We might speculate that eventually there will
be no significant role for humans to play in warfare, at least not
anywhere near the front lines, in which case warfare might become
futile, absurd (Krishnan 2009). 54 Super Soldiers torturers would seem
to be morally problematic. This is because torture itself is morally
unacceptable, and deliberate contributions to promoting human torture
are by extension morally unacceptable as well.2 Enhancing the patience
of snipers may be less problematic, and enhancing the patience of
soldiers so that they are less likely to make hasty decisions when
engaging with enemy combatants (and thus less likely to fail to
discriminate between legitimate combatants and innocent civilians) is
likely to be less unacceptable still. [Or, 'enhancing' soldiers to
exhibit **a lack of empathy** for the plight of other human beings (even
if only in their enemies) would promote a lack of discrimination,
potentially loos.en concerns for proportionality and promote immoral
behaviour. This is true even if having less empathy for one's opponent
(whether one is a sniper, torturer or whatever) could promote military
proficiency.]{.underline} While warfare in general is ugly, an
enterprise that routinely sparks the most despicable of human behaviour,
it is also taken to be necessary, especially given that threats of
attack and violence from the outside are pervasive. [The **ethical
issues that emerge at the intersection of human enhancement and warfare
are tricky to grapple with** in part because of the blurriness of the
moral acceptability of the ends of warfare taken more generally: on one
hand, it is largely assumed that defending oneself (either as an
individual or as a nation) is morally acceptable, and thus that (at
least) some military action is permissible, or at worse a necessary evil
in an imperfect world, where our wellbeing and way of life is constantly
vulnerable to outside threat. On the other hand, it is also largely
agreed that killing others is wrong (for reasons other than defence),
and that the colossal harms that come about as a **result of warfare are
undesirable**, and thus that war is something that, in the long term, we
ought to work to mitigate and eliminate altogether.]{.underline} (To say
that war is 'inevitable' is to misuse language, however unlikely it
seems that putting an end to war once and for all is an achievable goal,
given the current state of the world.) As long as military actions
conform close enough to the former justification, they are taken to be
morally justifiable. [Something has gone awry, however, if **we lose
sight of the latter goal altogether**, that is, if we ignore the idea
that war should not occur at all.]{.underline}

This Discussion Note [calls for attention to the cultural practices of
Neural Engineering]{.underline} as part of the life sciences [as
practices and technologies of manufacturing life]{.underline}.
[Through]{.underline} focusing on **[Disability, Ableism,
and]{.underline}** especially **[Technoableism]{.underline}** within the
field, I point out [instances of onto-epistemological
violence]{.underline}, which [influence the likelihood of **survival of
disabled people individually and as a (cultural and political)
group**]{.underline}. By drawing on Crip Technoscience, a method
assemblage is introduced that allows to address these issues in an
intersectional-kyriarchal understanding of interlocking systems of
privilege and oppression through generative critique and productive
collaborative work. [Criptical Neural Engineering is dedicated to
disability justice and disability gain]{.underline}. [It centers
disabled people as **epistemic activists**]{.underline} [and
**demands**]{.underline} [response-ability and **accountability** from
non-disabled people]{.underline}, specifically [engineers that want to
build adaptive technologies with disabled people.]{.underline}

When I first saw the call for a NanoEthics special section on how life
sciences and technologies (re-)constitute living beings and the possible
substantial transformation of their corporeality through the expected
convergence of "nano-, bio-, information and cognitive sciences and
technologies (NBIC)" \[1\], I immediately thought about how this also
raises the question of whose life gets (not) manufactured, and with that
it also becomes relevant to inquire by whom as well as the what and the
why.

This perspective is as much informed by my lived experience as by my
research work. I am, among other things, a white neurodivergent,
disabled scholar of Science and Technology Studies (STS). In 2014, I
started to investigate the intersection of technology and disability by
interrogating my desire to "overcome" my congenital disability through
voluntary amputation of my left arm to replace it with a mechanized,
technological arm --- a prosthesis. At the time, I thought that I could
become a vanguard of the human evolution by technological means --- a
dedicated transhumanist view that overlaps with a specific presentation
of technological perfectibility (\[2\], Pos. 181Footnote 1). Through the
encouragement and support of my professors in sociology of technology, I
was able to position this desire within the human enhancement discourse
and larger ableist narratives around the idealized corporeal standard.
Since then, this intersection has been my primary research interest, and
my understanding has expanded as I learned about and get sensitized to
the intersectional-kyriarchal intricacies of the "interlocking systems
of privilege and oppression."Footnote 2

In my Master's Degree program, the focus shifted from enhancement
narratives to the design processes of technologies for, but seldom with,
disabled people.Footnote 3 Several events contributed to this shift:
first, a semester-long ethnographic study in an introduction course for
neurotechnology and the portrayal of disability in it; second, a more
than year-long internship as a research assistant for the project
"FUTUREBODY --- The Future of the Body in the Light of Neurotechnology"
\[7\]; third, an ongoing collaboration with neuroengineers, primarily
via Nicholas Berberich, a Ph.D. student at the TUM Institute for
Cognitive Systems (ICS) that started mid-2019 and encompasses, among
other things, supporting the CereBro Team of the Cybertum
ProjectFootnote 4 by providing a Crip Technoscience perspective in the
development.

All of this culminated in my master's thesis, "Disability in
Neuroengineering" which interrogated how disability and the disabled
body is figured in Neuroengineering and how to critique Neuroengineering
and its culture constructively to produce better and more just
(neuro)technologies through co-design and human-centered approaches.

This discussion note is a continuation of this effort by being an
intra-ventionFootnote 5: A call to action for "Studies Investigating
Science and Technology"Footnote 6 to give attention and inquire about
the (cultural) practices of Neural Engineering. If my research has not
overlooked something (see Appendix Table 1), Neural Engineering seems to
be currently systematically neglected by STS, as well as (Critical)
Disability Studies (DS), including feminist strands.

This discussion note brings attention to Neural Engineering as a site of
research and collaboration, broadening its focus, practices, and
possibilities by pointing out entrenched ableist structures and
providing a tentative approach to support the goal of "building
assistive technologies ... to enable disabled people to lead an active
and self-determined life" (\[10\], p. 21) through fostering a cultural
shift in development and participation in Disability Justice.

**[Neural Engineering]{.underline}**, as a field, [is concerned with the
application of "engineering principles and neuroscience]{.underline}
methods [to analyze neurological functions and to design **treatments
for neurological limitations and dysfunctions**]{.underline}" (\[11\],
p. 286). [It "encompasses experimental, computational, theoretical,
clinical, and applied aspects of research areas at the molecular,
cellular, and systems levels]{.underline}" \[12\]. The description of an
introductory course for Neural Engineering states that the discipline
"combines foundations of biology, physics, mathematics, computer
science, psychology and engineering to design artificial 'neural
systems,' such as active body prostheses, or autonomous robots, whose
design and functional principles are based on those of biological
nervous systems" \[13\]. According to Nicholas Berberich, the discipline
brings together neuroscience and engineering through "reciprocal
synergetic application of both fields' methods and bodies of knowledge
to each other" (\[10\], p. 7).

Neural Engineering is adjacent to Neuroscience, but it would be too
simplistic to understand it as a sub-discipline of either Neuroscience
or Engineering. [The]{.underline} range of [impact reaches far into
other fields]{.underline}. The fields probably most relevant here are
[Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Machine
Learning]{.underline}, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The
manufacturers of [**algorithms** for governmental and commercial
use]{.underline} [face sustained critique for the reproduction and
entrenchment of **racist, sexist (and other)
discrimination**]{.underline} \[14,15,16\], [which extends
to]{.underline} the ways in [how **ethics is (not) integrated and (not)
discussed** in these fields]{.underline} \[17,18,19\].

But it seems that inquiries into the field of Neural Engineering itself
with its cultural practices, norms, values, and procedures have been
limited. This possible [neglect is concerning]{.underline} as [these
have far-reaching consequences]{.underline} in the application of
"engineering principles and neuroscience methods" (\[11\], p. 286) to
the (human) nervous system --- "often with the goal of providing
rehabilitative solutions" (\[11\], p. 286). [It **directly links** ideas
of **dysfunction and proper functions to**]{.underline} notions of
**[disability and neurodiversity]{.underline}** \[20\].

With that, **[ableism]{.underline}** [becomes a necessary
focus]{.underline}. Fiona Kumari Campbell defines [ableism]{.underline}
a[s a]{.underline} "[network of beliefs, processes and practices that
produces a particular]{.underline} kind of self and body (the [corporeal
standard]{.underline}) [that is projected as the **perfect**,
species-**typical** and]{.underline} therefore
**[essential]{.underline}** and fully human.
**[Disability]{.underline}** then [is cast **as a diminished state** of
being human]{.underline}." (\[21\], p. 5).

[What is (not]{.underline}) deemed [pathological and in need of
intervention has a direct impact on]{.underline} our self-understanding
as humans including [**who lives and who dies**.]{.underline} This, in
turn, affects "future-making," as John Urry calls the process of
imagination and foretelling, which is often relegated to "specialists of
the future" (\[22\], p. 17). Currently, [**disabled people** "are
continually **being written out of the future**]{.underline}, [rendered
as the]{.underline} sign of the [future no one wants]{.underline}"
(\[23\], p. 46). Because of that, [we need accessible and inhabitable
futures where disabled people are present]{.underline}, and therefore,
we have to look whose lives get manufactured, by whom, and why.

As a leading producer of Neurotechnologies, which have "taken centre
stage in many visions of a technologized future body," Neural
Engineering is at the frontier of the merger of the bodymindFootnote 7
and technology and these processes \[7\]. Questions of what differences
of being are recognized, validated, and valued become unavoidable
(\[20\], p. 39), which creates an inseparable connection between
Neuro-Engineering and Disability. [It is]{.underline} thus [crucial to
"engage with" Neural Engineering, "to inquire into the effects and
assumptions of emerging technologies]{.underline}" (\[23\], p.124).

One of the most prominent depictions of the merger of the bodymind and
technology are **[cyborgs]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}
"[human-nonhuman entanglement]{.underline}" \[1\]. It is present in a
variety of media that in turn inspires technology development. This
reciprocal influence of media and technology development is, for
example, explored by Kirby \[25\]. [The]{.underline} cybernetic
organism, "[cyborg]{.underline}", [was]{.underline} originally
[envisioned by Clynes and Kline in the 1960s]{.underline} for NASA as
the technologically altered human body necessary "[to meet the
requirements of extraterrestrial environments]{.underline}" and make
space travel possible. [Their conceptualization is strongly influenced
by]{.underline} their work in [psychiatry]{.underline}, within which
Kline pioneered the development of antipsychotic and antidepressant
medication. These influences become most notable [through their argument
to include remote **involuntary medication**]{.underline} if deemed
necessary because of psychoses (\[26\], p.76). [This
position]{.underline}, as feminist disability studies scholar Alison
Kafer states, [highlights "the **cyborg's history in
institutionalization and abuse**" and connects it **from the beginning**
to **disability**]{.underline} [on multiple levels]{.underline} (\[23\],
p. 126ff).

This article follows The Cyborg Jillian Weise's understanding of cyborgs
as, like Ashley Shew put it, "technologized disabled people" (\[27\], p.
1f). This definition overlaps with the term (and concept)
"[cripborg]{.underline}" [--- a "disabled cyborg]{.underline}" by Nelson
et al. (\[28\], p. 2). But using cyborg this way (along with cripborg)
is a deliberate decision in order [to reclaim and critique "the cyborg"
from its **de-contextualized and de-materialized** metaphorization,
which **neglects** its **entanglement with disability
politics**]{.underline}, mainly proliferated through Donna Haraway's
Cyborg Manifesto (\[23, 29\], \[30\], p. 114). As Kafer points out,
Haraway uses [the]{.underline} (fictional) disabled
[character]{.underline}, which [is described as "severely handicapped"
to]{.underline} [evoke the "stereotyped assumption" of "'total
dependence']{.underline} in order to convince her readers of the
existence of bodies that don't 'end at the skin or include at best other
beings encapsulated by skin'" and "[presents **disability as the site of
spectacular technological fixing**]{.underline}" (\[23\], p. 112). This
presentation is one of the few but significant commonalities the cyborg
figure of Haraway and cyborgs of (science fiction) media and news
coverage share.

I align myself with Weise, Shew, Stephens, and Kafer to firmly [ground
the cyborg in disabled lived experiences]{.underline}, [highlighting
historical lineages]{.underline} to its above-mentioned origins [while
retaining connections to the political]{.underline} figure in its
multiplicity [and infuse cyborg theories with crip politics]{.underline}
to further complicate the human-technology connections in conjunction
with disability as political category (\[23\], p. 116, 118). As Ashley
Shew writes:

When disabled people declare [cyborg]{.underline} expertise, this [is a
political claim]{.underline}, because [cyborg voices have]{.underline}
for so long [been ignored and dismissed]{.underline}. Too few disabled
people have been consulted about our cyborg-ness, our technological
choices, or the planning and design (usually done by non-disabled
people) that shapes our lives. (\[27\], p. 13)

[The neglect of disability as valid and valuable position
is]{.underline} also [present in]{.underline} the
[practice]{.underline}s of life sciences and technologies that
manufacture life. **[Disabled people]{.underline}** often
[appear]{.underline} just [**as objects** that are granted a precarious
status of personhood]{.underline}. [**Research** is]{.underline} most
often **[about us]{.underline}**, sometimes [for us]{.underline}, [and
**seldom with us**]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} frequently [wear the
burden of]{.underline} **[being wounded now for the betterment of others
in an uncertain future]{.underline}**. Lochlann Jain pointed out in The
Prosthetic Imagination that "[it]{.underline} usually [is not the same
body that is simultaneously extended and wounded]{.underline}" and adds
that it should not be forgotten that the [wounding includes the
psyche]{.underline} (\[31\], pp. 35, 37). [This link]{.underline}
between disabled people and cyborg technologies (that is also prominent
in news storiesFootnote 8) [stages us as]{.underline} "[privileged
subjects in a teleology of technical augmentation]{.underline}, which is
understood [as evolution by other means]{.underline}" [and thus as
a]{.underline} new category of [human-in-the-becoming]{.underline}: [the
superhuman]{.underline}, [while "'ordinary' people will have to
wait]{.underline}" (\[2\], Pos. 181 own translationFootnote 9; \[23\],
p. 107).

[But with that]{.underline}, **[non-disabled people do not bear the
risks of early]{.underline}**-stage **[development
testing]{.underline}** [that includes]{.underline}
**[malfunction]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[abandoning]{.underline}** [of hard- and software
regularly]{.underline}. [Instead of witnessing the
"non-innocent]{.underline}" (\[33\], p. 597) [materialization
of]{.underline} such [technologies, they can have]{.underline} [**naïve
transhumanist dreams** about **overcoming** their **(presumed)
biological limitations**]{.underline}. Just as promised in countless
science fiction stories and hype news coverage, [they might become
cyborgs one day with a **shiny, slender, "sexy" artificial
arm**]{.underline} full of multi-functional tools and transformations.
[These are]{.underline} most often the dreams of
"[tryborgs]{.underline}" --- as Jillian Weise calls them --- ["a
non-disabled person who has no fundamental interface.]{.underline} The
tryborg is [a **counterfeit cyborg**]{.underline}. The tryborg [tries to
integrate with technology through the latest product or
innovation]{.underline}" \[34\]. Moreover, cyFootnote 10 points out
that.

**[\[t\]he cyborg is the engineer's dream]{.underline}**. **[The
engineer steers]{.underline}** and manipulates **[the human to greater
performance]{.underline}**. As a common cyborg, I subvert that dream.
**[I do not want to sell]{.underline}** any of **[their shit for
them]{.underline}**. **[I am not impressed with their
tech]{.underline}**, which they call 3C98-3, and **[which I am wearing,
a leg that whirs and clicks, a socket that will not fit unless I
stay]{.underline}** in the weight range of **[100]{.underline}**-105
**[pounds. I am 88 per cent charged]{.underline}** in basic mode and
**[I have taken 638,402 steps on this leg]{.underline}**. **[The last
one]{.underline}** they gave me **[was a lemon]{.underline}**. Maybe
**[this]{.underline}** feeling of **[trial-and-error, repetition and
glitch, is part of the cyborg condition and]{.underline}**, by
extension, **[the disabled condition]{.underline}** \[30\].

It is important to understand that [cyborg technologies are]{.underline}
much more [mundane and have]{.underline} much [less prestige than
science fiction or]{.underline} even [news]{.underline} coverage makes
us believe. [Cyborg technologies are adaptive]{.underline}
technologiesFootnote 11: often **[rugged, clunky, expensive, requiring
maintenance, seldom convenient, and sometimes risky]{.underline}** to
wear. [They]{.underline} **[stress scar tissue]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} often **[leave an opening where flesh, bones, and the
artifact]{.underline}** connect --- **[interface]{.underline}** --- with
each other (\[28\], p.13). The linkage between technological artifacts
and bodyminds is vital to consider. [These interfaces are]{.underline}
very often inter- and [multispecies]{.underline} (including artificial)
"[contact zones]{.underline}" (\[36\], pp. 216, 218) [with]{.underline}
the potentially **[deadly outcome]{.underline}** [if the delicate
homeostasis of live-saving and death-bringing entities]{.underline}
(including medicaments[) is not held]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
possible imbalances [include]{.underline}
"**[malfunctions]{.underline}**," [where the]{.underline} cardiac
pacemaker, the insulin pump, or the electric [knee stops
working]{.underline}. [This is the rough,]{.underline} often [violent,
non-innocent reality of common -- of disabled -- cyborgs]{.underline}.
[But because **disability** is posed to be]{.underline} self-evidently a
signifier for [**an "undesired future**," "**a future no one wants**,"
**how much society got "rid" of it through technology**]{.underline} [is
an]{.underline} **[indicator of progress]{.underline}**.
[Cripborgs]{.underline} or cyborgs [are **part of neither the present
nor** any **future** story]{.underline} (\[23\], pp. 3, 20, 27; \[30,
34\]).

With this perspective, it seems just rational that [we]{.underline}
"disabled, impaired, (chronic) ill, mad, D/deaf, neurodiverse (among
other crip ways of being) people" and especially
[cripborgs]{.underline}, [do not need to be considered and recognized in
the "future-making]{.underline}" (\[6\], p. 4; \[22\], p. 17). This
includes the production of technology (with Adaptive Technology),
besides the continuous contributions of us not only as end-users but, as
Liz Jackson put it, the "Original Lifehackers" \[37\]. [We become either
**never born**]{.underline} (because of reproductive
technologiesFootnote 12) **[or "cured" and normalized]{.underline}**.
**[Eugenics is]{.underline}** still **[alive and
thriving]{.underline}**. In its shadow lurks
"**[euthanasia]{.underline}**". It [is horrifying and
frightening]{.underline} to live in a world that wants
**[you]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} **[not-so-abstract
you]{.underline}**, **[as an inhabitant of]{.underline}** the category
**[disability]{.underline}** (which intersects with others that increase
or decrease the vulnerability or protection), **[to be
eradicated]{.underline}** (\[23\], p.46). This has to change.

This is why the Disability Studies and Crip Technoscience perspectives
are of crucial relevance to critically engage with boundary-blurring and
images of the merger of body and technology. This [relevance extends to
the interrogation of the practices and the impact of manufactured
life.]{.underline} Often, [cyborg technologies become an]{.underline}
"evocative [shorthand for adaptive technology]{.underline}, associating
such technology [with a promising future]{.underline} for 'the
disabled.'" [But this "promising future" has a major
downside]{.underline}, as Alison Kafer points out:

[In our disabled state, we are not part of the]{.underline} dominant
[narratives of progress]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} once
[rehabilitated]{.underline}, [normalized]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
hopefully [cured]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} play a
[star]{.underline}ring role: [the sign of progress]{.underline}, the
proof of [development]{.underline}, the [triumph over the mind or
body]{.underline} (\[23\], p. 28).

"Supercrip"Footnote 13 stories spread this kind of narrative (\[23\], p.
141). They are so pervasive, which even disabled people themselves can
find them alluring, especially because they provide a semblance of
agency. I myself have believed in them, as briefly mentioned in the
introduction. Thus, it is not surprising that supercrip stories and
narratives of "promising future" can be found within the discipline of
Neural Engineering. Moreover, they get even more credibility when told
by a disabled person, as one of the most prominent representatives of
the field, [Hugh Herr]{.underline}, exemplifies, which illustrates the
pervasiveness of ableism.

Herr is not only [professor at]{.underline} the [MIT]{.underline} Media
Labs, but also the director of its Biomechatronics Group, [whose tag
line is]{.underline} "**[Towards the end of disability]{.underline}**"
\[39\] and associated editor of the Journal of NeuroEngineering and
Rehabilitation \[40\]. In a TED talk, Hugh Herr says that he is, besides
having highly sophisticated Bionic Legs, "not yet a cyborg" due to the
lack of Neurofeedback: "If I were a cyborg, I could feel my legs, they
would become part of me, part of self" (\[41\], 2m12s-2m17sFootnote 14).
A bit later, he states:

By designing the biological body to better communicate with the built
design world, [humanity will **end disability**]{.underline} in the 21st
century [and]{.underline} [establish the scientific and technological
basis for]{.underline} **[human augmentation]{.underline}**,
[extending]{.underline} human [capability]{.underline},
[beyond]{.underline} innate, [physiological levels,]{.underline}
[cognitively, emotionally and physically]{.underline} (\[41\],
3m27s-3m49s).

Herr follows a more common understanding of cyborg, which is more
closely aligned to Clynes and Kline. And even though there is a surface
compatibility to the definition of "technologized disabled people," the
difference lies in the politics that starts with, but is not limited to,
[the]{.underline} different understanding of the presence of cyborgs,
[stories of **(im)perfection**]{.underline} thus the role of
maintenance, and the body-mind relation. This becomes further evident in
another TED Talk by [Herr]{.underline}, which has over twelve million
views, where he [demonstrates his bionic legs as a kind of]{.underline}
**[technological fix to disability]{.underline}** \[42\].

[These]{.underline} kinds of stories [get amplified b]{.underline}y big
tech companies like [Meta]{.underline} (Facebook's holding company)
[or]{.underline} Elon [Musk's]{.underline} Neuralink that have massively
raised awareness of Neurotechnologies (and subsequently
Neuroengineering) and invested considerable amounts of money in them.
With that, the [influence grows]{.underline} [and]{.underline} also
strengthens [the]{.underline} often-toxic [Silicon Valley
attitude]{.underline} that partly [comes from the]{.underline} **[deep
entrenchment of transhumanist beliefs]{.underline}** \[43\].

For example, Facebook's Reality Labs joins the narrative of portraying
disability as a diminished state from the norm: "Imagine a world where
all the knowledge, fun, and utility of today's smartphones were
instantly accessible and completely hands-free. Where you could spend
quality time with the people who matter most in your life, whenever you
want, no matter where in the world you happen to be. And where you could
connect with others in a meaningful way, regardless of external
distractions, geographic constraints, and even physical disabilities and
limitations" (\[44\], own emphasis).

Musk said that "**[Neuralink will 'solve]{.underline}** a lot of
brain-related diseases,' naming **[autism and
schizophrenia]{.underline}** as examples". Fortunately, the author of
the article adds: "Autism is not a disease" \[45\]. But is
schizophrenia? This question relates to Margaret Price's writing on
pain, able-mindedness, and [the label of "mental
illnesses]{.underline}," which, in this work, I can only point to [as
another site of inquiry]{.underline} \[24\].

Neuralink demonstrates perfectly how hype is generated, how it is
"constitutive" and mobilizes "the future into the present," in parts due
to the "difficulties in the legitimacy of biotech" (\[46\], p. 6). It
also serves as a perfect example for a specific type of ableism that is
utmost relevant for this work: **[technoableism]{.underline}**, a term
coined by Shew explicitly to grapple with ableism [in "the context of
imagination, technology, and bodies]{.underline}" and [describes "a
rhetoric of disability that]{.underline} at once [talks about
**empowering disabled people**]{.underline} through technologies
[while]{.underline} at the same time [**reinforcing ableist tropes**
about **what body-minds are good** to have and who counts as
worthy]{.underline}." [Technoableism allows]{.underline} "[to
recognize]{.underline} and work against ideas that reimpose and
[**reinforce ableist claptrap** under the **guise of
empowerment**]{.underline}" (\[47\], p. 43).

Very recently, Musk has "trotted out" pigs to showcase Neuralink's new
**[Brain-Computer-Interface]{.underline}** (BCI) [implant]{.underline}
that can connect to a smartphone \[48\]. Beyond that, Neuralink is not
very noteworthy regarding its technical capabilities, and much of its
presentation [was]{.underline} "[science theatre]{.underline}" that
resembled known spectacles as Danielle Carr pointed out \[49\]. Another
recurring aspect is animal testing as site of technology development and
practices of manufacturing life. Here, we are within the complex
networks of non-innocent and "forced into 'becoming with'" (\[36\],
p.37) intra-relations of human-animal-technology entanglements and
chimeras that cannot be put in neatly purified categories on their own.
[Brain-Computer Interfaces]{.underline}, [especially]{.underline} those
[that need to be surgically inserted]{.underline} into or planted onto
the brain and are therefore deemed rightfully invasive,
[are]{.underline} **[tested]{.underline}** in later stages almost
**[exclusively on disabled people]{.underline}**, while most
non-invasive interfaces "are built and tested on able-bodied
individuals" (\[50\], p.1).

[There is something to be said about the]{.underline} possible
**[kinship between laboratory animals and disabled people]{.underline}**
[through positioning within these systems (and beyond).]{.underline} I
cannot explore this here, but I want to point out that such a connection
must be made with utmost care as [it]{.underline} likely [furthers **the
precarity of personhood status for disabled people**]{.underline}.
Especially when **[racism]{.underline}**, [and its reliance]{.underline}
on charges of **[animality]{.underline}** [towards]{.underline}
[racialized people, is part of the intersection and thus]{.underline}
further [threatening for (disabled) BIPOC]{.underline}. [Even more so in
the context of]{.underline} the decontextualized and disembodied
engineering on the nervous system that relies on image giving
proce[dures and (purified) representations of signals from the nervous
system.]{.underline} These [data and models become]{.underline} the
object and might create what Stephen Horrocks calls "Datafied Body
Doubles: [numerical stand-ins for the body that construct them as both
usable and controllable]{.underline}" (\[51\], p.1--2).Footnote 15
[Decontextualized]{.underline} and disembodied, [it can]{.underline}
just [too easily be "conflated with whiteness" so that]{.underline}
"**[whiteness as information]{.underline}**" [is the
default]{.underline} [and]{.underline} "**[in control of the body and
other bodies]{.underline}**" (\[53\], p. 2,6,7).

This underlines how crucial engagement of Science and Technology Studies
--- but even more Critical Disability Studies --- with Neural
Engineering is needed, and to analyze such assemblages in an
intersectional-kyriarchal understanding. This does not prevent the
foregrounding of certain aspects. However, it should thwart single-issue
considerations when having the complex webbed networks of interlocking
systems of privilege and oppression in mind.

#### The alternative is the emancipation of cognitive biotechnology into the hands of the disabled, allowing "crip world-remaking" and self-determination for those who need this technology. Reject the 1AC's "curative imaginary" and focus on "earthly survival" for disabled people as the praxis for neuro-technological development by endorsing a "bodymind" ontology that subverts the compulsory abled mind

I might have painted a rather dire picture of the current state of
Neural Engineering. But it is my conviction that an
"[autre-mondialisation]{.underline}" (\[36\], p. 3) ---
[another]{.underline}, more just, [more caring world]{.underline} ---
[can be materialized]{.underline}. [While there are deeply ingrained
(techno)ableist assumptions]{.underline}, (**[neuro-)technology is
not]{.underline}** per se **[an "anathema to crip
worldremaking]{.underline}**" (\[6\], p.3) [but]{.underline} **[vital
for disabled peoples' survival and flourishing.]{.underline}**

According to Nicolas Berberich, the "[main motivation for]{.underline}
building [assistive technologies is to enable disabled people to lead an
active and **self-determined life**]{.underline}" (\[10\], p. 21), which
is a good place to start. But as Sara Goering and Eran Klein point [out,
Neural Engineers have]{.underline} almost [no]{.underline} [context with
disabled people]{.underline}, often [seeing them only as
testers]{.underline}, [in a phase where the device is
advanced]{.underline}, and the options for change limited \[54\].
Nevertheless, their ethnographic work shows that [there is an awareness
of the lack of exchange and a desire for change]{.underline}:

[If the neural engineering community wants to address the highest
priority needs of the population]{.underline}, I think [we have to
understand those needs much better than we do now]{.underline} (\[54\],
p. 11).

This finding coincides with my own experiences with Neuro-Engineers
while doing intra-ventionist and ethnographic fieldwork. As one
participant answered when asked by the course organizer why the
particpant thinks that a Disability Studies lecture (held by me) was
part of the sessions:

Because the course is centered around building tools that would be
helpful for maybe a disabled person. And therefore, it is useful to
understand their point of view and to gain a better understanding of the
problems they are really facing and problems that they don't really
face, but we just care about solving (own transcription, also provided
in \[10\], p. 48).

Based upon my positioning and (auto)ethnographic work, the question that
concerns me is "[How to engage with]{.underline} and 'critique
generatively' [Neural Engineering in a way, that]{.underline} '[**holds
in tension** the **unjust imperatives** of technoscientific innovation
with the **transformative capacities** to shape matter and meaning
through praxis]{.underline}'?" (\[55\], p. 756; \[56\], p.21).

My tentative approach to this [is a "method assemblage]{.underline}"
\[57\] that I put together to guide and inform my approach,
conceptualization, and narration. I named this "monster" and "boundary
creature" that I'm "co-minded" and "becoming with" \[20, 29, 36\]
Criptical Neural Engineering (see Fig. 1), where criptical is a
portmanteau of "crip(borg)," "critical," and "cryptical":

Crip(borg) as it privileges disabled perspectives on "cyborg
technologies." [The **cripborg**]{.underline} [is "a disabled person who
selects technologies whilst anticipating the world they will
encounter]{.underline}" (\[28\], p. 2). [With that, the active
"**world-making**," "**world-dismantling**," and "**world-remaking**"
are focused]{.underline} \[56\]. [We are not only "end-users," but we
**shape technologies**]{.underline} (and have done this already for a
long time).

[Critical for the "ethico-onto-epistemological" "response-ability" and
accountability]{.underline} for the multiple ways assemblages, including
method assemblages, can [emerge and bring "objects into
reality"]{.underline} or out of it in specific contexts, their nodes,
[and their material-semiotic effects]{.underline} (\[59\], p. 90;
\[60\]). [This is accompanied]{.underline} [by the necessity for an
"**exploration of emancipatory potentials** that could **enable** those
affected by current developments to participate in the relevant
processes and practices to improve them or replace them with better
ones]{.underline}" (\[61\], p. 64).

Cryptical as we are [disabled, mad, neurodiverse (and other bodymind
variants), people]{.underline} who often [appear incomprehensible to the
non-disabled world]{.underline}. [Our bodyminds are "**written out of
the future**"]{.underline} (\[23\], p. 46) [and]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} **[written out of history]{.underline}**.
[Yet]{.underline}, [we undeniably shape the worlds we live]{.underline}
and find not only discomfort and unwanted pain, but also pleasure in (as
for example the origin of the modern dildo shows), [which is often
subliminal for many non-disabled people and ableist
institutions]{.underline} \[37, 54, 62\]. [With that]{.underline}, [our
beings, ways, and actions appear as cryptic because they are not
recognized, not decipherable, and thus mystic --- and so are
we]{.underline}. [This is evident in the unthinkability of the position
of "**disability as desirable**]{.underline}," [the]{.underline}
**[devaluing of neurological differences]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[onto-epistemological
violence]{.underline}** \[6, 20, 63\].

Criptical Neural Engineering as mutually affecting method assemblage
(inspired by \[58\], p. 875)

With that, I assume a position in which [it is necessary to not just
include disabled perspectives as resources but to center
us]{.underline}, especially those who engage with neurotechnologies in
the making, [as neurotechnologies' becoming is inextricably linked
to]{.underline} the ways [disabled people]{.underline} encounter the
world.

[The]{.underline} knowledge [actions of]{.underline} the [often
non-disabled **engineers**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} placed [**in
the service of disabled people** and cripborgs]{.underline}, serving [to
enable accessible and queercrip futures]{.underline}. Through this
shift, [the "**curative imaginary**]{.underline}, an understanding [of
disability that]{.underline} not only expects and assumes intervention
but also [cannot]{.underline} [imagine or comprehend anything other than
intervention" is no longer the main focus]{.underline} in producing
neurotechnologies. [Instead, the "**earthly survival**" of cripborgs and
disabled people becomes the focal point]{.underline} (\[23\], p. 27f).

I use the figure of "prototyping" to convey a preliminary status. But
that does not imply that Criptical Neural Engineering is reaching a
"finished" state somewhen. [As an assemblage, it is always
becoming]{.underline}.

[Feminist STS follows]{.underline} feminism's history of
"[theoriz\[ing\] from practice]{.underline}" (\[23\], p. 14). It calls
for attention to the politics of knowledge and technology production
(including the own), the importance of embodiment, location, and
subjectivity \[64\]. Taking [accountability and responsibility are
cornerstones]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} also [includes engaging
with technoscience, striving for "better accounts of the
world]{.underline}" (\[33\], p. 585ff.).

**[Crip Technoscience]{.underline}** builds upon that, as the name
already suggests, and enriches Feminist STS by demanding disability to
be recognized. It [is **political, unruly, questions compulsory
abledness,** and focuses **disabled "knowing-making"**]{.underline}
(\[56\], p. 3) [It "calls attention to the powerful, messy,
non-innocent, contradictory, and nevertheless crucial work of (...)
practices of critique, alteration, and reinvention of our
material-discursive world]{.underline}" (\[56\], p.1). Two claims are
foundational for Crip Technoscience: [first, that "natural and built
**environments are constructed**, rather than given]{.underline}," [and
second, tha]{.underline}t "science and [**technology shape the
expression, enactment, or elimination of disability**, impairment,
madness, d/Deafness, neurodiversity, chronic conditions, and
illness]{.underline}." (\[6\], p.3).

[Central]{.underline} for Crip Technoscience [are "four political
commitments]{.underline}": **["center\[ing\] the work of disabled people
as knowers and makers," "access as friction," "interdependence as
political technology," and "disability justice."]{.underline}**

[The first commitment acknowledges disabled people as "**epistemic
activists**" that are situated "to produce the material conditions that
allow disability to thrive."]{.underline} [The second]{.underline}
commitment [highlights that access is]{.underline} a
[political]{.underline} process. It can mean ["an opportunity enabling
contact]{.underline}," [but also "a]{.underline} kind of
[attack]{.underline}." [Access]{.underline} is understood [**beyond**
liberal and **assimilation**-based approaches and includes]{.underline}
direct [actions of disabled people that encompass "acts of
**non-compliance and protest**.]{.underline}" [The]{.underline} third
commitment [calls attention for]{.underline} the "relational circuits
between bodies, environments, and [tools to **create non-innocent,
frictional access**]{.underline}." [The fourth]{.underline} commitment
"[emphasizes tha]{.underline}t **[disabled people are not]{.underline}**
mere **[consumers]{.underline}** of, **[or objects for, assimilationist
technologies]{.underline}**, but instead [have]{.underline} **[agential,
politicized, and transformative relationships to
technoscience]{.underline}**" \[56\].

Critical Neuroscience connects with Feminist STS and Crip Technoscience
through [the "exploration of emancipatory potentials]{.underline} that
could enable those affected" (\[61\], p. 63). It also provided me with a
framework for possible activities that enriched the broader outlines of
Crip Technoscience by a more specific approach to Neuroscience. [It
acknowledges the produced knowledge]{.underline} while stating that the
"cultural contexts (...) adds new meaning" like processes of
"reification." [A goal is to offer "alternative experimental
designs]{.underline}," which is similar to Goering's goal of "educating"
Neural Engineers through CBPR (\[20\], p. 47).

[New Materialism is not]{.underline} a [monolithic]{.underline} approach
either. The aspects I chose come from Michael Feely's engagement with it
from a Disability Studies perspective. [Deleuze's and Guattari's flat
ontologies are also present]{.underline} in [and can be]{.underline}
neatly [exemplified by Haraway's and Barad's]{.underline} writing with
the [material-semiotic understanding of matter]{.underline} \[33, 59,
65\]. [**Matter** is no longer passive, but active]{.underline} (even
vibrant), [political, and]{.underline} also **[refuses
re-essentialization]{.underline}**. [It adds to the DeleuzoGuattarian
understanding of **bodies in an anti-essentialist mode**]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} viewing them with [a lens of "actual" and
"virtual" capabilities]{.underline}.Footnote 16 [This makes it possible
to regard]{.underline} the scientific knowledge of [material sciences
and not neglect them]{.underline}. Instead, [they "can]{.underline} and
do [tell us what]{.underline} certain [entities]{.underline} [can or
cannot do within specific contexts]{.underline} (...) [and allow us
create things which increase the number of things a body can
do]{.underline}" (\[58\], p. 871; \[67, 68\]).

[The bodymind]{.underline} concept [follows]{.underline} this [by
rejecting the "Cartesian divide"]{.underline} \[56\]. This is not simply
additive but demands that we fundamentally reconfigure our understanding
\[24\]. "**[Bodymind" subverts]{.underline}** ideas of **[a compulsory
abled mind that is "trapped" in a disabled body]{.underline}**, [or of a
separate disabled mind or mental illness from a]{.underline}n otherwise
seemingly **[natural non-disabled body]{.underline}**. Furthermore[,
this subversion allows us to **situate affect, sensations, and
identity** as fulminant **materialized embodiment without
essentializing** it]{.underline}. With that, [questions regarding the
merger of corporeality and technology change]{.underline}. [If
we]{.underline} [understand us as bodyminds]{.underline}, [inscribing
technology is not limited to our materiality, but incorporates
our]{.underline} incomplete "[split and contradictory"
selves]{.underline} and positions, as Goering has argued \[20\].
[This]{.underline} can be grasped by an intersectional and
kyriarchalFootnote 17 analytical understanding that [exposes
the]{.underline} [interlocking systems of oppression and privilege in
which]{.underline} relative [privilege can be]{.underline} understood as
[context-dependent, **avoiding static and reductive images** in analyses
\[]{.underline}3\].

[Science is part of]{.underline} the [societies]{.underline} we live in
[and]{.underline} thus [not outside of]{.underline} the interlocking
systems of [oppression and privilege]{.underline}. [This includes Neural
Engineerin]{.underline}g and the application of "engineering principles
and neuroscience methods to analyze neurological functions" (\[11\], p.
286). [There needs to be a fundamental **acknowledgment of** science(s)
and **engineering** as **"world-building** and **world-dismantling**
practices" that are intensely **political**]{.underline} (\[56\], p. 4).
[It needs more than compartmentalize-able ethics courses]{.underline} in
(engineering) education, [but an understanding that **the technical is
inextricably interwoven with ethics, politics, the social, and the
"unmaking and making of definite realities**]{.underline}" (\[57\], p.
32).

[Otherwise]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} questionable, and yet
[unquestioned, assumptions about disability and]{.underline} other
categories like [race, gender, sexuality, class, etc. will remain in the
development of new technologies]{.underline}. [This will result in
a]{.underline} continuing **[onto-epistemological cycle of
violence]{.underline}**Footnote 18 [as "the space for technologies
\[is\]]{.underline} almost exclusively \[[demarcated\] to domains of
**cure, therapy and intervention**]{.underline} --- [all of which are
tied to]{.underline} **[rhetorics removing]{.underline}** the
intricacies of **[disabled lives]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} the
range of [human experiences]{.underline}" (\[63\], p. 2).

With Criptical Neural Engineering, I try to find a way to [engage
with]{.underline} the field of [Neural Engineering in a generative way
that **does not forget** the "unjust imperatives of technoscientific
innovation]{.underline}," [while]{.underline} at the same time
[**acknowledging that the "transformative capacities**" which "shape
matter and meaning through praxis" are central and can be used **for an
"autre-mondialisation**" that fosters "**disability
justice**"]{.underline} (\[36\], p.3; \[56\], p. 21f).

But until [the]{.underline} (already [emerging yet]{.underline} still
[fragile]{.underline}) [change will take place and build accessible and
inhabitable futures where disabled, impaired, (chronically) ill, mad,
D/deaf, neurodiverse, queer, crip, queercrip (among other ways of)
beings can flourish, we are mostly **struggling to survive** against and
within interlocking systems that frame us (some more than others,
depending on intersecting positions) as icons of an "**undesirable
future**," a future "no one wants," resulting in our **eradication**
(\[23\], p. 2).]{.underline}

[We have to ask]{.underline} **[whose life gets (not) manufactured, by
whom]{.underline}**, as well as **[for what and why.]{.underline}**

[Critique of Neuroessentialism]{.underline}

A [narrow interpretation of]{.underline} the **[neuroscientific
evidence]{.underline}** could [lead to a **one-dimensional**
understanding of the **mind--brain problem.**]{.underline} Two major
issues can be raised against neuroessentialism. [First, there is the
**danger** of **reducing human behavior** to **neurobiology** and using
various techniques, **psychopharmacology**, or **neurotechnologies** to
**manipulate human behavior** for **social purposes**.]{.underline} The
hope is to use a neuroessentialist framework for the enhancement of
certain character traits deemed socially desirable, as exemplified by
Peter Reiner who states that

[the mores of society are widely discussed in the news
media]{.underline}, sometimes [when a prominent figure exhibits a lapse
in ethical behavior but also in the vigorous public debate of the
"culture wars]{.underline}". ... One useful suggestion would be for
neuroessentialists to join social theorists and educators in calling for
improvements in moral and character education ... thereby aligning
social policy with the rise of neuroessentialism. 28 : 170

(p.46) [This alignment between **social policy** and **science qua
neuroessentialism** to determine and/or alter behavior has an air of
déjà vu in the history of **psychiatry**]{.underline} (i.e.,
phrenology). Italian psychiatrist Cesare [Lombroso]{.underline}
(1835--1909), considered the founder of modern criminology, elaborated a
theory based on evolutionary principles and body, skull, and brain
physiology. In his work---since discredited---he [attempted to explain
criminal behavior through]{.underline} an interpretation of [physical
deviances]{.underline} such as large jaw, large ears, thick skull, and
certain neuroanatomy. 37 Although [neuroessentialism and
phrenology]{.underline} have different premises to support their claims,
both perspectives [attempt to explain behavior based on
**neuroanatomical** **characteristics**]{.underline}.

At this point, based on clinical evidence, it seems unclear whether
specific behaviors (e.g., psychopathy) are acquired in childhood or
adolescence due to neuroanatomical abnormalities (e.g., damage to the
orbital frontal cortex can affect affective and cognitive processes
essential for moral deliberation). In addition, any explanation of human
behavior based solely on neuroanatomical characteristics should warrant
some caution. T. B. Benning points out that there is a danger of
stigmatization grounded on alleged neuroscience evidence. As he writes,
"[a brain scan diagnosis of psychopathy legitimises the preventive
incarceration of a 'high-risk' individual]{.underline}, and ... a static
neuro-structural deficit may lead to a therapeutically nihilistic
approach to such an individual on the grounds that ~~he is~~ \[they
are\] 'beyond rehabilitation.' " Combining these two positions---the
perception of an individual as both dangerous and unchanging---may lead
to a "lock them up for good" ethos. 38 : 564 The same claim could be
made with regards to [moral enhancement]{.underline}, which [could
result in a type of social engineering based on certain behavioral
standards or expectations]{.underline}. 2 , 8 The [alignment of social
policy with **neuroessentialism**]{.underline} could [reinforce
**stigmatization** and undermine **cognitive liberty**]{.underline}. 39
, 40 , 41 , ii

The second issue relates the human moral psychology. The way that [some
proponents of cognitive enhancement conceptualize morality does not
capture the **complexity** of **human moral psychology**]{.underline}.
Consider the following characterizations of morality:

According to our preferred view, the core of our moral dispositions
comprises, first, a disposition to altruism, to sympathize with other
beings, to want their lives to go well rather than badly for their own
sakes. Few would deny that this disposition is central to morality 42 :
168

or

I \[Douglas\] will take it as a suggestion that we cause ourselves to
have morally better motives ... I understand motives to be the (p.47)
psychological---mental or neural---states or processes that will, given
the absence of opposing motives, cause a person to act. Since I focus
only on motives, I will not claim that the morally enhanced person is
more moral, has a more moral character, or will necessarily act more
morally than her earlier, unenhanced self. I will also try to avoid
committing myself to any particular view about what determines the moral
goodness of a motive. 3 : 229

One could also consider the project of [**enhancing morality** by means
of **genetic manipulations**, postulating the genetic basis of
behavioral traits: "Since genes influence enduring behaviors, it might
be possible to use biotechnology in a manner that would promote virtue,
and thus serve as a means to improve ourselves, morally
speaking."]{.underline} 43

While recognizing that [these three conceptualizations of
morality]{.underline} do not represent comprehensively the moral
enhancement debate, they nevertheless [exemplify the potential failure
to consider the **complexity** of **human behavior** and the nature of
**moral** **judgments**. A reductionistic approach]{.underline} is
problematic because, as stated previously, it [limits morality to moral
emotions but does not take into account that **moral agents** have
developed particular understandings of notions of the **good**, the
**right**, and the **just** that shape **behavior** and **moral
identity**]{.underline}---a point more fully developed in the next
section. In other words, moral intuitions do not operate in isolation
but are informed by normative claims for their justification. This point
is clearly made by Sinnott-Armstrong, who contends that "to determine
whether moral beliefs \[moral intuitions\] really are justified, we need
to move beyond psychological description to the normative epistemic
issue of how we ought to form moral beliefs." 44 : 48

In addition, there is strong evidence that [adaptive changes in neural
pathways occur in the brain based on **environmental** **changes** (such
as social context, family context, etc.)]{.underline}. Therefore, [to
assume that "we are our brains" is misleading]{.underline}. As human
beings and moral agents, individuals are shaped by external factors such
as the environment, the cultural context, and narratives. The brain's
ability to change its circuits and functions is the result of the brain
interacting with external elements that, in turn, create a synergy
between internal and external factors. As Glannon puts it, "[the ability
of the brain to alter its circuits and functions is not a property of
the brain operating independently of external factors but of dynamic
interaction between the brain and these factors]{.underline}." 45 This
process describes [neuroplasticity]{.underline} , which [is the ability
of the brain to adapt to these external factors]{.underline}. It refers
to a "change in neural structures and is usually the result of
activity-dependent change in the interconnections among cells that
constitute the structures. Enduring changes in structure result from
repeated activation of some cells and pathways more than others,
following (p.48) the principle that neurons that fire together wire
together." 46 [The **development** of a **sophisticated** **model of
morality**, one grounded on the **latest advances** in **neuroscience**
concerning **brain** **structure** and **functions**, necessitates
**avoiding** a **blind trust** in the ability of these modalities to
address, in isolation, complex questions related to human behavior.
Progress in understanding the brain and human behavior must align with
the traditional disciplines of ethics, and vice versa.]{.underline}

This is not to say that there is no connection between brain structures
or neurochemicals and human behavior. In the case of mental illness
(especially neuropsychiatric disorders that affect behavior), "bad
character" is not the issue but rather a neurochemical imbalance in
conjuncture with environmental factors. However, [in the context of
moral enhancement, we are dealing with "**normal and healthy**"
individuals who do not suffer from **psychiatric
conditions**]{.underline}. Hence, the appeal to neuroessentialist
constructs in discussions about the possibility of enhancing people
morally is misleading.

Psychopharmacological and neurostimulation techniques assume that
interventions on the brain, chemically or through electric stimulation,
will heighten some character traits. This position is shortsighted
because it does not take into account that [**environmental**,
**cultural**, and **historical** determinants shape the brain and
mind]{.underline}. As Walter Glannon rightly states, "the mind emerges
from and is shaped by interaction among the brain, body, and environment
... . [We are embodied minds in the sense that our mental states are
generated and sustained by the **brain** and its **interaction** with
**external** and **internal features** of our bodies. We are also
**embedded** minds in the sense that the **content** and **quality** of
our mental states is shaped by how we act within the **social** and
**natural environment**]{.underline}." 45 Glannon's points corroborate
psychiatrist Thomas Fuchs's critique of neuroreductionism (the
biological reductionism of the mind to the brain); he argues that the
expression "you are but a pack of neurons" or "you are just your brain"
is a category error and scientifically erroneous (an alternative
approach to neuroessentialism is provided in the next section
particularly with regard to social practices). In his view, "the brain
is only an organ, and it is not the brain, but the organism or the
living person that has conscious access to the world." 47 cited in 45:
26 [**Moral agency** requires individuals to engage in the world in
relation to others, which in turn **shapes** and **determines** one's
own (**moral) identity** (moral capacity and moral content). This point
is further corroborated by Shapiro 48 who rejects **neuroreductionism**
on the ground that the mind by itself is unable to **perceive** and
**interpret** any outside information.]{.underline} In other words, [the
mind and the body complete each other. He defends a position called the
**embodied mind thesis** , which stipulates that **psychological
processes**, to be complete, depend on the **inputs** of the
body]{.underline}. In short, as Shapiro puts it, perceptual capacities
such as vision and audition cannot stand in "body-neutrality." 48

#### Neurobiological technology's control of brain activity [precludes]{.underline} independent moral thought.

In this section, I expand my criticism of neuroessentialism particularly
in relation to the concept of moral agency. [If the premise that "we are
the brain" is correct, it means that, in principle, human behavior can
be altered or manipulated at will through **psychopharmacological**
**means** or **brain** **stimulation**. Brain areas associated with
**basic** and **moral** **emotions**]{.underline} (including the
amygdala, thalamus, upper midbrain, medial orbitofrontal cortex, medial
frontal gyrus, and right posterior superior temporal sulcus) [can be
manipulated to achieve particular **behavioral**
**outcomes**.]{.underline} For instance, [using techniques
like]{.underline} functional magnetic resonance imaging ([fMRI), a
**b**]{.underline}rain--**[c]{.underline}**omputer
**[i]{.underline}**nterface [can be developed to **regulate** **brain**
**activity** for]{.underline} [the treatment of disorders of cognition,
emotions, and behavior]{.underline} (e.g., psychopathy, pedophilia; see
Sitaram, Caria, and Birnbaumer 49 and Renaud et al. 50 ). The approach
of these procedures suggests the activation and the reinforcement of
neural pathways in the brain associated with particular behaviors. 51 ,
52

Although these techniques might have the potential to treat or at least
mitigate the symptoms of mental disorders such as psychopathy and
pedophilia, [it is]{.underline} nevertheless im[portant to examine how
patterns of behaviors are acquired]{.underline}. Specifically, [closer
attention should focus on the factors, such as **upbringing**, **culture
assumptions**, **social environment**]{.underline}, and the like, [that
determine and shape one's **moral** **identity** and **neurobiological**
**makeup**]{.underline}. Many [neurobiological systems]{.underline}
(e.g., the neural basis of morality) ["must be '**tuned** **up'** by
experience in order to **reinforce** and **motivate** **normal**
**behavior**, including **moral** **behavior**."]{.underline} 53 : 46 In
other words, [individuals develop **character** **traits** and a
**moral** **identity** shaped by their **neurobiology** but]{.underline}
also [by their **upbringing**, understanding of the good, and life
experience.]{.underline} This [**dual** **dimension** of **moral**
**development** constitutes the **internal** and **external
constraints** of moral agency]{.underline}. 5 [The internal constraints
concern the neural basis of morality or the capacity]{.underline} of an
individual [to respond morally grounded on]{.underline} ~~his or her~~
[\[their\] **neurobiology** and **psychological makeup**]{.underline}.
But the [capacity to respond to moral dilemmas]{.underline} is likewise
[shaped by external factors such as life experience, beliefs, values,
and presuppositions]{.underline}. Moral decisions, then, need particular
philosophical and moral perspectives developed within the social context
of the family and the broader community, which in turn shape and refine
particular moral emotions. To reiterate Sinnott-Armstrong, 44 [**moral
beliefs** are justified by moving beyond a purely psychological account
of moral life to a normative framework that guides and justifies moral
emotions]{.underline}. The [**justifiability** of one's actions
presupposes]{.underline} a [**specific understanding** of **notions** of
the **good**, the right, and the just based on]{.underline} a particular
[mode of practical reasoning as]{.underline} a [tool for social
interpretation]{.underline}. 54 Specifically, (p.50) this means that
[the idea of a **philosophical** and **moral neutrality** is
**illusory**. Any discussion about morality presupposes a particular
conception of rationality determined by a particular social environment
and conceptions of the good and human flourishing]{.underline}. In
short, [a framework of moral agency presupposing a **moral**
**neutrality** does not take into account the **complexity of moral
life**, which includes **emotional**, **motivational**, and **rational
dimensions** formed throughout one's life.]{.underline}

This last point becomes even clearer [when we look at the nature of
rationality and rational actions]{.underline} through the lens of the
work done by Alasdair [MacIntyre]{.underline} 54 whose inquiry on the
question of practical rationality provides insights pertaining to the
question at hand. He [rightly notes that **rationality** and **rational
actions** are structured differently depending on the **social
context**, **time in history**, and **location**]{.underline}. In his
view, contemporary accounts of rationality and practical reasoning
usually depict agents as uninformed in their rational deliberations by
some processes antecedent to any action. In the words of MacIntyre,

\[In\] contemporary accounts of practical reasoning ... we are presented
... with agents as if detached altogether from any conception of or
perception of the good or goods ... such an individual exemplifies what
I will borrow a phrase from the late A. A. Zhdanov to describe rootless
cosmopolitanism. Such individuals speak ... from a standpoint dictated
by a stage in the dissolution of social traditions at which no form of
practical rationality is any longer possible. 54 : 129, 135

[An alternative to the "rootless cosmopolitanism" framework of practical
reasoning and the resulting dissolution of social traditions
would]{.underline} be to [consider moral deliberation and the
development of moral agency as part of an initiation into practices and
their inherent skills and virtues for the attainment of the internal
goods of these practices.]{.underline} This process of initiation takes
place in various social contexts and includes domains such as science,
politics, games, arts, and family life. 55 Importantly, [each practice
has a history in which particular goals, skills, and
virtues]{.underline} (or standards of excellence) [have been identified,
refined, and accepted]{.underline}. 56 MacIntyre is quick to recognize
that [there is a potential for interpreting his line of reasoning as a
form of relativism or perspectivism]{.underline}. However, his point is
to stress that practical rationality (and its moral dimensions) does not
occur in a vacuum. Individuals engaged in practical rationality inquire
about it from some particular point of view within a social context that
shapes right practices as exemplified within communities. 54 [For
instance, the game of chess, the sport of golf, or the practice of
medicine requires socialization into the nature, goals, and standards
for their practice]{.underline}, which have been (p.51) established,
critiqued, and a[ccepted by the community of chess players, golfers, and
physicians, respectively]{.underline}. Any new participant will need to
be socialized in these communities and will be required to understand
the basic social rules, standards, and ends of the activity before being
identified as a chess player, golfer, or physician. Ultimately,
MacIntyre contends that human beings need to identify characteristics
(concept of the good) that will help them flourish within a social
context at a particular time in history. 54 The application of practical
rationality entails a process of reasoning and learning about the ends
of human existence and the goods necessary to achieve these ends. 57

To summarize, MacIntyre 57 holds that [moral deliberation is an
**endeavor** in which an **individual** constantly engages in the
**evaluation** of **internal and external constraints** essential for
moral agency]{.underline}. 5 , 57 First, [moral agency develops within a
social context embedded in a particular narrative]{.underline}. Although
[neurobiology certainly **influences** and **shapes** the **moral
development** and **makeup of individuals**, **personal** **journeys**
through life, **education**, **interests**, and **human** **relations**
likewise determine one's moral identity]{.underline}. Second reflections
about the nature of the good are essential for human flourishing. [Human
beings are **constantly engaged** in **reasoning** about what
**constitutes** the **ultimate ends** of human existence and how to
**achieve** these **ends**]{.underline}. For MacIntyre, the
**[failure]{.underline}** to [acknowledge that human beings are
"**practical reasoners** about goods]{.underline}" results in their
inability to flourish [because they are unable to define and establish
the nature and goals of practices]{.underline}. 57 These practices are
determined by particular visions of the good life and define one's own
understanding of human flourishing. Third, as individuals develop as
moral agents, they learn through trial and error: that is, each person
goes "through a process of learning, making mistakes, correcting those
mistakes and so moving towards the achievement of excellence, \[in
which\] the individual comes to understand her or himself as in via, in
the middle of a journey." 56 [The consolidation of these various
learning experiences occurs in the application of practical wisdom
(phronesis), which allows the integration of **affective, motivational,
and cognitive processes** in a coherent entity. The final key point is
the necessity to develop the skills for the integration of life
experience and moral reasoning as **necessary conditions** for
**character development**. The failure to do so would result in
"intellectual blindness" and, ultimately, in the development of bad
character because a person with such a trait does not have the knowledge
to recognize what makes right judgment and action]{.underline}. 56
MacIntyre's framework allows us to make an important distinction between
having character traits and having character. The former refers to
behavioral attributes that describe how people carry out particular
activities, whereas the latter describes more fundamental features of an
individual's moral identity and ability to show moral strength. 5 Based
on these definitions, [**moral enhancement technologies** focus on some
**character traits** to achieve particular ends but do not shape the
more **fundamental**]{.underline} (p.52) [**moral** **attributes** of a
moral agent. Moral enhancement technologies place outside constraints to
produce a particular outcome, whereas having **character** requires an
**internal process** that **motivates** an agent to act based on
**reasons** for **action**. 5]{.underline} Building on the earlier
distinction between moral capacity and moral content, [and in the light
of the preceding analysis, a robust understanding of **moral agency**
cannot be limited or reduced to the alteration or manipulation of the
brain structure or brain chemistry to **enhance moral
behavior**.]{.underline} The notion of "moral" or "morality"
intrinsically assumes an interpretation of human flourishing grounded on
a particular understanding of the good. [Technological means, as far as
we know, do not provide any content to **moral deliberation** but only
control **affective** and **motivational responses** to **moral
conundrums**.]{.underline}

#### Post-enhancement discrimination becomes a [new form]{.underline} of ableism -- the aff [cannot]{.underline} solve.

Galton describes [eugenics as the "investigation under which men of a
high type are produced"(Galton, 1883). and it is aimed to "bring as many
influences as can be reasonably employed, to cause the useful classes in
the community to contribute more than their proportion to the next
generation"(]{.underline}Galton, 1904). This vision of eugenics is not
limited to segregation and sexual sterilization two well-known practices
of eugenics but it can also be applied to enhance humans beyond the
species-typical, beyond the normal using genetic manipulations (Ball &
Wolbring, 2013). The only prerequisite is that enhancements produce men
of a high type (Ball & Wolbring). History of Enhancement Humans
throughout history try to add abilities to their body. So far most of
the abilities added were achieved through external means like the
development of tools humans used to add body abilities to their
repertoire. However, scientific and technological advancement
increasingly allow for intervention on the level of the body that will
increasingly generate human bodily enhancements that add abilities to
the body its normally does not have. The [enhancement of the human body
is envisioned to happen through a) genetic interventions whereby the
genome of humans is changed to introduce enhancements to the
bod]{.underline}y b) drugs which are used to add temporary enhancements
especially cognitive enhancements to the human body and c) [the fusion
of technologies with the body.]{.underline} As to technologies nearly
every body part is under technology development (artificial arms,
artificial blood, artificial blood vessels, artificial ears, artificial
eyes, artificial gut, artificial heart, artificial legs, artificial
organs, artificial retina, artificial skin, bionic knee, spinal cord
prostheses, cranial, neural, and other implants, artificial joints,
artificial muscles, artificial noses and tongues, nose on a chip,
bio-artificial kidney, artificial liver, artificial lungs, artificial
discs, artificial hippocampus (a chip implanted under the skull that can
act as a memory repository), brain machine interfaces (implanted or non
implanted version that allow the control of objects by thought that is
linked to a computer), subvocal speech (allowing the translation of
thought into speech through a computer without a need to actually
speak). [The human body is treated by many as an obsolescent technology
in need of serious improvements]{.underline} (Wolbring, 2010). [The ever
increasing ability to generate human bodily enhancement products in many
shape and forms enables a culture of, demand for, and acceptance of
improving and modifying the human body]{.underline} (structure,
function, abilities) [beyond its species-typical
boundaries.]{.underline} This [facilitates the move beyond
species-typical ability expectations toward an enhancement **form of
ableism that expects beyond species-typical of humans**]{.underline}
(Wolbring, 2005; Wolbring, 2006; Wolbring, 2008a; Wolbring, 2010;
Wolbring, 2008b). As Beck states: "The degree to which, as well as the
circumstances under which we want to allow or even support it, who has
to pay for it, and how we can secure equality will be crucial questions
for the following decades." (Beck, 2007) Many type of possible
enhancements are envisioned (Wolbring, 2005). A lively debate exists
around numerous forms of enhancements. Some push for enhancements to be
legalized or at least deregulated (Miah, 2010; Bostrom & Sandberg, 2009;
UK House of Common Science Technology Committee, 2007; Bostrom, 2005;
Savulescu, 2005; Caplan, 2004; Savulescu & Kahane, 2009; Harris, 2010;
Harris, 2011a; Harris, 2011b) others questions [the promotion of an
enhancement form of ableism]{.underline} \[e.g. (Sparrow, 2010; Sparrow,
2012; Koch, 2010; Wasserman, 2012; Bradshaw & ter Meulen, 2010; Larrere,
2010; Agar, 2007; Walters & Palmer, 1996; Ebbesen, Anderson, &
Besenbacher, 2006; Kerr & Wishart, 2008)\]. However in a 2009 "Human
Performance Study" written for the European Parliament one reads,
"Currently however, the EU has no platform for monitoring and discussing
human enhancement issues[. Arenas are lacking where the normative issues
can be politically deliberated and the gap between the needs and the
concerns of the broader public and the practitioners and experts
bridge]{.underline}d" (Coenen, Schuijiff, Smits, Klaassen, Hennen,
Rader, & Wolbring, 2009). The situation is not much different for other
countries and regions of the world. Human Enhancement and people with
disabilities People with disabilities play a main role in the negative
narrative around not being able to reach species-typical abilities.
Indeed the medical model of disability reflects that sentiment. However,
disabled people also are seen to play a role in the enhancement beyond
the species-typical debate. [The time is near were so called
'therapeutic devices,' generated to mimic species-typical body
structures and expected body functioning will outperform in numerous
functions the species-typical bodies giving rise to
'therapeutic']{.underline} enhancements (Wolbring, 2005). [Given this
development it is not surprising that people with disabilities are also
seen to play a key role in mainstreaming and increasing the general
acceptance of especially body techno enhancements]{.underline}
(Wolbring, 2005; Hughes, 2004). However [disabled people might also
serve as an indicator as to what will happen once human enhancements
beyond the species-typical becomes a less than niche reality. People who
are not enhanced **might experience a disablement by the
enhancement-haves in the same way the so called "sub species-typical"
experience disablement by the "species-typical**". Anyone not having
certain beyond species-typical abilities might face discriminative
actions by the ones that have the beyond species-typical abilities
(enhancement social model of disability)]{.underline} (Wolbring, 2010).

The commercialisation and commodification of abilities It is important
to track and critically analyse the commercial, political and cultural
landscape in which human performance enhancement takes shape -- and what
are likely future trajectories. We currently see a legitimisation
process taking place through the complex interaction of a broad range of
actors, preparing the ground for wider acceptance of enhancement and its
commercialisation. One important actor is [the
**military**]{.underline}, which [is pursuing research and development
of human enhancement to improve the capabilities of soldiers, but also
**driving** a **demand** for technological fixes for war veterans
impaired by combat]{.underline}. The gaming industry is another, quite
different, actor that is simultaneously creating new demands and market
opportunities for enhancement. The increasing sophistication of computer
games, creation of virtual realities and new interfaces between player
and machine are likely creating acceptance and temptations for a
step-by-step move towards enhancements and increasing humanmachine
integration. Sport is a third factor that likely increases the
legitimisation of enhancement. Although deeply contested, doping is
already pervasive and is seen as something unavoidable by many, both
among athletes and the public (it is interesting to consider how the
roles and status of the Olympics and the Para-olympics may shift in the
future; what will be the implications when the best performances and
records are all being achieved in the Para-olympics by 'impaired'
athletes with extraordinary enhancements?). 30 In this legitimisation
context it is of critical importance to anticipate the next moves by
different interest groups. How, for example, will the pharmaceutical
industry move into the realm of enhancement? This is where very likely a
great deal of future profit will reside, and there are thus tremendously
strong forces in motion. The commercialisation of the body is about to
take another fundamental leap. Will we see a shift to enhancement drugs
rather than 'sick people's drugs', with all traditionally 'normal' and
'healthy' persons as potential customers -- if they can afford them? The
market logic behind these developments is powerful. [Even if many people
would be instinctively hesitant]{.underline} to take enhancement drugs
or treatment to improve their capabilities, [many would]{.underline}
probably [be inclined to do so if they were given the right
reason]{.underline} or found themselves in particular circumstances.
[The rat-race of ability competition will make many feel obliged to join
in]{.underline} -- in order [to keep the job]{.underline}, [succeed in
school or]{.underline} simply keep up with all the
[stresses]{.underline} of modern life. Those not able or willing to join
in will lose out. Science, technology, governance and democracy -- ways
forward Human performance enhancement is only one aspect of new,
emerging and converging technologies with implications for the
disability and ableism discourse -- and society at large. For example,
new technologies that enable constant monitoring of body functions and
implanted chips that keep track of where a person is located may be
justified as useful devices to help sick and 'impaired' people with
illnesses such as Alzheimers, but [there is]{.underline} also the danger
of [a slippery slope towards a **surveillance society** with massive
**centralised control** of our lives.]{.underline} [The social
acceptance]{.underline} level [of sensors and]{.underline} of [being
monitored]{.underline}, as well as public sharing of personal
information, [are increasing constantly]{.underline} -- just consider
the phenomenon of Facebook. 32 New [converging technologies]{.underline}
will also [play a major role in combating climate change]{.underline}.
On the one hand, [new]{.underline} [large-scale, quick-fix solutions --
'geo-engineering']{.underline} -- [are]{.underline} currently
[undergoing]{.underline} a legitimisation process, from having been
completely taboo a few years back. 33 However, we can also foresee a
development where '[adaptation' to climate change is not only confined
to the physical and socio-economic environment but also to the human
body]{.underline}. As living conditions change and become more extreme
due to global warming[, the demand and market for alteration of the
human body and mind will]{.underline} likely [escalate]{.underline}. The
[existential crises]{.underline} associated with a climate spinning out
of control [will open up possibilities for new, 'therapeutic'
interventions]{.underline}. [Common to all these examples is a lack of
discourse]{.underline} around social impact, risk and governance[, as
well as a lack of participation by marginalized and directly affected
groups]{.underline}. [We need to ask what abilities we cherish and for
whom they should be available when]{.underline}, for example, we discuss
adaptation and mitigation to climate change. [Do 'impaired' people have
the same needs and are their needs assessments visible]{.underline}?
[What would a transhumanised model of ableism mean for responses to
climate change]{.underline}? Would it mean the modification of the body
beyond the species-typical as a means to adapt? [Who would have
access]{.underline}? What would this mean for other possible options?
All these possible trajectories force us to tackle some very deeply
rooted notions that have significantly shaped our modern societies, for
example the privileging of certain values -- such as competitiveness --
over others -- such as empathy -- and to think about what abilities are
favoured and seen as progress. What kind of progress and knowledge is it
that we most need, to deal successfully with the multiple challenges
confronting us today? What is needed to create sustainable, equitable
and resilient societies? What is development really about? Clearly, the
political, economic and ability context in which science, technology and
social policy are developed is at the core and needs to be discussed in
open, critical ways. [This is certainly one of the most important
conversations that should take place in our societies.
Scientists]{.underline}, commercial interests, government [decision
makers]{.underline}, civil society [organisations and social movements
need a]{.underline} much broader, **[holistic analysis]{.underline}**
[of the impacts of science and technology developments.]{.underline} As
Wendy Harcourt exemplifies from the women's movement, this may not be
all that easy and fast -- but it is utterly necessary. 34 Civil society
has a particularly critical role in mobilising and influencing other
actors -- but only a handful of organisations have so far grasped the
magnitude of the NBIC challenges and applied a framework which puts
ableism centre-stage. It is my firm conviction that [the confluence of
challenges confronting us **cannot be dealt with successfully without
explicitly addressing** various aspects of **ableism**.]{.underline}
Even the most techno-optimistic groups such as the World Transhumanism
Association acknowledge that we are moving into realms where, [wrongly
used]{.underline}, the [new]{.underline} powerful [technologies may lead
to]{.underline} catastrophic scenarios and **[an end to
humanity]{.underline}**. 35 This, if anything, justifies an approach
where our options for [the future are discussed in the most serious and
**critical way**]{.underline} -- and where [we are prepared really to
act with caution and **say no** until we are **convinced**]{.underline}
[about what is a reasonable direction]{.underline} for the future. If we
do not act now [we are sleepwalking into a society which will move from
today's]{.underline} -- unacceptable -- [disableism to]{.underline} its
transhumanised form, with [**direct and dire consequences** for the
**large majority of the global population**]{.underline} and the
pluralism so needed among humans.

Ability divides and the techno-poor impaired [Enhancement technologies
will]{.underline} very likely [generate]{.underline} new ability
**[divides.]{.underline}** This would follow the pattern of the divides
that developed after the introduction of many other technologies. As [we
seem incapable of narrowing]{.underline} most of the [other
divides]{.underline} (remember [the]{.underline} vast majority of
[web]{.underline} pages that [are]{.underline} still [not accessible to
blind people]{.underline}) and a large part of the world's population
still do not have the ability to access clean water and electricity [it
is doubtful that we will be able]{.underline} -- under current policies
-- [to close new ability divides despite transhumanists]{.underline} and
others [stating that wealth will]{.underline} eventually [trickle
down]{.underline}. 22 Furthermore, the introduction of every [new
technology]{.underline} has [led to]{.underline} a new group of
[marginalised people and]{.underline} to [new inequalities]{.underline}.
As much as human enhancement technology is set to become an
[**enabling** technology **for the few**]{.underline}, it [will become a
**disabling** technology **for the many**]{.underline}. 23 If we
continue on the present trajectory of rapidly expanding application and

certainly also [see]{.underline} the appearance of [a new
underclass]{.underline} of people -- [the 'unenhanced']{.underline}, or
to use another concept of mine, [the 'techno-poor impaired and
disabled']{.underline} people, people [who are labelled
'impaired']{.underline} and who encounter disableism because they do not
have the enhanced abilities. A transhumanisation of ability divides can
also be expected. Indeed, people and groups who promote human
enhancement use the existence of other societally accepted divides to
justify why an increasing divide stemming from enhancement should also
be accepted. As the World Transhumanist Association argues in response
to the risk of an increasing ability divide: 'Rich parents send their
kids to better schools and provide them with resources such as personal
connections and information technology that may not be available to the
less privileged. Such advantages lead to greater earnings later in life
and serve to increase social inequalities.' 24 I would argue strongly
against this line of argument. [Existing inequalities cannot be made an
excuse for unleashing a technology and commercialisation trend that is
likely to further exacerbate problems]{.underline}. It should be the
other way round: [before considering whether the technology
is]{.underline} at all [acceptable]{.underline}, careful [assessments
need to be made of the]{.underline} likely [societal and equity and
equality consequences]{.underline}. The fundamental and wideranging
consequences of enhancement for all of society require thorough public
debate and the taking of precautions. [We need to ensure that no already
privileged groups can gain positional advantages from enhancements and
force their desires and self-perception onto others]{.underline} such as
their children or children-to-be or society as a whole. And we need
seriously to [think about the consequences of distributive
injustice]{.underline} and the impact of it on social cohesion and
global stability. Responsibility Human performance [enhancement will
require changes to the concept of responsibility]{.underline}. The
transhumanists consider it to be a parental responsibility to use
genetic screening and therapeutic enhancements to ensure as 'healthy' a
child as possible. 25 Under such a model, [would it be child abuse if
parents refused to give their children cochlear implants, if they felt
there was nothing wrong with their child using sign language, lip
reading or other alternative modes of communication? Would it be child
abuse to fail to provide a 'normal' child early in life with a
brain--machine interface?]{.underline} We need urgently to understand
the possible scenarios and trajectories of the future and their
implications. Are we ready for a society where we have full freedom --
and thereby responsibility --to choose and design both our own and our
children's abilities and traits? What are areas that should be left
untouched and how do we, as a species, collectively determine the
borders that we should not cross? Transhumanisation of personhood All
UN-based documents use [the term 'person']{.underline} as a descriptive
term to highlight certain rights. However, this term [is not set in
stone]{.underline}. Throughout history, many humans have not been seen
as persons and in some places some are still seen as non-persons today.
[What are the criteria for personhood]{.underline}? [May]{.underline} we
end up in a situation where [some people who are perceived as persons
today become non-persons]{.underline}? Is there a limit to [how much
technological parts and modifications a person can have and still be
considered a full human]{.underline}? Will one only be seen as a person
if one has received certain enhancements? Will personhood depend on
certain levels of cognition or other abilities? In this regard it is
important to note that the Disabled People's Association (DPI) bioethics
resolutions from the 6th World Assembly in October 2002 in Sapporo,
Japan, states 'We defend and demand a concept of "person" that is not
linked to a certain set of abilities'. 26 This demand is of particular
importance as the transhumanisation of ability divides is a likely
future scenario. A transhumanised version of personhood which links
personhood to certain abilities beyond the species-typical might become
part of the personhood debate of the future which might lead to various
very problematic consequences. Body politics, performance, disablement
and pluralism [These developments will increase the number of people
perceived as 'impaired']{.underline}, because as enhancement
technologies are developed, [the definition of who is 'impaired' will
change]{.underline}. The transhumanist model of health sees every human
body as defective and in need of improvement, such that every unenhanced
human being is, by definition, 'impaired'. Im[paired people are those
who are not able to improve themselves beyond what is normal for our
species]{.underline} (the 'technopoor impaired'). This development has
the danger of decreasing pluralism among humans. [Tolerance and
appreciation of human diversity is thus at stake]{.underline}. [Disabled
people can opt to be seen as inherently defective and subnormal, in need
of being fixed by science and technology towards a societal norm of the
so-called non-disabled]{.underline} (for example, giving legs to
amputees that will be as good as or worse than 'normal' biological
legs). Beyond this, they can opt not only to be fixed to a
speciestypical norm but also to be enhanced, augmented beyond the
species typical norm (for example, giving bionic legs to amputees that
work better than biological legs). Alternatively, they can opt for
changing the physical environment, the interaction with the physical
environment and the societal climate to accommodate their biological
reality (for example, giving wheelchairs to amputees and making the
physical environment wheelchair-accessible. I think it's fair to assume
that in a situation where 'impaired' people feel that an accommodation
of the environment (physical and socially) is not realistic they will
opt for enhancements. Indeed, many transhumanists are very aware of the
potential to use disabled people as a trailblazer for the acceptance of
transhumanist ideas and products. 27 As James Hughes, the former
executive director of the World Transhumanist Association, writes,
'Although few disabled people and transhumanists realise it yet, we are
allies in fighting for technological empowerment.' 28 However, as many
'traditionally disabled people' are poor and live in low income
countries they have far more to lose than gain from such a shift. They
might think that they are better off because they would share that lack
of ability with others who can't afford the enhancement, but we can
expect that resources would rarely reach people who are below the
traditional norm. This is because with the same amount of money more
people who already fit the traditional norm could be enhanced than
people who are different. As Murray and Acharya have written (Murray is
the father of 'disability-adjusted life years' -- a measure developed to
give decision-makers a tool to judge whom money should go to in the
allocation of health interventions), '[individuals prefer, after
appropriate deliberation, to extend the life of healthy individuals
rather than those in a health state worse than perfect
health']{.underline}. 29 If this is indeed true it means that [society
is likely to choose to enhance the lives of healthy individuals rather
than those in a state of less than perfect health because it will be
seen as better value for money]{.underline}. The push for enhancement
versus cure might also make sense from a general market perspective.
[Healthy people]{.underline} very likely [have more money]{.underline}
to spend and therefore [this group is more profitable than sick people.
Companies mostly go where they can make money]{.underline}. That is why
[there is already more of a focus on diseases of the middle and high
income countries than the diseases of low income countries]{.underline}.

#### The aff pushes us into a Techno-Eugenic future

When we read your writings, we become aware of what is being done in the
field of genetics and biotechnology. [You are a
whistleblower]{.underline} in what is happening in science. [Where do
you think we're going]{.underline}? Are you optimistic about the future
of humanity?

I wish I could find some countervailing impulse, but it seems to me that
**[we are headed for a techno-eugenic future]{.underline}**.
**[Human-animal chimeras]{.underline}** [are already being
produced]{.underline}; [calibrating their acceptable degree of humanity
will just be a matter of social mores]{.underline}. Right now, [pigs
with human brains are]{.underline} considered [a step too
far]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the supervising [scientists promised
to destroy any mixed-species animals that display]{.underline} evidence
of [human consciousness]{.underline}. However, when [business
models]{.underline} emerge [involving]{.underline}, [for]{.underline}
example, post-surgical reconstruction, or **[cognitive
enhancement]{.underline}**, using tissues from such animals,
[this]{.underline} **[will]{.underline}** almost certainly
**[change]{.underline}**.

Regarding [embryo engineering]{.underline} with the intention of
producing improved offspring, the technology [is]{.underline} certainly
[not]{.underline} [ready]{.underline} for general application. I cannot
conceive of a biologist or a knowledgeable affluent person who would
consent to have their prospective children tinkered with by these
methods. For that reason, Walter Isaacson's question in his article
referred to above of [whether the rich should be allowed to buy the best
genes, is misleadingly premature.]{.underline} Any given gene, even it
can be shown to be the "best" in a given context, is an infinitely
replicable resource. [The correct question is]{.underline} rather
whether (and more realistically, [how]{.underline}) [the technology can
be]{.underline} [made suitable for the rich.]{.underline}

In his essay, Isaacson discusses the proposal by James Watson, the
eugenicist Nobel laureate, to [make genetic engineering "more
equitable"]{.underline} (i.e., available to the poor) [by diminishing
patent protections on the technology.]{.underline} Isaacson takes this
as a late-in-life expression of liberal generosity by Watson, but [this
seems naïve]{.underline}. Given Watson's track record, [we know what
sector of society he believes is most in need of genetic
cleansing]{.underline}, and who would be most suited to be the
first-line experimental subjects before it is ready for prime time.

[**Capitalism** revolutionises the **means of production** but
even]{.underline} within this process we [hang on to **transversal
concepts**]{.underline}. [Workplaces are]{.underline} paradoxically
[materially different but]{.underline} **[fundamentally
similar]{.underline}** [in terms of their trajectory over the last two
hundred years. Although a]{.underline} [19th-century]{.underline}
Manchester [factory worker might find it difficult to understand the
clean and mechanised]{.underline} Japanese [car production
plant]{.underline} line, [there would be enough similarities to
provide]{.underline} some [familiarity]{.underline}. The discipline of
[the **clock** and]{.underline} of the [**production**
process]{.underline}, [**waged labour** and the **fatigue of
work**]{.underline} would [**hardly** have **changed** at
all]{.underline}. In all of this, [**learning** at work could
be]{.underline} assumed to be [another]{.underline} seemingly
**[transversal concept]{.underline}**. The ideas [**that learning 'on
the job' is required** to undertake a]{.underline} task and that
schooling [might]{.underline} [be required to deal with]{.underline}
written and verbal [instructions]{.underline}, as well as [the
recognition that advanced qualifications are necessary for]{.underline}
high-level engineering and [technical tasks]{.underline}, [have
similarities across]{.underline} most [cultures and
contexts]{.underline}. However, [it is **easy to mistake**
these]{.underline} [**historical and geographical parallels for a
timeless universalism** in t]{.underline}erms of [the **relation between
learning and work**.]{.underline}

This chapter takes a critical view of the universalism of that
relationship and argues that [changes in the workplace]{.underline},
some [already underway and]{.underline} other [prefigurative
changes]{.underline}, [are producing a **unique shift in** the nature
and location of **learning**]{.underline} [whilst **maintaining
fundamental relations between labour and capital**]{.underline}. [Such
changes make learning unrecognisable by even broad epistemologies
of]{.underline} human [pedagogy and include **shifting the locus of
learning from humans to products**]{.underline} [through]{.underline}
'**[use sovereignty']{.underline}** [and the '**Pixarfication'** of
manufacturing and services]{.underline}, the rediscovery of [competence
theories of learning and their]{.underline} current [alignment
with]{.underline} [machine learning]{.underline}, and [the impact of
**AI** on **fragmenting learning** entities into the '**skills
cloud\'**]{.underline}. [The future is one in which]{.underline} whilst
[the]{.underline} [workplace]{.underline} appears to \[Page 640\]be
[teeming with learning]{.underline} entities where it [is difficult to
locate learning as we would recognise it, particularly in human
workers]{.underline}.

One focal point for this change is the rise in Artificial Intelligence,
or **[AI]{.underline}** for short, which [has become **shorthand for a
paradigmatic change** in]{.underline} nearly [every aspect of
contemporary society]{.underline}. Whilst [AI]{.underline} may be far
from meeting the expectations of most early theorists (particularly in
terms of general intelligence), as a tool for significant changes in
society it [is very powerful]{.underline}. [AI]{.underline} is not often
clearly specified in accounts of modernisation and it commonly [stands
for anything from]{.underline} simple [computerisation]{.underline} that
extends little beyond mechanisation [to]{.underline} General Artificial
Intelligence ([GAI]{.underline}) [that would]{.underline} equal or
[surpass]{.underline} the abilities of [the]{.underline} working
[human]{.underline}. Indeed, [fears of an 'intelligence
explosion']{.underline} or 'learning explosion' where an AI entity could
bootstrap itself to levels of intelligence well above human sentience
abound in our culture. Articles on [AI in the workplace in]{.underline}
publications such as **[Wired]{.underline}** magazine [or]{.underline}
illustrated in [**TED talks**,]{.underline} often [present AI as
involving a]{.underline}n ever-closer [linkage with the
human]{.underline}. Images of **[cyborgs or transhuman
hybrids]{.underline}** abound, not dissimilar from the covers of science
fiction magazines of the 1950s. AI often produces 'weird tales' of how
humans might come to work in the future. [This might involve
a]{.underline} close [bodily and mental fusion of humans]{.underline},
[AI and robots]{.underline}, [or the displacement of humans
completely]{.underline} by (often anthropomorphised) robots. AI is a hot
topic in sociology and education, as much as in business, and [the idea
that AI could]{.underline}, alongside humans, [produce hybrid forms of
'cyborg learning']{.underline} has become a fruitful line of research in
education and robotics. In particular, the field of '[**post-humanism'**
has produced]{.underline} a number of [conceptions of how learning can
be articulated between humans and]{.underline} other entities such as
[robots and AI]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} conceptions dismiss
anthropocentric notions of learning in favour of ones that [do not
distinguish between or privilege entities]{.underline},
[are]{.underline} dismissive of boundary formation and [emphasise
collective learning]{.underline} properties. In a recent synthesis
[Hasse]{.underline} (2020) [describes post-humanist learning theory as
an]{.underline} '... [ultra-social collective of social and material
collective]{.underline}s' (Hasse, 2020, p. 1). [This]{.underline}
'**[collective of collectives']{.underline}** [includes]{.underline}
entities of all kinds ([Human, robot, AI, animal, material and
non-corporal]{.underline}) which are in constant articulation with each
other.

For those of us living in the improbably futuristic year of 2021 **[the
future is not]{.underline}** quite **[as exciting as
this]{.underline}**. [**Work** is still the **predominant
activity**]{.underline} [of humans, who struggle]{.underline}
continuously [to survive in a **capitalist society**]{.underline}, and
[the **conditions** of work have **changed very little** from early
capitalism]{.underline}. [**Time** is]{.underline} still [**regulated**
through the clock]{.underline} (Postone, 1993). Our [working processes
are **recorded and regulated** so]{.underline} that [**not a second** is
**wasted** in idleness]{.underline}. Research on the quantified self at
work (Moore et al., 2017) shows that [devices]{.underline} which are
used [to monitor workers]{.underline} in the contemporary era, ranging
[from biometric]{.underline} devices [to]{.underline} **[BCI (Brain
Computer Interface)]{.underline}** technologies, [rather than liberating
workers from capitalist toil]{.underline}, act to **[reinforce
standardisation]{.underline}**. [The '**means of
cognition**']{.underline} (Dyer-Whiteford et al., 2019) have [become a
**fundamental** part of capitalism]{.underline}. [Like]{.underline}
other ['means of production\']{.underline}, [the **capitalist
conversion** of **human and machine cognition** into fixed
capital]{.underline} (computers, robots and AI) [has **increased the
scale** and scope **of capitalist work**]{.underline} [whilst
**retaining** the same principles of **exploitation**]{.underline} [and
the extraction of surplus value from living labour]{.underline}.
Although Nick Land (2018), the poster boy for accelerationism, exhorts
us not to live in 'transcendental miserabilism' and to embrace the
future, [the **liberatory cyberpunk 'phuture'**]{.underline} he predicts
[does **not** seem to be **on the horizon.**]{.underline}

Marxist critiques of the relationship between AI and humanity are not
always as optimistic as post-humanist articulations. Despite comments in
Grundrisse concerning the ability of machine labour to form an
alternative to capitalist work (Marx, 1993), in Capital [machines
are]{.underline} largely seen as [methods of **increasing control** of
labour processes]{.underline}, \[Page 641\][increasing **unemployment**
and **exploitation**]{.underline} (Marx, 1976). There are similar
tensions in other Marxist works concerning the relationship between AI
and humans. For example, Dyer-Whiteford (1999) considers that [although
**digital technologies** can be used by capitalists to **control
workers** and]{.underline} as a form of '**[divide and
rule\']{.underline}**, [they also]{.underline} [**provide
possibilities** for workers to **control production** and to create new
forms of machine/human hybridisation that might lead to new forms of
**economic activity outside of capitalism**]{.underline}. Bastani (2019)
sees [technology]{.underline} a[s]{.underline} [an oppressive feature
of]{.underline} contemporary [capitalism]{.underline} whilst drawing on
a number of existing technologies, including AI and post-humanism, to
argue that these features of [capitalism might enable a 'fully
automated' Communist future]{.underline}. Other works are more critical
of human/AI hybridisation and communal technologies. Dyer-Whiteford,
Kjøsen and Steinhoff (2019) argue that a [**transhumanist**, AI-enhanced
**workforce** would **labour under**]{.underline} largely **[the same
conditions as current workers]{.underline}**, and Griziotti (2019)
considers that [generalisable technologies]{.underline} that might be
expected to [form]{.underline} part of a '**[digital
commons]{.underline}**' can be recuperated by capital. These
perspectives reflect the duality of optimistic and pessimistic views
within Marxism on technology but [there is]{.underline} a fundamental
[tension in Marxist theory]{.underline} in [evaluating]{.underline}
specific [capitalist technology in terms of its]{.underline}
emancipatory or [revolutionary aspect]{.underline},
[particularly]{.underline} in terms of [AI/human synthesis]{.underline}.
[Capitalist **accumulation through technology** has the]{.underline}
ultimate [purpose of]{.underline} expanding the creation of 'value' [at
the]{.underline} **[expense of human existence]{.underline}**,
[meaning]{.underline} that any form of **[AI/human synthesis
should]{.underline}** not **[be assessed only]{.underline}** in its own
terms but **[as part of capitalism as a whole]{.underline}** (Kurz,
2014). In many ways [such developments are a continuation of current
tendencies]{.underline} in capitalism [towards the capitalisation of
humanity as '**human capital**]{.underline}' [(]{.underline}Rikowski,
2002). However, although [AI]{.underline} might not change the relations
of capitalism it [does fundamentally change work and workplace
learning]{.underline}. Primarily, [the position of the human labourer as
the locus of learning is irrevocably changed by the
**reconceptualisation of work** as an **arena of learning entities
rather than human beings**]{.underline}. To examine this we will first
engage in some (near) futurology by examining what [the 'factory of the
future']{.underline} might look like.

In the United Kingdom (UK) the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council) which is part of UKRI (United Kingdom Research and
Innovation) -- a government body that allocates competitive research
monies to academics -- has funded several projects to consider what the
factories of the future will look like **[by]{.underline}** the year
**[2030]{.underline}**. These projects analyse current technological,
social and cultural trajectories to engage in grounded predications of
the future in which proof of concept can be shown through actually
existing technologies. These projects have involved looking at concepts
such as human-based [factories]{.underline} which [will
optimise]{.underline} the [production]{.underline} of medications and
factories that use materials to produce products which will last
forever, adapting themselves to avoid damage.

One of these projects, of which the author is a part, 'Chatty Factories'
(Burnap et al., 2019), has profound implications for workplace learning
and the role of the human and AI in the production process. The idea of
the 'Chatty Factory' is that [products]{.underline} ([and]{.underline}
to some [extent]{.underline} services) [can]{.underline} already be
developed which [have **human**-like **capabilities** in]{.underline}
terms of [**perception** of their environment]{.underline} (through
sensors and other methods of recording the nature of their use),
[**communication** with the manufacturer]{.underline} (through wireless
technologies and internet connection) [and **sentience**]{.underline} or
at least some form of so-called learning (through AI or machine
learning). [This leads to]{.underline} the possibility of '**[chatty
products]{.underline}**' [that]{.underline} can [communicate with the
factory and]{.underline} the \[Page 642\][production]{.underline}
process. Some companies, such as [airlines and]{.underline} some [luxury
car manufacturers]{.underline}, [already use]{.underline} elements of
'[chatty products\']{.underline}, but as the cost of this technology
falls [such methods will become ubiquitous and applicable to a wide
range of products]{.underline}, even FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods).
[This]{.underline} change [presents a profound challenge to the nature
of the]{.underline} current [consumer and]{.underline} manufacturer
paradigm towards what can be called '**[use
sovereignty\']{.underline}**.

[Early]{.underline} factory [production was characterised
by]{.underline} [producer sovereignty]{.underline}, [where
a]{.underline} usually [**homogenous product** was produced
**on**]{.underline} a **[mass]{.underline}** **[scale]{.underline}**
[and sold]{.underline} to consumers [using **standardised advertising**
and mass marketing campaigns with little]{.underline} product
[differentiation]{.underline}. This orientation is summed up by Henry
Ford\'s famous maxim regarding the Model T Ford that customers could
have any colour so long as it was black. This model had a form of
workplace learning where [workers were trained for one]{.underline} type
of routine or [action on a production line]{.underline}, [as repetition
and consistency were]{.underline} highly [important]{.underline}. This
producer orientation had implications for workplace learning in terms of
the Taylorist nature of the labour process and of training. [Work was
divided into]{.underline} a series of [repeatable actions]{.underline}
that were tuned and honed by experts in scientific management, [which
were]{.underline} then [reproduced]{.underline} accurately [by humans on
a consistently moving production line]{.underline}. Through a finely
tuned division of labour [a car could be built]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} using [the labour of workers divided by
specialism]{.underline}. In terms of workplace learning this had two
major implications. Firstly, [**training was 'preloaded'** into human
workers]{.underline} through a process of initial learning. [There was
little formal learning on the job]{.underline}. Taylorism prefigured
much of the competence and competency movement in workplace learning
(see below). Secondly, [there was a need for support]{.underline} for
individuals, both inside and outside of the workplace, [in]{.underline}
terms of [learning how to deal with the **boredom and repetition** of
work]{.underline} (which also included how to informally 'game' the
system of production). As a result of this, [a sociological department
was established at Ford to]{.underline} enable families to function more
effectively in [support]{.underline}ing [the]{.underline} (usually male)
[worker]{.underline}.

[The move to **consumer sovereignty**, **heterogeneous products** and
increasingly **customised commodities**]{.underline}, [led to
a]{.underline} **[Post-Fordist]{.underline}** [system of
production]{.underline}. Post-Fordist production, also known as
**[Toyotism]{.underline}**, [heralded]{.underline} a system of
production where workers would need to be skilled for [flexibility and
re-skilled]{.underline} for a production line that would require
[changes to production on a frequent basis]{.underline}. Although in
many manufacturing firms the production line remained, and [the overall
labour process still relied on]{.underline} forms of measurement similar
to **[scientific management]{.underline}**, there was a change in the
nature of workplace learning[. Rather than workplace learning
being]{.underline} [front-loaded]{.underline} (so that workers were
trained in a particular task) [and compensatory]{.underline} (to learn
formally and informally to deal with the pressures of work), [learning
'on the job' and]{.underline} more [flexible fo]{.underline}rms of
workplace learning [came to dominate the workplace]{.underline}.
[Workers were expected to]{.underline} **[reskill and
upskill]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} the [production]{.underline}
process consistently [changed]{.underline}.

[In both Taylorist and Post-Fordist production systems there were
similarities in terms of workplace learning]{.underline}. Firstly,
[learning was]{.underline} located at the level of the [human and human
communities]{.underline} and societies [rather than at the level of
objects]{.underline} and artefacts. [Whilst there]{.underline} [was some
consideration of human/machine symbiosis in]{.underline} fields such as
[cybernetics]{.underline}, human factors [and prosthetics]{.underline},
[the human]{.underline} (even within the framework of a learning
organisation) [was the locus of learning]{.underline}. Secondly,
although contemporary theories of learning that draw on [post-humanism,
cyborg theory and assemblage allow us to]{.underline} retrospectively
[reinterpret the human focus of workplace]{.underline} learning during
this period, substantively [there was always a human focus to workplace
learning]{.underline}. Both [product]{.underline} (Taylorist) [and
consumer]{.underline} (post-Fordist) orientations [were orientated
around a **human subject as the 'learner\'**]{.underline}. This was the
case even when an impoverished notion of learning was used \[Page
643\](such as in Competence Based Education and Training - CBET).
Thirdly, [workplace learning]{.underline} in both consumer and product
orientations [was based on the idea of an external vantage
point]{.underline} or external expertise [from education and training
experts]{.underline}. Fourthly, [work-based learning was]{.underline} a
[trans-organisational]{.underline} discipline in terms of building a
home in universities with a wider connection to the fields of education
and pedagogy. Although workplace learning may be adapted differently
across workplaces, organisations and countries [there was a principle
that knowledge could be transferred between contexts]{.underline}.
Knowledge of workplace learning was not idiographic and isolated but
could form part of a wider body of knowledge.

[The 'Chatty Factory']{.underline} (chatty being UK slang for talkative)
[model develops a **new model of sovereignty**]{.underline}, use
sovereignty [where the]{.underline} **[use]{.underline}** of a
**[product determines its own production]{.underline}** (detailed in
Burnap et al., 2019). Advances in sensors, technology, cybersecurity,
wireless connection (5G), new materials and AI/machine learning mean
that [products can model human senses and gain]{.underline} a limited
[sentience]{.underline} ([or at least]{.underline} the ability to use
machine learning, a form of statistical analysis to determine a course
of action or [judgement]{.underline}). [There are already]{.underline}
examples of [products which can communicate]{.underline} back [to the
process of production]{.underline} that might be called 'chatty
products\'. For example, an airline might place [sensors]{.underline} in
their [aircraft]{.underline} that [enable]{.underline} them to receive
direct [information from aircraft in flight. This]{.underline} in turn
[allows them]{.underline}, if required, [to modify future
production]{.underline}. The 'Chatty Factories' model allows for
products which collect information about their use 'in the wild\'. [As
the product is used it sends a]{.underline} constant [stream of
information back to the factory]{.underline}. Using [human and
AI]{.underline}-based data collection [methods]{.underline} the product
'**[in use]{.underline}**' [determines its own production]{.underline}.
In practice, this process has to involve various methods of mediation.
For example, [human ethnographers]{.underline} are employed in
[interpret]{.underline}ing [the product\'s use]{.underline} '[in the
wild]{.underline}\', designers are involved in interpreting the product
data when it arrives at the factory, and humans interpret the product
data when it is processed into production plans (alongside robots) in
the continuous production of the product. 'Chatty Factories' also
require a large investment in cyber-security as there are opportunities
for data leakage and corruption.

The 'Chatty Factories' model is designed for the factory of the near
future (2030), but it is possible to envisage how this might operate in
practice today. Imagine that a factory produces bicycles each of which
contains a number of sensors that examine the use of the product in
terms of location, speed, damage to the tyres and frame, temperature,
accidents and final disposal. The use of the bicycle would determine the
information sent back to the factory. For example, if the data
discovered that products used 'off road' were not robust in terms of the
integrity of the tyres then the factory would start to produce bikes
which had thicker tyres mitigating the problem. Without human
intervention in decision making the production of the bicycle would have
automatically been optimised as it is use that has sovereignty rather
than the consumer or producer.

This example may seem far-fetched given current technologies but 'Chatty
Factories' have proved that the concept works at various stages of the
process and is an elaboration of existing tendencies in what has been
called 'Industry 4.0' or **[the 4th Industrial Revolution]{.underline}**
(Schwab, 2016), [in which]{.underline} a variety of technologies such as
[the Internet of Things]{.underline} (IoT), [AI and digital
manufacturing are]{.underline} [combined to produce a transformation of
industrial systems.]{.underline} Despite the advanced technological
nature of such systems, [it is not]{.underline} necessarily [the case
that such systems lead to increased worker autonomy]{.underline}
(Butollo, Jürgens and Krzywdzinski, 2018), and [the
'**datafication'**]{.underline} [of production]{.underline} potentially
[increases the possibilities for **worker surveillance**]{.underline}
(Beer, 2018; Thomas, Nafus and Sherman, 2018).

Of course, there are differences in the implementation of these
technologies in \[Page 644\]various industries and the progression
towards 'Industry 4.0' may be uneven. However, in the future it is
indeed possible that [this might be an 'unmediated process']{.underline}
(even with human intervention it could still be considered that the
process is assisted rather than enabled by humans). [Products 'in the
wild']{.underline} [would take in data]{.underline} which would be
communicated back to the factory. This 'sense data' would [be optimised
by an algorithm to maximise profits]{.underline}, which may involve more
robust manufacture to minimise faults/returns, [reducing
costs]{.underline} by minimising redundant features or making the
product more appealing to consumers. This would [then]{.underline} feed
into an [automatically adjust]{.underline}ed [production]{.underline}
process. In this way products using [AI are 'chatty' in determining
their own production]{.underline}. Products and components may also be
similarly 'chatty' in the factory, providing consistent and constant
data. Through the IoT (Internet of Things) and wireless technology
constant communication is plausible. A sophisticated [AI
may]{.underline} even [decide to evolve products]{.underline} to conduct
experiments in changing matter through a process which can be called
'speciation\', the production of new species and sub-species of
products. So in the above bicycle example, a new 'mutant' bicycle might
be produced with extra thick tyres to see how it is used in 'the wild\'.
This is not just a further example of customisation and consumer
orientation but a paradigm shift to 'use sovereignty\'. [Every item in
the factory]{.underline}, including robots, AI, components and products
inside and outside of the factory, [is 'alive']{.underline} with sense
and communication. This whole process of production might be best
categorised as **[Pixarfication]{.underline}**, Pixar being a US company
that makes movies [where toys are sentient]{.underline} (the 'Toy Story'
films), [robots are sentient]{.underline} (the robots and AI in
'Wall-E\') [and there is a sense of everything possessing sentience
through technology ('Cars\') or magic ('Brave\']{.underline}). [This
pan-psychism of the factory]{.underline} and its products [has a
profound implication for learning at work.]{.underline}

In the 'Chatty Factory' **[humans are no longer the locus of
learning]{.underline}**. [The most important learning
entity]{.underline} in production [becomes the **product**,
which,]{.underline} in conjunction with other non-humans and humans,
[determines its own production]{.underline}. Learning in the workplace
has become a consistent process involving the product as a learning
object creating itself in conjunction with increasingly sophisticated
forms of AI. The human is not unimportant as they retain a place as an
entity in a learning assemblage but their position as the significant
learning object has been completely displaced. [The **subject** of
workplace learning is **now the commodity**]{.underline}. How it learns
outside the workplace in its environment and how it communicates that
learning to other entities within the factory has become the pedagogical
question. In this perspective, human learning appears ephemeral. [There
is]{.underline} now [no transhistorical reason to consider]{.underline}
[learning]{.underline}, including workplace learning, [as]{.underline}
it is [conventionally defined]{.underline}. Capitalism not only appears
as Marx said to be a 'mass of commodities' (to highlight the ephemeral
nature of the form of value), but this '[mass of commodities' becomes
determinant in its own production **removing human agency** from the
process]{.underline}. Of course, in Marxist interpretations [the process
of production is already]{.underline} [inhuman in terms of its
determination for profit]{.underline} (which has its basis in the
Marxist conception of value) as a real abstraction (Postone, 1993). Here
the claim is that [commodities literally]{.underline} and directly
[determine their own production so]{.underline} that the [real mediation
and abstraction have]{.underline} visceral [significance in
reality]{.underline}.

#### Failure to act causes cyber-scientific management that optimizes every second of every day for maximum profit

**Preston 21** (John Preston, Faculty Dean Research (Social Sciences) -
Professor (R)Department of Sociology - University of Essex. The SAGE
Handbook of Learning and Work, \"Where did the Learning Go? Artificial
Intelligence, 'Use Sovereignty' and 'Pixarfication' in Factories of the
Future\", 10/26/2021, https://sk-sagepub-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/reference/the-sage-handbook-of-learning-and-work/i4942.xml, accessed

Relating outcomes to competences, which are then optimised through
machine learning, and the rise of '[use sovereignty]{.underline}' are
ways [in which learning is displaced from the individual]{.underline}
worker and increasingly from work-based learning [in terms of
collectives of workers]{.underline}. Paradoxically, [learning seems to
be occurring]{.underline} everywhere in the contemporary factory but it
is [not]{.underline} happening [at a human level as
**epistemologically** CBET]{.underline} [and machine learning are
**distinct**]{.underline} from what we would understand by learning.
[This displacement]{.underline} of learning [might occur]{.underline}
not in terms of a single computational or organisational 'mind'
co-ordinating activities but rather [as a system of AIs]{.underline} and
machine intelligences [that collectively seek to optimise profit and
cost]{.underline} functions [determined by the employer who 'wireheads'
these into the organisation]{.underline}. In terms of human outcomes,
AIs work to build up a 'grammar' of outcomes, behaviours and
combinations. [This is the new]{.underline} '**[scientific
management]{.underline}**' [where **humans are 'chopped up' into outcome
entities**]{.underline}, either individually or collectively,
foreshadowed by Marx in Grundrisse:

[The worker\'s activity]{.underline}, [reduced to a mere
abstraction]{.underline} of activity, [is **determined** and
regulated]{.underline} on all sides [by]{.underline} the movement of the
**[machinery]{.underline}**, and not the opposite. The
[science]{.underline} which [compels the inanimate limbs]{.underline} of
the machinery, by their construction, [to act purposefully, as an
**automaton**]{.underline}, [does not exist in the worker\'s
consciousness, but]{.underline} rather [acts upon him through the
machine as an alien power,]{.underline} as the power of the machine
itself. [The **appropriation of living labour by objectified
labour**]{.underline} -- [of]{.underline} the [power]{.underline} or
activity [which creates value by value existing for-itself]{.underline}
-- which [lies in the concept of capital]{.underline}, is posited, [in
production]{.underline} resting on machinery, as the character of the
production process itself, including its material elements and its
material motion. The [production]{.underline} process has [ceased to
be]{.underline} a [labour]{.underline} process in the sense of a process
dominated by labour as its governing unity. [Labour
appears]{.underline}, rather, merely [as a conscious organ]{.underline},
[scattered among]{.underline} the individual living
[workers]{.underline} at numerous points of the mechanical system;
[subsumed]{.underline} [under the]{.underline} total process of the
[machinery itself]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} itself only [a link of
the system]{.underline}, [whose unity exists not in the living workers,
but rather in the living]{.underline} (active) [machinery]{.underline},
[which confronts his individual, insignificant doings as a mighty
organism]{.underline}. In machinery, [objectified labour confronts
living labour within the labour process itself as the power which rules
it; a power which]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} the appropriation of
[living labour, is]{.underline} the form of [capital]{.underline}.
(Marx, 1993, p. 693, my italics)

What is relevant in the above quote is not just how **[machinery
colonises labour]{.underline}** (the 'acting upon' of machinery) but
also how labour unity both between and within the individual labourer is
'scattered' among the individual workers. As the British philosopher
Nick Land describes the process of AI takeover in industry:

\[Page 647\][Modern production seems like a dream of **cyborg
colonization work**]{.underline}, a dream that makes the nightmare of
Taylorism seem idyllic.

Industrial **[machines dismantle the]{.underline}** actuality of the
[**proletariat**, displacing it in the direction of cyborg
**hybridization**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} re [the]{.underline}
**[plasalizingticity]{.underline}** of **[labour power]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} corresponding [extraction of tradable value from the
body]{.underline} sophisticates [at the interface]{.underline},
[dissociating exertion into]{.underline} increasingly
[intricate]{.underline} [functional sequences]{.underline}, from pedals,
levers and vocal commands through the synchronization of production-line
tasks and time-motion programs, to sensory-motor transduction within
increasingly complex and self-micromanaged artificial environments,
capturing minutely adaptive behavior for capital.
**[Autocybernating]{.underline}** [market control guides the
labour-process into **immersion**]{.underline}. (Land, 2018, p. 435, my
italics)

Here, Land takes further Marx\'s 19th-century considerations of what is
happening to labour in the process of industrial production.
[Labour]{.underline} in all its forms (mental and physical) [becomes
'dismantled' into discrete components through AI realising]{.underline}
the myriad ways in which it can be combined ([its
**plasticity**]{.underline}) [where **human behaviour is
captured**]{.underline}. In each of these quotes, the idea is that
[labour is consistently pushed to the limits of human embodiment as it
becomes captured by machinery into a 'grammar' of human
labour]{.underline} far [surpassing]{.underline} the ideas of
[scientific management]{.underline}. In these scenarios
[learning]{.underline} at work [does not exist within human entities but
in 'chopped up' human assemblages that would be integrated with machines
and data in many different forms]{.underline}. The
[learning]{.underline} takes places [within]{.underline} various [AIs in
terms of a 'skill bank']{.underline} [whereby]{.underline} various
[entities]{.underline} would be charged with '[produc]{.underline}ing'
types of behaviour. As stated above, [this would be an]{.underline}
[impoverished conception of human learning]{.underline} [where
**learning would become**]{.underline} reconceptualised as pure
**[outcome]{.underline}**.

In the field of consumption, [**AI** is already building up **data** on
our **behavioural patterns**]{.underline} [through]{.underline} platform
**[capitalist tools]{.underline}** [such as]{.underline} **[Facebook,
Twitter and Google]{.underline}**. [Reactions and behaviours are
quantified and]{.underline} used to [build]{.underline} up [a
**profile**]{.underline} [not only of]{.underline} our
[individual]{.underline} [behaviour but of a **model of human
behaviour**]{.underline}. Existent disciplines such as [**Psychology**
and Sociology]{.underline} in universities [appear to be rather
**insignificant** compared to]{.underline} [how accurately]{.underline}
[**social media** giants can **predict (and modify**]{.underline})
[attitudes and]{.underline} **[behaviours]{.underline}** [based
on]{.underline} the [predictions of '**Big Data**]{.underline}\'. In the
workplace, [quantification]{.underline} also [gathers]{.underline} and
uses [data on how workers]{.underline} [behave and respond]{.underline}.
As considered above, in many ways [this is an **extension of scientific
management**]{.underline} [whereby]{.underline} the movements of
[workers were laboriously logged and tested]{.underline} in a series of
scientific experiments. [Photography]{.underline} was used to
[map]{.underline} and chart [each]{.underline} human
[movement]{.underline} as part of a production process [so]{.underline}
that [each factory]{.underline} worker [was subject to **optimisation**
and]{.underline} eventually computer [tech]{.underline}nology
[developed]{.underline} more [complex techniques of process and
production management]{.underline} which were used to record and
simulate worker behaviour. As technology improves, [modes of
quantification have become]{.underline} increasingly
[extensive]{.underline} (Moore et al., 2017). High performance
[**digital cameras** and sensors]{.underline} are used to [record worker
movements at **sub-perceptual levels**]{.underline}.
**[Smartwatches]{.underline}** can [record]{.underline} worker
**[biometrics]{.underline}** [and allow instant feedback on worker
attitudes]{.underline}. Worker [interactions and
**vocalisations**]{.underline} [can be measured by]{.underline} using
[Alexa]{.underline}-type [devices]{.underline} in the workplace.
Employee [**sentiment** can be measured by conducting **text analysis**
of their social media posts]{.underline}. Such [devices]{.underline} can
also be used to **[measure worker resistance]{.underline}** ([including
union organisation]{.underline}) [and the]{.underline} worker\'s
[capacity for disruptive activity]{.underline}. [These are]{.underline}
all forms of [worker surveillance]{.underline}. [Through these
means]{.underline}, [labour power production is becoming]{.underline}
even more [extensive to]{.underline} [reflect]{.underline} not only a
wider variety of [physical and mental **attitudes**]{.underline} and
**[behaviours]{.underline}**, but also worker attitudes and
**[emotions]{.underline}**. [Compliance and satisfaction can be
measured]{.underline} not only through a periodic worker satisfaction
survey but [constantly]{.underline} and \[Page 648\]consistently
**[during every moment]{.underline}** of an employee\'s day.

[This is not just]{.underline} a process of [quantifying each individual
worker]{.underline}, [it also involves building]{.underline} up [a model
of human behaviour in general]{.underline}. Zuboff (2019) argues that
'**[Surveillance Capitalism']{.underline}** [is]{.underline} not just a
method of increasing productivity in certain circumstances but also [a
method for producing a]{.underline} residue, or [surplus]{.underline},
from these surveillance activities [in which workers are dispossessed of
skills]{.underline}. Zuboff refers to [this]{.underline} activity as
'**[behavioural surplus\']{.underline}**:

**[Surveillance capitalism]{.underline}** [begins with]{.underline} the
discovery of [behavioral surplus]{.underline}. **[More]{.underline}**
behavioral **[data]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [rendered than
required for service improvements]{.underline}. [This surplus feeds
**machine intelligence**]{.underline} -- [the]{.underline} **[new means
of production]{.underline}** -- [that fabricates **predictions** of user
behavior]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} products [are sold
to]{.underline} business customers in [new]{.underline} **[behavioral
futures markets]{.underline}**. [The **Behavioral Value Reinvestment
Cycle** is subordinated to this new logic.]{.underline} (Zuboff, 2019,
p. 97)

Zuboff primarily considers the realm of consumption in her analysis of
Surveillance Capitalism, but it is also possible to apply this work to
the behavioural surplus acquired in the workplace. Surveillance produces
streams of data which can be combined with other data pools and
resources to produce (through machine learning) insights into aspects of
human labour that could not be gained by a single observation alone.
[Owners of this data]{.underline} (who might not be the employer who
uses the technology) can create new ways of understanding the mechanisms
of worker productivity and the 'nudges' by which the labour power of
workers can be enhanced. These can be combined [with AI
knowledge]{.underline} of other entities in the production process to
specify minute interactions between those entities to [optimise
production]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} what Zuboff (2019, p. 97)
refers to as [the 'Behavioural Reinvestment Cycle\']{.underline},
[whereby behaviour]{.underline} is used to build platforms that [are
reintegrated into the production process to further optimise worker
behaviour]{.underline}. One existing example of this is the use of
so-called '[fatigue functions']{.underline} to op[timise human
performance in production]{.underline}. [A 'fatigue
function']{.underline} is a mathematical equation derived from empirical
observation which [shows when a human worker is reaching]{.underline}
the point of '[failure']{.underline} in terms of being unable to carry
on with their task successfully. At present fatigue functions are
usually determined by using existing data on worker fatigue so that a
production process can be optimised. Studies which have tested worker
fatigue in real manufacturing environments under experimentally
controlled conditions can be used to specify how workers should behave
in reality. With the advent of consistently gathered biometric and
behavioural data on workers in real time, [fatigue can be measured
consistently]{.underline}, [and the worker is consistently experimented
on by AI that can 'nudge' workers towards better
performance]{.underline}. [The accumulation of intelligence through
surveillance]{.underline} on each individual worker [is reinvested
constantly into a superior system]{.underline}.

It must be noted that the idea of an intelligence that can catalogue and
build a grammar of individual skills and capacities to be used in the
workplace is not a new one. The early years of the Soviet Union produced
a number of experiments in creating a catalogue of human skills and
abilities, with their origins in the work of Alexi Gastev. Gastev sought
to record and catalogue all manifestations of physical labour (Ings,
2016, p. 79) which could be combined in a 'performance\'. Through this
manual cataloguing performances could be choreographed, and workers
would learn through rehearsal to prepare for factory work. In the 1980s
there were similar attempts in terms of CBET to create a universal
database of competences that could be used for any occupation. Plans
were made for a vast lexicon of computerised records which could be used
to select exactly the right set of competences for a particular work
task (Preston, 2017, p. 34). These early experiments foreshadow the
contemporary situation where individual behaviours are under
surveillance and disaggregated, but the essential difference is that
learning is transferred from the worker to the AI, and that the real
learning that takes place in the workplace \[Page 649\]is occurring at
the level of machines rather than at the level of humans.

This evolution and confluence of workplace [learning with AI and machine
learning is]{.underline} increasingly [making]{.underline} the prospect
of '[cloud-based' services]{.underline} for skills [more
likely]{.underline}. Rather than individuals possessing knowledge of
discrete skills, the [organisation uses 'Behavioural Value Reinvestment'
to create a]{.underline} consistently evolving [learning platform
regarding worker behaviour]{.underline}. However, there is no reason why
this [evolving knowledge]{.underline} of skills and abilities should
remain at the level of the individual organisation. As is the case with
other services which can be accessed by a digital organisation, there
are plans for 'skills clouds' whereby [employers]{.underline} of various
types [could 'draw down' the particular skills components]{.underline}
that they require in their workplace. For example, Workday, a
[NASDAQ]{.underline}-listed company [with a market capitalisation of
\$40 billion]{.underline}, [has produced a 'skills cloud' system that
uses machine learning to categorise]{.underline} skills between
organisations in order [to form a common 'skills
language\':]{.underline}

Cristina Goldt, vice president, HCM products, Workday commented: 'Nearly
every organization wants to develop and reskill their workforce to grow
their people and their business, but they lack a fundamental
understanding of the skills they have and the skills they need. Our
skills cloud tackles this issue head on with machine learning algorithms
that bring calm to the chaotic language of skills. This will ultimately
help customers connect skills to people in a more meaningful way to
improve how they get work done, develop existing workers, and allocate
talent to better meet evolving business needs. (Source:
www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2018/10/03/workday-unveil-skills-cloud/)

The capacity for 'skills clouds' to grow is not only premised on
technology but also on the growth of new forms of precarious employment.
Recruitment agencies, who often act to 'sift' employees to large
employers make use of skills tests, using AI and machine learning, to
filter workers into job positions and in doing so gain wider behavioural
knowledge of worker skills and abilities. Similarly, the growth of
'platform capitalism' in terms of employers who use mobile applications
to track and reward workers (such as Uber or Deliveroo) gain constant
data on employee behaviour and skills. This leads to a number of
separate 'skills clouds\', with the possibility of amalgamation at a
higher level. The implication of this for learning at work is clear in
that learning is disappearing not just from workers, but potentially
also from employers as it is integrated into the 'skills cloud' by
multinational companies.

[To say the present]{.underline} era [is]{.underline} one of [crisis
borders on cliché]{.underline}. Habitual and familiar, [this crisis
differs from the dystopias of]{.underline} George [Orwell
or]{.underline} Aldous [Huxley]{.underline}, [or hell]{.underline} in
the paintings of Bosch or the last days of Earth as told in the Book of
Revelations. [It is unlike]{.underline} Europe during [the Black Death
or]{.underline} Central Asia as it faced [the]{.underline} galloping
[Golden Horde]{.underline}. Here, instead, [we inhabit a world in
**free-fall**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} yet [we are all along for
the ride]{.underline}. Some aspects of this, like [the **European
migration crisis,**]{.underline} [are]{.underline} highly [mediatised
and public]{.underline}. Here, [people displaced by]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[social
breakdown]{.underline}** [migrate]{.underline}, often [meeting with
hostility]{.underline} in response. While for previous generations
[**the Berlin Wall** was totemic of division]{.underline}, [only **235**
people **died**]{.underline} trying to cross it. [Compare that
to]{.underline} the **[3,770]{.underline}** souls [who died]{.underline}
or went missing in the Mediterranean [trying to reach the shores of
Europe just in 2015]{.underline}. And if, as an undocumented
[migrant]{.underline}, you are fortunate enough to safely cross the
Mediterranean, or the US--Mexico border, or the fences and forests
between Hungary and Bulgaria, your [problems are only just
beginning]{.underline}. There are of course other expressions of our
broken world that are equally profound, if less immediately obvious. One
is **[a crisis of mental health]{.underline}**, with **[suicide the
leading killer]{.underline}** of British men under the age of fifty and
**[depression]{.underline}** expected [to be the]{.underline} **[leading
cause of the global burden of disease by 2030]{.underline}**. Others
still are less easy to personalise, remaining incomprehensible on a
human scale. One is a **[crisis of the state]{.underline}**,
[as]{.underline} agency ebbs to the market and [an
increasingly]{.underline} [**globalized economy undermines** the ability
of nations to **act decisively**]{.underline}. This process of [market
and capital integration]{.underline} -- [where commodities]{.underline}
move more [seamlessly]{.underline} than ever -- is entirely
[at]{.underline} [odds with]{.underline} the experience of **[displaced
peoples]{.underline}** and undocumented migrants [as they face
**walls**, **surveillance** and ever more **securitised
borders**]{.underline}. As the state gives way to the market this is
accompanied by a nebulous sense of loss, as [a crisis of representation
**empties democratic institutions of authority**]{.underline} and
citizens come to view them as little more than conduits for the
interests of corrupt elites. [This]{.underline} [entrenches]{.underline}
the tendencies of [globalisation as]{.underline} previous, if
[imperfect]{.underline}, [repositories of accountability]{.underline} --
[**national governments -- lose** the **consent** of those they
represent.]{.underline} In the supposedly good times [something had
**gone badly wrong**]{.underline} -- [but it **remained an
undercurrent.**]{.underline}

Almost two decades after Fukuyama's false prophecy, that decisively
changed: **[a banking crisis]{.underline}**, a **[debt
crisis]{.underline}**, a **[deficit crisis]{.underline}** -- all
[culminating in the]{.underline} **[imposition of
austerity]{.underline}**, [from Greece to California]{.underline}.
Alongside that was **[war in Georgia]{.underline}**, the flowering of
**[the Arab Spring]{.underline}**, uprising in the
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**, **[insurrection]{.underline}** --
[and]{.underline} then the most bloody of civil wars -- in
**[Syria]{.underline}**. Elsewhere [previously low-intensity conflict in
**Iraq and Afghanistan deteriorated**]{.underline} further, soon [joined
by]{.underline} similarly hazy [struggles in **Libya and
Yemen**]{.underline}. In early 2014 [the Russian Federation]{.underline}
added new territory for the first time as it **[annexed
Crimea]{.underline}** following a local referendum. A few months later,
straddling Syria and Iraq in an area the size of the United Kingdom,
**[insurgents declared a caliphate]{.underline}**, the Islamic State.
But even amid all this it was events [in Western Europe, a heartland of
capitalist realism]{.underline}, which proved most surprising: a
heightened cycle of **[protest and riot in England]{.underline}** after
2010 was [followed by a]{.underline} failed but surprisingly close
[referendum on]{.underline} **[Scottish independence]{.underline}** four
years later. Even that paled into insignificance, however, when in 2016
Britain voted to leave the European Union, becoming the first
member-state in its history to do so. While '**[Brexit']{.underline}**
was the most important political moment in Europe for a generation, it
was soon outdone by events across the Atlantic when, just a few months
later, Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** was elected the forty-fifth
president of the United States. Less than a decade after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers in 2008, it was now undeniable. An **[expansionist
Russia]{.underline}**, **[isolationist Britain]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[broken economic model]{.underline}**
[had]{.underline} all [been outdone by **a reality TV star becoming the
most powerful person on Earth**]{.underline}. History was back. [Trump's
inauguration speech]{.underline} the following February stood in defiant
contrast to the heady rhetoric of his predecessor, Barack Obama, when he
assumed office eight years earlier. [Claiming]{.underline} that [the
system was failing ordinary Americans]{.underline}, Trump's explicit
message of social decay and aggrieved **[nationalism]{.underline}**
[became his]{.underline} immediate [signature]{.underline} in office.
And yet in a strange way, despite their markedly different forms of
presentation, [Obama and Trump shared a]{.underline} similar **[faith
in]{.underline}** the unique ability of **[markets]{.underline}** [to
find solutions]{.underline}. After all, **[anything else
is]{.underline}** tantamount to **[heresy]{.underline}** [in a world of
**capitalist realism -- where the end of the world is more plausible
than the end of capitalism**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} condition
[presents]{.underline} arguably [the most pressing crisis]{.underline}
of all: **[an absence of collective imagination]{.underline}**. It is as
if all humanity has been afflicted by a psychological complex,
[capitalist realism making us believe the present world is stronger than
our capacity to remake it]{.underline} -- as if it were not [our
ancestors]{.underline} who [created what stands before us]{.underline}
now. As if the very essence of humanity, if there is such a thing, is
not to constantly build new worlds. In its defence, capitalism can point
to an impressive record, at least so far. Having faced crises almost
every decade for two centuries, amid the ferocious pace of constantly
accelerating change, it has always found ways of extracting profit and,
eventually, improving living standards. Capitalism has survived, evolved
and prospered through the Industrial Revolution, the Great Depression,
protectionism, two World Wars, the end of the gold standard and the
demise of the Bretton Woods Agreement. Little more than a generation
ago, much of the world was under the political influence of the former
Soviet Union, with it and the United States seemingly destined to face
off in nuclear confrontation. And yet that never came to pass and, as
Fukuyama would later write, a divided world was replaced by one where
markets prevailed and liberal democracy would reign supreme. This
explains why, in spite of manifest crises, [those who champion the
status quo are]{.underline} as [confident]{.underline} as they are.
[Ours may]{.underline} well [be]{.underline} a [world of low

#### The alternative is fully automated luxury communism -- coopting the machinery of efficient production to create sustainable automated machine unemployment

[Why 'fully automated luxury communism']{.underline}? Why those words
and in that sequence? After all, [many see]{.underline} [communism
as]{.underline} nothing more than [a failed experiment]{.underline} of
the twentieth century undeserving of our attention save learning from
its mistakes. [Some may admit that capitalism has]{.underline} numerous
[flaws]{.underline}, and may indeed end one day, [but]{.underline} if
[communism]{.underline} is what comes next, that [wouldn't be an
improvement]{.underline}. While it is true that a number of [political
projects have labelled themselves communist]{.underline} over the last
century, [the aspiration was neither accurate nor]{.underline} -- as we
will go on to see -- [technologically possible]{.underline}.
'**[Communism']{.underline}** [is]{.underline} used here for the benefit
of precision; the intention being to denote [a society in
which]{.underline} **[work is eliminated]{.underline}**, [scarcity
replaced by]{.underline} **[abundance]{.underline}** [and
where]{.underline} **[labour and leisure blend]{.underline}** into one
another. [Given the]{.underline} possibilities arising from the [Third
Disruption]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} the emergence of [extreme
supply in **information, labour, energy and resources**]{.underline},
[it should be viewed]{.underline} not only [as]{.underline} an idea
adequate to our time but **[impossible before now]{.underline}**.
[FALC]{.underline} does not underpin the trends of the Third Disruption
-- [it]{.underline} is [the]{.underline}ir [conclusion]{.underline}. [If
we want it]{.underline}. However people respond to the word 'communism',
the word is associated with one person in particular -- Karl Marx. It
was he who claimed to see the contours of a new world at the precise
moment industrial capitalism burned at its brightest. That is not to say
Marx was unique in thinking capitalism would end, nor that it would
transition to something else. Indeed in this respect he was joined by,
among others, two thinkers of the twentieth century, John Maynard Keynes
and Peter Drucker, who despite being critics of his held similar views
on how capitalism might lead to a system beyond it. By placing Marx
alongside both thinkers, examining how each viewed the relationship of
scarcity to capitalism and utopia, we can begin to create a clearer
picture of what he meant by communism. An aspect of Marx's thinking
which remains underemphasised is how he recognised capitalism's tendency
to progressively replace labour -- animal and human, physical and
cognitive -- with machines. In a system replete with contradictions, it
was this one in particular which rendered it a force of potential
liberation. This is most clearly laid out in the 'Fragment on Machines',
a short but important excerpt within the much larger Grundrisse. The
reason you've likely never heard of either before, unlike the
better-known Communist Manifesto or Capital, is that the Grundrisse was
unpublished in German until 1939. Worse still, the text wasn't
translated into English until 1973. As a result, its prescient
observations exerted little influence over communist projects in the
twentieth century. That was a tragedy, because within the Grundrisse we
not only encounter the first analysis of technological evolution under
capitalism, but also the opportunities that creates. As Marx so
memorably put it in the 'Fragment', [Capital employs
machinery]{.underline}, rather, only to the extent that [it enables the
worker to work a larger part of his time for capital]{.underline}, to
relate to a larger part of his time as time which does not belong to
him, to work longer for another. Through this process, [the amount of
labour necessary for the production of a given object is]{.underline}
indeed [reduced to a minimum]{.underline}, but only [in order to realise
a maximum of labour in the maximum number of]{.underline} such
[objects]{.underline}. The first aspect is important, because capital
here -- quite unintentionally -- reduces human labour ... to a minimum.
This will redound to the benefit of emancipated labour, and is the
condition of its emancipation. Marx could not have been any clearer:
[competition compels capitalists to innovate in production]{.underline}.
[This leads to permanent experimentation with workflows and
technologies, all in the pursuit of ever-greater
efficiency]{.underline}. The logic of market demand means capitalists
must produce goods and services as cheaply as they can, forcing them to
constantly reduce overheads, in turn [creating a never-ending cycle of
automation]{.underline}, encompassing tasks and even whole jobs --
[substituting workers with machines]{.underline}. [While
generating]{.underline} huge amounts [of suffering and
exploitation]{.underline} under capitalism, under [another
system]{.underline} this [represented]{.underline} a momentous
[opportunity]{.underline}. In 1987 the US National Academy of Sciences
published a report titled Technology and Unemployment. In it, restated
almost word for word, is Marx's criticism of technological change under
capitalism, the key difference being the report's authors consider such
change to be wholly positive: [Historically]{.underline} and, we
believe, for the foreseeable future, [reductions in labour]{.underline}
requirements [per]{.underline} unit of [output]{.underline} resulting
from new process technologies [have been]{.underline} and will be
[outweighed by]{.underline} the beneficial [employment effects of
the]{.underline} [expansion in]{.underline} total [output]{.underline}
that generally occurs. So while production becomes ever more efficient,
and [leisure is valued as a social good]{.underline}, [increased
**productivity doesn't lead to more free time but**]{.underline} simply
the production of **[more goods and services]{.underline}**. In fairness
to those defending it, such a view was not only founded on economic
orthodoxy but also two centuries of observable change under capitalism.
The difference with Marx in the Grundrisse is he thought
[there]{.underline} wa[s an **alternative**]{.underline}, and that [only
in pursuing it could humans **achieve freedom.**]{.underline}

While the average political commentator likes to cast Marx as an
idealistic dreamer, the man himself repeatedly stated his distaste for
describing what communism might actually look like -- what he termed
writing 'recipes for the cook-shops of the future '. While admirable in
its humility, that is also irritating because one of the greatest minds
to describe the shortcomings of the emerging system was well placed to
at least suggest what might replace it. Marx's view, however, was that
[workers in struggle were uniquely positioned to arrive at concrete
solutions]{.underline}. He was certain about some features of the new
society, however. One was that the arrival of [communism would herald
the end]{.underline} of any distinction between labour and leisure. More
fundamentally, it would signal humanity's exit from what he called [the
'realm of necessity' and entrance into the 'realm of
freedom']{.underline}. But what did that mean? For Marx the realm of
necessity was where we 'wrestle with nature to satisfy our wants and to
maintain and reproduce life' -- in other words it was a world defined by
scarcity, something which had confronted us since the time of our
hominid ancestors. In Marx's day it formed the central question of
classical political economy: how do you efficiently and equitably
allocate resources in a world where they are limited? For Marx the realm
of necessity was so far-reaching that it even included socialism. That
was because, like capitalism, it had features such as work and scarcity
-- although as a system subject to democratic control these were
rationalised and more socially just. While certainly preferable to
capitalism, and something to be actively struggled for, socialism for
Marx was a stepping stone to something else: communism and the realm of
freedom. This, by contrast, was marked not only by an absence of
economic conflict and work but by a spontaneous abundance similar to the
Golden Age of Hesiod or Telecleides, or the biblical Eden. Unlike in
classical Greek poetry or religious scripture, however, for Marx this
was a project to be aimed at rather than a legendary past to be revered.
A realm of plenty beyond imagination wasn't something to recall or enjoy
in the afterlife -- it was a political project to aim for in the here
and now. It was communism. Despite the claim that Marx favoured violent
revolution, the truth is he never believed the transition beyond
capitalism would be an exclusively political process -- something so
simple to achieve as to merely require replacing one group of rulers
with another. It certainly entailed class struggle and the working class
gaining political power, but it also needed new ideas, technologies and
social relations. Marx considered the working class to be the key to a
future society, but only because its revolution was uniquely able to
eliminate work and thereby end all class distinctions. Thus despite
repeated calls for the working class to liberate itself, Marx did not
believe that work makes us free -- nor that the society of work expands
the scope of human possibility. To the contrary, his view was that
[communism was only possible when]{.underline} our [labour]{.underline}
-- how we mix our cognitive and physical efforts with the world --
[becomes a route to self-development rather than a means of
survival.]{.underline} Marx viewed [this]{.underline} a[s contingent on
technological change]{.underline}: [the]{.underline} [more
developed]{.underline} the forces of [production]{.underline}, [the
greater]{.underline} their [capacity to offer]{.underline} a new kind of
society where labour and [leisure]{.underline} would blend into one: In
a higher phase of communist society, after the enslaving subordination
of the individual to the division of labour, and therewith also the
antithesis between mental and physical labour, has vanished; after
[labour has become]{.underline} not only a means of life but [life's
prime want]{.underline} ... and all the springs of co-operative wealth
flow more abundantly -- only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois
right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banners:
From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs! With
the arrival of communism any distinction between mental and physical
labour would vanish, [with work becoming]{.underline} more [akin to
play]{.underline}. [This also meant]{.underline} a society with greater
[collective wealth]{.underline}, [where]{.underline} all essential
[wants as well as]{.underline} creative [desires are
satisfied]{.underline}. Which is where [luxury]{.underline} comes in.
The concept, [under]{.underline} conditions of [scarcity]{.underline},
expresses that which [is beyond utility]{.underline}, its essence an
excess beyond the necessary. So [as information, labour, energy and
resources become permanently cheaper]{.underline} -- and work and the
limits of the old world are left behind -- it turns out [we]{.underline}
don't just satisfy all of our needs, but [dissolve any boundary between
the useful and the beautiful]{.underline}. [Communism is luxurious -- or
it isn't communism.]{.underline}

**[Capitalist realism]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} best [summed up
with a single sentence]{.underline}: '**[It is easier to imagine the end
of the world than the end of capitalism]{.underline}**.'\* For Mark
Fisher -- the British theorist who coined the term -- [that]{.underline}
catchphrase [captures the]{.underline} very [essence of our
era]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} **[capitalism]{.underline}** not
only [viewed as the **exclusively 'viable political and economic
system'**]{.underline} [but also]{.underline} one [where it is
'**impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative**]{.underline} '.
After all, [how can you contrive an alternative to reality
itself]{.underline}? Turning to the 2006 film Children of Men, Fisher
investigates its [surreal normality as a dystopia fit for our age with
the world it]{.underline} [projects]{.underline} 'more like an
[extrapolation or exacerbation of ours (rather) than an
alternative]{.underline} to it. In its world, as in ours,
**[ultra-authoritarianism and Capital]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
by no means in[compatible]{.underline}: **[internment
camps]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} franchise **[coffee
bars]{.underline}** [co-exist]{.underline}.' This tallies with the
thinking of Alain Badiou, who writes, [We live in a contradiction ...
where all existence ... is presented]{.underline} to us [as ideal. To
justify their conservatism]{.underline}, the [partisans of the
established order cannot]{.underline} really [call it ideal]{.underline}
or wonderful. So instead, [they]{.underline} have decided to
[say]{.underline} that all [the rest is horrible]{.underline} ... [our
democracy is not perfect. But it's better than the bloody
dictatorships]{.underline}. [Capitalism is unjust. But it's not criminal
like Stalinism]{.underline}. [We let **millions of Africans die of
AIDS**]{.underline}, [but we don't make racist nationalist declarations
like Milosevic]{.underline}. [Because **capitalist realism has no offer
of a better future**]{.underline} -- [especially]{.underline} so [over
the]{.underline} course of the [last decade]{.underline} -- [its default
logic is one of **anti-utopianism**]{.underline}. **[Flat
wages]{.underline}**, **[falling home ownership]{.underline}** [and
a]{.underline} **[warming planet]{.underline}** [might be
bad]{.underline}, granted, [but **at least we have
iPhones**]{.underline}. And, yes, [you may not be able to access the
things your parents took for granted]{.underline}, [like]{.underline}
**[affordable homes]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[free higher
education]{.underline}**, [but]{.underline} [you should still **be
grateful**]{.underline} -- [at least it's **not the sixteenth
century**]{.underline}. Over time [this argument]{.underline},
[seductive]{.underline} for the opening years of the twenty-first
century, [is]{.underline} being revealed as **[patently
absurd]{.underline}**. **[Capitalist realism]{.underline}**, [a world
**where nothing** really **changes**]{.underline}, [is giving way to a
**historic moment defined by crisis**]{.underline}. One
[where]{.underline}, **[unless we transform our understanding of the
future]{.underline}** once more, [the]{.underline} very **[worst
demons]{.underline}** of centuries past **[will prevail]{.underline}**.

Technology.

The [expected inequality of access to HET will **exacerbate existing
economic inequalities**]{.underline} if left unregulated[.]{.underline}
The [wealthy]{.underline} already benefit from their financial
situation; for example they [can use their position to access better
education and nutrition, which in turn enhances their brain
power]{.underline} (Sahakian &Morein-Zamir, 2007, p. 1159). [HET has the
potential to allow those who can afford it to increase, through the use
of genetic modification technology, their own, and their children's, IQ
beyond even that of the most gifted naturally. Cognitive
enhancements,]{.underline} such as education, have many benefits beyond
higher job status and salary; they [can reduce the risk of substance
abuse, crime, and many illnesses while increasing quality of
life]{.underline}, social connectedness, and political participation
(Sandberg &Bostrom, 2007, p. 208). Consequently, the [benefits
associated with higher IQ]{.underline}, such as increased income
(Sandberg &Bostrom, 2007, p. 216), [and prevention of a wide array of
social and economic misfortunes]{.underline} (Bostrom &Sandberg, 2009,
p. 330), [are likely to increasingly become solely available to those
who are better-off,]{.underline} further increasing the advantages
packaged with wealth. [This will exacerbate economic inequality by
providing further benefits to those with the ability to pay and
preventing access for the less well-off. Fukuyama (2002, p. 9-10) is
concerned that the idea of natural human equality, that is the base of
political and moral equality, will be compromised by HET and
**consequently some people, the unenhanced, will be considered less
human** than the enhanced.]{.underline} HET has the potential to [create
two classes of people, the enhanced and the unenhanced, and this would
increase class struggle; a solid immovable hierarchy]{.underline} would
form where, [**based on ability to pay**, some people would be
significantly better off than others who would never have the ability to
catch up as they lack class mobility]{.underline}. There is concern that
those able to afford HET will be buying their own well-being at the
expense of a greater social good (Caplan &Elliott, 2004, p. 174). There
is fear that the way we live together as a group could be damaged by the
actions of individuals. [Harms from inequality **do not require extreme
deprivations to warrant our consideration**; injustices exist even when
no extreme deprivation is present.]{.underline} If a HET increased
political influence for those who could afford it, such as by allowing
increased communication capacities, this would be an injustice to those
who did not have access to it although they suffer no extreme
deprivation (Buchanan, 2011b, p. 250). [We must seriously consider these
potential harms from increased inequality and create policies to best
mitigate these harms]{.underline}. Studies [have found a wide range of
negative outcomes both within and between nations with greater
inequality,]{.underline} these include; greater risk of mental
disability and psychiatric hospitalization (Hudson, 2005, p. 16); lower
economic mobility (Andrews &Leigh, 2009, p. 1492); poorer general
health; higher infant mortality; lower average life expectancy;
increased obesity; greater illicit drug use; [higher homicide and
violent crime]{.underline}; a greater prevalence of depression; and,
lower self-reported well-being (De Vries, Gosling&Potter, 2011, p.
1978). These [numerous social problems are more common in unequal
societies, for everyone in the society, not just the less
well-off]{.underline} (Wilkinson &Pickett, 2007, p, 1972).In a society
with a strong hierarchy, an individual's position relative to others is
more important, and, consequently, individuals become more competitive,
less trusting, more self-focused, less friendly, and less cooperative
(De Vries, Gosling, &Potter, 2011, p. 1979). This means more unequal
societies have lower levels of agreeableness and, following from this,
poor health outcomes, such as poor diet, and increased alcohol and
cigarette consumption (De Vries, Gosling, &Potter, 2011, p. 1984).
[Increased inequality, and the associated negative consequences, should
be of concern to both the less and more well-off in
society.]{.underline}

But [besides those]{.underline} issues [are challenges]{.underline}
seemingly [harder to overcome]{.underline}. In isolation each is
historically significant, yet [taken together they]{.underline} can be
viewed as threats whose scale is civilisational, [hold]{.underline}ing
[the potential to **undermine the ability of capitalism** to **reproduce
itself** as a system **based on infinite growth**]{.underline},
**[production for profit and wage-labour]{.underline}**. There are
**[five]{.underline}** such **[crises]{.underline}**, [which at times
overlap]{.underline}. They are **[climate change]{.underline}** and the
consequences of global warming; **[resource scarcity]{.underline}** --
particularly [for energy, minerals and fresh water]{.underline};
[**societal ageing**, as life expectancy increases and birth rates
concurrently fall]{.underline}; [a growing surplus of **global
poor**]{.underline} [who form a]{.underline}n ever-larger
'[unnecessariat']{.underline}; [and]{.underline}, perhaps **[most
critically, a new machine age]{.underline}** [which will
herald]{.underline} ever-greater **[technological
unemployment]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} progressively more
[physical and cognitive labour is performed by machines]{.underline},
rather than humans. [Confronting such crises is the basis of
**FALC**]{.underline}. **[Capitalism]{.underline}**, at least as we know
it, [**is about to end.** What matters is what comes next.]{.underline}

The claim [that capitalism will end, is]{.underline}, for capitalist
realism, [like]{.underline} saying [a triangle doesn't have three sides
or]{.underline} that the law of [gravity no longer applies]{.underline}
while an apple falls from a tree. [Rather than understanding
the]{.underline} [present as **one historical period among
many**,]{.underline} like Victorian England or the Roman Republic, [to
be **alive at the end of history** means presuming our social systems to
be]{.underline} as [unchanging]{.underline} as the physical laws that
govern the universe. And yet the truth is **[capitalist realism is
already coming apart]{.underline}**. The fact you are reading [these
words]{.underline} at all [is proof]{.underline}. Despite the
observations of Francis Fukuyama and his disciples, history returned [on
15 September **2008**]{.underline} [when the global financial system
crashed]{.underline}. Within weeks [the world's]{.underline} leading
[economic powers]{.underline}, previous zealots for minimal state
interference, were left with no alternative but to [bail out their
domestic banks]{.underline}, [with some]{.underline} even [being
**nationalised**]{.underline}. [That exposed]{.underline} their
[previous free market fervour for the lie it was]{.underline}: this was
**[socialism for the rich]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[market
capitalism for the rest]{.underline}**. The critics had always said as
much, now nobody could deny it. But as well as revealing what had passed
as common sense for the political project it was, [that
moment]{.underline} also [ended]{.underline} a phase of [global
expansion]{.underline} that had powered financial services and real
estate -- most notably in Britain and the United States -- to the
forefront of economic life. Over the preceding two decades it was these
areas which had underpinned growth, tax receipts and forms of asset
ownership which were at least moderately distributed. After 2008 that
decisively changed, meaning that in many countries
**[poverty]{.underline}** has **[increased]{.underline}**,
**[wages]{.underline}** have **[stagnated]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[growth]{.underline}** -- in any significant sense
-- has **[vanished]{.underline}**. In the US the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, popularly known as '[food stamps]{.underline}', is a
federal initiative that helps low-income Americans buy food. By virtue
of its objective it [is]{.underline} one of [the most accurate
indicator]{.underline}s [of **poverty**]{.underline} in the country.
While [in]{.underline} [2007]{.underline}, immediately before the
crisis, [26 million Americans were in receipt of food
stamps]{.underline}, [by 2012]{.underline} -- [at the]{.underline}
[tail]{.underline} end [of]{.underline} what some now call '[the Great
Recession']{.underline} -- [that]{.underline} figure had almost [doubled
to **46 million**]{.underline}. Over subsequent years, despite an
alleged upturn in the country's economic fortunes, that number barely
moved, with Donald Trump frequently highlighting how [43
million]{.underline} Americans used food stamps while on the campaign
trail [in 2016]{.underline}. For all the talk of his victory being
powered by 'fake news', that number was entirely accurate. Analogous to
food stamp use in the US is the meteoric rise in the number of people
using food banks in Britain. The Trussell Trust, which operates the
largest food bank network in the country, claims to have delivered
around 41,000 food packs in 2010. By 2017 that had risen to 1.2 million
after nine consecutive years of rising demand for their services. While
the increased use of food banks in the UK is partially the result of
disastrous welfare reforms, it also reflects something observable on
both sides of the Atlantic: being in work no longer guarantees escaping
poverty -- quite the opposite. The most detailed data available in the
UK only serves to confirm a historic shift has taken place over the last
decade, with those in relative poverty more likely to be in a working
household than not. Most troubling of all is that this is accelerating:
by the end of 2016, **[55 per cent of people in poverty
were]{.underline}** in a household where someone was
**[employed]{.underline}** -- an astonishing 7.4 million people. Just
[six months later]{.underline} that figure had risen to [60 per
cent]{.underline}. Powering this downward spiral is falling wages: since
2008, real **[pay]{.underline}** in Britain, which takes inflation into
account, has **[dropped]{.underline}** by more than **[10 per
cent]{.underline}**. It should come as little surprise, then, that
nearly 17 million Brits of working age have less than £100 in personal
savings. In the United States it's a similar story, with [**63 per
cent** of Americans]{.underline} saying they [**have \$500 or less** put
aside]{.underline}. The other pillar of consent for twentieth-century
capitalism, of [property-ownership]{.underline} as the complement to
democracy, [is in]{.underline} similar [retreat]{.underline}. In
Britain, where the Conservative Noel Skelton coined the term
'property-owning democracy' in 1923, home-ownership is at its lowest
level since 1985 and continues to fall. It's even worse in the US,
though, where a combination of high prices, low wages [and]{.underline}
little credit means [the average American is **less likely to own**
their own **home** than at any time **since 1965**]{.underline} -- four
years before the Moon landing.

While ordinary people are struggling, measured through use of food banks
and food stamps, wages which buy less or unmet expectations regarding
home ownership, [the abstract vision of the **economy** pedalled by
elites, defined by growth and productivity, is in]{.underline} similar
**[disarray]{.underline}**. After all, on [output per hour
worked]{.underline}, perhaps the most useful measure of economic
progress, Britain [produced less]{.underline} in 2017 than it did a
decade earlier. Such a development is [without precedent in modern
history.]{.underline} Similar issues are in evidence elsewhere around
the world. '**[Lost decade]{.underline}**', previously used to describe
anomalous economic conditions in countries like Italy and Japan, is
increasingly [applied to]{.underline} an [ever-growing]{.underline}
cluster of [nations]{.underline}. Since the crisis of 2008, [Greece and
Spain]{.underline} have seen **[unemployment]{.underline}** go [beyond
**25 per cent**]{.underline}, with youth unemployment touching double
that. Elsewhere, [**economies** such as]{.underline} [**Hungary,
Austria, Portugal and Latvia's are no bigger**]{.underline} now
**[than]{.underline}** they were in **[2008]{.underline}** when measured
on an output-per-person basis. [Even in]{.underline} the rising nations
of [the Global South]{.underline}, the trend is clear. The [10 per cent
growth]{.underline} which characterised the Chinese and Indian economies
during the early years of the twentyfirst century [are now a thing of
the past]{.underline}. Elsewhere the likes of [**Brazil and Russia**
have been mired in **recession**]{.underline} almost as severe as parts
of Europe, the only difference being their economic malaise has kicked
in at far lower levels of relative development. [Such a
shift]{.underline} has only served to [strengthen the forces of
**autocracy**]{.underline}. So our world is one increasingly defined by
low growth, low productivity and low wages. [Before the
crisis]{.underline}, most [policymakers would have thought
such]{.underline} [events impossible]{.underline}, let alone speculated
about an appropriate response. Alan Greenspan's 2008 remarks to the US
House of Representatives are illustrative: the banking crisis having
left this former chairman of the Federal Reserve in a state of 'shocked
disbelief ' and 'distressed' by events he previously viewed as
impossible. While **[neoliberalism]{.underline}**, which emerged with
the Thatcher and Reagan governments, [led to higher **unemployment** and
**lower wage growth**]{.underline}, for more than a generation this was
mitigated by access to cheaper goods and services -- by relocating
production to countries with lower wages -- as well as inflated asset
prices, particularly housing, and access to cheap mortgage and consumer
debt. As well as forming the foundation for a widely felt material
improvement in living standards, this was the economic base for a world
where [there was no alternative]{.underline}. [How could
you]{.underline} really [be angry at]{.underline} anything with your
credit cards and ever-[cheaper consumer gadgets?]{.underline} And even
if you were, [what choice did you have]{.underline} once you'd earned
your stake in the system with a home of your own? Now, with these
previous fixtures in retreat, [elites have yet to make a positive offer
about what comes next]{.underline}. What we know for certain is that
**[the status quo can't hold]{.underline}**. [There is]{.underline}
**[no consent]{.underline}** [for a system which]{.underline}, on nearly
every measure, [is **going backwards**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
all [explains the revival of]{.underline} **[radical
politics]{.underline}**, [on both the left and right]{.underline}, in
recent years. Because the events of 2008 came as such a shock -- even
for the system's outsiders -- nobody proved immediately able to take
advantage of such a historic opportunity. Gradually that would change,
however, with the previously unthinkable becoming increasingly
commonplace. In the 2009 European Parliamentary elections, the far right
made impressive gains across the continent with the likes of
**[UKIP]{.underline}**, France 's Front National and even the British
National Party attracting widespread support. The
**[BNP]{.underline}**'s results in particular came as a shock, with a
party historically connected to the country's **[neo-Nazi
movement]{.underline}** [gaining]{.underline} almost [1
million]{.underline} votes and two MEPs. For a few years similar
energies on the left were limited to the streets -- such as the 2010
British student movement and the Spanish **[Indignados]{.underline}** --
but eventually these too translated to success at the ballot box. Spain
offered the most obvious initial expression of that with the emergence
of a new party, **[Podemos]{.underline}**, which gained five MEPs in
2014 just a few months after it had been formed, before finishing third
in the following year's Spanish general election. But before then, in
January 2015, Greece's **[Syriza]{.underline}**, a coalition of
previously insignificant left-wing groups, would win the most seats in
that country's general election. After agreeing to be the senior partner
in a wider coalition they formed a government, becoming the first party
of the radical left to do so in a Western democracy since the Second
World War. This fed hopes of a deal between Greece and the 'Troika' of
the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International
Monetary Fund on the terms of their coming bailout deal that summer. In
due course Syriza campaigned for an '**[Oxi']{.underline}** vote,
defying the conditions proposed by the Troika. To widespread amazement,
oxi -- no in Greek -- won by a landslide. While the Troika would refuse
to change their stance in the negotiations that followed, and the Greek
government capitulated to their terms, a new reality had emerged: the
corridors of power were no longer insulated from mass protest in the
streets. In Britain, meanwhile, the Conservative Party won its first
majority since 1992 as the right-wing [UKIP attracted]{.underline}
almost [4 million votes]{.underline} and the Scottish National Party
took an astonishing forty seats from Labour in Scotland. A few months
later, Jeremy Corbyn, who began his outsider bid at odds of 200--1,
became Leader of the Labour Party -- his supporters certain he could be
powered by the same wave that had taken the likes of Syriza and Podemos
so far in such a short space of time. It was 2016 which proved to be the
decisive year, however, as a crisis that started eight years earlier
found its most potent political expressions. In June, Britain voted to
leave the European Union with more people voting in the
'**[Brexit']{.underline}** referendum than any previous vote held in the
country. That appeared to be a pivotal moment, with right-wing populism
seeming to capture an increasingly clear hostility to governing elites.
As Nigel Farage, a figurehead for the Brexit movement, triumphantly
declared on the night, 'This is a victory for ordinary people, for good
people, for decent people ... the people who've had enough of the
merchant bankers.' Yet even the shock of Brexit paled in comparison to
events just a few months later when Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**, a
well-known businessman and reality TV star, was elected president of the
United States. Winning the Republican primary earlier that year had
already caused a shock -- and with Bernie Sanders pushing Hillary
Clinton close for the Democratic nomination, the signs were there for an
upset. Which was precisely what ensued as Trump took previously
democrat-held 'Rust Belt' states on his way to the White House. The
President-elect's victory speech was reminiscent of Farage 's, as he
told 'the forgotten men and women of our country' that they would be
'forgotten no longer'. The following April, buoyed by the perception of
a zeitgeist seemingly to her advantage, Britain's new Prime Minister
Theresa May called a general election to cement her party's grip on
power. An enhanced majority was widely viewed as inevitable, the
question being how big a landslide the Conservatives could achieve. And
yet, in a manner analogous to both Trump and Brexit, Labour defied the
odds with a clear message of a break with the status quo. While they
didn't form a government, they did deprive the Tories of a majority,
winning an additional 3.5 million votes in the process and enjoying the
biggest increase in vote share -- for any party -- since 1945. The
Tories, significantly to the right of their campaigns in recent years
also did well, winning their highest share of the vote since 1987.
Britain now displayed both key features of the new political landscape:
massively increased **[polarisation]{.underline}**, and uncertainty as
to whether the politics of the left or right would ultimately prevail.
While they might not share much politically, **[Trump]{.underline}** and
**[Corbyn]{.underline}**, along with **[Brexit]{.underline}** and the
emergence of **[Podemos]{.underline}**, Bernie **[Sanders and
Syriza]{.underline}**, [indicate]{.underline} **[the era of capitalist
realism is over]{.underline}**. And yet there is also a deeper story at
play, one which remains largely unremarked upon. While the events of the
last several years are both historic and unexpected, they are a response
to an economic crisis, beginning in [2008]{.underline}, which itself
[only represents the first stage of a prolonged period of global
disorder]{.underline}. Over coming decades we will not only endure the
aftershocks of the failure of this economic model to deliver rising
living standards, but also [the era-defining]{.underline} effects of the
aforementioned **[five crises]{.underline}**. Individually, **[each
pose]{.underline}**s **[an existential threat]{.underline}** to our way
of life. Together they could blow away the social and economic
certainties of the last two and a half centuries. But there is a deeper
layer still, because [we are at a crossroads as much as a cliff
edge.]{.underline} Alongside these challenges [we]{.underline} also
[see]{.underline} the contours of [something new,]{.underline} a society
[as distinct from our]{.underline} own [as]{.underline} that of the
twentieth century to [feudalism, or urban]{.underline} civilisation
[from]{.underline} the life of the [hunter-gatherer]{.underline}. [It
builds]{.underline} on [technologies]{.underline} whose development has
been accelerating for decades which, only now, are set [to
undermine]{.underline} the key features of [everything]{.underline} we
had previously presumed to be as unchanging as scarcity itself. Its
name? Fully automated luxury communism.

FALC Is a Beginning, Not a Destination The shifts outlined as central to
the Third Disruption are not a destination, but a beginning. [FALC is
not a blueprint for]{.underline} a steady-state [Eden]{.underline} --
those always prove disappointing anyway. [Nor is it]{.underline} a place
[beyond sadness or pain, where conflict and vulnerability are consigned
to the pas]{.underline}t. [Pride, greed and envy will abide as long as
we do]{.underline}, the management of [discord]{.underline} between
humans -- the essence of politics -- [an inevitable feature
of]{.underline} any [society]{.underline} we share with one another.
Instead, [FALC is a]{.underline} [figurehead of possibility]{.underline}
forged for a world changing so rapidly that [new utopias are
needed]{.underline} -- because the old ones no longer make sense. Isaac
Deutscher once wrote '[socialism is not evolution's last]{.underline}
and perfect [product]{.underline} or the end of history, but in a sense
only the beginning'. This is how [FALC]{.underline} is perhaps best
conceived. It [is a map by which we escape]{.underline} the labyrinth of
[scarcity]{.underline} [and]{.underline} a society built on
[jobs]{.underline}; the platform [from which we can begin to
answer]{.underline} the most difficult question of all, of [what it
means]{.underline}, as Keynes once put it, [to live 'wisely and
agreeably and well']{.underline}. Of course, [any]{.underline} effective
[map must instruct]{.underline} its user about [immediate next
steps]{.underline}, the clarity of which must be as apparent as the
intended destination. It is for this reason that [FALC demurs from
idealism]{.underline} or an overly optimistic view of human nature,
[offering immediate action]{.underline} instead. While
[FALC]{.underline} is situated within a transformation as seismic as
that of the arrival of agriculture, its concrete [politics consist
in]{.underline} specific, readily identifiable demands[: **a break with
neoliberalism, a shift towards worker-owned production, a state-financed
transition to renewable energy and universal services -- rightly
identified as human rights -- placed beyond commodity exchange and
profit**]{.underline}. FALC is not a manifesto for the starry-eyed
poets. Rather it is born from the recognition of an increasingly obvious
truth: amid the changes of the Third Disruption the 'fact' of scarcity
is moving from inevitable certainty to political imposition. This is not
a book about the future but about a present that goes unacknowledged.
The outline of a world immeasurably better than our own, more equal,
prosperous, and creative, is there to see if only we dare to look. But
insight alone is not enough. We must have the courage -- for that is
what is required -- to argue, persuade, and build. There is a world to
win.

Yet sometimes the nimbler Bastani persona lightens these pages. A clever
passage uses the London "Horse Manure Crisis" of 1894, when the then
huge number of horses being used in the capital led the Times to wonder
whether it would become uninhabitable, to demonstrate that supposedly
lethal threats to the environment can be overcome by technology with
unexpected swiftness. Within a few years of the panic, motorised
transport became common, the London horse population collapsed, and the
threat of manure-buried streets evaporated. "A few short decades from
now," Bastani concludes, "the seemingly terminal \[environmental\]
problems of today will appear as absurd." You don't have to share his
confidence about that to agree with his suggestion that the apocalyptic
is a mode that the media and many of its consumers slip into too easily
-- sometimes for commercial or psychological rather than rational
reasons -- and that episodes of mistaken doom-mongering are too easily
forgotten. But he does concede that [there is a bigger obstacle than
pessimism]{.underline}, or "technical barriers", to [the]{.underline}
creation of a [sustainable and fair world. The problem is
**political**]{.underline}: [the stranglehold of **short-termist
corporations**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} most [economic life and
governments]{.underline}. It's a predictable bogeyman for a book of this
sort, but a persuasive one. [As long as]{.underline} such [capitalists
dominate the development and deployment of technology]{.underline}, he
argues, [its potential to achieve higher **social and environmental
goals will not be realised**]{.underline}. [Even the]{.underline} [most
adventurous space]{.underline} exploration [firms]{.underline}, which he
at first profiles with great enthusiasm, [are]{.underline} ultimately
[too unambitious and profit-driven]{.underline} for his liking. In his
final chapters, Bastani sketches how governments and citizens could make
companies act differently, and also expand the space for developing
technology outside capitalism altogether. He suggests that Corbyn's
Labour party, and in particular the shadow chancellor John McDonnell and
his technologically literate young advisers and proteges, are on the
right path. But it's a long haul from "growing the worker-owned economy"
and establishing new British "regional investment bodies", as the book
slightly blandly summarises the McDonnell approach, to establishing the
new global society Bastani envisages, with almost limitless public
services and consumer commodities, all of them either free or affordable
to all, and environmentally sustainable.

#### Globalization of biotechnology is a continuation of epistemologies of Western control that violates other nation's sovereignty

**Carolan 7** (Michael S. Carolan, \"Mapping Biotechnology: From
Epistemic Artifacts to Geographies of Control",
https://www.jstor.org/stable/43304100, Autumn 2007, Accessed

[Questions of sovereignty and distributive rights become par- ticularly
pronounced when one recognizes the **globalization of Western patent
law.**]{.underline} Such a move began to gather steam in the 1 980s with
the emergence of the Uruguay Rounds. This represents a watershed moment
of [sorts, ushered in largely by developed countries, which ultimately
led to the \"harmonization\" of interna- tional patent law.]{.underline}
Serious [concerns began to emerge in the 1 980s within the U.S. business
community and government regarding lost revenues from the piracy of U.S.
technologies overseas.]{.underline} According to a 1987 survey conducted
by the U.S. International Trade Com- mission, U[.S. firms were losing
approximately US\$50 billion a year]{.underline} from a lack of overseas
intellectual property protection (Adede 2003). [What was
needed,]{.underline} it was argued, [was the uniform adoption of strict
intellectual property rights by all members of the interna- tional
community. This code of **uniform global standards** as they apply to
patent law was first defined with the ratification of the Convention on
Biological Diversity in 1 992,]{.underline} followed shortly there-
after with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (CATT)\'s
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1994.
Yet, [whose vision of patent law was to be \"harmonized\" the world over
through such global agreements? The answer: **Anglo- North American
patent law**]{.underline} (Alford 1995). Thus, [while the creation of a
uniform global standard for intellectual property protection might
initially sound reasonable]{.underline} (particularly among those
located in developed countries), [there is a growing concern that
interna- tional agreements like TRIPS are **little more than \"an
international copyright grab by United States intellectual property
industries\"**]{.underline} (Aoki 1996: 1341). During TRIPS
negotiations, for example, [a number of African countries argued that it
was inherently unethical to patent life form]{.underline}s (Adede 2003).
Similarly, [many Asian countries protested on the grounds that U.S.
patent law clashed with their own cultural tradi- tions,]{.underline}
which consider intellectual works a communal good and copying an
essential means to disseminate knowledge and promote learning. Indeed,
because of this, the patent laws of India, Korea, and Thailand did not
extend to pharmaceutical products, whereas in India such protections
lasted only five years (Kuanpoth 2003). When [examined historically, it
is interesting how developed nations like the United States, the most
ardent supporter of some type of global harmonization of patents,
themselves denied protec- tion for foreign technology when they where
still a young, devel- oping state.]{.underline} The United States, for
example, ignored foreign copyrights until 1891 and maintained a
manufacturing clause in its copyright law until 1986 that limited
foreign copyright holders\' rights for products produced within the
United States (Alford 1 994). And the arguments used to justify these
policies sound remarkably similar to those coming out of developing
countries today.

#### **The development of internationally harmonized biotech patent law is a product of epistemologies of Western dominance that subjugates and erases Eastern countries.** 

**Carolan 7** (Michael S. Carolan, \"Mapping Biotechnology: From
Epistemic Artifacts to Geographies of Control",
https://www.jstor.org/stable/43304100, Autumn 2007, Accessed
6-26-2022)//ILake-SG

[In 2006, South African law was amended to require applicants for
patents to declare the source of origin of the material was well as
whether the innovation draws from traditional knowledge or]{.underline}
traditional [uses.]{.underline} Yet, as the preceding examples make
clear, such [statutory requirements risk becoming irrelevant due to the
growing list of technologies that can **remove these artifacts from
history**.]{.underline} For through such processes as replication and
synthesis[, artifacts can now be created, at least from the perspective
of **internationally harmonized patent la**w, ex nihilo.]{.underline}
When taken together, [such artifacts, processes, and policies reinforce
long-standing geographies of **control and domination**.]{.underline}
This can be witnessed, for example, as one follows the changing spatial
locations of biological material, from source, to centers of
accumulation, to centers of manipulation. [It is no secret how the
origins of important crops sprinkle the globe, with a particular genetic
richness found within the tropics and subtropics.]{.underline} The point
that tremendous biodiversity tends to be centered within these warm,
moist climates was famously documented by the Russian scientist Nikolai
Ivanovich Vavilov in 1926 with the publication of Origin and Geography
of Cultivated Plants. Vet, although the origin of biological materials
is concentrated in less developed countries, [a noticeable
redistribution takes place as these artifacts are reduced into mobile,
stable forms and collected and stored. For example, the 12 largest gene
banks are located in the mostly developed countries]{.underline} of
(listed in alphabetical order) Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
India, Japan, Korean Republic, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and
the United States (Food and Agriculture Association of the United
Nations \[FAO\] 1998). Al- though not exclusively located in developed
countries, neither do the arrangements of these banks reflect the same
spatiality as the origins of the materials they contain. Next,
[attention turns to the top five countries for international patent
filings in 2005: the United States, Japan, Germany, France and the
United Kingdom]{.underline} (with the United States accounting for 33.6
percent of all international patent filings and 34.6 percent coming from
the countries party to the European Patent Convention) ( Recharger
Magazine 2006). In doing this, [we find a noticeable \"clumping\" taking
place within distinctly developed countries. This is not surprising
given the concentrations of capital and technology in these nations;
con- centrations that make it possible to rearrange, manipulate, and
replicate nature in ways that are not (yet?) possible in
countries]{.underline} [where the foundational materials were
discovered.]{.underline} Granted, com- pensatory arrangements, as
earlier described, are set up to mitigate for this point. Through such
arrangements, source countries are to be supplied with infrastructure,
training, and technology so they too will eventually be able to create
patentable innovations. Yet, as also previously described, [those
already in possession of these forms of capital are increasingly able to
remove themselves from any obligations to compensate source countries.
Which leads one to ask: Will less developed countries ever be able to
catch up?]{.underline}

#### **The development of internationally harmonized biotech patent law reproduces dependencies and inequalities.** 

**Carolan 7** (Michael S. Carolan, \"Mapping Biotechnology: From

The goal of this article has been to map [key epistemological and
ontological terrains associated with biotechnology.]{.underline} I begin
by com- paring the scientific representations of today, particularly as
found in the genomic sciences, with those of the past. In doing this, we
find that these representations have changed over the centuries, which
has been of significant consequence in shaping today\'s global political
economy. In the following section, the socio-politi- cal effects of
these representations are discussed, particularly in terms of how they
give shape to global path dependencies. Here, specific attention is
given to the redistributive effects (in terms of reifying the dominant
political economy) of Western patent law and its internationalization.
[By the article\'s end, we find the supposedly spaceless bioeco- nomy of
endlessly reproducible genetic \"code\" to be in fact a fiction. The
reproduction of intellectual property rights **on the global scale** has
resulted in the further reification of existing path depend- **encies
and inequalities,**]{.underline} which in part gives lie to the term
\"global- ization.\" By examining the epistemologica! and ontological
assumptions that give shape to the global distribution of informa-
tional and biological resources, this article seeks to add [another
layer of depth to our understanding of today\'s dominant political
economy and the geographies of control it helps to create and
so-lidify.]{.underline}

The development of the new biology has in large measure been possible
through the application of informatics to biology, more recently, of
[the new biology to informatics, using data-intensive]{.underline} --
so-called ['big data']{.underline} -- [to develop a 'evo-devo' program
that integrates biological theory across the hierarchy of
life]{.underline}. This [involves]{.underline} the [development of a
**dialectic** of]{.underline} information and biology
[('**bioinformatics'**)]{.underline} as a scientific logic and
rationality that leads to the biologization of the digital (in the long
term) [and an informatization of biology]{.underline}. [It follows
developments in late capitalism after
'**informationalism'**]{.underline} (Castells), ['**academic
capitalism'**]{.underline} (Slaughter), ['cognitive']{.underline}
(Boutang), '[finance' and 'financialization',
'**algorithmic'**]{.underline} (high frequency trading), [and now
'bio-cognitive capitalism'. **Genomic capitalism** represents a phase of
global **biocapitalism** that, when harnessed with a new generation of
info]{.underline}rmation [processing]{.underline}, itself organically
enhanced, [comprises a '**bio-informationalism'** that expresses a new
kind of **utopian perfectionism** about the possibilities for a **new
age of genetic self-renewing capitalism that is capable of programming
itself**]{.underline} (Peters, 2012: 99). In a Thesis Eleven paper
(Peters, 2012), I tried to articulate a notion of 'bioinformational
capitalism' that builds on the literatures on 'biocapitalism' and
'informationalism' (or 'informational capitalism') in order to
articulate an emergent form of capitalism that is self-renewing in the
sense that it can change and renew the material basis for life and
capital as well as program itself. Bioinformational capitalism applies
and develops aspects of the new biology to informatics to create new
organic forms of computing and self-reproducing memory that in turn has
become the basis of bioinformatics. The paper begins with a review of
the successes of the 'new biology', focusing on Craig Venter's
digitizing of biology and, the creation of new life from the digital
universe. In examining the claims of synthetic biology (Dyson, 2007)
writes: It has become part of the accepted wisdom to say that the
twentieth century was the century of physics and the twenty-first
century will be the century of biology. Two facts about the coming
century are agreed on by almost everyone. Biology is now bigger than
physics, as measured by the size of budgets, by the size of the
workforce, or by the output of major discoveries; and biology is likely
to remain the biggest part of science through the twentyfirst century.
Biology is also more important than physics, as measured by its economic
consequences, by its ethical implications, or by its effects on human
welfare. Other critics suggest that we have entered the digital age of
synthetic biology where biotechnology and advanced computer information
systems are converging. In this age we can design gene sequences, slice
and edit them, and 'insert them into the DNA of a developing organism,
resulting in life that had not naturally evolved in the global
ecosystem' (Berube, 2016: 428). As Williamson argues: 'postdigital'
hybrids of biological and informational codes, novel neurotechnologies
combine neuroscience insights into the human brain with advanced
technical development in brain imaging, brain-computer interfaces,
neurofeedback platforms, brain stimulation and other neuroenhancement
applications. (Williamson, 2018) He suggests that[: **Merging
neurobiological knowledge** about human life **with computational
tech**]{.underline}nologies, **[neurotech]{.underline}**nology
[exemplifies how **postdigital science** will play a significant role in
societies and education in decades to come]{.underline}. (Williamson,
2018) We can broaden this perspective to talk about the confluence and
convergence of informationalism and biology at the nano-level. In
'Critical Philosophy of the Postdigital' (Peters and Besley, 2018) we
argue: Quantum computing is based on quantum mechanics and offers a
radically different approach from classical computing based on classical
mechanics. **[Cybernetics]{.underline}**, and complexity theory,
[provide]{.underline} [insight into systems that are too complex to
predict their future]{.underline}. [A]{.underline}rtificial
[I]{.underline}ntelligence [and deep learning are promising the final
stage of automation which is not compatible with the welfare state based
on full employment]{.underline}. [**We have** thus **arrived** into the
**age of algorithmic capitalism**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} its
current phase, ['**biologization of digital reason'**]{.underline}, is a
distinct phenomenon that is at an early emergent form that springs from
the application of digital reason to biology and the biologization of
digital processes. **[Rejecting a fully mechanical
universe]{.underline}**, therefore, a critical pedagogy of the
postdigital is closely related to Whitehead's process philosophy, which
[is a form of **speculative metaphysics** that privileges the **event
and processes over and above substance**]{.underline}. [A **critical
philosophy of the postdigital is dialectically interrelated with** the
theories such as **cybernetics and complexity theory**]{.underline}, and
also processes such as quantum computing, complexity science, and deep
learning. [These **processes** **constitute the emerging technoscience
global system, perpetuate (algorithmic) capitalism, and offer an
opportunity for techno-political change.**]{.underline}

#### The incorporation and use of neuroweapons systems datafies the minds of IHL experts [and]{.underline} subjects, cementing calculation as the dominant paradigm. 

**Noll 14** (Gregor Noll, \"Weaponising neurotechnology: international
humanitarian law and the loss of language\", OUP Academic,

Let me, then, ask the same question once more: [what would be lost if we
were to adopt a neuroweapons system incorporating IHL
software]{.underline} along the lines I have described above? [The use
of a neuroweapons system incorporating IHL software would constitute a
reduction: the **legal knowledge of the IHL experts would be reduced to
a set of skills** regarding a particular procedure to be followed in
decision-making and a range of outcomes]{.underline}. As these skills
and this range of outcomes are taken as a baseline for programming,
[they are uncoupled from processes of verbalisation]{.underline},
discussion with peers and other forms of knowledge production. [The
complexity of a mind expressing itself through human language, and minds
communicating with each other, are reduced to neuronal and synaptic
processes, which are scripted in a particular technical
language.]{.underline} In this reduction[, human experts provide
themselves as raw material for armament production.]{.underline} This is
captured well in Martin Heidegger's reflections on what sets modern
technology apart from the technology of pre-industrial farming or
craftsmanship. In his 1953 text on 'The Question Concerning Technology',
Heidegger suggests that it is the river, which is built into the
hydroelectric power station, rather than the power station being built
into the river.56 He captures this relationship as one of challenging
(Herausforderung, also translatable into 'asking to give up something'
or into 'provocation').57 The decisive difference between a
pre-industrial windmill and the power station is that only the latter is
designed to store energy, whereas the former is at the mercy of the
weather. A power station provokes the river to offer up its energy, to
then secure it in a system of storage, which makes it steerable at will.
In all this, man is no longer at the mercy of the weather. [For
Heidegger, these are the main traits of contemporary industrial
technology: to challenge or provo]{.underline}ke (herausfordern) that
which nature holds, with the purpose to steer (steuern) and secure
(sichern) [the energy derived from it at will.]{.underline}58 **[The
same three traits apply to the hypothetical IHL software I described
above.]{.underline}** The single IHL assumes a role analogous to the
single windmill[, but the software accumulates the knowledge of a whole
group of experts for steady use]{.underline}. These [experts are
provoked by combat simulations to impart something that can be stored,
steered and secured]{.underline}. The [work done to resolve an
application problem of IHL]{.underline} in that simulation is
transformed into measurements of neuronal and synaptic activities, [to
then be]{.underline} re[-transformed into the code of a computer
programme.]{.underline} From there, [it is further transformed into a
machine-made decision whether or not to attack a material
target.]{.underline} As a consequence, humans may be harmed, or not,
buildings may be destroyed, or not. [Securing the operation of a weapons
system through the energy or information imparted by the
experts]{.underline} is, however, only an intermediary aspect of this
process. In the end, it [secures a particular way of waging war,
underwritten by a particular form of knowledge production]{.underline}.
[This knowledge, in turn, is conceived as the ultimate form of knowledge
available to humans. It unfolds a particular form of normativity, which
affects IHL.]{.underline} I will revert to this in a moment. In
comparing the windmill to the power station, Heidegger sets apart
pre-modern from modern technology. Yet it is striking how careful he is
to avoid passing judgment on either form. 'The Question of Technology'
is antithetic to nostalgia.59 Heidegger's point is to present technology
as a mode of revealing truth.60 From this point onward, he develops the
idea that modern technology reveals through challenging and provoking
(Herausfordern). The way modern technology relates to truth, we come to
understand, is no different from the way it relates to a river, to coal,
or to the wind. [Modern technology works in two directions. It brings
about changes in the material world as much as it produces a particular
understanding of what it means to be in the world at all. Neither of
these changes takes place without the involvement of humans. It is
actually decisive for modern technology to address human beings so that
they adopt a challenging, or provocative mode of revealing the
world.]{.underline}61 [The essence of technology is, as Heidegger
emphasises, nothing technical.]{.underline}62 If we accept this, we may
also accept that modern technology made the advent of modern science in
the 17th century possible. In this understanding, [modern technology as
a form of challenging and provoking emerged ontologically and
historically prior to the 18th century breakthrough of
engineering]{.underline}.63 The [**human being is no outsider to this
form of revealing**. On the contrary, she assumes a central role,
walking the path designated by it, being challenged by it in a way prior
to, and more original, than the coal]{.underline}, the water or the
wind, and revealing herself in the process. [For more than three
centuries, the technological mode of revealing has grown from a rather
particular metaphysical choice into ubiquitous technological presence**.
The advent of neuroweapons is perhaps its most conspicuous example so
far**]{.underline}, but [the way it intervenes into the very process of
human perception and cognition differs, in degree, but not in
kind.]{.underline} The growth of modern science into an unquestionable
and naturalised paradigm yields a kind of enchantment. This I felt
together with fellow patients when we saw Leif walk unaided. [This was
sensed by my audiences; anxious about, yet trustful in the metaphysical
groundedness of science**. In its light or dark form, it remains a
dangerous sentiment**]{.underline}. Yet [the perception of things as
ordered by the apparatus of neuroweapons is not as such more or less
natural than any other ordering of perception.]{.underline} It is here
that Heidegger takes us further than analytical philosophers criticising
degenerate forms of Cartesianism64 or cognitive scientists subscribing
to the embodiment thesis65 would do. He does so, because his account for
technology is part of a fundamental critique of any form of
Cartesianism. In Heidegger's thought, all entities can be experienced in
two different modes. One is presence-at-hand (Vorhandenheit), referring
to objects present in consciousness, e.g. when we think about them.
Another is readiness-at-hand (Zurhandenheit), referring to equipment
'that remains concealed from view insofar as it functions
effectively'.66 [For Heidegger, we relate to the world and the entities
in it as 'equipment', and not as subjects encountering objects. When we
encounter an entity as equipment, we relate to it as being for a
particular task.]{.underline}67 When we encounter an entity through the
sights of a weapon, [we encounter it as being for the task of winning a
war (regardless of whether we open fire on it or not).]{.underline} Why
is this so different from Descartes' world where a subject encounters an
object? The Cartesian way is to make out context-independent objects, to
only then add context-dependent meanings to them. These objects are
present-at-hand, and at considerable distance from their uses and
relations. Heidegger's preferred encounter with entities is through the
mode of readiness-at-hand, in which entities already come laden with
contextual meaning. [This meaning---the entity's being itself---can only
be partially experienced as an emergent meaning.]{.underline} Here is
the famous Heidegger quote in which he exemplifies the being revealed by
readiness-at-hand through the example of a hammer: [The less we just
stare at the hammer-thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it,
the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more
unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is---as
equipment.]{.underline} The hammering itself uncovers the specific
'manipulability' of the hammer. [The kind of Being which equipment
possesses---in which it manifests itself in its own right---we call
'readiness-to-hand'.]{.underline}68 As I noted earlier, we relate to
anything in the world as equipment, so there is no particular class of
things that are equipment in the more traditional sense of tools. [Once
we keep this in mind, it becomes clear that revelation of what a thing
is hinges on our preparedness to immerse ourselves into using it, that
is, into its readiness-at-hand.]{.underline} Only then can we reveal
that which is concealed in them (denoted by Heidegger with the Greek
term lethe) and let it come forward as truth (aletheia, the Greek term
for truth or that which is no longer concealed).69 What difference does
this all make to neuroweapons? [I now understand that the neuroscience
going into neuroweapons systems is Cartesian in that **it isolates
neural signals in the human brains as completely decontextualised
objects.** These neural signals are isolated from the fact that they are
observed]{.underline} for a particular purpose (in the end, [for winning
a war]{.underline}). Only after making them present-at-hand as isolated
objects, are they endowed with context. [It is exactly this Cartesian
lack of context that makes them appear as such a solid foundation for
any normativity]{.underline}. We risk believing that this
presence-at-hand, [this objectivity of the entities is nature itself in
purity]{.underline}. So when such neural signals appear, we are
prepared, by an unreflexive Cartesian habit, to ascribe this appearance
a truth-value in isolation from the context for which they are used.
When a particular neural signal appears in the analysis of a video feed
of a theatre of war, we are then a priori prepared to ascribe this
appearance truth-value as to the existence of a target. Here is the
normative effect of Cartesianism. With its reduction of reality to a
presence-at-hand, it 'sets up one privileged entity as the explanation
for all others'.70 Neural signals in the human brain are that privileged
entity in our case, and the explanation of what is a target flow from
it. With Heidegger's distinction in mind, I may trace how Cartesian
ontology effects the hierarchy of academic disciplines as well. To the
extent that this ontology posits presence-at-hand as ideal, the sciences
will always appear as more normative than other disciplines.
Presence-at-hand with its subject--object constellation can be staged
much more convincingly in science than in law, social sciences or
humanities. Medicine rests on the study of the human body as part of
nature, and it is the nature of its natural science that is so well
suited as an object maximally distant from all subjectivity. This adds
further weight to the normativity I outlined above. [I think that the
appeal of the law and neuroscience field may be partially explained by
the desire of legal researchers to render the most judgmental elements
of their discipline]{.underline} more Cartesian. [So neurotechnology in
weapons systems participates in a particular normativity that is founded
on a particular Cartesian ontology.]{.underline} Its workings are very
likely to be unconscious to those engaged in the development of these
weapons systems and technologies, and, indeed, to many of those
criticising them. I have set out with the question what would be lost
with the introduction of neuroweapons, and I have arrived at an answer
that focuses upon what is added when using these weapons, and why it
matters. [This addition comes at the price of a loss: it is the loss of
language. Language is lost because neuroweapons shift the focus from a
conversation amongst combatants on the existence and legitimacy of a
target]{.underline}, or, indeed, even an inner dialogue on these matters
within one combatant [to an exchange of neural signals and its
interpretation by the machine.]{.underline} Of course, in developing
that machine, humans speak and use language in an exchange on its future
uses. [The latter use of language is clinically separated from the
context of the battlefield experience.]{.underline} Why would the
reduced role for spoken language affect the application of IHL? Applying
IHL in the battlefield is to make judgments: distinguishing civilians
from combatants, determining when a combatant is hors de combat or
making a proportionality judgment in targeting. The rules set out in IHL
predetermine these judgments only partially. And these judgments need to
be justified in language ex post. Historically, with the advent of
international criminal law, we have probably never verbalised the laws
of war as much as now. To the extent that applied IHL cannot be
expressed in the script of computer programmes, it would be doomed to
trail the normative primacy of neuroscientific modes of warfare. It is
no coincidence that militaries arrange for a standing conversation on
IHL between a legal advisor (or judge advocate general) and the
commander. [Because it is impossible to express the two cardinal
principles of distinction and proportionality as a script,71
contemporary IHL is critically dependent on language as a carrier of
judgement.]{.underline} [The more neuroweapons are used, the less IHL
will be applied in a conflict.]{.underline} There is a second and
related argument for the importance of language. Heidegger allots the
human a privileged role in revealing things. Presently, this revealing
takes place in the challenging mode so characteristic for technology.
Yet there is another form of revealing in which language has a
privileged role. In his 1950 essay on language ('Die Sprache'),72
[Heidegger distinguishes between a standard view of language as a medium
for humans to express themselves, and his own view, in which language
itself speaks]{.underline} ('Die Sprache spricht').73 [Where language
does not speak in this particular way, we are left with everyday
platitudes or the residuum of information brought about by
technology]{.underline} (which may then be broken down into its
constituent elements and made computable in a software). Yet when we are
attentive to the speaking of language itself, we may hear the peal of
silence ('das Geläut der Stille').74 This mode of revealing is not one
which challenges, but which lets emerge.75 While Heidegger draws on
poems to exemplify this revelatory addition to the constituents of
language, he makes it clear that this particular type of revelation is
necessary for truth to appear. [Language and the role of the human in
the world are closely related to each other. In combination, they are
indispensable for the appearance of truth, if only in a conversation
between a legal adviser and a commander.]{.underline}

#### The impact is a [global techno-totalitarianism]{.underline} that will bring about [extinction]{.underline}

**Resta, 21**---professor of Theoretical Philosophy at the University of
Messina (Caterina, "The Age of the Totalitarian Domination
of Technology," Heidegger and Contemporary Philosophy: Technology,
Living, Society & Science, Chapter 1, pg 17-18, dml)

While the collapse of "ideological" totalitarianism marks the definitive
defeat of the idea of a political government capable of guiding total
mobilization that stems from a political ideology, we can limit
ourselves to observing that [in our present]{.underline}, in the age of
the technological-economic globalization of the world, where the veil of
ideologies has definitively fallen, [the will to power can now be
expressed in all its **destructive violence**, through **technology**,
which]{.underline} directly takes command. Technology that, as has now
become evident, [assumes the task of imposing its total dominion
directly over the **entire globe**, finally **free** from any
ethical-political-legal or ideological restraints. This concerns the
devastation of the **environment**]{.underline}, as well as [the
**economy**]{.underline}, in the age of financial capitalism,
[**bio-technologies** and]{.underline} **[A]{.underline}**rtificial
**[I]{.underline}**ntelligence. [While ideological totalitarianism was
based on]{.underline} a frightening **[personal
constraint]{.underline}**, one that was implemented through terror and
propaganda, [the new **techno-totalitarianism** pursues its aim
of]{.underline} consumption and of [wearing down the totality of
beings]{.underline}, [through an **all-pervasive control** of all the
spheres of existence]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} however [uses much
more **seductive** and **persuasive** systems]{.underline}, such as [to
induce the masses]{.underline}, by now completely depoliticized, [to
consent "**spontaneously**", even **joyfully**, to the loss of their
**most basic freedom**, and live with **relief** from responsibility and
decisions which]{.underline}, in turn, [are becoming **increasingly
anonymous** and **impersonal** and]{.underline}, precisely for this
reason, also **[inscrutable]{.underline}**. [Totalitarianism, in its
extreme form of **post-ideological technological nihilism**, can finally
become a "**normal condition**" for]{.underline} the historical
**[humanity]{.underline}** of our time. [The era of **total global
technological domination**]{.underline}, therefore, not only
[marks]{.underline} the end of philosophy, but also **[the end of
politics]{.underline}** -- [as]{.underline} Heidegger understood--,
[which is forced to serve the **techno-economic interests** that
nowadays impose their dominion directly **without opposition** and
**without intermediaries**]{.underline}, particularly through the
technical and economic command of computation. [Politics now only serves
as **propaganda** and **apologetics**: as a mere 'persuasive' **cover**
and **collector of consensus** for increasingly obscure
technical-economic interests]{.underline}. For its part, [technology is
**never neutral**, since it is already constitutively pre-disposed, as
will to power, to a **violent politics** of power and robbery, which
will be all the more effective]{.underline}, the more it pursues
objectives and interests that are not extrinsic to it. [The new Lords of
the Earth will be the **Lords of Technology**, those able to put
themselves at the service of this **planetary**, **totalitarian power**,
which will then launch its **final attack** on both the **Earth**,
**sacking** and **devastating** it, along with its
**inhabitants**]{.underline}. The animal rationale is transformed into
the technologized animal, while the being-at-work names the new truth
that the era of technology reveals, also "fixing" the essence of man:
"The laboring animal \[das arbeitende Tier\] is left to the giddy whirl
of its products so that it may tear itself to pieces and annihilate
itself in empty nothingness".46 [What characterizes **homo technicus**
above all else is]{.underline} therefore [**self-annihilation**, a
sinister propensity to **self-destruction**]{.underline}.
[Technology]{.underline}, insofar as it is a challenge
\[Herausforderung\], [requires from nature its resources]{.underline},
in the mode of ordering \[Bestellung\], [as a
**standing-reserve**]{.underline} \[Bestand\]. [Ordering]{.underline}
\[Be-stellen\] [is done by **computation**, by virtue of which the earth
is commanded to present]{.underline} \[dar-stellen\] [itself.
This]{.underline} mandatory 'presentation' [forces the earth to make
itself available for our **unlimited exploitation**]{.underline}. This
is why Heidegger would call the non-technological essence of technology
Ge-stell, in the sense of the meeting \[Versammlung\] of the different
ways of placing \[stellen\], through which man requests and provokes the
real. The fact that the real now presents itself as a standing reserve
\[Bestand\] involves the transformation of beings from objects to
reserves of materials and energies that are available to us, usable, and
ready for use and consumption. [Technology is this imperious command
that **violently attacks the earth** in its **totality**, for the sole
purpose of enhancing its power]{.underline}, and therefore is
[**completely indifferent** to the **catastrophic** and **destructive
outcomes** of its devastating work]{.underline}. All [this does not
concern the fate of a **people** or a **continent alone**]{.underline}:
as already Jünger had noted, in addition to its total nature,
[technology also has a **planetary** nature]{.underline} -- today we
would say global -- [that goes **beyond** geo-historical boundaries,
**unifying** the earth in]{.underline} a single, universal language.
While technological power unveiled its destructive character in the wars
of matériel \[Materialkriege\] of the first half of the twentieth
century, then conversely [the violence of an **unconditional will to
power**]{.underline} has become the truth of technology, even in
peacetime.

#### **The spiral into technological improvement and self-augmentation inevitably results in technological immortality -- vote Neg to endorse Being with the Human Body and Death.**

**Blades 3** (David Blades, \"The Pedagogy of Technological
Replacement\", https://www.jstor.org/stable/42978067, JSTOR, May 2003,
Accessed 7-6-2022)//ILake-SG

In a way, notes the Historian, citizenship was becoming moot since [in
the decades that followed, the boundary separating humans from analogous
mechanical technology became blurred.]{.underline} In the early sixties
more and [more humans were electing to replace body parts with durable
synthetics.]{.underline} This led to a brief cyborg movement, [a loose
social development where some individuals proclaimed the superiority of
their synthetic and bio-engineered combinations over \"normal\" humans
and even androids.]{.underline} The prosthetics fashion mania that swept
the wealthy nations in the late sixties briefly stimulated the
development of cyborgs, but [by the mid-seventies the technical ability
to place the entire consciousness of a human into a new, mechanically
equivalent body totally immune from disease led most people to choose
the android alternative]{.underline}; very few cyborg combinations
existed by 2080. Over the next two decades the term \"android\" came to
be used both for those machines of artificial intelligence and those
with similar bodies containing the analogues of human consciousness.
Finally, [during the first two decades of the twenty-second century the
two types of androids completely merged, forming the android
Collective.]{.underline} Those that held to their organic existence due
to nostalgia, religious beliefs, or poverty began the curious process of
dying in the last decade of the twenty-first century, either from old
age or during the Great Plague of \'98-\'99. [The rest of humanity, safe
from the failings of flesh, entered the twenty- second century pondering
their immortality.]{.underline} The Pedagogy of Replacement The end of
the Historian\'s work degenerates into scattered reports of a few major
historical events, such as the dissolution of national entities and the
Collective\'s declaration in 2099 at the dedication of the new Museum of
Creation that it would take care of the remaining organic humans. It is
clear the Historian had lost interest in the narrative before dying,
except for the sudden flurry of writing comprising the final pages.
These begin with a comment that strikes the caregiver as almost
sacrilegious: **[It\'s OK to die.]{.underline}** According to the
discussion that follows, the Historian was reacting to a comment made at
the start of the twenty-first century in a keynote address at a
teachers\' convention: [We are in danger as a species of inventing
ourselves to death. We have at the most one or two generations to gain
public control over the direction of technological change.]{.underline}
The children about to start school next year, our little ones -
certainly their children - will face a radically different world than
humanity has ever known. Indeed, these changes have already begun and
the time is short in beginning the public discussions and action needed
to direct the evolution of our technology. (Blades, 2001, p. 1) While
this educator was right about the extent of the changes that would take
place in the twenty-first century, the history of events revealed a key
flaw in the educator\'s thinking: [The danger to humanity was not in the
possibility of inventing to death, but in the act of inventing away from
death. The android is deeply disturbed by this point and the argument
that follows. Android ontology was formed on the assumption that
androids re-present humanity; in fact, androids are humanity in an
evolved form.]{.underline} The Historian seemed to be developing a
counter argument that **[the act of cheating death through technology
essentially robbed humanity of its Being]{.underline}**. Once again, the
Historian turns to Heidegger, [this time the philosopher\'s sketch in
Being and Time (1962a) of the existential- ontological structure of
death in relation to \"Dasein\" - the existential and ontological
possibilities of Being.]{.underline} Heidegger begins his discussion of
death by reminding readers that [\"death is a possibility-of-Being which
Dasein itself has to take over in every case\"]{.underline} (p. 294).
This is clearly true since [death is the possibility of no longer
Being-in-the-world.]{.underline} In other words, [understanding what it
means to live in the world begins by confronting the possibility of
death.]{.underline} According to Heidegger humans are thrown into this
position: [Every organic human has to face the real event of
death.]{.underline} Thus far the android has little argument. But
Heidegger takes this obvious point much further. After discussing
inauthentic responses to death, he suggests [Being- towards-death can be
seen as \" Being towards a possibility - indeed, towards a distinctive
possibility of Dasein itself\']{.underline} (p. 305[). He explains that
this possibility arises by \"waiting for that actualization\" (p. 306);
that is, the anticipation of this actual event \"turns out to be the
possibility of understanding one\'s ownmost and uttermost
potentiality-for- Being - that is to say, the possibility of authentic
existence\" (p. 307). So claimed by death, one becomes liberated from
one\'s lostness in those possibilities which may accidentally thrust
themselves upon one; and one is liberated in such a way that for the
first time one can authentically understand and choose among the
factical possibilities]{.underline} lying ahead, (p. 308) The android
puts down the Historian\'s notes, shaken. Heidegger is making a radical
suggestion: [Rather than something to overcome, the authentic
anticipation of death leads to freedom from being lost, revealing the
possibility that is life itself. **Authentic Being-in-the-world requires
death**; the ontology of humanness begins, argues Heidegger, with the
\"impassioned freedom towards death\"]{.underline} (p. 311). And,
realizes the android, this [essential anticipation is not logically
possible if you are immortal. What does the technological replacement of
humanity teach]{.underline}? In White Noise , DeLillo (1985) points out
the importance of death in understanding life: [I think it\'s a mistake
to lose one\'s sense of death, even one\'s fear of death. Isn\'t death
the boundary we need? Doesn\'t it give a precious texture to life, a
sense of definition?]{.underline} You have to ask yourself whether
anything you do in this life would have beauty and meaning without the
knowledge you carry of a final line, a border or limit, (pp. 228-229)
The Historian expands on this point, citing the experience of the
character Fosca in Simone de Beauvoir\' s novel All Men Are Mortal
(1946/1995). Frustrated by the death and decay he faces daily, [Fosca
chooses to drink from a potion that guarantees immortality.]{.underline}
But through this character, de Beauvoir shows that immortality is a
terrible curse. Living forever eventually leads to a bland experience of
boring predictability. Fosca explains: It was a fine morning, but the
peasants, bent over the land, did not look at the sky. As for me, I was
weary of seeing it day in and day out for two hundred years, always the
same\.... Endlessly! Will I never awake in another world where even the
air will taste different? (pp. 138-139) Before drinking the potion Fosca
neglected to consider the consequence immortality might have for
relationships. As his friends and companions grow old his retention of
the same age separates him from the essential normal human experience of
aging. In response to his proposal of marriage and in full knowledge of
his immortality, Beatrice responds, \"You\'re not a man\... .You\'re a
corpse\" (p. 153). But even a corpse has future, returning through decay
to the fabric of the natural world; Fosc is even denied this
possibility. [Eventually he comes to realize that a**s an immortal he is
a man from nowhere, without a past, without a future, without a
present.** I wanted nothing; I was no one. My hands were forever empty:
an outsider, a dead man.]{.underline} They were men, they were alive. I
was not one of them. I had nothing to hope for. (p. 400) In the end,
Fosca finds immortality to be \"a terrible curse[. I\'m alive and yet
I\'m lifeless. I shall never die and I have no future. I am no one.
I\'ve no past and no face\"]{.underline} (p. 29). Fosca shows us,
suggests the Historian, that by achieving immortality through technology
humanity moved away from the very sequences of time that defined being
human. These sequences are linked to a much larger pattern of life over
billions of years. In her novel about a family that by accident became
immortal, Babbitt (1975) uses a conversation between the mortal Winnie
and the immortal Tuck to explain how living involves being part of a
larger pattern. When Winnie tells Tuck that she does not want to die,
Tuck replies, Not now. Your time\'s not now. But dying\'s part of the
wheel, right there next to being bom. You can\'t pick out the pieces you
like and leave the rest. Being part of the whole thing, that\'s the
blessing. But it\'s passing us by, us Tucks. Living\'s heavy work, but
off to one side, the way we are, it\'s useless, too. It don\'t make
sense. If I knowed how to climb back on the wheel, I\'d do it in a
minute. You can\'t have living without dying. So you can\'t call it
living, what we got. We just are, we just be, like rocks beside the
road. (pp. 63-64) Like rocks beside the road - the android ponders these
words - and then: Am I alive? Stretching out an arm, the caregiver
adopts a critical stance. [Is this arm, so much like the Historian\'s
arm in shape and function, actually an arm, or just an artifact, part of
an interconnected collection of parts that amounts to no more than a

#### An academic discussion of technological innovation and Being within the context of Heideggerian logics creates Rebellion, allowing us to ask [questions with meaning]{.underline}.

The caregiver turns to the remaining points with anticipation. [The
number four is written beside one word: **\"Rebellion.\"**]{.underline}
A circle has been drawn around this word with a line leading to the next
page. [The last page is a mess of notes and references, but numbers
continue to guide the android]{.underline}. The page begins with a quote
from educational philosopher Maxine Greene: \"In the classroom opened to
possibility and at once concerned with inquiry, critiques must be
developed that uncover what masquerade as neutral frameworks\" (Greene,
1988, p. 134). [This critique begins, suggests Greene, when teachers and
students \"learn to love the questions\" (]{.underline}p. 134). Beside
this quote **[the Historian writes, in large letters, \"ASK WHY\" and a
large number five.]{.underline}** The android bristles a bit at this,
since questions that ask why are regularly used among androids for
systematic diagnosis. As for general speculation, however, the question
seems so impractical and pointless. Anticipating this response, the
Historian argues that [it is fundamentally human to ask ontological
questions arising from the question why.]{.underline} As Heidegger
(1962b) points out, to ask why is to make \"a daring attempt to fathom
this unfathomable question by disclosing what it summons us to ask, to
push our questioning to the very end\" (p. 221). Questions open the
possibility of challenge to the social structures that bind and define
us, but [Heidegger also points out that the questions brought forth by
asking why are sources of revelation]{.underline} about the human
condition. [Questions are thus crucial to the survival of humanness.
Androids may inherit the ability to ask why, but the question shifts in
meaning and purpose when death is not part of the equation and
individuality is absent]{.underline}. [When every part is replaceable
and consciousness is linked to a Collective, asking why as an individual
is meaningless. The]{.underline} corporate [existence of androids robs
them of the ability to ask with any meaning the questions that naturally
rise from the human experience.]{.underline} For this reason, argues the
Historian, [every school should have embraced curriculum of questioning
since through questions children could **more deeply understand their
situation and Being.**]{.underline} In their seduction by the
superficial, however, schools historically avoided the deep questions
that can be brought forth by asking why. [Instead]{.underline}, notes
the Historian, [schools in the late twentieth century and early
twenty-first century encouraged students to leap to the sanctioned right
answer, effectively policed by a testing mania that seemed to grip
public education.]{.underline} This call to the correct answer
considerably narrowed the vision of what else might be, limited what
other questions might be posed, and failed to explore what opportunities
might exist. As a technology of answers, [the system failed most
woefully by not teaching children to pose the difficult questions. What
was needed, argues the Historian, **was a system-wide rebellion
initiated by brave teachers who encouraged children to ask questions,
including questions abo**ut the nature, direction, and **role of
technological innovations**.]{.underline} Drawing from several leading
twentieth century critics of technology (Ellwood, 1996; Mander, 1991;
Postman, 1993), the Historian had sketched out several questions
children, along with teachers and adult mentors, might learn to ask in
order to uncover the political and social issues presented by existing
and emerging technologies, such as: Does the technology 1. provide
benefits for the majority or a few? 2. promote social and economic
justice? 3 . influence the protection of fundamental human and civil
liberties, including the rights of minorities? 4. respect cultural
diversity? What will be the quality of interactions with this technology
across a variety of cultures? 5 . allow a reasonable balance between
time alone and time interacting with others? 6. humanize living? Help
people act with kindness and resp others? 7. respect the natural world?
Favor conservation or waste? 8. have social effects that can never be
reversed?

IV\. Security for Sure [**There can be no security**. If being is what
threatens then security as the absence of terror would be the absence of
being.]{.underline} But **[the absence of being is precisely the
threat]{.underline}**. Obviously, security is just a be found in the
absence of danger as it is in the consummation of the danger, total
annihilation. [Instead, security is to be found within the danger and
threat of being.]{.underline} But how? Heidegger likewise provides us
endangered ones with a way of thinking security and preservation. This
is his fourth contribution to a thinking of terrorism. [Security and
assurance, both equally apt translations of the German Sicherung, are
indissociable from certainty]{.underline} (Gewißheit) for Heid the
course of the 1968 seminar in Le Thor, [Heidegger provides a brief
history of this relation between security and certainty]{.underline}:
\"the quest for certainty appears first in the domain of faith, as the
search for the certainty of salvation (Luther), then in the domain of
physics as the search for the mathematical certainty of nature
(Galileo)\" Heidegger [unites these two concerns for certainty within a
single concept: assurance]{.underline} (Sicherung), \"In the quest for
mathematical certainty what is sought is the assurance of man in nature,
in the sensible, in the quest for the certainty of salvation, what is
sought is the assurance of man in the supra-sensible world\" (KS,
30/14).22 [Certainty is in the service of assurance or security and is
only the epistemological aspect of a greater ontological condition of
security. Security is freedom from uncertainty in all of its forms,
sensible, super-sensible, and ontological.]{.underline} Salvation and
the mathematical certainty of nature are themselves to be understood as
instances of an ontological assurance again uncertainty. [Ontological
uncertainty would be found in conceptions of singularity, where the
uniqueness of a thing renders it irreplaceable]{.underline} and thus
opens us to the possibility of loss, or in conceptions of alterity,
where the other is not anticipated and confined in advance to the
structures of categorical thought. Uncertainty in this eliminated in
security. [One is securely insulated against these differences of the
world. For modern thought, the securing of representations for
representational thinking provided the backdrop for the arrival of
uncertainty]{.underline} (see GA 7: 82; EP, 98). [Modern
metaphysics]{.underline} itself, according to Heidegger, [\"means the
securing of the human being by itself and for itself\"]{.underline} (GA
67: 167). Such a policy must be abandoned becomes more and more a piece
of the standing-reserve like everything else. [This postmodern security
is accomplished through the **bestowal and appraisal of
value**,]{.underline} \"Securement, as the obtaining of security, is a
grounding in valuation\" (GA 5: 262/195; tm). [What is valued can be
replaced by something of equal value, and this fact lies at the center
of our conception of security today. Securement]{.underline}, as a
giving of value, [assures us against loss by making the world
replaceable.]{.underline} In this respect, [security is nothing other
than to imagined as a world of total availability, imagined as a world
of utter transparency where **all resources**, human and otherwise,
**are constantly surveilled** and traced through their paths of
circulation. The transformation]{.underline} in being coincident modern
warfare likewise [puts an end to modern politics and establishes in its
place an impersonal commitment to the furthering of the planned
replacement. Security is only possible when everything works according
to these plans, and this requires \"leaders,\"]{.underline} whose true
function now becomes evident. For the plan, \"the necessity of
'leadership,' that is, the [planned calculation of the securing of the
whole of beings, is required]{.underline}\" \[GA 7: 89 90/EP, 105; tm).
[The demand for security is always a call for such Führers.]{.underline}

Heidegger contends that the history of [Western philosophy]{.underline},
beginning with Plato and Aristotle, has failed to carry out the proper
task of thinking. [Philosophy has occupied itself only with beings. It
has, therefore, failed to ask the "question of being," a question that
asks how and why beings show up as they do.]{.underline} One of the
fundamental goals of Heidegger's project, in this regard, is to
dismantle a core assumption in the Western philosophical tradition, an
assumption that Jacques Derrida will later call the "metaphysics of
presence"2 and Dorothea Frede will call "substance ontology."3 [The
history of metaphysics, as Heidegger puts it, is the treatment of the
meaning of being as parousia or ousia, which signifi es in
**ontologico-Temporal terms,** "presence"]{.underline} (Anwesenheit).
[Entities are grasped in their being as "presence," that is to say, they
are understood with regard to a defi nite mode of time---the
"Present"]{.underline} (Gegenwart). (BT, 47) Based on this view, [the
being of anything that exists, including humans, must be understood in
terms of enduring presence, a presence that is constant or remains the
same through any change in properties. The metaphysical tradition,
therefore, understands the being of beings as "substance," referring to
the basic, underlying "what-ness" that is unchangeable and essential to
all beings]{.underline} as beings.4 In short, **[metaphysics is a type
of refl ection that is "concerned with the essence of what
is"]{.underline}** (AWP, 115). Throughout Western history, this
metaphysical assumption prevailed, where substance has been interpreted
in different epochs in terms of eidos (Plato), energeia (Aristotle), ens
creatum by God (Christendom), res cogitans/res extensa (Descartes), and,
today, as a material resource, a "standing reserve" (Bestand) that can
be mastered and controlled by calculative reason (OWA, 201). As an area
of philosophical inquiry, Heidegger sees nothing inherently wrong with
metaphysics. The problem is that [the metaphysical worldview has become
so dominant that it "drives out every other possibility of
revealing"]{.underline} (QCT, 27). Consequently, [the metaphysical
worldview becomes absolute; it fails to recognize that it is merely one
of many possible interpretations of the world. Although metaphysics is
the prevailing historical interpretation, it has become tyrannical in
the modern age]{.underline}, preventing any other possible horizon of
disclosure. According to Heidegger, [this concealment of other modes of
disclosure is a "double-concealment." First, metaphysics forces all
things to be contained within a substance-oriented worldview. Second,
metaphysics offers itself as the only possible worldview]{.underline}.
As a conse- quence, [**beings reveal themselves only in terms of
substance, and this orientation culminates in the technological age**,
where our relation with the world has become purely instrumental, where
beings show up exclusively as resources at our disposal.]{.underline}
But the expansion of the metaphysical worldview does not end with the
Cartesian paradigm of man as subject mastering and controlling objects
in the world. Man too is sucked into the vast system of objects via the
totalizing effects of modern technology. [Heidegger asks, "Does not man
himself belong even more originally than nature within the standing
reserve?"]{.underline} The answer is yes, as a "human resource" (QCT,
18). Dismantling Cartesian Metaphysics Heidegger's diagnosis of the
oblivion of being helps us understand his motivation for [overcoming the
subject/object metaphysics that "pervades all the problems of modern
philosophy"]{.underline} (BP, 124). For Heidegger, this requires
engaging the thought of René Descartes, the progenitor of this
bifurcated worldview. Descartes's project was to systematically doubt
the veracity of every thought and every commonsense experience in order
to ground science on a foundation of absolute certainty. This method of
radical doubt establishes the res cogitans as indubitable. [The free,
thinking "subject" becomes the self-enclosed first ground from which
"objects" of experience can be observed. From this standpoint, the
external world comes to be understood as a system of causally determined
parts. Beings are no longer experienced in terms of historically
embedded social meanings and values but in terms of brute, mechanistic
causal relations that can be **objectively researched, measured, and
predicted based on scientific principles.**]{.underline}

#### **The aff's planmaking, centered around the motive of securitization, is fundamentally mutually exclusive from the neg's model of Being, in that it results in the inevitable datification of subjects into models.** 

**Mitchell '5** (Andrew J. Mitchell, "Heidegger and Terrorism," Brill,

[**Planning is a matter of ensuring the smooth and \"frictionless"
circulation of resources** along channels and pipelines of order and
delivery. The plan\'s success is assured from the outset, because beings
are now in essence]{.underline} \[plannable\]. The [mathematical
tracking stock and supplies becomes a total tracking when things have
become completely available.]{.underline} Nothing is concealed from this
taking of inventory, with the effect that the mathematical model of the
thing is no different than the thing itself. [The mathematical modeling
of things, an operation that Heidegger traces back to Ockham and the
nominalist split between the word and thing]{.underline} (see VS,
30---31/13--- 14), [is paradigmatic for the disappearance of
**identifiably discrete beings under the rule of technology**. The model
is no longer a representation of what is modeled, but in a paradoxical
manner, the thing itself.]{.underline} Nothing beyond the thing's
mathematical model is recognized. [Everything essential to the thing is
contained in the model, without remainder.]{.underline} Such is the
truth of the standing-reserve; it is a collapse of the distances that
made possible representation. [Without that spacing, there is only the
suffocating rush of the standing-reserve along the circuitry of the
plan. The plan makes **manifest the self-willing nature of technology**,
in that the plan has no purpose other than to assure its own and
increase. For the plan to function, it is therefore necessary that
beings be consumed]{.underline} and their replacements follow right upon
them. The plan plans for consumption, [outlining the paths and channels
that the standing-reserve will occupy in its compelled obedience to
order.]{.underline} The world wars have pointed towards this end,
according to Heidegger, for \"They press toward a securing of resources
\[Bestandsicherun\] for a constant form of consumption\" (GA 7: 88; EP,
103-4; tm). This [consumption is synonymous with replacement, since
there is nothing lost in consumption that is not immediately
replaced.]{.underline} The [plan is to protect itself from loss by
**completely insulating itself from uncertainty**. The plan
seeks]{.underline} \"the \'all-inclusive\' \[restlose\] [securing of the
ordering of the order\"]{.underline} (GA 7: 92; EP, 107; tm). [Order is
only secured when there is nothing that resists it, nothing that remains
in \"disorder.\"]{.underline} Any remainder would stand outside of the
prevailing order, as would any difference, in complete disorder. [There
is another Nietzschean intimation in this, as Heidegger reads the will
to power as a drive to secure and order all chaos.]{.underline} Without
remainder (restlose), without rest, [the standing-reserve threatens to
encompass everything in a monotonous, swirling sameness. **The more
secure the world becomes, the greater is the abandonment of being** as
it is further enframed within the plan.]{.underline}

#### Heidegger indicates that one must create one's own interpretation of law and Being in order to achieve autonomy -- the aff [forgoes]{.underline} this with [state law]{.underline}.

What are the political implications of Heidegger\'s analysis of
authenticity and resolve? [Richard Schmitt is not the only one to
suggest that Heidegger\'s emphasis on self-possession surely \"would
incline him toward an anarchism]{.underline} like that of Henry David
Thoreau, who proclaims, [That government is best which governs
least]{.underline}.\' \"18 In support of this suggestion one can point
to a remark made by Count Yorck von Wartenburg, and quoted with apparent
approval in Being and Time: \"To dissolve elemental public opinion, and,
as far as possible, to make possible the moulding of individuality in
seeing and looking, would be a pedagogical task for the state. Then,
instead of a so-called public conscience -- instead of this radical
externalization? individual conscience -- that is to say consciences --
would again be come powerful.\" (SZ 403) [Schmitt cites one of
Heidegger\'s own statements, adding the comment that Where all authority
is suspect and feared as a temptation for the individual to give over
his responsibility for choosing genuine self- possession]{.underline},
one is not surprised to read that \"Resoluteness constitutes the
fidelity of existence to its own self. As resoluteness which is ready
for dread, fidelity is at the same time respect for the only authority
that existing freely can have.\" (SZ 391)19 [Unfortunately Schmitt does
not quote the second sentence in its entirety and as a result
misinterprets what is being asserted**: according to Heidegger resolve
must root itself in the inherited past**]{.underline}.20 This past,
[given the fact that man exists essentially with others, is not only the
individual\'s own, but determines the destiny of a people.]{.underline}
(SZ 384) \"[Dasein\'s fateful destiny in and with its \'generation\'
goes to make up the full authentic historizing of Dasein.]{.underline}\"
(SZ 385) [Heidegger\'s understanding of destiny rules out all attempts
to draw anarchistic consequences from Being and Time]{.underline}.21
[Once we recognize that authenticity demands the subordination of the
individual to a common destiny, it becomes impossible to see the
Rektoratsrede as diametrically opposed to Being and Time]{.underline}.
Consider the following passage from the address which Schmitt finds
particularly difficult to reconcile with what is said in Being and Time:
[The highly touted \"academic freedom\" is being banished from the
German university: being merely negative, this freedom was spurious. It
meant indifference, arbitrariness of goals and inclinations, actions
without restraint.]{.underline} (SU 15)22 [**Heidegger precedes this
sentence with the Kantian sounding \"To give the law to oneself is
highest freedom**.\" Freedom is understood as autonomy; autonomy
requires obedience to a law which the individual draws from his own
essence and thus gives himself]{.underline}. But [in what sense does
Heidegger\'s understanding of the essence of man enable us to give
content to such a law?]{.underline} Kant could appeal to the authority
of pure reason. [But if Heidegger\'s analysis is accepted, that
authority is no longer available. To give some content to the notion of
autonomy Heidegger draws on history: to understand what his own essence
commands, the individual has to understand also the origin of that
essence and the destiny which ties him to others]{.underline}, to his
people (Volk). (SZ 384, SU 15) This much we can get from Being and Time.
New and all too timely is the emphasis which the Rektoratsrede places on
leader ship. [Heidegger strikes this theme with the very first sentence:
the assumption of the rectorate is the acceptance of the duty to provide
the university with spiritual leadership.]{.underline} (SU 5) And [since
the university should not only be the school which trains \"the leaders
and guardians of the fate of the German people]{.underline}\" (SU 7,
18), but itself a place of \"spiritual legislation,\" (SU 21), **[this
leadership cannot be confined to the academic sphere, but should have an
impact on the entire nation.]{.underline}** The disintegration of the
old order, the collapse of an already ruined culture, which threatens to
sweep everything into confusion and madness (SU 22), gives particular
urgency to this task. Heidegger\'s description of the students of 1933
underscores this urgency: Germany\'s students are \"on the march,\" but
this march still lacks direction. This makes it into a search for those
leaders, who through \"word and work\" would reveal to these students
their vocation. (SU 14)

from the scientific community reveal the danger of these potentially
incendiary speculations. Responding swiftly, the Office of the Director

scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or
genetically modified . . . " (my emphasis).6 Within days, the director

so, we must resist the temptation to confine our analysis to the narrow

conjuncture as extraordinary, it is crucial that we situate the current
unfolding within the long history of Asian racialization, one that
indexes the abiding tension between the political impetus to define
national belonging and the shifting economic imperatives of the
nation-state.8 In this essay, we examine the techniques and effects of
race-making in this current moment, while linking them to historical
antecedents, in order to illustrate [the persistence of the yellow peril
ideology as it is being configured through a techno-Orientalist
imaginary where China is posited as the chief enemy-threat]{.underline}.

#### Discussion of new emerging tech in STS shows that race is NOT just biological, but has recentered toward a posthuman conversation of socio-genetic discussion\-\--specifically in biotech, this racial configuration brings new forms of biological orientalism to fruition that aggregates Asian Americans into racialized stereotypes of dehumanization

Studies" \| DOI: 10.1215/00029831-3711150 \| SAoki)

\-\--STS = science and technology studies

Like Zhou's and Anderson's monographs, which group Asian American texts
and cultural productions around a particular theme, Lee's book can be
approached as an analysis of Asian American literature and performance
art within the framework of biopolitics and the idea of the fragmented
Asian American body. But Lee's book is much more ambitious, an
epistemological reassessment of Asian American studies that attempts to
graft recent scholarship in gender theory, queer theory, and science and
technology studies (STS) onto Asian American critical thought to break
the static thinking of the field's pursuit of social justice and
understanding of agency. [In a framework where race is understood as a
historically variable construct with material effects, the term Asian
American has been foregrounded as a necessary "fictional (discursive)
construct,"]{.underline} one [that constantly threatens to be
interpreted as **essentialist** and **biological**]{.underline} (8).
Pointing to the field's renewed anxiety about essentialism, Lee reviews
the different ways scholars such as Kandice Chuh and Colleen Lye have
called for "more rigorously historicist, formalist, \[and\] aesthetic"
interrogations (10). While not taking issue with these endeavors, [Lee
questions the implications of avoiding a discussion of the ways
**scientific discourse on race** has moved to the **genetic** and
**cellular level**]{.underline}, and [has **cleaved from the
biological**]{.underline}. [This disconnect]{.underline}, she argues,
[**forecloses** a number of **opportunities to advance social justice**
agendas]{.underline}: [the ability to see the persistence
of]{.underline} particular forms of [biological racism]{.underline},
[the emergence of new racial forms]{.underline}, and the apparent
equivalence of living matter "in an abstract system of underlying
exchangeability" (233[). In a manner analogous to Asian American
studies' deployment of qualified personification, STS deploys discursive
strategies that conjure narratives about fictional persons in order to
return the part (of the body) to the whole---for example, conflating
cell lines with persons and turning them into proxies for
personhood]{.underline}. Lee highlights how [recent scholarship in STS
traces the historicity of biology and exposes the ways
**biotech**]{.underline}nology [has reconfigured biology as a factory in
correspondence with an intensified commodification of organs and tissues
from surplus populations, separating human biological persons from
partial persons]{.underline}. She pushes [Asian American
scholarship]{.underline} to [consider these new forms of racial
profiling and rearticulated divisions between nature and culture, human
and posthuman]{.underline}. In other words, **[the meaning of race has
changed within the discourse of biology]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} Lee contends that [these shifts have neither displaced
nor supplanted a chromatic schema of race. Instead,
biotech]{.underline}nology['s separation of human biological persons
from partial persons and its anthropomorphizing of cells performatively
intensify the aggregation and disaggregation of Asian Americans into
revised racial classification systems]{.underline}. [This
emerges]{.underline}, for instance, [in]{.underline} the case of Greg
Bear's biothriller Blood Music (1985), whose plot includes [racializing
and reinforcing Orientalist stereotypes of Asian Americans as

as a production, reproduction, and consumption unit as well as planet-
destruction unit]{.underline}. [Sexual practice in pairs]{.underline}
(that is to say, in distinct groups of more than one but fewer than
three individuals of distinct sex) **[is conditioned by the
heterocentric system's reproductive and economic
purposes]{.underline}**. The qualitative (straight) and quantitative
(two) sexual normalization of corporal relationships shall be
systematically subverted thanks to countersexual reversal practices and
individual and group practices, which shall be taught and promoted by
means of freely distributed countersexual images and texts
(counterpornographic culture). Article 11 Countersexual society shall
establish the principles of a countersexual architecture. The conception
and creation of countersexual spaces shall be based on the
deconstruction and renegotiation of the border between the public and
private spheres. This task implies the deconstruction of the house as a
private space of heterocentric production and reproduction. Article 12
[Countersexual society promotes the **destitution of traditional
educational institutions** and the development of a high- tech
countersexual pedagogy in order to maximize the erotic relationship
between living bodies as well as diversifying and improving
countersexual practices. **Countersexual society** favors the
development of knowledge-- pleasure; it **favors the development of
technologies aimed at a radical transformation of bodies and an
interruption of human history as the naturalization of
oppression**]{.underline} (the naturalization of class, race, sex,
gender, disability, species, etc.).
