[[Leaders believe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[if]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[state abandons one ally]{.mark} during a crisis]{.underline},
[then their state\'s **[other allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} will
[[expect]{.mark} **similar [disloyalty]{.mark}** in the
future]{.underline}. Thus, [a **single instance** of
disloyalty]{.underline} can damage, or even [destroy]{.underline},
[alliances]{.underline} with other states. Because of this belief in
interdependence --- that developments in one alliance will also affect
other alliances --- the desire to demonstrate loyalty has exercised a
tremendous influence on U.S. policy. But is indiscriminate loyalty what
allies want? The First [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait Crisis]{.underline}
(1954--55) case study [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[allies do
not desire]{.mark} U.S. [loyalty in **all
situations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, they want the \[US\] United
States to be a reliable ally, posing no risk of abandonment or
entrapment. [In the]{.underline} First [Taiwan Strait
Crisis]{.underline}, several allies [[worried]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[U.S. [loyalty]{.mark} to the Republic of China
[increased]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk of]{.mark} **unwanted
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and as the crisis persisted, these
allies sought to restrain the United States and thus reduce the
likelihood of war. Although U.S. leaders were reluctant to coerce the
Republic of China into backing down during this territorial dispute with
the People\'s Republic of China, other [U.S. [allies **actively
encouraged**]{.mark}]{.underline} such
[[disloyalty]{.underline}]{.mark}. These findings have significance for
theories of alliance politics and international reputation, as well as
contemporary alliance management.

Introduction

Do states judge their ally\'s behavior toward its other allies? If yes,
how? Historically, decisionmakers have instinctively adopted deterrence
theory\'s logic that a state\'s character is judged through displays of
innate loyalty: if a state is disloyal to one ally, then this will
create a reputation for disloyalty, which will cause other allies to
doubt the state\'s reliability. Thus, disloyalty can have calamitous
consequences: the aggrieved ally will punish the betrayal; other allies
will suffer crises of faith; and adversaries will conclude that the
state\'s alliances are cheap talk. The logic is that discrete alliance
commitments are interdependent---that what happens in one alliance
affects the expectations of other allies---and that this interdependence
is underpinned by demonstrations of loyalty. President Lyndon Johnson
said that if the United States were "driven from the field in Viet-nam,
then no nation can ever again have the same confidence in American
promise or in American protection."1

These convictions regularly animate contemporary debates: Nancy Bernkopf
Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue that if the United States were to abandon
Taiwan in a conflict with China, this could deal "a fatal blow to the
U.S.-Japan alliance" and might lead to South Korea "renouncing its
security alliance with Washington and aligning with Beijing."2 Aaron
Friedberg writes that expecting a U.S. "back down ... \[and\] a Chinese
victory over Taiwan ... to leave America\'s Asian alliances unscathed,
is to indulge in wishful thinking of the most dangerous kind."3 Others
suggest cross-regional effects, claiming that by "retreating from the
Middle East and abandoning Ukraine to Russian aggression," President
Barack Obama left "America\'s Asian allies ... bewildered and
alienated."4 If alliance interdependence exists, and is governed by
innate loyalty, then fighting for reputation is crucial, because any
single alliance rift could quickly tear asunder other alliance
relationships.

Some scholars, described as "reputation skeptics," dispute this common
wisdom. Skeptics argue that because "[[reputation]{.mark} is [in the
**eye of the beholder**]{.mark}]{.underline}," the [United States should
**never** regard demonstrating loyalty as sufficient grounds for
military action]{.underline}.5 Jonathan Mercer argues that [when
[allies]{.mark} observe the **U**nited **S**tates demonstrating
loyalty]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} will [[attribute]{.mark} this
**desired [behavior]{.mark}** [to **situational causes**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [will [not conclude]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [it will be loyal in **[future crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
contrast, he concludes that [[when]{.mark} the **U**nited **S**tates is
[disloyal]{.mark}]{.underline}, this [[undesired
behavior]{.underline}]{.mark} will be [[attributed to **national
character**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [but]{.underline} will
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} always [[cause allies to expect **similar
behavior** in the future]{.underline}]{.mark}.6 Reputation skeptics
believe that "[leaders are **tragically mistaken**]{.underline} when
they commit to the use of force in the expectation of long-term benefits
beyond any gains in the immediate dispute."7

**The nuclear umbrella is [unsustainable]{.underline} and fails to
prevent proliferation or solve deterrence.**

Why is this statement so intriguing? Because it shows the authors of
this report recognize that [[Europe]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline}
might be [[**more secure** if it]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[rely on a
**local**]{.mark}**ly based [deterrent]{.mark}** [instead
of]{.mark}]{.underline} continuing to shelter under [[the U.S. nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}]{.mark}. And if that is true for the nations of
Europe, then it might well be [true for others]{.underline}. Although
the report's authors are opposed to new states joining the nuclear club
(Britain and France are already members), their statement clearly
implies that [deterrence]{.underline} would be [strengthened if states
facing **serious external threats** had a nuclear guarantee that didn't
depend on **Uncle Sam**]{.underline}.

This is hardly a new issue. Since fairly early in the nuclear age, the
United States has used nuclear weapons to "extend deterrence" and shield
some of its allies. It sought to convince potential adversaries that the
United States might use its formidable nuclear arsenal if these allies
were attacked, even if the United States was not. Of course, there was
always some chance that a war involving one of the United States' allies
might escalate to the nuclear level, either by accident, through
inadvertence, or via deliberate decision, no matter what U.S. leaders
said in advance. Even so, Washington went to considerable lengths to
make its nuclear umbrella credible, partly to discourage enemies from
attacking but also to convince its allies not to get nuclear weapons
themselves.

Accordingly, U.S. leaders made lots of public statements linking the
U.S. arsenal to its core alliance commitments, and NATO drew up various
plans and doctrinal pronouncements designed to reinforce perceptions of
a reliable U.S. guarantee. The United States also deployed thousands of
warheads on some of its allies' territory, along with dual-key
arrangements that gave those allies some say in how, when, or if these
fearsome weapons got used. Lastly, and very importantly, the United
States kept trying to achieve a meaningful degree of nuclear superiority
to make a possible first use of nuclear weapons to defend allies more
credible. Instead of acquiring a "minimum deterrent" (i.e., retaliatory
forces that could survive any possible attack and then inflict
unacceptable damage on an aggressor), U.S. war plans and weapons
decisions always focused on trying to come out on top in the awful event
of an actual nuclear war.

Why did the United States do this? In good part because convincing
people you might use nuclear weapons to defend an ally isn't easy. One
might imagine a U.S. president using nuclear weapons to retaliate
against a direct attack on U.S. territory or to deter the extremely
unlikely prospect of a conventional invasion that threatened U.S.
independence. This is the one thing nuclear weapons are good for:
deterring existential threats to their possessors' independence or
autonomy. This form of deterrence (sometimes termed "basic" or "Type I")
works because the deterring side will almost certainly care more about
preserving its own independence than a potential attacker is likely to
care about trying to take it away. Because the balance of resolve favors
the defender, even much weaker nuclear powers can deter enemies from
attacking them directly. If you don't find this argument persuasive,
remember the U.S. attacked non-nuclear Iraq in 2003 and non-nuclear
Libya in 2011, but it leaves nuclear-armed North Korea alone.

By contrast, [[deterring]{.underline}]{.mark} a conventional or a
[nuclear attack on an ally [by threatening]{.mark} to go
[nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and convincing your allies that you
really mean it --- [[is]{.mark} **more
[challenging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is one thing to threaten to use
nuclear weapons to keep one's own country from being subjugated but
quite another to do so to save an ally from defeat or domination. Or, as
people used to wonder back in the Cold War, [[would]{.mark} a U.S.
[president]{.mark} really [risk Washington]{.mark} or Chicago [to save
Paris]{.mark} or Berlin]{.underline}? Long after they had left office, a
few former U.S. officials suggested the [answer was]{.underline} almost
**[[certainly]{.underline}]{.mark}** "**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Extended deterrence could still work because potential attackers can't
be sure about any of this, but it still [[isn't]{.underline}]{.mark} as
[**[credible]{.mark}** as deterring attacks]{.underline} on one's own
territory.

The [[solution to this conundrum]{.underline}]{.mark} --- if one can
call it that --- [[is]{.mark} to achieve
**[overwhelming]{.mark}**]{.underline} "**[[nuclear
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**." If you could wipe out an
adversary's entire nuclear force in a first strike, you wouldn't have to
fear its retaliation, and using nuclear weapons to defend an ally would
be much more credible. Even if a splendid first strike were not
possible, perhaps you could convince a potential attacker that it will
end up even worse off than you are at the end of a nuclear war to
convince it not to put so much as a toe on the first rung of the
escalation ladder.

Thus, the perceived need to extend deterrence is one of the reasons why
the United States has long sought nuclear superiority. It's not the only
reason: A genuine first strike capability could limit damage in the
event of an actual war. A few commentators have also tried to argue ---
not very convincingly --- that superiority would enable the stronger
side to coerce weaker states in crises. Chasing the holy grail of a
first-strike advantage was also popular with defense contractors and
parts of the armed services because it requires spending billions of
dollars annually on more and more accurate weapons, more efficient and
destructive warheads, improved surveillance and anti-submarine warfare
capabilities, and lots of other shiny objects.

Interestingly, a number of sophisticated [scholars]{.underline} have
[recently claimed]{.underline} that [technological advances]{.underline}
have [put the United States on the brink of]{.underline} a [true
**first-strike capability**]{.underline}. [Perhaps in
theory]{.underline}, [but **certainly not**]{.underline} as a
[usable]{.underline} option. To see why, ask yourself what you would do
if you were president and facing a serious crisis with a nuclear-armed
adversary. You've put the armed services on alert, and there is some
danger that force might be used and fighting could escalate. Suppose
your military advisors and intelligence experts tell you if you order a
first strike now, you can almost certainly destroy the enemy's entire
nuclear arsenal, leaving the United States unscathed and in an ideal
position to resolve the dispute on favorable terms.

Being a sensible person, you'd undoubtedly ask them: "Can you guarantee
that? Are you absolutely, 100 percent sure the enemy will have zero
usable weapons left, and therefore, we won't even get our hair mussed?"

"We are highly confident of success," you are told. "But there is a slim
chance that a few enemy weapons would survive and reach U.S. soil. No
more than one to three."

Even if you weren't troubled by the moral issues involved in ordering an
[attack that would kill **untold numbers** of people]{.underline} (and
you ought to be), would you do it? Of course you wouldn't, because you
[wouldn't]{.underline} want to [risk]{.underline} losing [New
York]{.underline}, [Los Angeles]{.underline}, [Chicago]{.underline},
[Boston]{.underline}, [or any other]{.underline} major [U.S.
city]{.underline}, which is what might happen if that first strike you
authorized turned out to be just a tiny bit less effective than your
advisors predicted. To issue a launch order, you'd have to believe the
proposed attack would work perfectly the very first time it was executed
(simulations and exercises aren't the same), almost all of the missiles
and bombs that have been sitting in silos or storage facilities for
years would work as designed, and the other side wouldn't have dispersed
its own forces or hidden some extra weapons in places you had failed to
detect. Based on everything the United States' knows about complex
military operations and the limits of intelligence, [you'd be a
[**fool** to **roll the dice**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this way.

One more thing: [[As]{.underline}]{.mark} first-strike [[capabilities
improve]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[respond by keeping forces on **higher alert**]{.mark} or
adopting]{.underline}
"[**[l]{.mark}**aunch-**[o]{.mark}**n-**[w]{.mark}**arning]{.underline}"
[procedures that [increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[risk of
**accidental** or **inadvertent** war]{.underline}]{.mark}. No matter
what U.S. forces are capable of in theory, in short, it's hard to see
how any president would be willing to use nukes first even if the
probability of "success" was extremely high. This reality casts further
doubt on the whole idea of extended deterrence, insofar as it is based
on the threat to deliberately escalate to the nuclear level if a key
ally is in danger of being conquered.

Extending a protective umbrella over allies in Europe and Asia may have
made good sense during the Cold War, both to protect them and to
discourage proliferation. But the [**[nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[environment]{.mark}** [has changed]{.mark}]{.underline}: The number of
nuclear-armed states has crept upward, and several countries (India,
Pakistan, and the United Kingdom) are increasing the size of their own
arsenals (though they remain far lower than U.S. or Russian levels).
Moreover, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates is [not]{.mark}
as **tightly [coupled]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} some of its]{.underline}
traditional [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} as it was during the Cold War,
[and serious [rifts]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[continue to grow]{.mark}
despite]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration's [efforts
to restore **alliance solidarity**]{.underline} and reassert U.S.
leadership.

Which raises the obvious question: Does it still make sense to shield
allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella? [[Using]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[threat of nuclear use to protect other countries]{.mark} is not cost-
or risk-free]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it may even be [**[more
dangerous]{.mark}** [than letting]{.mark}]{.underline} some [other
[states acquire **arsenals of their own**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
encouraging them to rely on "Type I" deterrence provided by their own
national capabilities.

This view has been advanced before --- most notably by Kenneth Waltz in
a controversial Adelphi Paper 40 years ago. Waltz was not advocating
giving other states the bomb or arguing that the rapid spread of nuclear
weapons would be desirable; his central point was that trying to prevent
the slow spread of these weapons was not without costs of its own and
that in some cases, as he put it, "more may be better." The question is:
Is that becoming the case today?

To be sure, folding the nuclear umbrella might well have some negative
effects. It might make states long accustomed to U.S. protection
question its commitment (though there's no logical reason for them to do
so if it is still in the United States' interest to aid their defense in
other ways). It could also reduce U.S. influence or leverage if certain
allies were no longer as dependent on U.S. protection, though folding
the umbrella would not eliminate their reliance on other elements of
U.S. power. Removing the U.S. nuclear guarantee might encourage a few
states to pursue nuclear arms of their own, but it is not obvious that
acquisition by Japan or Germany would be a terrible outcome from a
purely U.S. perspective.

Moreover, even the possibility that these states might take over
responsibility for deterring attacks on their own territory could have a
sobering effect on a rising China and a recalcitrant Russia. In
particular, it would remind Beijing and Moscow that their own behavior
will affect the strategic calculations that their neighbors make in the
near future, including decisions about nuclear arms. If China doesn't
want to face more nuclear weapons states in its immediate region, for
instance, then its leaders should start asking themselves what they can
do to make those neighbors feel less need for additional protection. The
obvious answer: Stop harassing them in various ways, drop the
sharp-elbowed approach to diplomacy, stick to agreements previously
reached, and do more to resolve existing disputes on a fair-minded
basis.

Whatever Washington ultimately chooses to do with its nuclear umbrella,
the [[more important]{.mark} task is [to **move
beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[tendency to see nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s as]{.mark} **potent [signs]{.mark}** [of
status]{.mark}]{.underline}, [indispensable tools of
statecraft]{.underline}, [or **powerful sources** of
leverage]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons are extremely useful for
deterring direct and all-out attacks on one's own homeland but not much
else. For that purpose, a great power doesn't need an enormous arsenal
or some hypothetical capability to "fight and win" a nuclear exchange.
All it needs is a stockpile that can survive an enemy attack and be able
to respond in kind. Properly concealed or protected, they don't need to
be poised and ready to strike at a moment's notice. [**[Fetishizing the
bomb]{.mark}** and using it to try to protect others is]{.underline}n't
just expensive; it may also be [dangerous]{.underline}.

Alas, though some arms control advocates would like to argue that the
only purpose of nuclear weapons is to deter a nuclear attack on one's
territory, recent world events confirm that nuclear weapons can have
another plausible purpose for some countries. For smaller or weaker
states, [owning nuclear weapons helps ensure that a large country will
**not be able to attack**]{.underline} them and overthrow their
government. Or, at least, the converse is true --- **[NOT]{.underline}**
[having nukes]{.underline} clearly [leaves one
**vulnerable**]{.underline}.

Just [ask]{.underline} Saddam [**Hussein**, who did not have nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, about the 2003 Iraq war. [Or]{.underline} Moammar
[**Gadhafi**, who also did not]{.underline} have nuclear weapons, about
the 2011 NATO air campaign launched against Libya after he threatened to
exterminate domestic opponents. Of course, [we cannot really ask
them]{.underline} --- because not only are their regimes gone, [they are
**dead**]{.underline}, as a direct consequence of wars that they could
not deter with conventional arms alone.

Watching all this, [Kim]{.underline} Jong Un had [already made the
calculation]{.underline}, long before the Ukraine war, [that he would
cherish the]{.underline} North Korean [nuclear weapons]{.underline} that
his grandfather and father had bequeathed him. Our [efforts to persuade
him to denuclearize have **failed**]{.underline} under U.S. President
Joe Biden's four immediate predecessors, and the Biden team itself
appears to be putting little effort into the quest itself, perhaps out
of recognition that the task is just too hard if attempted in absolutist
terms.

[North Korea is not alone]{.underline}. Twenty four years ago [we tried
to persuade **Pakistan**]{.underline} not to test nuclear weapons after
India had done so. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott led a team
to Islamabad to make the case. Then Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif reluctantly said he had no choice, and, buoyed by Saudi money and
his Chinese ally, Pakistan tested.

Now [we watch a Ukrainian regime vilified as "Nazi"]{.underline} in
nature [by Russian propaganda fighting for]{.underline} its territory,
as well as [its existence]{.underline} as a country --- and indeed the
personal survival of its leadership. Can there be any doubt that Putin
would prefer the dismemberment and annexation of Ukraine --- Putin has
repeatedly called into doubt the very concept of Ukraine as a sovereign
state --- and the capture or killing of its president, Volodymyr
Zelenskyy, given the way Putin has demonized him? When aggressors have
extremist, existential goals like these, nuclear theorists rightly argue
that nuclear weapons alas CAN be relevant, for threatening unacceptable
retaliation to any such attack and thereby deterring it.

At the end of the Cold War, Ukraine had the world's third largest
nuclear arsenal. The fact that, in 1994, Ukraine returned to Russia
almost 2,000 nuclear weapons that it had inherited from the breakup of
the Soviet Union --- receiving in reply a guarantee, in the form of the
Budapest Memorandum (also signed by the U.K. and U.S.) that Ukraine
would not be attacked --- adds insult to the injury. Presumably Kyiv
would like to take that decision back, given Russia's subsequent
behavior.

Some [countries will draw]{.underline} two [lessons]{.underline},
neither in the interest of the United States, from this history. [If you
have nuclear weapons, **keep them**. If you don't have them]{.underline}
yet, **[get them]{.underline}**, especially if you lack a strong
defender like the United States as your ally, and [if you have
**beef**]{.underline} with a big country that could plausibly lead to
war.

Thinking through similar hypothetical scenarios 60 years ago, President
John F. Kennedy predicted that there would be at least 25 nuclear
weapons powers in the course of the 20th century. Luckily, he was wrong,
and today we still have only nine. But the reasons for Kennedy's fears
persist; in fact, recent events have exacerbated and magnified them.

There is no simple solution to this problem, and we certainly do not
propose that the United States enter the Ukraine war and fight a nuclear
superpower today to reduce the risks of nuclear nonproliferation
tomorrow. That would be oxymoronic in the extreme.

However, there are other more practical implications of this analysis.
One is clearly that the Biden team and U.S. government, more broadly,
should be working as hard as possible, not only to help Ukraine defend
itself, but to seek a diplomatic solution to the conflict that preserves
intact most or all of Ukraine's territory as well as its government.
Otherwise, beyond the further damage done to Ukraine and its people, the
resulting precedent will be terrible for the cause of nuclear
nonproliferation. Second, we need to be more careful about promising
alliance expansion when we don't really mean it. NATO proposed, back in
2008, that Ukraine would someday be invited to join the alliance --- but
with no timetable and no interim security guarantee. That had the net
effect of painting a bullseye on Kyiv's back that Russia has now
targeted. Third, where we do have allies and alliances, we need to be
resolute and consistent in conveying our seriousness about defending
them. Biden is doing this latter job well, but his predecessor did not.

If we fail in these efforts, [Kennedy's prediction about the spread of
nuclear weapons may wind up just being **premature**, not
**wrong**]{.underline}. That would be a very dangerous and regrettable
outcome for the future of international security.

**No prolif spread nor escalation.**

However, [nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration is [**unlikely to accelerate**
or prove]{.mark} to be **[a]{.mark} major
[danger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Terrorists are likely to continue to
find that obtaining and using nuclear weapons is exceedingly difficult.
And aggressive counterproliferation policies can generate costs far
higher than those likely to be inflicted by the proliferation problem
they seek to address. Those policies need careful reconsideration.

Nuclear Proliferation

Except for their effects on agonies, obsessions, rhetoric, posturing,
and spending, [the consequences of nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [have
been]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [**[benign]{.mark}**: those who have
acquired the weapons have ["**used**"]{.mark} them **simply [to
stoke]{.mark} their [egos]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} to **[deter]{.mark} real
or imagined threats**]{.underline}. For the most part, **[nuclear
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline}** have [found the weapons to be **a notable
waste of time**, **money**, **effort**, and **scientific talent**.
They]{.underline} have [**quietly [kept]{.mark}** the [weapons **in
storage**]{.mark} and haven't **even found much benefit** in rattling
them from **time to time**]{.underline}. If the recent efforts to keep
Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons have been successful, those efforts
have done Iran a favor.

There has never been a militarily compelling reason to use nuclear
weapons, particularly because it has not been possible to identify
suitable targets---or targets that couldn't be attacked as effectively
by conventional munitions. Conceivably, conditions exist under which
nuclear weapons could serve a deterrent function, but there is little
reason to suspect that they have been necessary to deter war thus far,
even during the Cold War. The main Cold War contestants have never
believed that a repetition of World War II, whether embellished by
nuclear weapons or not, is remotely in their interests.

Moreover, the weapons have not proved to be crucial status symbols. How
much more status would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? Would
anybody pay a great deal more attention to Britain or France if their
arsenals held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or much less if they had none? Did
China need nuclear weapons to impress the world with its economic growth
or its Olympics?

Those [considerations help explain **why alarmists** have been **wrong
for decades** about **the pace** of **nuclear
proliferation**]{.underline}. Most famously, in the 1960s, President
John Kennedy anticipated that in another decade "fifteen or twenty or
twenty-five nations may have these weapons." Yet, of the **[[dozens
of]{.mark} technologically [capable countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that have [[considered]{.mark} obtaining **nuclear [arsenals]{.mark}**[,
**very few** have]{.mark} done so]{.underline}. Insofar as most leaders
of most countries (even rogue ones) have considered acquiring the
weapons, they have come to appreciate several drawbacks of doing so:
nuclear weapons are dangerous, costly, and likely to rile the neighbors.
Moreover, as the University of Southern California's Jacques Hymans has
demonstrated, the weapons have also been exceedingly difficult for
administratively dysfunctional countries to obtain---it took decades for
North Korea and Pakistan to do so. In consequence, [**alarmist
predictions** about **proliferation chains**, **cascades**,
**[dominoes]{.mark}**, **waves**, **avalanches**, **epidemics**, and
**points of no return**]{.underline} have [[proved
**faulty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Although [proliferation has so far had **little
consequence**]{.underline}, that is not because the only countries to
get nuclear weapons have had rational leaders. [**Large, important
[countries]{.mark}** [that acquired the bomb were
run]{.mark}]{.underline} at the time [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
unchallenged---perhaps certifiably
**[[deranged]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[**monsters**. Consider]{.mark}
Joseph [Stalin]{.mark}]{.underline}, who, in 1949, was planning to
change the climate of the Soviet Union by planting a lot of trees,
[[and]{.mark} Mao [Zedong]{.mark}]{.underline}, who, in 1964, had just
carried out a bizarre social experiment that resulted in an artificial
famine in which tens of millions of Chinese perished.

Some also fear that a country might use its nuclear weapons to
"dominate" its area. That argument was used with dramatic urgency before
2003 when Saddam Hussein supposedly posed great danger, and it has been
frequently applied to Iran. Exactly how that domination is to be carried
out is never made clear. The notion, apparently, is this: should an
atomic rogue state rattle the occasional rocket, other countries in the
area, suitably intimidated, would bow to its demands. Far more likely,
threatened states would make common cause with each other and with other
concerned countries (including nuclear ones) against the threatening
neighbor. That is how countries coalesced into an alliance of
convenience to oppose Iraq's region-threatening invasion of Kuwait in
1990.

Yet [**another concern** has been]{.underline} that the [weapons will
**go off**, by [**accident** or **miscalculation**]{.mark}]{.underline},
devastating the planet in the process: the weapons exist in the
thousands, sooner or later one or more of them will inevitably go off.
But [those [prognostications]{.mark} **have now [failed to
deliver]{.mark}** [for 70 years]{.mark}. **That [time period]{.mark}**
[suggests]{.mark} **something [more than luck]{.mark}** is
**operating**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the [notion]{.mark} that [if
**one nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon** [goes off]{.mark} in one place, the

Umbrella,\"

"Europe needs to build up the nuclear dimension of its defense efforts,
including by retaining and modernizing capabilities for existing NATO
nuclear missions and by France and Britain working together to extend
their nuclear deterrents to their European allies."

Why is this statement so intriguing? Because it shows the authors of
this report recognize that [Europe]{.underline} as a whole [might be
**more secure** if it could rely on a **locally based
deterrent**]{.underline} instead of continuing to shelter under the U.S.
nuclear umbrella. And [if that is true for the nations of
**Europe**]{.underline}, then [it might well be true for
**others**]{.underline}. Although the report's authors are opposed to
new states joining the nuclear club (Britain and France are already
members), their statement clearly implies that [deterrence would be
**strengthened** if states facing **serious external threats** had a
**nuclear guarantee**]{.underline} [that didn't depend on Uncle
Sam]{.underline}.

This is hardly a new issue. Since fairly early in the nuclear age, the
United States has used nuclear weapons to "extend deterrence" and shield
some of its allies. It sought to convince potential adversaries that the
United States might use its formidable nuclear arsenal if these allies
were attacked, even if the United States was not. Of course, there was
always some chance that [a war involving one of the United States'
allies might **escalate**]{.underline} to the nuclear level, either by
accident, [through **inadvertence**, or via **deliberate
decision**]{.underline}, no matter what U.S. leaders said in advance.
Even so, Washington went to considerable lengths to make its nuclear
umbrella credible, partly to discourage enemies from attacking but also
to convince its allies not to get nuclear weapons themselves.

Accordingly, U.S. leaders made lots of public statements linking the
U.S. arsenal to its core alliance commitments, and NATO drew up various
plans and doctrinal pronouncements designed to reinforce perceptions of
a reliable U.S. guarantee. The United States also deployed thousands of
warheads on some of its allies' territory, along with dual-key
arrangements that gave those allies some say in how, when, or if these
fearsome weapons got used. Lastly, and very importantly, the United
States kept trying to achieve a meaningful degree of nuclear superiority
to make a possible first use of nuclear weapons to defend allies more
credible. Instead of acquiring a "minimum deterrent" (i.e., retaliatory
forces that could survive any possible attack and then inflict
unacceptable damage on an aggressor), U.S. war plans and weapons
decisions always focused on trying to come out on top in the awful event
of an actual nuclear war.

Why did the United States do this? In good part because [convincing
people you might use nuclear weapons to defend an ally **isn't
easy**]{.underline}. One might imagine a U.S. president using nuclear
weapons to retaliate against a direct attack on U.S. territory or to
deter the extremely unlikely prospect of a conventional invasion that
threatened U.S. independence. This is the one thing nuclear weapons are
good for: deterring existential threats to their possessors'
independence or autonomy. This form of deterrence (sometimes termed
"basic" or "Type I") works because the deterring side will almost
certainly care more about preserving its own independence than a
potential attacker is likely to care about trying to take it away.
Because the balance of resolve favors the defender, even much weaker
nuclear powers can deter enemies from attacking them directly. If you
don't find this argument persuasive, remember the U.S. attacked
non-nuclear Iraq in 2003 and non-nuclear Libya in 2011, but it leaves
nuclear-armed North Korea alone.

By contrast, deterring a conventional or a nuclear attack on an ally by
threatening to go nuclear---and convincing your allies that you really
mean it---is more challenging. [It is one thing to **threaten to use
nuclear weapons** to keep one's own country from being subjugated but
quite another to do so to **save an ally**]{.underline} from defeat or
domination. Or, as people used to wonder back in the Cold War, [would a
U.S. president really risk Washington or Chicago to save Paris or
Berlin?]{.underline} Long after they had left office, a few former U.S.
officials suggested the answer was almost certainly "[**no**." Extended
deterrence]{.underline} could still work because potential attackers
can't be sure about any of this, but it still [**isn't as credible** as
deterring attacks on one's own territory.]{.underline}

The solution to this conundrum---if one can call it that---is to achieve
overwhelming "nuclear superiority." If you could wipe out an adversary's
entire nuclear force in a first strike, you wouldn't have to fear its
retaliation, and using nuclear weapons to defend an ally would be much
more credible. Even if a splendid first strike were not possible,
perhaps you could convince a potential attacker that it will end up even
worse off than you are at the end of a nuclear war to convince it not to
put so much as a toe on the first rung of the escalation ladder.

Thus, the perceived need to extend deterrence is one of the reasons why
the United States has long sought nuclear superiority. It's not the only
reason: A genuine first strike capability could limit damage in the
event of an actual war. A few commentators have also tried to
argue---not very convincingly---that superiority would enable the
stronger side to coerce weaker states in crises. Chasing the holy grail
of a first-strike advantage was also popular with defense contractors
and parts of the armed services because it requires spending billions of
dollars annually on more and more accurate weapons, more efficient and
destructive warheads, improved surveillance and anti-submarine warfare
capabilities, and lots of other shiny objects.

Interestingly, a number of sophisticated [scholars]{.underline} have
recently [claimed]{.underline} that [technological advances have put the
United States on the brink of a true first-strike
capability.]{.underline} Perhaps [in **theory**, but certainly not as a
**usable option**]{.underline}. To see why, ask yourself what you would
do [if you were president and facing a serious crisis]{.underline} with
a nuclear-armed adversary. [You've put the armed services on
alert]{.underline}, and there is some danger that force might be used
and fighting could escalate. [Suppose your]{.underline} military
[advisors and intelligence experts tell you if you order a first strike
now, you can almost certainly destroy the enemy's entire nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}, leaving the United States unscathed and in an
ideal position to resolve the dispute on favorable terms.

Being a sensible person, you'd undoubtedly ask them: "[Can you
**guarantee that**?]{.underline} Are you absolutely, 100 percent sure
the enemy will have zero usable weapons left, and therefore, we won't
even get our hair mussed?"

"We are highly confident of success," you are told. "But there is a slim
chance that a few enemy weapons would survive and reach U.S. soil. No
more than one to three."

[Even if you weren't troubled by the **moral issues**]{.underline}
involved in ordering an attack [that would kill **untold numbers of
people**]{.underline} (and you ought to be), would you do it? Of course
[you **wouldn't**]{.underline}, because [you wouldn't want to risk
losing New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, or any other major U.S.
city, which is what might happen if that first strike you authorized
turned out to be just a **tiny bit less effective than your advisors
predicted**]{.underline}. To issue a launch order, [you'd have to
believe the proposed attack would work perfectly the **very first time
it was executed**]{.underline} ([**simulations** and **exercises**
aren't the same]{.underline}), almost [all of the missiles and bombs
that have been sitting in silos or storage facilities for years **would
work as designed**]{.underline}, and [the other side wouldn't have
**dispersed its own forces**]{.underline} or hidden some extra weapons
in places you had failed to detect. Based on everything the United
States' knows about complex military operations and the limits of
intelligence, [you'd be a **fool to roll the dice in this
way**]{.underline}.

One more thing: [As first-strike capabilities improve, adversaries may
respond by keeping forces on **higher alert**]{.underline} [or adopting
**"launch-on-warning" procedures** that increase the risk of
**accidental** or **inadvertent war**]{.underline}. No matter what U.S.
forces are capable of in theory, in short, [it's hard to see how any
president **would be willing to use nukes first**]{.underline} even if
the probability of "success" was extremely high. [This reality casts
further doubt on the whole idea of extended deterrence]{.underline},
insofar as [it is based on the threat to **deliberately escalate to the
nuclear level**]{.underline} if a key ally is in danger of being
conquered.

Extending a protective umbrella over allies in Europe and Asia may have
made good sense during the Cold War, both to protect them and to
discourage proliferation. But [the]{.underline} nuclear [weapons
environment has **changed**: The number of nuclear-armed states has
crept **upward**]{.underline}, and [several countries]{.underline}
(India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom) [are increasing the size of
their **own arsenals**]{.underline} (though they remain far lower than
U.S. or Russian levels). Moreover, [the United States is not as tightly
coupled to some of its traditional allies as it was during the Cold War,
and serious rifts may **continue to grow**]{.underline} despite the
Biden administration's efforts to restore alliance solidarity and
reassert U.S. leadership.

Which raises the obvious question: Does it still make sense to shield
allies under the U.S. nuclear umbrella? [Using the threat of nuclear use
to protect other countries is **not cost- or risk-free**]{.underline},
and [it may **even be more dangerous** than letting some other states
**acquire arsenals of their own**]{.underline} and [encouraging them to
rely on "Type I" deterrence]{.underline} provided by their own national
capabilities.

This view has been advanced before---most notably by Kenneth Waltz in a
controversial Adelphi Paper 40 years ago. Waltz was not advocating
giving other states the bomb or arguing that the rapid spread of nuclear
weapons would be desirable; his central point was that trying to prevent
the slow spread of these weapons was not without costs of its own and
that in some cases, as he put it, "[**more** may be
**better**]{.underline}." The question is: Is that becoming the case
today?

To be sure, folding the nuclear umbrella might well have some negative
effects. It might make states long accustomed to U.S. protection
question its commitment (though there's no logical reason for them to do
so if it is still in the United States' interest to aid their defense in
other ways). It could also reduce U.S. influence or leverage if certain
allies were no longer as dependent on U.S. protection, though folding
the umbrella would not eliminate their reliance on other elements of
U.S. power. Removing the U.S. nuclear guarantee might encourage a few
states to pursue nuclear arms of their own, but [it is not obvious that
acquisition by **Japan** or **Germany** would be a terrible outcome from
a purely U.S. perspective]{.underline}.

Moreover, [even the possibility that these states might take over
responsibility for deterring attacks on their own territory could have a
**sobering effect**]{.underline} [on a **rising China** and a
**recalcitrant Russia**]{.underline}. In particular, it would remind
Beijing and Moscow that [their own behavior will affect the **strategic
calculations**]{.underline} that their neighbors make in the near
future, [including decisions about **nuclear arms**. If China doesn't
want to face **more nuclear weapons states**]{.underline} in its
immediate region, for instance, then [its leaders should **start asking
themselves what they can do**]{.underline} to make those neighbors feel
less need for additional protection. The obvious answer: [**Stop
harassing them** in various ways, drop the sharp-elbowed approach to
diplomacy, stick to agreements previously reached, and do more to
resolve existing disputes on a fair-minded basis.]{.underline}

Whatever Washington ultimately chooses to do with its nuclear umbrella,
the more important task is to move beyond the tendency to see nuclear
weapons as potent signs of status, indispensable tools of statecraft, or
powerful sources of leverage. Nuclear weapons are extremely useful for
deterring direct and all-out attacks on one's own homeland but not much
else. For that purpose, [a great power doesn't need an **enormous
arsenal**]{.underline} or some hypothetical capability to "fight and
win" a nuclear exchange. [All it needs is a stockpile that can **survive
an enemy attack**]{.underline} and be able to respond in kind. Properly
concealed or protected, they don't need to be poised and ready to strike
at a moment's notice. [Fetishizing the bomb]{.underline} and [using it
to try to protect others isn't just expensive; it may also be
**dangerous**.]{.underline}

[After decades of researching]{.underline} the impact that
[humans]{.underline} are having [on]{.underline} animal and plant
[species around the world]{.underline}, Chris Thomas has a simple
message: Cheer up. Yes, we've wiped out woolly mammoths and ground
sloths, and are finishing off black rhinos and Siberian tigers, but [the
doom is not all gloom]{.underline}. **[Myriad
[species]{.mark}]{.underline}**, thanks in large part to humans who
inadvertently transport them around the world, [[have
**blossomed**]{.mark} **in new regions,**]{.underline} [mated with like
species]{.underline} and formed new hybrids that have themselves gone
forth and prospered. We're talking [mammals, birds]{.underline}, [trees,
insects, microbes]{.underline}---all your flora and fauna. "[Virtually
[all]{.mark} countries]{.underline} and islands in the world [have
[**experienced substantial increases** in]{.mark} the **[numbers]{.mark}
of species**]{.underline} [that can be found in and on
them]{.underline}," writes Thomas in his new book, Inheritors of the
Earth: How Nature Is Thriving in an Age of Extinction.

Thomas is a professor of conservation biology at the University of York
in England. He is not easily pigeonholed. He has been a go-to scientist
for the media and lawmakers on how climate change is scorching the life
out of animals and plants. At the same time he can turn around and
write, "[Wild geese, swans, storks, herons and cranes are
returning]{.underline} as well, [and the great whales]{.underline}, the
largest animals ever to have lived on Earth, [are once more plying their
way across our seaways]{.underline} in numbers after centuries of
unsustainable butchery." Glass half empty, meet Chris Thomas.

Inheritors of the Earth collects years of Thomas' field research,
illuminating plant and animal species---notably one of his specialties,
butterflies---flourishing all over the Earth. Thomas also puts big ideas
on display. Humans are just another animal on the planet, he wants us to
know. Our actions are not outside the engine of evolution, even though
we have the most horsepower. Environmentalists need to stop fencing off
nature from humans, he argues, understand the mechanics of evolution
better, including our role in it, and quit being such nattering nabobs
of negativity. Once they do all those things, real conservation has a
chance. The Sixth Great Extinction, he tells us, is premature.

There may be a bit too much of Dr. Pangloss in Inheritors of the Earth,
and despite its ample footnotes, I would have liked to have learned more
about how Thomas quantifies some of his general assertions about
increases in species. I did ask Thomas to cite the research he has drawn
from to support his views, and he responded with the names of five
scientists who have influenced him. You can read his answer in a
footnote at the end of the interview.1 (I didn't include it because it
seemed kind of wonky.) In any event, Thomas was a pleasure to talk to.
What is it about a wry Englishman that so enchants an American
interviewer? Thomas and I had a jolly conversation, even if it got
contentious at times, as I reminded him of the environmental wreckage
that hung like a dark cloud over his thesis.

You write, "It is entirely possible that the long-term consequence of
the evolution of Homo sapiens will be to increase the number of species
on the Earth's land surface." That sure goes against the grain of what
we have been hearing for generations.

Yes, it does.

What first caused you to you come to that conclusion?

I knew there was a new hybrid plant living in my hometown of York,
England, and nowhere else in the world, and I had also heard about a new
kind of fly evolving on introduced apple trees in North America. I
started to reflect on the fact that so many of our crop plants started
out as hybrids between different species. So I privately asked myself:
How many new species might come into existence because of humans? All I
needed was a pencil and the back of an envelope for my first
calculation. I was gobsmacked, and eventually pleased with my
preliminary answer. [I reckoned that [we]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[might]{.underline},]{.mark} very roughly, **[[double the]{.mark}
number of [species]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[on Earth]{.mark} over the
**next million years**]{.underline}. Brought up on stories of extinction
and environmental doom, it took me several years to believe my own
answer.

Give us a convincing example of how humans boost the number of species.

The Italian sparrow is a really good example of a rapid evolution of a
new species. It began when the house sparrow colonized out of Asia,
following the development of agriculture. In the Mediterranean Basin, it
met the Spanish sparrow. At some point, probably about 6,000 years ago,
the house sparrow and the Spanish sparrow hybridized, and their
offspring became sufficiently genetically distinct. Although they can
interbreed with both of their parents, they basically don't. So a [new
[species **came into existence** by]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[hybridization]{.underline}**]{.mark}. I really like this example
because the Italian sparrow has probably already survived for several
thousand years. [**[It's not]{.mark}** one of [these **species**]{.mark}
that come into existence and **[suddenly
disappear]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Most of the new hybrids exist because we humans have either deliberately
or accidentally brought the parents---which used to live in different
parts of the world---into contact with one another. This is an
extraordinary feature of the modern world. There has been no time in the
history of life when species have been mixed up within and between
continents at the rate that's going on at the moment. The consequence of
this human-caused transport is that hybrids must be coming into
existence faster than ever before.

Is there a mammal that fits your scenario? Mammals have not fared well
with humans.

You are quite right. The heavyweight, large body-sized mammals are where
we have most systematically exterminated other species over the last
60,000 years. There's no doubt about that whatsoever. But hybridization
is taking place in mammals too, when they've been introduced to new
locations. In Britain, the native red deer has been mating with the sika
deer. There's some hybridization among the wapiti, or elk, and red deer.
Presumably, these new populations will start to diverge with a new
mixture of genes that they didn't have previously.

In 1997, the biologist E.O. Wilson wrote, "Extinction is now proceeding
thousands of times faster than the production of new species." Is that
just wrong?

At the time he wrote that, [[nobody]{.mark} had [made **any
estimate**]{.mark} whatsoever [of the current]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[speciation rate]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[It was based on **a
presumption** that the **present-day**]{.mark} **speciation rate** [is
the same]{.mark} that it appears to have been [in the
**long-term**]{.mark} **historical [past]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For
animals]{.underline}, particularly vertebrates, [it's]{.underline}
pretty [clear that]{.underline} over the last few thousand years, the
[extinction rate has]{.underline} indeed [been a lot higher]{.underline}
than the speciation rate. However, [[it's **not**]{.mark} **so [obvious
for plants]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If you take the mainland North
America north of Mexican border, for which there's good data, and
mainland Europe, we know of more hybrid plant species in both of these
regions that have come into existence over the last 300 years than we
know of plant species that have become completely extinct.

I'm not disputing that what Wilson and others are talking about is real.
What I'm saying is that, simultaneously, [**[large]{.mark} numbers of
[biological gains]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} also [going
on]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [that they are at least as
worthy of scientific study]{.underline} as the losses. As environmental
managers and conservationists, we should start incorporating these gains
into our thinking of how we manage the planet, rather than taking a
stance of simply trying to fight the losses.

How do we benefit by taking those gains into account?

It depends on what sort of gain you are talking about. A number of
scientists have suggested the benefits of ecosystems to humans may
increase with the number of species in an ecosystem. Most ecologists
accept that [various [plants can]{.mark} **[stabilize]{.mark} the
[soil]{.mark}, purify [water]{.mark}, or fix [carbon]{.mark}** from the
atmosphere]{.underline}, and so on. If so, then why should these
services not also be provided by so-called non-native species? There's
no clear evidence that the old ones are better than new arrivals at
doing these ecological jobs. The fact that [new species are becoming
established in our new]{.underline}, [disturbed environmental
conditions]{.underline}, [suggests that **[non-native]{.mark} species**
[could]{.mark} **actually [be better at these
jobs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If you were to say]{.underline}, "My
standpoint is that [[ecosystems]{.mark} are [degraded by the loss
of]{.mark} the **former [diversity]{.mark}**]{.underline}," then you
might think that the ecosystem service has declined. But
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [argument [doesn't follow once you
take]{.mark} into account [the]{.mark}]{.underline} balance in
[[gains]{.underline}]{.mark}.

But [environmentalists are so good at **[emphasizing worst-case
scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that when]{.underline} [we look to the
future]{.underline}, [[apocalypse]{.mark} often [feels
inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, aren't we in the "sixth mass
extinction"? Haven't populations of wild animals already crashed by 60
percent? Don't we have just "10 years left" to avert climate meltdown?
Do we really dare to hope?

Yes, we do dare to hope. Looking at these problems from a distance, they
seem like impenetrable, mountainous barriers to a good future, but in
every case, there is a path through.

"Saving the planet" can mean many things in practice, but one goal
pretty much everyone shares is stopping extinctions. Elizabeth Kolbert's
2014 Pulitzer Prize--winning book, The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural
History, reported on scientists sounding the alarm about high extinction
rates, and in the years that followed, the idea that we are in the midst
of one of the planet's greatest mass-extinction events has come to feel
like a bedrock truth to many greenies. This framing can make extinction
feel like a force too huge and powerful to avert.

That's just not true. [As of today]{.underline}, according to the
International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, [the
conservation status of 128,918 species has been assessed]{.underline}.
Of those, [902 have gone extinct]{.underline} since the year 1500. This
is absolutely too many. One is too many. But [[to cause]{.mark} an
**[extinction]{.mark} event**]{.underline} on the scale of those [seen
millions of years ago]{.underline}, [in which]{.underline} [more than 75
percent]{.underline} of species [disappeared]{.underline}, **[[we would
have to lose all]{.mark} our threatened [species within a
century]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and then]{.mark} keep losing
species]{.underline} at that same super-high rate [[for]{.mark} between
240 and **[540 more years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
concept]{.underline} [assumes that we won't save anything]{.underline},
ever, and [[that]{.mark} hundreds of [years into]{.mark} [the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[we]{.underline}
[will]{.underline}]{.mark} [still [be **as inept a**]{.mark}**t
protecting [biodiversity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as we are
now]{.underline}.

You might have also heard that we've lost something like 60 percent of
wild animals since the 1970s? Surely this suggests that a lot more
extinctions are imminent? In 2018, The Atlantic's Ed Yong helpfully
explained that this [study actually looked at the average]{.underline}
[decline of a given population]{.underline} (not species) of wild
animal. [So **[severe]{.mark} [declines]{.mark} in small populations**
[disproportionately increase]{.mark} the **[average
decline]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

More recently, a new analysis of the data showed that, indeed, the 60
percent average decline was driven by very severe crashes in a very
small number of vertebrate populations. For example, one small
population of Australian waterfall frogs declined 99.5 percent over two
years. This decline became one data point, which was averaged with
14,000 others, many from stable or increasing populations.

Really, [**[less than 3 percent]{.mark}** of vertebrate populations [are
crashing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Remove the most strongly
declining]{.underline} populations, [and the average would actually be
growing slightly]{.underline}. This means that declines are not the rule
everywhere. It means that the specific populations in crisis can be
identified and helped. And we have the knowledge to save them, if we can
marshal the will and resources.

This targeted approach works for environmental policy too. The Trump
administration pushed for more than 100 rollbacks of pollution
standards, land protections, and other green policies, with the glee of
a team of comic-book villains. Jill Tauber, the vice president of
litigation for climate and energy at Earthjustice, told me that her
[organization has more than 100 lawsuits pending]{.underline} against
the Trump administration and that so far, [once cases pass any
procedural hurdles]{.underline}, [her side is winning more than 80
percent of them]{.underline}. [Tackled one-by-one]{.underline}, [many of
his policies can be undone and their damage limited.]{.underline}

Addressing climate change is obviously a cornerstone of environmental
protection. Some change has already happened and more is locked in, but
as the cost of key technologies such as solar panels and batteries has
fallen, the price tag [[to move]{.mark} the country [to **net-zero
emissions**]{.mark} by 2050]{.underline}---as President Joe Biden has
pledged---has also dropped. [[The U.S. could spend]{.mark} about [what
it **already spends**]{.mark} on energy]{.underline}---[a mere 4 to 6
percent]{.underline} of gross domestic product---[and **still reach this
goal**, according]{.underline} to a new report out of Princeton
University.

robust justification**]{.underline} [for why this boundary should not be
40%, or 70%, or some other level.]{.underline}

While the stated objective of [[the PB framework]{.underline}]{.mark} is
to "guide human societies" away from a state of the Earth system that is
"less hospitable to the development of human societies", it [**[offers
little scientific evidence]{.mark}** [to support the connection between
the]{.mark} [global state of]{.mark} specific Earth [system processes
and human well-being]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Instead, [the Holocene
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} (the most recent 10,000 years)
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[assumed to be
ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**[Yet]{.mark}** most species evolved
before the Holocene and [the]{.mark} contemporary [ecosystems that
sustain humanity are]{.mark} **[agroecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[urban ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and
other]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[human-altered
ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that in themselves represent some of
the most important global and local environmental changes that
characterize the Anthropocene]{.underline}. [Contrary to the authors'
claim that the Holocene is the "only state of the planet that we know
for certain can support contemporary human societies,"]{.underline}
[[the]{.mark} **[human-altered ecosystems]{.mark}** of the Anthropocene
[represent the only state of the planet that we know]{.mark} for certain
[can support contemporary civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Human alteration of environments produces multiple effects, some
advantageous to societies, such as enhanced food production, and some
detrimental, like environmental pollution with toxic chemicals, excess
nutrients and carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and the loss of
wildlife and their habitats. The key to better environmental outcomes is
not in ending human alteration of environments but in anticipating and
mitigating their negative consequences. These decisions and trade-offs
should be guided by robust evidence, with global-change science
investigating the connections and tradeoffs between the state of the
environment and human well-being in the context of the local setting,
rather than by framing and reframing environmental challenges in terms
of untestable assumptions about the virtues of past environments.

[Even without specifying exact global boundaries, global metrics can be
**highly misleading for policy**]{.underline}. [For example, with
nitrogen, where the majority of human emissions come from synthetic
fertilizers, the real-world challenge is to apply just the right amount
of nitrogen to optimize crop yields while minimizing nitrogen losses
that harm aquatic ecosystems]{.underline}. [Reducing fertilizer
application in Africa might seem beneficial globally, yet the result in
this region would be even poorer crop yields without any notable
reduction in nitrogen pollution; Africa's fertilizer use is already
suboptimal for crop yields. [What can look like a good or a bad thing
globally can]{.mark} **[prove exactly the opposite]{.mark}** [when
viewed regionally and locally]{.mark}]{.underline}. What use is a global
indicator for a local issue? As in real estate, location is everything.

[Just over [250 million years ago, the planet
suffered]{.mark}]{.underline} what may be described as its greatest
holocaust: ninety-six percent of marine genera (plural of genus) and
seventy percent of land vertebrate vanished for good. Even insects
suffered a mass [[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}\-\--the only time
before or since. Entire classes of animals\-\--like trilobites\-\--went
out like a match in the wind.

But [what's arguably most fascinating about this event\-\--known as the
Permian-Triassic extinction]{.underline} or more poetically, the Great
Dying\-\--[is the fact that anything survived at all.
[Life]{.mark}]{.underline}, it seems, [**[is so ridiculously
adaptable]{.mark}** that not only did [thousands of species]{.mark} make
it through whatever killed off nearly everything]{.underline} (no one
knows for certain though theories abound) [but, somehow, after millions
of years life even recovered and [went on to write new
tales]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Even as [[the]{.mark} Permian-Triassic [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}
event shows the fragility of life, it also [[proves its
**resilience**]{.mark} in the long-term]{.underline}. [The lessons of
such mass extinctions\-\--five to date and arguably a sixth happening as
I write\-\--inform science today]{.underline}. [Given that extinction
levels are currently 1,000]{.underline} (some even say 10,000[) times
the background rate, researchers have long worried about our current
destruction of biodiversity\-\--and what that may mean for our future
Earth and ourselves]{.underline}.

In 2009, a group of researchers identified nine global boundaries for
the planet that if passed could theoretically push the Earth into an
uninhabitable state for our species. These global boundaries include
climate change, freshwater use, ocean acidification and, yes,
biodiversity loss (among others). The group has since updated the
terminology surrounding biodiversity, now calling it "biosphere
integrity," but that hasn't spared it from critique.

A paper last year in Trends in Ecology & Evolution scathingly attacked
the idea of any global biodiversity boundary.

"[[It makes **no sense** that there exists a tipping point of
biod]{.mark}iversity [loss beyond which the Earth will
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[said]{.mark} co-author and ecologist,
José [Montoya]{.mark}, with Paul Sabatier Univeristy in France. "[There
is **no rationale**]{.mark} for this."]{.underline}

Montoya wrote the paper along with Ian Donohue, an ecologist at Trinity
College in Ireland and Stuart Pimm, one of the world's leading experts
on extinctions, with Duke University in the US.

Montoya, Donohue and Pimm argue that [[there isn't evidence of a point
at which loss of species leads to ecosystem collapse, **globally** or
even **locally**. If the planet didn't collapse after]{.mark} the
[Permian-Triassic]{.mark} extinction event, **[it won't collapse
now]{.mark}**]{.underline}\-\--though our descendants may well curse us
for the damage we've done.

Instead, according to the researchers, every loss of species counts. But
[the damage is gradual and incremental, not a sudden
plunge.]{.underline} [[Ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
them, [slowly degrade but **[never fail outright.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"[[Of]{.mark} more than [600 experiments]{.mark} of biodiversity effects
on various functions, **[none showed a collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
Montoya said. "In general, the loss of species has a detrimental effect
on ecosystem functions\...We progressively lose pollination services,
water quality, plant biomass, and many other important functions as we
lose species. But [we never observe a critical level of biodiversity
over which functions collapse."]{.underline}

2\. [As conservation became a global enterprise in the 1970s and 1980s,
the movement\'s justification for saving nature shifted from spiritual
and aesthetic values to focus on biodiversity]{.underline}. [Nature was
described as primeval, fragile, and at risk of collapse from too much
human use and abuse]{.underline}. And indeed, [there are
consequences]{.underline} [when]{.underline} [humans convert landscapes
for mining, logging, intensive agriculture, and urban development and
when key species or ecosystems are lost.]{.underline}¶ But
[[ecologists]{.mark} and conservationists have [**grossly overstated**
the fragility of nature]{.mark},]{.underline} frequently arguing that
once an ecosystem is altered, it is gone forever. [Some ecologists
suggest that if a single species is lost, a whole ecosystem will be in
danger of collapse, and that if too much biodiversity is lost, spaceship
Earth will start to come apart. Everything, from the expansion of
agriculture to rainforest destruction to changing waterways, has been
painted as a threat to the delicate inner-workings of our planetary
ecosystem.¶]{.underline} [The fragility trope dates back]{.underline},
at least, [to]{.underline} Rachel [Carson]{.underline}, [who wrote
plaintively in Silent Spring of the delicate web of life and warned that
perturbing the intricate balance of nature could have disastrous
consequences]{.underline}.22 Al Gore made a similar argument in his 1992
book, Earth in the Balance.23 And the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment warned darkly that, while the expansion of agriculture and
other forms of development have been overwhelmingly positive for the
world\'s poor, ecosystem degradation was simultaneously putting systems
in jeopardy of collapse.24¶ The trouble for conservation is that [the
[data]{.mark} simply [do not support]{.mark} the idea of a [fragile
nature]{.mark} at risk of collapse]{.underline}. Ecologists now know
that [[the disappearance of one]{.mark} species [does not]{.mark}
necessarily [lead to the extinction of]{.mark} any others, much less
[all others]{.mark} in the same ecosystem]{.underline}. In many
circumstances, [[the demise of]{.mark} formerly abundant [species can be
**inconsequential**]{.mark} to ecosystem function. [The]{.mark} American
[chestnut]{.mark}]{.underline}, [once a dominant tree in eastern North
America, [has been extinguished]{.mark} by a foreign disease, yet the
forest ecosystem is surprisingly unaffected. [The]{.mark} passenger
[pigeon]{.mark}]{.underline}, once so abundant that its flocks darkened
the sky, [went extinct, along with countless other species from
[the]{.mark} Steller\'s [sea cow]{.mark} to [the

back over abandoned agricultural land had 40 to 70 percent of the
species of the original forests]{.underline}.27 Even Indonesian
orangutans, which were widely thought to be able to survive only in
pristine forests, have been found in surprising numbers in oil palm
plantations and degraded lands.28¶ [[Nature]{.mark} is so **resilient**
that it [can **recover rapidly** from]{.mark} even [the **most
powerful**]{.mark} human [disturbances. Around]{.mark} the

**Greater [species discovery]{.underline} rates.**

[[**Unhelpful inflation** of]{.mark} threatened
[species]{.mark}]{.underline}

The recent assessment of the state of the world's biodiversity by the
Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem
Services ([IPBES]{.underline}) [claimed that 1]{.underline} [million
species are threatened with extinction and that]{.underline} extinction
[rates are tens to]{.underline} [hundreds of times higher]{.underline}
than those in the past 10 million years based on the fossil record (1,
2). [Neither estimate is helpful to conservation]{.underline}, [and both
may be counterproductive.]{.underline}

[The claim that **[1 million]{.mark}** threatened [species]{.mark} are
[under threat was based on]{.mark} an **[outdated high
estimate]{.mark}**]{.underline} of how many species may exist. [[Old
estimates]{.underline}]{.mark} of species diversity [[need to be reduced
to recognize]{.underline}]{.mark} that continued [[**high rates** of
**species discovery**]{.underline}]{.mark} [are being]{.underline}
[maintained by increasing effort]{.underline}, that [the number of
apparent [species includes]{.mark} **[many
synonyms]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and that at least two-thirds of all
species are named (3--6). [[Comparisons]{.mark} between the present
situation and the]{.underline} (patchy and biased) [fossil]{.underline}
[record [are **flawed** because they differ in]{.mark}]{.underline}
causes of extinctions, species groups measured, and **[[time
scales]{.underline}]{.mark}** (3, 7).

Perhaps 1.8 million living species have been named if we consider that
at least one-fifth of presently accepted species names may be synonyms
(3--5, 8). Of the named species, the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has only assessed about 100,000 (5%) for
extinction risk (9). Of these, about 27,000 species are listed as
threatened with extinction (in addition to 872 species that are already
extinct) (9). This, likely an underestimate, is a global crisis that
needs to be addressed. Helpfully, we know which species are threatened.

[The IPBES report's compromised comparisons]{.underline} with the fossil
record and emphasis [on a highly speculative 1 million]{.underline}
(instead of the \~27,000 known threatened species at risk), [do not
contribute to conservation]{.underline} action. Instead, [they can be
detrimental to]{.underline} [conservation because they fuel
**distracting debates** and contribute to "**compassion
fade**,"]{.underline} a phenomenon in [which people **feel
overwhelmed**]{.underline} [and **less likely** to act]{.underline} as a
result (10). [Conservation requires the wider society to stay
engaged]{.underline} and continue to work toward solutions. [Rather than
focus on **exaggerated numbers**]{.underline}, [we should
emphasize]{.underline} [successes]{.underline} and [steps
forward]{.underline}. For example, partly because of conservation,
[**extinction** **rates** have **not been as high**]{.underline} as some
have feared (11, 12).

To help conservation action, we should assess the threats to all known
species. The freely available online databases now listing over 2
million species provide a foundation for this, including an expert
network (8).

**Global actors mean they can't solve biodiversity --- prefer the
[only]{.underline} comparative analysis.**

Index; (October 12, 2020; "Fifth of countries at risk of ecosystem
collapse, analysis finds"; *The Guardian*;

//LFS---SR)

[**[One-fifth of the world]{.mark}'s countries are [at risk of]{.mark}
their [ecosystems collapsing]{.mark}** because of the destruction of
wildlife]{.underline} and their habitats, according to an analysis by
the insurance firm Swiss Re.

Natural "services" such as [food]{.underline}, [clean water and
air]{.underline}, [and flood protection have already been
damaged]{.underline} by human activity.

More than half of global GDP\-\--\$42tn (£32tn)\-\--depends on
high-functioning biodiversity, according to [the
report](https://www.swissre.com/media/news-releases/nr-20200923-biodiversity-and-ecosystems-services.html),
but the risk of tipping points is growing.

Countries including **[[Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[**[Israel]{.mark}** and **[South Africa]{.mark}** rank near the
top]{.underline} of Swiss Re's index of risk to biodiversity and
ecosystem services, with [**[India]{.mark}**, **[Spain]{.mark}** and
**[Belgium]{.mark}** also highlighted.]{.underline} [Countries with
fragile ecosystems and large farming sectors]{.underline}, [such as
[**Pakistan** and **Nigeria**]{.mark}]{.underline}, are also
[[flagged]{.underline}]{.mark} up.

Countries including Brazil and Indonesia had large areas of intact
ecosystems but had a strong economic dependence on natural resources,
which showed the importance of protecting their wild places, Swiss Re
said.

"A staggering fifth of countries globally are at risk of their
ecosystems collapsing due to a decline in biodiversity and related
beneficial services," said Swiss Re, one of the world's biggest
reinsurers and a linchpin of the global insurance industry.

"If the ecosystem service decline goes on \[in countries at risk\], you
would see then scarcities unfolding even more strongly, up to tipping
points," said Oliver Schelske, lead author of the research.

Jeffrey Bohn, Swiss Re's chief research officer, said: "[[This is the
first index]{.underline}]{.mark} to our knowledge [[that pulls]{.mark}
together [indicators]{.mark} of biodiversity and ecosystems [to
**cross-compare around the world**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
then]{.underline} specifically [link back to]{.underline} the economies
of those [locations.]{.underline}"

The index was designed to help insurers assess ecosystem risks when
setting premiums for businesses but Bohn said it could have a wider use
as it "allows businesses and governments to factor biodiversity and
ecosystems into their economic decision-making".

The [[UN revealed]{.underline}]{.mark} in September that [the **world's
[governments failed to meet a single target ]{.mark}**[to stem]{.mark}
biodiversity [losses in the **last decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while

jeopardy](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/06/human-society-under-urgent-threat-loss-earth-natural-life-un-report) from
the accelerating decline of the Earth's natural life-support systems.
More than [60 national leaders recently
pledged](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/28/world-leaders-pledge-to-halt-earth-destruction-un-summit) to
end the destruction.

The Swiss Re index is built on 10 key ecosystem services identified by
the world's scientists and uses scientific data to map the state of
these services at a resolution of one square kilometre across the
world's land. The services include provision of clean water and air,
food, timber, pollination, fertile soil, erosion control, and coastal
protection, as well as a measure of habitat intactness.

Those countries with more than 30% of their area found to have fragile
ecosystems were deemed to be at risk of those ecosystems collapsing.
[Just **[one in seven]{.mark} countries [had intact ecosystems
covering]{.mark}** more than **[30%]{.mark}** of their country

radiation that may affect biological organisms.]{.underline} In the
twentieth century the temperatures has elevated by about 0.6 degrees
Celsius than past centuries. Research on the tree rings and ice cores,
established scientific data needed to demonstrate such trend of
increasing temperatures. [As a result of temperature change, some

such as effect of terrestrial plants (Tamarix spp. (Tamaricaceae), that
change water regime of riparian soils and also alter stream flows in
North America and Australia.59

[[Habitat degradation]{.mark} refers to an arrangement of reactive
factors that may [include **direct impacts** on **aquatic

The [[S]{.mark}ustainable [D]{.mark}evelopment
[G]{.mark}oal[s]{.mark}]{.underline} (SDGs) are often [[**failing**
to]{.mark} produce]{.underline} the profound [changes needed to
[achieve]{.mark}]{.underline} their ambitious [[objectives **due to a
lack of coordination**]{.underline}]{.mark} across the 17 separate
goals, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)
annual meeting heard.

"The reality is that if [[they are just seen as **aspirational**]{.mark}
goals what happens is]{.underline}\-\--what is actually happening
now\-\-- is that [[governments]{.mark} are just [label]{.mark}ling [what
they]{.mark} are [do]{.mark}ing [anyhow as being in the
obligation]{.mark} of the SGDs]{.underline}," Peter Gluckman from the
University of Auckland, New Zealand, told a panel discussion during the
event, held in Washington, DC from 14-17 February.

The [SDGs](https://www.scidev.net/global/governance/sdgs/) were adopted
by the United Nations in September 2015, and call
for [governments](https://www.scidev.net/global/governance/) to achieve
goals such as ending poverty, eradicating hunger and ensuring everyone
has access to clean,
affordable [energy](https://www.scidev.net/global/environment/energy/) by
2030.

However, [global [hunger has **risen for the third year in a
row**]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to the latest UN's [world food
security
report](http://www.fao.org/state-of-food-security-nutrition/en/), while
[fewer than five per cent of countries are on track to meet childhood
obesity and tuberculosis targets]{.underline}, according to [a
study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32336-X/fulltext) published
in The Lancet in 2017.

[**[Global [carbon
emissions](https://www.scidev.net/global/environment/pollution/)]{.mark}** were
also set to **rise by two per cent** in 2018 to **[hit an all-time
high]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to [a
report](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/-/strong-growth-in-global-co2-emissions-expected-for-2018) by
the UK's University of East Anglia and the Global Carbon Project. The
trend is driven by rises in the use of coal, oil and gas.

"Don't get me wrong, those \[the SDGs\] are critically important and we
are fully committed\-\--but let's be honest about lots of words and lots
of talk, but perhaps little action," Daan du Toit, deputy
director-general for international cooperation at the South African
Department of Science and Technology, said during a panel discussion.

Nakao Ishii, chief executive of the DC-based funding organisation Global
Environment Facility, said that in her native Japan, people would wear
SDG badges at policy meetings, but that did not always mean they
understood the changes that are required to implement the objectives.

"It's almost an order if you go to those meetings you have to wear the
SDG badge, but the question is to what extent they really do understand
the need of transformation, which is not the incremental approach
anymore," she said.

Trade-offs

One of the problems, according to the panel, is that [**[there
is]{.mark} often [a trade-off between]{.mark}** different
[**SDGs**,]{.mark}]{.underline} meaning that [[one goal is achieved to
the detriment of other goals.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[One example is]{.mark} that of [the Aral Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} on
the border between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, formerly the fourth
largest inland lake in the world. [The [rivers that feed the lake have
been diverted to irrigate]{.mark} desert farmland, causing it to shrink
by over 90 per cent]{.underline} since the 1960s.

["The [irrigation]{.mark} of the farmland [helped]{.mark} to achieve one
SDG]{.underline} goal, number two, [that aims to enhance [food
security]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Hongbo Yang, from the US-based
Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.

"[But that progress is achieved [as **a sacrifice
of**]{.mark}]{.underline} another goal which is SDG number 14, which
**[[aims to protect aquatic wildlife."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Modeling\-\--Inflation AC]{.underline}**

**Inflation's hitting them hard.**

\"Eurozone inflation rises to 8.6 percent, the highest ever, driven by
energy prices.\". New York Times.
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/01/business/eurozone-inflation-june.html.
Pen-DL

The situation in each eurozone member varies. Although inflation in
Germany and the Netherlands dipped slightly in June, Spain set a record,
hitting double digits for the first time since 1985. [For
the]{.underline} three **[Baltic States]{.underline}** in northeast
Europe --- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia --- [prices that
high]{.underline} [have]{.underline} **[been a reality]{.underline}**
for months.

Despite their differences, [all of these countries are]{.underline} in
some way [feeling the effects of the jump in the]{.underline} **[price
of energy]{.underline}**, [which rose]{.underline} to [41.9
percent]{.underline} over the year through June, three times the rate in
the same period a year earlier, [and]{.underline} **[prices for
food]{.underline}**, which were up to 8.9 percent over the past year,
also a significant acceleration.

Economists are predicting that higher prices could lead workers to
demand higher wages, which could solidify rapid inflation and put more
pressure on interest rates to rise. But the aftereffects of the
coronavirus pandemic, combined with the unpredictability of the war,
have made forecasts difficult.

Mateusz Urban, an economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a report that
June could be the peak of eurozone inflation, but that the pace of price
rises "will slow only gradually throughout 2022." But as Kerstin Bernoth
and Marcel Fratzscher of the German Institute for Economic Research
note, "[There is]{.underline} **[enormous]{.underline}**
[uncertainty]{.underline} how the economic situation and the inflation
in the eurozone will develop in the coming months."

The Baltics

[Estonia recorded an annual inflation rate of]{.underline} **[22
percent]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} **[highest]{.underline}** [in
the eurozone, followed by its neighbors]{.underline} on the Baltic Sea,
[Latvia]{.underline} (**[19 percent]{.underline}**) [and
Lithuania]{.underline} (**[20.5 percent]{.underline}**). [The three
countries lack any]{.underline} **[domestic]{.underline}** [energy
sources, and their efforts to replace Russian energy have]{.underline}
**[left them exposed]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline} **[exorbitant
prices]{.underline}** on the spot markets.

Environment," *NYT*, Factiva)

[There is much to like about small, local farms]{.underline} and their
influence on what we eat. [But if we are to sustainably deal with
problems presented by population growth and climate change, we need to
look to the]{.underline} [farmers who grow a majority of the country's
food and fiber]{.underline}. [[Large
farmers]{.underline}]{.mark}\-\--who are responsible for 80 percent of
the food sales in the United States, though they make up fewer than 8
percent of all farms, according to 2012 data from the Department of
Agriculture\-\--[[are among the most]{.mark} progressive,
[technologically savvy growers]{.mark} on the planet. Their [technology
has helped make them far gentler on the environment than at]{.mark}
**[any time in history]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[And a [new
wave of innovation makes them more sustainable
still]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A vast majority of the farms are
family-owned. Very few, about 3 percent, are run by nonfamily
corporations. Large farm owners (about 159,000) number fewer than the
residents of a medium-size city like Springfield, Mo. Their wares, from
milk, lettuce and beef to soy, are unlikely to be highlighted on the
menus of farm-to-table restaurants, but they fill the shelves at your
local grocery store. [There are legitimate fears about soil erosion,
manure lagoons, animal welfare and nitrogen runoff at large
farms]{.underline}\-\--[but it's not just environmental groups that
worry. Farmers are also concerned]{.underline} about fertilizer use and
soil runoff. Continue reading the main story [That's one reason they're
turning to **[high-tech solutions]{.mark}** [like precision
agriculture]{.mark}. Using location-specific information about soil
nutrients, moisture and productivity of the previous year, new
tools]{.underline}, known as "variable rate applicators," [can put
fertilizer only on those areas of the field that need it (which may
reduce nitrogen runoff]{.underline} into waterways). [GPS
signals]{.underline} drive many of today's tractors, and new planters
are allowing farmers to distribute seed varieties to diverse spots of a
field to produce more food from each unit of land. They also [modulate
the amount and type of seed on each part of a field\-\--in some places,
leaving none at all.]{.underline} Many food shoppers have difficulty
comprehending the scale and complexity facing modern farmers, especially
those who compete in a global marketplace. For example, the median
lettuce field is managed by a farmer who has 1,373 football fields of
that plant to oversee. For tomatoes, the figure is 620 football fields;
for wheat, 688 football fields; for corn, 453 football fields. How are
farmers able to manage growing crops on this daunting scale? Decades
ago, they dreamed about tools to make their jobs easier, more efficient
and better for the land: soil sensors to measure water content, drones,
satellite images, alternative management techniques like low- and
no-till farming, efficient irrigation and mechanical harvesters. Today,
that [technology is a regular part of operations at large
farms]{.underline}. Farmers watch the evolution of crop prices and track
thunderstorms on their smartphones. They use livestock waste to create
electricity using anaerobic digesters, which convert manure to methane.
Drones monitor crop yields, insect infestations and the location and
health of cattle. Innovators are moving high-value crops indoors to
better control water use and pests. [Before "factory farming" became a
pejorative]{.underline}, [ag]{.underline}ricultural
[scholars]{.underline} of the mid-20th century [were calling for farmers
to do just that\-\--become more factorylike and businesslike. From that
time, farm sizes have risen significantly. It is precisely this large
size that is often criticized today in the belief that large farms put
profit ahead of soil and animal health]{.underline}. [But increased size
has advantages, especially better opportunities to invest in new
technologies and to benefit from economies of scale]{.underline}. Buying
a \$400,000 combine that gives farmers detailed information on the
variations in crop yield in different parts of the field would never pay
on just five acres of land; at 5,000 acres, it is a different story.
[These [technologies reduce the use of water and fertilizer and harm to
the environment]{.mark}. Modern seed varieties]{.underline}, some of
which were [brought about by biotech]{.underline}nology, [have allowed
farmers to convert to low- and no-till cropping systems, and can
encourage the adoption of nitrogen-fixing cover crops]{.underline} such
as clover or alfalfa to promote soil health. [Herbicide-resistant crops
let farmers control weeds without plowing]{.underline}, and the same
technology allows growers to kill off cover crops if they interfere with
the planting of cash crops. The herbicide-resistant crops have some
downsides: They can lead to farmers' using more herbicide (though the
type of herbicide is important, and the new crops have often led to the
use of safer, less toxic ones). But in most cases, it's a trade-off
worth making, because [they enable no-till farming methods, which help
prevent soil erosion]{.underline}. [These [practices are one reason soil
erosion has declined more than 40 percent since the 1980s]{.mark}.
[Improvements in agricultural technologies and production practices have
significantly lowered the use of energy and water]{.mark},
and]{.underline} gr eenhouse-gas [emissions]{.underline} of food
production per unit of output over time. [United States crop production
now is twice what it was in 1970]{.underline}. That would not be a good
change if more land, water, pesticides and labor were being used. But
that is not what happened: [Agriculture is using nearly half the labor
and 16 percent less land than it did in 1970]{.underline}. Instead,
[farmers increased production through innovation]{.underline}. Wheat
breeders, for example, using traditional techniques assisted by the
latest genetic tools and information, have created varieties that resist
disease without numerous applications of insecticides and fungicides.
[Nearly all corn and soybean farmers practice crop rotation, giving soil
a chance to recover]{.underline}. Research is moving beyond simple
measures of nitrogen and phosphorus content to look at the microbes in
the soil. [[New industrywide initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline} are
focused on quantifying and measuring soil health. The goal is to provide
measurements of factors affecting the long-term value of the soil and to
identify which practices\-\--organic, conventional or
otherwise\-\--[[will ensure that farmers can responsibly produce]{.mark}
**[plenty of food for our grandchildren]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

**Megacities are sustainable -- stresses aren't coming soon.**

Dr. Toby **Ord 20**, Senior Research Fellow in Philosophy at Oxford
University, DPhil in Philosophy from the University of Oxford, The
Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity, Hachette Books,
Kindle Edition, p. 113-115

Climate change is not the only form of environmental damage we are
inflicting upon the Earth. [Might we face]{.underline} other
environmental [existential risks through
**[overpopulation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, running out of critical
resources or biodiversity loss?

When environmentalism rose to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, one
major concern was overpopulation. [It was widely feared that humanity's
rapidly growing population would]{.underline} far [outstrip the Earth's
capacity]{.underline} to feed people, [precipitating **a**]{.underline}n
environmental and humanitarian [catastrophe]{.underline}. The most
prominent advocate of this view, Paul [**Ehrlich**, painted an
apocalyptic vision]{.underline} of the near future: "Most of the people
who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in the history of man
have already been born."93 This catastrophe would come soon and pose a
direct existential risk. Ehrlich predicted: "Sometime in the next 15
years, the end will come---and by 'the end' I mean an utter breakdown of
the capacity of the planet to support humanity."94

[These confident [predictions]{.mark} of doom [were
**thoroughly**]{.mark} **[mistaken]{.mark}**. Instead of rising to
unprecedented heights, the [prevalence]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [famine
**dramatically declined**]{.mark}. **[Less than]{.mark} [a
quarter]{.mark}** as many people [died]{.mark} of famine [in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} 19[**[70s]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} 19[**[60s]{.mark}**, and the rate has **since
halved again**]{.underline}.95 [Instead of dwindling to a point of
crisis, [the amount of food]{.mark} per person [has **steadily
risen**]{.mark}]{.underline} over the last fifty years. We now have 24
percent more food per person than when Ehrlich's book, The Population
Bomb, was published in 1968.

[Much of the credit]{.underline} for this [is owed to the **Green
Revolution**]{.underline}, in which developing countries rose to the
challenge of feeding their people. They did so by
[modernizing]{.underline} their [farming, with improved fertilizers,
irrigation, automation and grain varieties]{.underline}.96 Perhaps the
greatest single contribution was from Norman Borlaug, who received the
Nobel Prize for his work breeding the new, high-yield varieties of
wheat, and who may be responsible for saving more lives than anyone else
in history.97

[But]{.underline} the [[improvements in
**ag**]{.underline}]{.mark}riculture [[are just part of the
story]{.mark}. The **entire picture** of overpopulation has **changed**.
[Population]{.mark} growth [is]{.mark}]{.underline} almost always
[presented as]{.underline} an **[[exponential]{.underline}]{.mark}**
process---increasing by a fixed percentage each year---[but in fact that
is **rare**]{.underline}ly the case. From about 1800 to 1960 the world
population was growing much faster than an exponential. The annual
growth rate was itself growing from 0.4 percent all the way to an
unprecedented rate of 2.2 percent in 1962. These trends rightly
warranted significant concern about the human and environmental
consequences of this rapid population increase.

But [suddenly, [the situation **changed**]{.mark}. The population
[growth]{.mark} rate [started to **rapidly decline**]{.mark}. So far it
has halved, and it continues to **fall**. Population is now increasing
in a roughly **linear** manner]{.underline}, with a fixed number of
people being added each year instead of a fixed proportion. This change
has been [[driven]{.underline}]{.mark} not by the feared increase in
death rates, but [[by a]{.mark} dramatic [change]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[**fertility**, as **more**]{.mark} **and more [countries]{.mark}**
**[have undergone]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} **demographic
[transition]{.mark}** [to a **small family size**]{.mark}. In 1950, the
average number of children born to each woman was 5.05. It is now just
2.47---**not so far above the replacement rate**]{.underline} of 2.1
children per woman.98

While we can't know what will happen in the future, [[the **current
trends**]{.mark} [point to a **rapid stabilization**]{.mark} [of the
population.]{.mark} The current **linear** increase is likely to be an
**inflection point** in the history of human population: the point where
the curve finally starts to **level off**. We may **never again** see
the **rapid population growth** of the mid-twentieth
century]{.underline}. In the last eighty years, population grew
threefold. In the next eighty years (to 2100) it is expected to go up
just 50 percent, to about 11 billion. For every person alive now, we'll
have to make room for an extra half a person. This will be a challenge,
but a much easier one than last century.

**[Hybrid War\-\--Deterrence D]{.underline}**

[[Arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} of this sort [have been a [staple of
**hard-line**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and [especially
**[neocon]{.mark}servative**]{.underline})
[[discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} [for decades]{.underline}. Like the
domino theory, which refuses to die no matter how often it is disproved,
such [claims transform]{.underline} the [outcome of a single conflict
into]{.underline} a [struggle for]{.underline} the [fate of the **entire
planet**]{.underline}. The choice we are said to face is stark. Down one
path: a revitalized liberal order led by a unified alliance of powerful,
peace-loving democracies, and a future where war is rare and prosperity
reigns. Down the other path: a world of rising autocracy, eroding human
rights, and more war. According to this view, Ukraine must win big, or
all is lost.

Framing the issue in this way [[stacks the deck in favor of **always
doing more**]{.mark} and rejecting any]{.underline} sort of
[compromise]{.underline}, but is the choice as stark as hard-liners make
out? [[Does defeating an aggressor]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[teach
others to **behave**]{.mark} **better**]{.underline}? It would be a more
benign world if this were the case, but a quick glance at the [past
[century]{.mark}]{.underline} or so [[suggests
**otherwise**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Start with World War I. Although all the major European powers played a
role in the outbreak of war, Germany was the driving force during the
July Crisis of 1914. Overly fearful of rising Russian power, German
leaders used the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria
and the confrontation between Austria-Hungary and Serbia as the occasion
for a preventive war for hegemony in Europe. The result was four
horrific years of war, a total German defeat at the hands of the Allies,
the end of the Hohenzollern monarchy and its Austro-Hungarian and
Ottoman allies, and the imposition of a highly punitive peace treaty.

The [**stark reality** of Germany's **[W]{.mark}**orld **[W]{.mark}**ar
**[I]{.mark}** defeat [didn't teach]{.mark}]{.underline} Adolf [[Hitler
not to make his]{.mark} own [bid for]{.mark} **European
[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline} 20 years later; indeed, the
[[myth]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Germany]{.mark} had been [stabbed in
the back]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [**harsh peace** imposed at
Versailles]{.underline} helped [[fuel]{.mark} the [rise of **Nazism**
and set the stage for]{.mark}]{.underline} another round of
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Nor]{.underline}]{.mark} did the carnage
of the First World War [teach **Imperial [Japan]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that [trying to carve out its]{.underline} own [empire in Asia was a
**bad idea**]{.underline}.

The chief aggressors were also soundly punished in World War II. Japan
was firebombed repeatedly, and two of its cities were destroyed by
atomic bombs; Germany was occupied and subsequently divided into two
separate states; and Hitler and Italian leader Benito Mussolini both
ended up dead. A clearer demonstration that "aggression does not pay"
would be hard to imagine, and a good case can be made that both Germany
and Japan learned that lesson well. But this [lesson [didn't stop
Kim]{.mark} Il Sung]{.underline} from [attacking South Korea [in
1950]{.mark}]{.underline} ([with]{.underline} Joseph
**[[Stalin's]{.mark} full support]{.underline}**) [or convince various
leaders]{.underline} elsewhere [in [Asia or the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline} that [going to [war was]{.mark} **always
[unwise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Similarly, one might have thought the French and American experiences in
[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark} would [offer a vivid and **enduring
reminder** of]{.underline} the [[dangers of **hubris**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[limits of]{.mark} military
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, not to mention the futility of trying to
nation-build in a deeply divided society without a competent local
partner. Yet the George W. Bush administration paid no heed to this
lesson when it invaded Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003.

Mind you, it's not just great powers that get taught harsh lessons after
launching an aggressive war. Back in 1982, Argentina's military junta
decided that the British Falkland Islands (which they call the Malvinas)
were theirs and decided to take the territory by force. Britain sank the
flagship of the Argentine navy and successfully retook the islands, and
popular protests in Argentina eventually swept the generals from power.

Iraq's Saddam Hussein eventually suffered a similar fate. His decision
to attack revolutionary Iran in 1980 led to nearly eight years of war in
which hundreds of thousands of Iraqis lost their lives and Iraq's
economy cratered. Two years later, he decided to solve the economic
problems the first war had created by seizing neighboring Kuwait, only
to be ignominiously expelled by a U.S.-led coalition and placed under
highly intrusive United Nations sanctions. Aggression didn't pay in
either case, but Saddam's failures didn't stop some other countries ---
including some prominent democracies --- from starting new wars
themselves.

[[If]{.mark} **painful [defeats]{.mark}** [really sent]{.mark} **clear
[warnings]{.mark}**]{.underline} to others, the [Soviet and American
experiences in [Afghanistan]{.mark} and]{.underline} the U.S. experience
in [[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} after 2003 [[would have taught
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} and his associates that [invading
[Ukraine]{.mark} was [likely to trigger]{.mark} a **[powerful]{.mark}
nationalist [reaction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and encourage outside
powers to do what they could to thwart his aims. Surely he knew that the
United States had helped defeat the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan by
supplying the mujahideen, just as Syria and Iran had each helped the
Iraqi insurgents defeat the U.S. effort in Iraq. The
[lesson]{.underline} of these two conflicts [[seems]{.mark} **all too
[obvious]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} seems
to have [[convinced himself it **didn't apply**]{.mark} to
Ukraine]{.underline}.

Not every aggressive war ends in defeat, of course, but there seems to
be no shortage of cases where aggressors were badly beaten and more than
a few where the people who started the war paid a large personal price
for their folly. Yet the lesson that "[[aggression does not
pay]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} typically
[[**ignored** or **forgotten**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Why?

One reason is that the lessons of any given war aren't always clear-cut,
and reasonable people can draw different conclusions from a defeat. Was
going to war a bad idea from the start, or was defeat due to poor
implementation or just bad luck? The lessons from a failed war will also
be discarded if [policymakers [believe that this time is
**different**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that [new
knowledge]{.underline}, [new technology]{.underline}, a [clever new
strategy]{.underline}, or a **[uniquely favorable]{.underline}** set of
[political circumstances]{.underline} will bring success this time
around. One should never underestimate what [elites]{.underline} can
[[talk themselves into]{.underline}]{.mark} if they really want to go to
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Leaders may be intimately familiar with their own national histories,
but they know and care less about what happened to other nations in
similar circumstances.

A second problem --- one highlighted in the work of the late scholar
Robert Jervis --- is that humans tend to place more weight on their own
experiences than on the experiences of others. Leaders in one country
may be intimately familiar with their own national history (though they
have probably absorbed a self-serving version of it), but they will know
and care less about what happened to other nations in similar
circumstances.

And it's [easy to dismiss]{.underline} another country's [failure by
claiming]{.underline} their [cause was not as just]{.underline}, their
[resolve not as great]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} their [military
not as competent]{.underline} as one's own. Moreover, because decisions
for war typically reflect a complex weighing of threats, opportunities,
expected costs, and alternatives, what happened to another country in a
wholly different conflict may not loom large in their calculations.

Furthermore, [leaders who start wars]{.underline} are often [aware that
there are **risks involved**]{.underline}, and they sometimes recognize
that the odds of victory are slim. Even so, [they will]{.underline}
"**[roll the iron dice]{.underline}**" if they believe the alternative
is even worse. To take an obvious example, Japan's leaders in 1941
understood that the United States was vastly stronger and that attacking
[[Pearl Harbor]{.underline}]{.mark} was a huge gamble that would
probably fail. Nonetheless, they believed the alternative was bowing to
U.S. pressure and giving up their quest for great-power status and Asian
dominance --- an outcome they regarded as infinitely worse.

The bottom line is that [U.S. policymakers should [not]{.mark}
base]{.underline} their [actions today on]{.underline} the [belief that
victory in [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} (or
[[Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark} or [[Ethiopia]{.underline}]{.mark} or
[[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark}) is [[going to tilt]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**arc of [history]{.mark}** [decisively]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
directions they favor. [[Nor will]{.underline}]{.mark} the [outcome of
[today's]{.mark} conflicts [have]{.mark}]{.underline} much [[effect on
how future leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} think about their own prospects
when they are [**[deciding]{.mark} whether** [to launch a
war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Returning to the general situation in the Black Sea region, it is worth
emphasising once again that **[NATO's build-up of military activity is
largely symbolic and]{.underline}** in essence **[does not change the
balance of power]{.underline}**. In military and political terms, the
key change in the strategic situation in the region came in 2014: the
entry of Crimea into the Russian Federation, among other things,
provided an additional impetus for modernisation and the build-up of
Russian forces on the peninsula. The geographical location of Crimea
itself provides Moscow with a fairly comfortable position in terms of
ensuring the military aspects of national security in the Black Sea. In
this regard, [there is no real reason to reassess Romania's attempts to
stimulate some kind of NATO activity on the southern flank]{.underline}.

An important circumstance, which also corresponds to Russian interests
in the Black Sea, is the increased independence of
[Ankara]{.underline}'s position. Despite the fact that the latter
remains a member of NATO, it [has distanced itself from the Western
allies, especially after the attempted military coup]{.underline} in
2016. Despite the fact that the partnership between Russia and Turkey is
saddled with a number of serious contradictions, **[for Ankara it is not
advantageous to aggravate relations with Moscow in a situation where it
sees in the Euro-Atlantic partners as almost the main
threat]{.underline}** to its political regime.

In the current conditions, **[it is difficult to count on the resumption
of the plans for the development of Black Sea cooperation]{.underline}**
that were born in the 2000s, but the risks of the bloc confrontation
spreading in this region should not be overestimated.

**No impact \-\-- Black Sea tensions only risk escalating if Ukraine
tries to coerce the US into opposing Russia \-\-- strategic restraint
prevents escalation**

In reality, the Kerch Strait incident involves a complex mixture of
factors. They include the tense Russian‐​Ukrainian bilateral
relationship, Kiev's broader foreign policy objectives, and Ukraine's
volatile domestic politics.

Ukrainian President Petro [Poroshenko had to know that a decision to
send three naval vessels through the Kerch Strait would be
disruptive]{.underline}. The strait, which connects the Black Sea and
the Sea of Azov, separates Russia's Taman Peninsula from the Crimea
Peninsula. Despite Moscow's annexation of the latter in 2014, Kiev still
considers Crimea to be Ukrainian territory, a position that the United
States and its allies back emphatically. Moreover, passage through the
strait is the only oceanic link between Ukraine's Black Sea ports and
those on the Azov. Kiev, not surprisingly, views the strait as
international waters. Russia, however, regards the waterway as its own
territorial waters and viewed the attempted transit by the three
Ukrainian ships as a violation.

Whatever the legal merits of the competing positions regarding
sovereignty over Crimea and the status of the Kerch Strait, [the reality
is that Russia controls that peninsula and is unlikely to ever restore
it to Ukraine]{.underline}, despite Western demands. [Poroshenko had to
know that his attempt to send warships through a narrow passage between
what the Kremlin insists are two portions of Russian territory was
certain to cause an incident. **Why did Kiev risk**]{.underline} ([if
not avidly seek]{.underline}) **[such a confrontation]{.underline}**?
And why now? There are several likely motives.

[Kiev wants to **increase pressure on NATO**, and especially the United
States, to take a **harder stance against Moscow**. Despite their
official position that the Kremlin must disgorge Crimea]{.underline} and
end support for pro‐​Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Western
policy looks increasingly stale and ineffectual. Some European officials
even muse that it may be time to reconsider (weaken) the economic
sanctions that the West imposed on Russia. President Trump has stated
that Russia should be re‐​admitted to the G-7 group of leading economic
powers.

Such talk is potentially quite threatening to Ukraine's interests.
Creating an incident that reminds Kiev's Western supporters (and the
rest of the world) of Moscow's aggressive tendencies makes any prospect
of even a limited rapprochement between Russia and either NATO or the
European Union less likely.

Ukrainian leaders are especially determined to nurture greater bilateral
strategic cooperation with the United States. The notion that the Trump
administration has pursued a "soft" policy toward Russia, much less one
that amounts to appeasement, has always been overstated. Trump's
initiatives are actually more hardline than those Barack Obama's
administration embraced. That is especially true regarding Washington's
relationship with Kiev. Whereas Obama consistently refused to provide
weapons to Ukraine, the Trump administration has approved two major arms
sales, one of which included sophisticated anti‐​tank missiles. U.S.
troops have participated in joint military exercises with Ukrainian
forces, and Secretary of Defense James Mattis concedes that the United
States is training Ukrainian units at a base in western Ukraine.

Poroshenko and his associates want to encourage and intensify those
trends. They hope that creating a new incident underscoring aggressive
Russian conduct will lead the Trump administration to boost arms sales
and other forms of bilateral military cooperation. Even if Trump proved
reluctant to adopt that course, domestic and international pressure
might leave him little choice. Indeed, Western news media outlets
excoriated Trump for not immediately condemning Russia as an outright
aggressor in the Kerch Strait incident.

Poroshenko thus has ample foreign policy reasons for taking the actions
he did in the Kerch Strait. He also has significant political and
ideological incentives. His government did not announce the official
date for Ukraine's 2019 presidential election until two days following
the naval clash; it is now set for March 31. To say that the timing of
the announcement was suspicious is an understatement.

No candidate in the extremely crowded field is likely to exceed the 50
percent mark needed to avoid a runoff, but recent surveys have indicated
that Poroshenko is in surprisingly poor political shape. Most polls
showed him receiving between 8 and 15 percent of the first‐​round vote.
The leading candidate is former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, with
Poroshenko running in third. Corruption scandals continue to bedevil his
administration, making his re‐​election (or even his ability to make the
runoff) far from certain.

In addition to creating a "rally around the flag" effect, thereby
boosting Poroshenko's status, Russian seizure of the Ukrainian vessels
gave the president a justification to impose outright martial law in 10
regions of eastern Ukraine---areas likely to be especially hostile to
his political prospects. It could also serve as a basis for tightening
Ukraine's already worrisome restrictions on freedom of expression.

That track record should trouble Kiev's backers in the West. [To wage
war against eastern separatists, Kiev early on not only instituted
military conscription, it arrested critics of that action.]{.underline}
Authorities jailed television journalist and blogger Ruslan Kotsaba and
charged him with treason for making a video denouncing the conscription
law. Kotsaba become Amnesty International's first "prisoner of
conscience" in Ukraine since the 2014 so‐​called Maidan revolution.

The vagueness of the applicable laws (and the absence of any meaningful
independent review or right of appeal) has been especially alarming.
Indeed, it seems that anyone who disputes the government's account of
the Maidan revolution (especially those who dare to mention the role of
ultranationalist, neo‐​fascist elements) or the conflict in eastern
Ukraine is likely to be silenced.

Bogdan Ovcharuk, a spokesperson for Amnesty International's Kiev office,
expressed the concerns of many proponents of freedom of expression when
he told the BBC: "This is a very slippery slope indeed. It's one thing
to restrict access to texts advocating violence, but in general banning
books because their authors have views deemed unacceptable to
politicians in Kiev...is deeply dangerous." The consequences of such a
campaign, he warned, were certain to damage the fabric of liberty.

Yet **[the Kiev government's restrictive policies continue
unabated]{.underline}**. In September 2015, Ukrainian authorities issued
an order banning 34 journalists and seven bloggers from even entering
the country. The Committee to Protect Journalists reported that the
newly publicized list was merely part of a larger blacklist that
contained the names of 388 individuals and more than a hundred
organizations that were barred from entry on the grounds of "national
security" and allegedly posing a threat to Ukraine's "territorial
integrity."

Human Rights Watch criticized the Kiev government in September 2017 for
imposing yet more restrictions on journalists, especially foreign
correspondents. The Poroshenko government even pushed through
legislation barring criticism of Ukraine's past, including the role that
ultra‐​nationalist guerilla leader (and Nazi collaborator) Stepan Bandera
and his followers played in World War II. Censorship provisions and
other media restrictions may become even more widespread and arbitrary
with Poroshenko's new declaration of martial law.

**[Ukraine's Western admirers typically ignore such evidence of
authoritarian conduct]{.underline}**, [since it does not fit with their
portrayal of the country as an enlightened member of the democratic
community]{.underline}. The reality is that **[Ukraine
epitomizes]{.underline}** what CNN analyst Fareed Zakaria has aptly
described as an "**[illiberal democracy]{.underline}**." The Poroshenko
regime certainly does not warrant unquestioned Western backing**[. Kiev
is not above engaging in provocations to serve either its political
leadership's domestic agenda or its foreign policy
objectives]{.underline}**. **[The United States does not have vital
strategic or moral interests at stake in the overall Ukraine‐​Russia
quarrel, much less the latest parochial spat in the Kerch
Strait]{.underline}**. A [cautious, restrained posture is
appropriate]{.underline}.

Ukraine\'s foreign minister has
urged [NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/topic/nato) not to allow Russia to
extend its influence in the Black Sea, amid tensions that Kremlin
critics say are a symptom of Moscow\'s plan to establish de
facto control of the wider region.

[Dmytro
Kuleba](https://www.newsweek.com/ukraines-foreign-minister-fires-back-vladimir-putins-claim-country-us-pawn-1605645) told Newsweek that
discussions about the [[Black Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}
[were]{.underline} [central to Kyiv\'s]{.underline} expanding
[cooperation]{.underline} [with NA]{.underline}TO, a bloc Ukraine has
been pushing to join since its 2014 revolution ousted a pro-Russian

**[Recent weeks]{.underline}** [have **[seen tense

forces]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Black Sea. First, [[Russian

Accessed 10-17-2020)

But, surprisingly, some electrical system experts are thinking about it
in a different way. [Cyberattacks on the grid are a real
risk]{.underline}, they told me. [But **[the worst-case]{.mark}
scenarios we're imagining** **[aren't that
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Nor is this a **short-term
crisis**]{.underline}, with risks that can be permanently solved.
[Bringing down the grid is a lot harder than just flicking a switch, but
the danger is real]{.underline} --- [and [it may **never go
away**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Representatives from two
[nonprofit organizations]{.underline} --- both of which play large roles
in how the electric grid is regulated and maintained --- [said it is
easier to imagine disaster scenarios than create one]{.underline}.
"[[There've been]{.mark} some very sensational
[books]{.mark}]{.underline} out [there [about the **grid going
dark**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because]{.mark} [someone's got their
**finger ready**]{.mark}]{.underline} over a mouse [and everything is
going to turn off at the same time]{.underline}," said Bill Lawrence,
vice president and chief security officer at the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, the regulatory authority that sets and enforces
technological standards for utility companies across the continent.
"[The **[grid does not work that way]{.mark}**]{.underline}."
[[Our]{.mark} electric [infrastructure is]{.mark} chock-[full of]{.mark}
both [**redundancies** and **regional variations**]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- [two things that impede widespread sabotage. That's not to say that
the grid isn't under attack]{.underline}. Lawrence acknowledged that
there is interest in "trying to hurt us from a distance." But [he
emphasized **[there have not]{.mark}** yet **[been any successful
attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [meaning hackers haven't caused any
blackouts.]{.underline} ![Chart, bar chart Description automatically
generated](media/image2.png){width="6.1391940069991255in"
height="2.5152220034995625in"} [They've been poking]{.underline} at our
critical infrastructure [for a long while]{.underline}. [Incident
reports]{.underline} published by the Industrial Control Systems Cyber
Emergency Response Team --- a division of Homeland Security that does
training and responds to cyberattacks on critical infrastructure ---
[suggest that electricity, oil and natural gas infrastructure have been
routinely targeted for years]{.underline}.1 There are dozens of these
attacks reported to ICS-CERTS annually. However, [[it would be difficult
for]{.mark} these [attacks to lead to **wide-scale**]{.mark}
**[blackouts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to Lawrence and Candace
Suh-Lee, who leads a cybersecurity research team at the Electric Power
Research Institute, a nonprofit research and development lab. And
[that's true [**even if hackers** do]{.mark} eventually [**succeed** in
taking control of **some electric systems**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} It
helps that [the North American electric grid is both diverse in its
engineering and redundant in its design]{.underline}. For instance, the
Ukrainian attacks are often cited as evidence that hundreds of thousands
of Americans could suddenly find themselves in the dark because of
hackers. But [Lawrence considers the Ukrainian grid a lot easier to
infiltrate than the North American one]{.underline}. [That's because
Ukraine's infrastructure is more homogeneous]{.underline}, [the result
of electrification happening under]{.underline} the standardizing eye of
[the former Soviet Union]{.underline}, he told me. [[The **North
American grid**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in contrast, [[began as a
**patchwork of**]{.mark} **[unconnected]{.mark} electric
[islands]{.mark},**]{.underline} each [designed and built by companies
that weren't coordinating with one another.]{.underline} Even today, he
said, the enforceable standards set by NERC don't tell you exactly what
to buy or how to build. "So taking down one utility and going right next
door and doing the same thing to that neighboring utility would be an
extremely difficult challenge," he said. Meanwhile, the electric grid
already contains a lot of redundancies that are built in to prevent
blackouts caused by common problems like broken tree limbs or heat waves
--- and those redundancies would also help to prevent a successful
cyberattack from affecting a large number of people. Suh-Lee pointed to
an August 2003 blackout that turned the lights off on 50 million people
on the east coast of the U.S. and Canada. "When we analyzed it, there
was about 17 different things lined up that went wrong. Then it
happened," she said. Hackers wouldn't necessarily have control over all
the things that would have to go wrong to create a blackout like that.
In contrast, Suh-Lee said, scenarios that sound like they should lead to
major blackouts ... haven't. [Take the 2013 Metcalf
incident,]{.underline} [where snipers physically attacked 17 electric
transformers in Silicon Valley]{.underline}. [Surrounding neighborhoods
temporarily lost power]{.underline}, but despite huge energy demand in
the region, "[the big users weren't even aware Metcalf had
happened]{.underline}," she said. Difficult isn't the same as
impossible, Suh-Lee told me. Depending on where an attack happened and
how people responded, you could get the stuff of our nightmares.
Lawrence repeatedly invoked the phrase "knock on wood" as he talked
about the possibility of infiltrations of electric infrastructure
turning into real-world blackouts. That's why there's a lot of effort
going into research, monitoring and preparation for cyberattacks.
Lawrence's team, for instance, is gearing up for an event that's held
every other year and is sort of like war games for the electric grid.
And the Department of Energy is planning a similar event, focused on
figuring out what it takes to reboot after a hacker-caused blackout. But
that preparation doesn't mean we'll eventually solve this problem,
either, Suh-Lee said. If the chances of a cinematic disaster are low,
the chances of a theatrical hero on a white horse riding in to save the
day are even lower. [[Making **the grid stronger**]{.mark} and more
resilient [also means **making**]{.mark} **[it more
digital]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [the [work]{.mark} that's [being done
**to improve**]{.mark} **the infrastructure** [has]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [[created]{.mark} new [opportunities for **hackers to break
in**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And the risk of attack is here to
stay]{.underline}. Security improvements are "never going to completely
eliminate the risk," she said. "The risk is out there and people will
find a new way to attack." We'll be living with cyber threats to the
grid for the rest of our lives.

From 1967 to 1972, [the U.S. military]{.underline} [used]{.underline}
weather [modification as a **tactical weapon**]{.underline} [for its war

infiltrators used the Ho Chi Minh Trail as a supply route.73 In an
attempt to deny access to the route, the U.S. military initiated
Operation Popeye hoping to ex tend the monsoon season and make the trail
impassable by seeding clouds over the trail with over two-thousand

and ultimately irrelevant.75 [Despite doubts about the

Hong Kong [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} this week [[revealed plans
to]{.mark} **drastically [expand]{.mark}**]{.underline} [an
experimental]{.underline} weather [[modification]{.underline}]{.mark}
[program]{.underline} [to cover an area]{.underline} of over 5.5 million
square kilometers (2.1 million square miles) \-- [more than 1.5 times
the **total size of India**.]{.underline}

According to a statement from the State Council, [China]{.underline}
[will have a \"developed]{.underline} weather **[modification
system]{.underline}**\" by 2025, [thanks to breakthroughs]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} fundamental **[research]{.underline}** [and key
**technologies**]{.underline}, [as well as improvements]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} \"comprehensive [prevention]{.underline} [against
safety risks]{.underline}.\"

In the next five years, [the total area]{.underline} [covered by
**artificial rain**]{.underline} or snowfall [will reach 5.5 million sq
km]{.underline}, while over 580,000 sq km (224,000 sq miles) [will be
covered]{.underline} [by **hail suppression**]{.underline}
[technologies]{.underline}. The statement added that the program will
help with disaster relief, agricultural production, emergency responses
to forest and grassland fires, and dealing with unusually high
temperatures or droughts.

[China has [long sought]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **control the
weather**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to protect]{.underline}
[farming]{.underline} areas [and]{.underline} to [ensure clear
skies]{.underline} [for key events]{.underline} \-- [it **seeded
clouds**]{.underline} ahead of the 2008 Beijing Olympics to reduce smog
and avoid rain ahead of the competition. Key political meetings held in
the Chinese capital are notorious for enjoying beautiful clear skies,
thanks both to weather modification and the shutting down of nearby
factories.

As a concept, cloud [seeding]{.underline} [has been **around for
decades**]{.underline}. It [works]{.underline} [by
injecting]{.underline} small amounts of [silver iodide]{.underline}
[into clouds]{.underline} with a lot of moisture, [which then
condenses]{.underline} [around the new particles]{.underline}, becoming
heavier and eventually falling as precipitation.

[A study funded by the]{.underline} US [[N]{.mark}ational
[S]{.mark}cience [F]{.mark}oundation]{.underline}, published earlier
this year, [found that \"cloud **seeding can boost
snowfall**]{.underline} [across]{.underline} [a wide area]{.underline}
[if the atmospheric]{.underline} [conditions]{.underline} [are
favorable]{.underline}.\" [The study [was one of the
first]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **ascertain definitively**]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} cloud [seeding worked]{.mark}]{.underline}, as previously
it had been difficult to distinguish precipitation created as a result
of the practice from normal snowfall.

That uncertainty had not stopped China investing heavily in the
technology: between 2012 and 2017, the country spent over \$1.34 billion
on various weather modification programs. Last year, according to state
news agency Xinhua, weather modification helped reduce 70% of hail
damage in China\'s western region of Xinjiang, a key agricultural area.

And while other countries have also invested in cloud seeding, including
the US, China\'s enthusiasm for the technology has created some alarm,
particularly in neighboring India, where agriculture is heavily
dependent on the monsoon, which has already been disrupted and become
less predictable as a result of climate change.

[[India and China]{.underline} **[recently faced
off]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[along]{.mark} their shared]{.underline} \--
[and **hotly disputed**]{.underline} \-- [border]{.underline} [in [the
Himalayas]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with the two sides **[engaging
in]{.mark} their [bloodiest clash]{.mark}** in decades]{.underline}
earlier this year. For years, [some in India have]{.underline}
[speculated]{.underline} [that]{.underline} weather
[[modification]{.mark} [could]{.mark} potentially **[give China the
edge]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a future conflict, [given the importance
of conditions]{.underline} [to any **troop movements**]{.underline} in
the inhospitable mountain region.

Though the primary focus of Beijing\'s weather modification appears to
be domestic, experts have warned there is the potential for impact
beyond the country\'s borders.

[Last month]{.underline}, [16]{.underline} "[artificial]{.underline}
rain **[enhancement rockets]{.underline}**" [were launched]{.underline}
off the back of a pickup truck 300 miles [south of Beijing]{.underline}.
[The operation]{.underline}, ordered up by the Juye County
Meteorological Bureau in response to a local drought, [was]{.underline}
reportedly [a success]{.underline}. Over the next 24 hours, [the county
received more than **two inches of rain** that]{.underline}, according
to local officials, [**alleviated** the drought]{.underline}, lowered
the risk of forest fires and improved air quality.

It sounds like something out of a cartoon. But for decades,
[[China]{.mark} has [been home to one]{.mark} [of the **world\'s most
advanced**]{.mark}]{.underline} weather-[modification
[programs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Generally]{.underline}, [its **goals**
have been **modest**]{.underline}: [more rain]{.underline} in arid
places, [less]{.underline} field-destroying [hail]{.underline} and sunny
days for big national events. But that modesty is starting to give way.
Earlier this month, China announced plans to expand its rainmaking
capabilities to cover nearly 60% of the country by 2025. Details are
sketchy, but [fears are **rising** about]{.underline} the [**potential
military** uses]{.underline} of these capabilities, and their effects on
an already changing climate. For China, and the world, these concerns
need to be addressed soon.

Humans have dreamed of controlling the weather for millennia. But it
wasn't until 1946 that scientists at General Electric Co. discovered
that dry ice can create precipitation when it interacts with clouds
under certain conditions. By 1953, roughly 10% of the land area of the
U.S. had been targeted for cloud seeding. Twelve years later, the
government was spending millions of dollars on weather-modification
research each year, and 15 other companies had started cloud-seeding
operations in 23 states.

It wasn't just about rainfall, however. During the Vietnam War, the U.S.
military weaponized cloud seeding to inhibit enemy troop movements and
reduce the effectiveness of anti-aircraft attacks, among other things.
These uses so alarmed policy makers that they began seeking an
international agreement to end "environmental warfare." In 1978, the
Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of
Environmental Modification went into force.

[Although China]{.underline} [**ratified the treaty** in
2005]{.underline}, [its interest in controlling the weather]{.underline}
and the environment **[didn't wane]{.underline}**. Meteorological
calamities such as hail and flooding account for more than 70% of the
country\'s annual disaster-related damage. Because of that ongoing toll,
the government has staked its legitimacy in part on how well it responds
to such incidents. In recent decades, as the country has grown
wealthier, Earth-altering projects such as the Three Gorges Dam have
become a favored solution.

Weather modification, by comparison, is relatively inexpensive. In the
1980s, the government began making substantial investments in cloud
physics and related fields. Advances in everything from satellites to
rocketry boosted the effort, even though definitive scientific proof for
the effectiveness of cloud seeding emerged only in 2018 (and in Idaho,
not China). Nonetheless, the government claimed a great success in 2008,
when Beijing launched 1,110 allegedly rain-suppressing rockets to ensure
that the Olympic opening ceremonies were dry (they were, although
scientists have questioned whether the rockets had much to do with it).
By 2015, there were rainmaking and hail-suppression programs in 30
Chinese provinces, employing some 35,000 people.

Success has bred greater ambitions. In 2017, China's top economic
policy-making body showered \$175 million on a weather-modification
system designed to bring more precipitation to a region that makes up
about 10% of the country's territory (among the items purchased: 897
rocket launchers). A year later, Chinese aerospace and defense companies
were reportedly building thousands of fuel-burning chambers intended to
produce vast amounts of precipitation along the Alaska-sized Tibetan
plateau. This month's announcement was a predictable progression ---
albeit one that has generated significant skepticism among scientists.

[But as [the U.S. learned]{.mark}]{.underline} decades ago,
[[even]{.mark} **modest [success]{.mark}**]{.underline} at weather
[modification [is **sufficient**]{.mark} [to **worry rivals**]{.mark}
and neighbors]{.underline}. [And other **[Asian
countries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly
[[concerned that China's program]{.underline}
[could]{.underline}]{.mark} **[negatively [affect]{.mark} the
[monsoons]{.mark}]{.underline}** and regular rains [that have fed their
people]{.underline} [for millennia]{.underline}. Although the science
behind such schemes is still debatable, this isn't an idle worry. [In a
region where **[tensions are already rising]{.mark}**]{.underline} over
access to water, weather [modification]{.underline} [will at **best
appear**]{.underline} [like]{.underline} diplomatic
**[pressure]{.underline}**; at worst, it looks like a weapon.

geoengineering.**

Humanity's [collective failure to]{.underline} **[reduce]{.underline}**
[greenhouse gas emissions is [driving]{.mark} the
[world]{.mark}]{.underline} **[inexorably [toward]{.mark}
[geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or the intentional, large-scale

[**[surely]{.underline}** [develop and deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} [new
[tech]{.mark}nologies to]{.underline} [reduce atmospheric]{.underline}

Geoengineering comes in two main forms: mitigation, in the form of
large-scale carbon dioxide removal, or CDR, and remediation, known as
solar radiation modification, or SRM. CDR involves the sequestering of
atmospheric carbon dioxide through measures ranging from massive
afforestation to direct air capture---capturing carbon dioxide from the
air---to ocean seeding---adding iron to the oceans in order to stimulate
phytoplankton growth and therefore absorb more carbon. SRM encompasses a
variety of techniques to make the Earth more reflective---the so-called
albedo effect---by injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, brightening
marine clouds and oceans, and creating more reflective terrestrial
surfaces. Unlike CDR, SRM has no impact on greenhouse gas
concentrations; it merely reduces the heat they would otherwise trap, as
long as those technologies remain in place.

**[AT: 5G Impact]{.underline}**

**'5G race' is [nonsense]{.underline}**

Nilay **Patel 19**, J.D. from the University of Wisconsin Law School,
Editor-in-Chief of The Verge, Former Acting Managing Editor for Vox, AB
in Political Science from the University of Chicago, "Wait, Why The Hell
Is The 'Race To 5G' Even A Race?", The Verge, 5/23/2019,
https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637213/5g-race-us-leadership-china-fcc-lte

I have a dumb question that no one seems capable of answering directly:
***[[Why is 5G a race?]{.underline}]{.mark}***

[Everyone]{.underline} --- the wireless industry, Democrats,
Republicans, the major media, you name it --- [frames the
building]{.underline} of next-generation 5G networks [as a "race" in
which the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [needs to
demonstrate "leadership."]{.underline}

Here is The Washington Post declaring America has the lead in the race
to 5G. Here's CNN asking "Who's winning the race to 5G?" Here's AT&T CEO
Randall Stephenson declaring that China isn't beating the US to 5G
"yet," as some sort of ominous warning. Here's T-Mobile CEO John Legere
telling the House Subcommittee on Communications and Technology that
merging with Sprint will let his company "win the race to 5G." Here is
an entire microsite from industry lobbying group CTIA titled "The Race
to 5G."

Let us never forget AT&T being so desperate to lead this "race" that it
rolled out fake 5Ge logos on its phones.

[But [the **stakes**]{.mark} of this supposed race [are **wholly
unclear**]{.mark}. What happens [if we win]{.mark}, besides
[telecom]{.mark} execs **[get]{.mark}**ting [**slightly
richer**?]{.mark}]{.underline} More importantly, [what are the drawbacks
to coming in second, or even third? [Where is the]{.mark}]{.underline}
list of specific [negative [outcomes of]{.mark} China [building]{.mark}
a 5G network [a **month**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a year, [or even **five
years** [before]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates[? [I've **never seen it**]{.mark}]{.underline},
and I keep asking about it.

NO ONE CAN SAY WHAT BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN IF WE DON'T WIN THE RACE TO
5G

For example, here's FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks on The Vergecast
this week, when I asked why 5G is a race.

"I think it is important for us to continue to lead the race \... we
obviously led to 4G and I think we get to set some of the standards that
are ultimately going to be implemented worldwide, which is why there is
a little bit of a race."

Starks went on to say that China wants to be a global leader in
supplying 5G equipment and that's why Huawei has been so aggressively
building and pricing its gear. But Huawei depends on American chip
technology to make its products, and the US government has just put
Huawei on a blacklist anyway. [So\... the race is [so we can **set
some**]{.mark} **wireless [standards]{.mark}**[?]{.mark} I suspect
Apple, Google, Qualcomm, [Verizon, and AT&T can **fend for
themselves**]{.mark} when it comes to that process]{.underline}.

The other main argument for winning the "race" to 5G is that having the
world's best and fastest networks will create new economic opportunities
for businesses of all kinds --- we'll enable self-driving cars and
telemedicine and all the other stuff you hear about during interminable
5G slideshows at trade conferences. At a hearing before the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation earlier this year,
Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker confidently declared that "failing to win
the race to 5G would not only materially delay the benefits of 5G for
the American people, it would forever reduce the economic and societal
gains that come from leading the world in technology."

WE WON THE RACE TO LTE AND OUR LTE NETWORKS ARE AMONG THE SLOWEST AND
MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD

Maybe. It is indeed true that better networks lead to better
opportunities, and that widespread high-speed broadband is something
everyone wants. But [**[I]{.mark}** sincerely [doubt]{.mark}
that]{.underline} all of these [[companies will]{.mark} pick up and
[move]{.mark} to China]{.underline} or Europe [if the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [builds 5G networks
slightly slower. After all, [we already have]{.mark} some of the
**[slow]{.mark}**est and most expensive [networks]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the world, [and Apple and Facebook have not]{.underline} yet
[relocated]{.underline} to South Korea.

The more I hear about the race, the more **[I don't buy
it]{.underline}**. I think [the "race" framing is there to
make]{.underline} some big [decisions seem urgent and
important]{.underline} --- to make it appear as though some serious
trade-offs are worth it in order to "win." And those trade-offs are
indeed serious: 5G networks will require a serious rethinking of how we
use wireless spectrum. There are incredible privacy implications around
putting millions of IoT devices in a "smart city" on 5G. Investment
dollars will naturally flow toward building 5G networks in cities
instead of expanding our networks to rural areas, exacerbating the
digital divide.

THE "RACE" IS TO THERE TO MAKE SERIOUS TRADE-OFFS SEEM WORTH IT SO WE
CAN "WIN"

And once the "race" to build out 5G in big cities is "won," the pressure
to expand access to other places in the country will vanish, making that
divide even worse. It is worth carefully considering all of these things
before giving in to haste.

Oh, and it appears that some of the required 5G spectrum might interfere
with important weather sensors, a concern raised by NASA, the Navy, and
the NOAA in hearings before Congress last week. How did the wireless
industry respond to these concerns? By writing a blog post accusing
meteorologists from across three government agencies of "risking our 5G
leadership." The implication, of course, is that worrying about
detecting major weather events could make us lose the race.

[This [race is **imaginary bullshit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's being
[[foisted]{.mark} on us [by]{.mark}]{.underline} huge [[telecom]{.mark}
companies]{.underline} that know internet access is fundamentally a
commodity and want something new to sell at high prices instead of
competing to improve service and lower prices on the networks they have.
[After all, the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [["won"]{.mark} the "race" for [LTE,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} it bears repeating: [our]{.underline} LTE
[[networks are]{.mark} among the **[slow]{.mark}**est in the world,
and]{.underline} our [prices among the highest. **[What did
winning]{.mark} that race [accomplish]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the
millions of people across the country that still can't get a reliable
LTE signal?

**It [can't]{.underline} be 'weaponized'**

John **Tanner 19**, Editor of Disruptive Asia, Former Editor-In-Chief
and Global Technology Editor at Telecom Asia, Two Degrees in
Telecommunications, "US Memo Claims China Could Use 5G To Kill People,
Maybe", Disruptive Asia, 1/8/2019,
https://disruptive.asia/memo-china-5g-kill-people/

ITEM: [[A former]{.mark} Trump administration [official]{.mark}
is]{.underline} circulating a memo [**[claim]{.mark}**ing [China could
weaponize 5G]{.mark} if its market dominance isn't checked]{.underline}.

How does one weaponize 5G, you may ask? According to the memo author --
retired Air Force Brigadier General Robert Spalding, who used to sit on
the National Security Council -- you do it by selling your 5G gear cheap
enough to ensure it's installed in every 5G network in the world, then
make use of secret back doors to wreak international havoc, reports
Bloomberg:

> Spalding in his memo paints a future headed toward domination by
> China. Eventually, alternatives to its network technology won't exist,
> because other suppliers won't be able to compete with
> government-subsidized offerings from Huawei and fellow Chinese gear
> maker ZTE Corp., Spalding said.

[Once China controls the market]{.underline} for internet-connected
devices, [it will be able "to weaponize cities," Spalding
said]{.underline} in the memo: "Think of self-driving cars that suddenly
mow down unsuspecting pedestrians. Think of drones that fly into the
intakes of airliners."

Well. Yes. **[Think]{.underline}**.

If you're wondering, [Spalding is the same person who put together a
memo and presentation last year that proposed a similar idea on the
grounds that Chinese dominance of 5G was tantamount to China attempting
to reinvent the global internet]{.underline} as a platform designed to
enable Chinese cyber espionage and cyber attacks on US networks.

**[Which is silly, because [that's not]{.mark} really [how 5G or the
internet work]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

I haven't read the new memo (which hasn't been made public), but based
on the Bloomberg report, [[Spalding's concept]{.mark} of weaponized 5G
[sounds]{.mark} both **[silly and paranoid]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That's not to say that China doesn't engage in cyber espionage and
hacking against US targets. Of course it does -- it has done for years,
just as the US has been doing likewise to China and ... well, just about
everyone, really.

And sure, it's technically possible that China could secretly leverage
Huawei or ZTE network gear to control every 5G network on earth, hoover
up personal data and turn cars and drones into robo-assassins. (It's
also technically possible that once Alexa, Siri, Bixby, Cortana and
Google Assistant become smart enough, they'll become sentient, team up
to form an AI hive mind called Skynet and kill us all.)

But [Spalding's scenario [**doesn't hold up** if you **look
closely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For a start, [it seems to depend on [the
premise]{.mark} that (1) [Huawei]{.mark} and ZTE [will]{.mark} literally
[become the **only**]{.mark} **commercially [viable
alt]{.mark}ernatives** for buying 5G solutions (which [is **highly
unlikely**), and]{.mark} (2) [there will be **no**]{.mark} **possible
[way]{.mark}** for regulators, law enforcement agencies or telcos [to
**vet** 5G]{.mark}]{.underline} gear [[for]{.mark} possible
[spyware]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities before installing it ([[also
**highly unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark}).

[The other main [assumption]{.mark} here seems to be that]{.underline}
autonomous cars, drones and the rest of [the **[I]{.mark}**nternet
**[o]{.mark}**f **[T]{.mark}**hings will]{.underline} either [be
manufactured by Huawei]{.underline} (or run Huawei software), [or [have
crap security]{.mark}, zero encryption and no failsafes whatsoever. The
latter may be possible]{.underline} given the state of IoT security
today, [but [in that case]{.mark} Chinese [hackers **wouldn't need
Chinese gear**]{.mark} in everyone's networks [to]{.mark} pull off such
an [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. They certainly haven't needed it up to
now.

Again, I don't have a copy of the full memo, and it might contain
details that make this sound more plausible than the ones included in
the Bloomberg report. But I'm reasonably sure that **[[of all the things
China plans to do]{.mark} with 5G, turning self-driving cars into
[murderbots is not one]{.mark} of them]{.underline}**.

**No Chinese dominance**

**SCMP 19,** South China Morning Post, citing a variety of experts,
"China Experts: US Still Out Front In Tech Race Despite Pentagon Claim",
11/3/2019,
https://www.abacusnews.com/tech/china-experts-us-still-out-front-tech-race-despite-pentagon-claim/article/3036161

[Chinese **[experts]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [**[reject]{.mark}**ed
[the claim]{.mark}]{.underline} by a senior Pentagon official [that the
[US is lagging]{.mark} behind [China in]{.mark}]{.underline} some [key
dual-use technologies]{.underline}.

Michael [Brown]{.underline}, director of the US Department of Defence's
innovation unit, [said]{.underline} at a seminar [earlier]{.underline}
this week [that China was]{.underline} either [competitive]{.underline}
or catching up [in the areas of]{.underline} hypersonics, artificial
intelligence, quantum sciences, [**[5G]{.mark}** mobile
networks]{.underline}, genetic engineering, and space.

With the exception of hypersonics, these technologies had not only
military applications but were also critical for long-term economic
prosperity, making them important to the future of US-China competition,
he said.

"I believe that national security and economic security are inextricably
linked," Brown told the think tank Centre for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington.

China prepares to send its own astronauts to the moon 50 years after
Apollo 11

But Chinese experts said [[China's progress had been
**exaggerated**]{.mark} and many of [its achievements were **only
partial**]{.mark} **successes** so far]{.underline}.

Hong Kong-based military commentator Song Zhongping said [the [US had
been "**unarguably** more **successful** and **experienced**, **far
ahead**]{.mark} of anyone"]{.underline} in space technology. "Look at
Project Apollo and the Space Shuttle programme -- decades later no other
country has ever matched those achievements," he said.

[[Despite]{.mark} breakthroughs in]{.underline} certain fields like
[[**5G**, there was]{.mark} more **generally [a clear gap]{.mark}**
[between **China**]{.mark}'s digital information and electronics
technologies [and]{.mark} the **[world]{.mark}'s technological
[leaders]{.mark}**, according to Beijing-based naval expert]{.underline}
Li [Jie]{.underline}.

In the field of hypersonics, China may have achieved milestones in
glider vehicles, but in another important technology -- ramjet engines
-- there was no evidence of any major breakthroughs, and the US was
still far more experienced in the field, said Zhao Tong, senior fellow
at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Centre for Global Policy.

China exhibited hypersonic missiles and drones at last month's National
Day parade, and has just launched a commercial 5G -- fifth generation
mobile network -- service on Friday, which is the biggest in the world.

Huawei, China's telecommunication giant has won contracts to construct
the 5G infrastructures for many countries, despite the US campaign to
ban Huawei equipment over security concerns.

Brown said China was "already ahead of the US in quantum sciences" --
citing the Chinese launch in 2016 of Micius, the world's first quantum
communications satellite. China had also made more launches into space
than the US in 2018 as it speeded up its space programme, he said.

Brown added the US had used Chinese equipment for genome sequencing,
which meant China had more data on the genetic sequencing of the US
population than the US itself, he said, and the US was also playing "a
catch up game" with China in AI-based facial recognition.

5G is available now in China for just US\$18

[[For]{.mark} the past]{.underline} 50 to [**[80 years]{.mark}**, the
[US]{.mark} had **[led]{.mark} the way** [and **set**]{.mark} **the
[standards]{.mark}** [in **almost all**]{.mark} important
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies and industries]{.underline}, he said. [In
doing so, the US had been able [to]{.mark} build and [shape a **global
ecosystem**]{.mark} and **enjoy its advantages** since the end of World
War II]{.underline}.

But, Brown warned, for China to set the pace for these technologies
would be "game-changing".

"Imagine what the world would look like if China was setting standards,"
he said. "Over time, that means we have fewer levers to shape what the
US wants to do, both from a global technology standpoint and also what
are the values that are highlighted around the world as ones to be
looked up to."

Ni Lexiong, a Shanghai-based military commentator, said [[Brown had
his]{.mark} **own [agenda]{.mark}** in making his comments]{.underline}.

"[The US [military wants **more budget**]{.mark}, more new equipment,
more new R&D projects. [And]{.mark} the theory of a [China threat
is]{.mark}, of course, [a]{.mark} **handy
[excuse]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Ni said.

Huawei Isn't So Scary", Foreign Policy, 10/12/2019,

5G may have become a buzzword, but [the [notion]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[countries must]{.mark} rush to [be first]{.mark}]{.underline} to
deploy it [[is **mistaken**]{.mark} and **reckless**]{.underline}---and
increases the odds of security breaches. There's no doubt that 5G is
important, promising the high speeds and unparalleled connectivity that
are required to unleash the full potential of the "internet of
things"---the ever-growing network of web-connected devices---and
artificial intelligence. 5G could prove critical to economic
competitiveness, but not only will a race to install the system end up
backfiring, [there is]{.underline} also [reason to [think twice
about]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[claims]{.mark} of
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}'s Huawei [that it]{.underline} alone
[[can shape]{.mark} our **[tech]{.mark}**nological
[future]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Huawei's marketing---and Chinese government propaganda---has built the
impression that it's either Huawei or no way to 5G. The
telecommunications firm declares itself the unparalleled leader in 5G as
it attempts to secure commercial partnerships around the world, now
boasting more than 50 contracts across some 30 countries. In Europe,
Huawei has even launched a campaign urging residents to "Vote for 5G,"
as if its 5G technologies were the only way for Europe to achieve a
smarter future.

Huawei's claims to be No. 1 in 5G can be misleading. Huawei is a leader
and a powerhouse, but it is not the only top player. And it isn't clear
that the company is winning---at least, not yet. Although Huawei's
technological capabilities shouldn't be underestimated, there are
reasons to look skeptically at its supposed superiority in 5G.

Huawei's quest for dominance in the global telecommunications industry
has involved tactics and practices that are antithetical to fair,
healthy competition. That Huawei has amassed a market share estimated at
nearly 30 percent of the global telecom equipment industry reflects its
capacity to underbid and undercut competitors, not to mention multiple
alleged incidents of bribery and corruption. The Chinese firm's
determination to provide cheap services and equipment to capture market
share often puts intense pressure on competitors. But it's not always a
fair fight: Huawei's rise has been enabled by the billions of dollars in
support, subsidies, and various benefits it has received from the
Chinese government. For instance, Huawei has lines of credit from
state-owned banks that reportedly amount to \$100 billion.

Huawei has also been helped by a business culture in which theft is
often encouraged---even outright incentivized. At best, some of its
activities, such as the aggressive recruitment of talent from rivals,
may be considered standard practice within the industry. At worst,
however, Huawei's business practices violate legal boundaries. There
have been numerous accusations of intellectual property theft, as well
as ongoing reports of attempts to expropriate sensitive technologies,
from the early copying of Cisco source code to military technology. And
what these dubious practices reveal is that Huawei is in fact not as
cutting-edge as its publicity claims.

[The idea [that Huawei]{.mark} has an insurmountable [lead]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the [[5G]{.underline}]{.mark} race also [[represents a
**failure**]{.mark} of observers [to distinguish its]{.mark} **carefully
crafted [image]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} any **[real]{.mark} technological
[edge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, Huawei has long pursued 5G.
Since 2007, it has invested massively in next-generation
telecommunications, spending more than \$60 billion on research and
development over the course of a decade. And the company now plans to
increase its 5G investments as part of an annual R&D budget that may
exceed \$15 billion.

Huawei truly does provide mature and cost-effective equipment. It is one
of the few players offering an end-to-end 5G solution, with particular
strengths in radio access networking. However, [[it's **unclear**
how]{.mark} well the company's [systems **integrate** with]{.mark}
existing **[4G]{.mark}** infrastructure from other vendors. The
[security]{.mark} of Huawei's products [has been]{.mark} assessed to be
[**subpar**, and]{.mark} the **long-term [performance]{.mark}** of its
5G networks also remains **[questionable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Countries that choose this low-cost option for fear of losing out in the
5G race risk creating an unstable and insecure foundation for their
future societies and economies.

[[Although Huawei]{.mark} may **[assert]{.mark}** that it has already
taken **[a]{.mark}**n unbeatable [lead]{.mark} in 5G infrastructure,
[judging]{.mark} who's truly ahead in the field [means]{.mark} looking
at **[multiple criteria]{.mark}**. Such indicators can include
commercial contracts, deployed performance, integration with network
infrastructure, and real technological innovation. For example,
[Huawei]{.mark} has [claimed]{.mark} that it has [more]{.mark} 5G
[patents]{.mark} than all U.S. companies combined, [but **quantity does
not**]{.mark} **necessarily [correlate with
quality]{.mark}**---especially [in **China**, where patents are]{.mark}
often of **[dubious]{.mark} value**]{.underline}.

Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei has declared that his company's dream is to
"stand on top of the world." But the global supply chain remains highly
interdependent---a point of leverage that Washington is seeking to
exploit by potentially limiting Huawei's access to U.S. technologies.
Moreover, Huawei's competitors have their own core strengths among the
fundamental technologies that will shape 5G. And although Huawei's
promise of relative vertical integration may offer efficiencies, [the
[**diversity** of]{.mark} competitive [suppliers]{.mark} continues to
[drive]{.mark} both competition and [innovation]{.mark}. A number of
companies based [in]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion, [South [Korea, Taiwan, and
Japan]{.mark} are]{.underline} also [industry leaders and major
providers throughout the supply chain]{.underline}. A healthy ecosystem
for telecommunications would be based on market diversity and fair
competition and would emphasize the importance of regulatory bodies,
standards, and industry alliances to ensure security and
interoperability.

That's where the United States' innovative capacity could give it an

simply faster 4G, but rather creates a new paradigm for connectivity
with very high speed, low latency and high throughput. Based on these
characteristics, 5G will be integral to realizing the potential of the
Internet of Things and promising applications of artificial
intelligence, from remote surgeries to autonomous driving in smart
cities. In this regard, 5G will become tantamount to critical
infrastructure, because its disruption or exploitation could prove
deeply damaging, even deadly. Consequently, security will be imperative,
and talk of 'racing' for 5G risks undermining this critical foundation.

That is what [US [leaders]{.mark} are]{.underline} doing again:
[creating a [**panic** over]{.mark} Chinese
**[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology companies [by]{.underline} raising,
and [**[exaggerating, tiny risks]{.mark}**. The most
pertinent]{.underline} case (but not the only one) [is]{.underline} the
US government attack on the wireless broadband company
[Huawei]{.underline}. The US is closing its markets to the company and
trying hard to shut down its business around the world. As with Iraq,
the US could end up creating a geopolitical disaster for no reason.

I have followed Huawei's technological advances and work in developing
countries, as I believe that 5G and other digital technologies offer a
huge boost to ending poverty and other SDGs. I have similarly interacted
with other telecoms companies and encouraged the industry to step up
actions for the SDGs. When I wrote a short foreword (without
compensation) for a Huawei report on the topic, and was criticized by
foes of China, I asked top industry and government officials for
evidence of wayward activities by Huawei. I heard repeatedly that Huawei
behaves no differently than trusted industry leaders.

[The US]{.underline} government nonetheless
[[argues]{.underline}]{.mark} that Huawei's 5G equipment could undermine
global security. [A **["backdoor"]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Huawei's
software or hardware, US officials claim, [could enable]{.underline} the
Chinese government to engage in [[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}
around the world. After all, US officials note, China's laws require
Chinese companies to cooperate with the government for purposes of
national security.

Now, the facts are these. Huawei's 5G equipment is low cost and high
quality, currently ahead of many competitors, and already rolling out.
Its high performance results from years of substantial spending on
research and development, scale economies, and learning by doing in the
Chinese digital marketplace. Given the technology's importance for their
sustainable development, low-income economies around the world would be
foolhardy to reject an early 5G rollout.

Yet, [[despite]{.mark} providing **[no ev]{.mark}idence**]{.underline}
of backdoors, the US is telling the world to stay away from Huawei. The
US claims are generic. As a US Federal Communications Commissioner put
it, "The country that owns 5G will own innovations and set the standards
for the rest of the world and that country is currently not likely to be
the United States." [Other countries]{.underline}, most [notably the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}**ingdom,
[have [found **no backdoors**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Huawei's hardware
and software. **[[Even if]{.underline}]{.mark}** backdoors were
[[discovered]{.mark} later, [they could]{.mark} almost surely [be
**closed**]{.mark} at that point]{.underline}.

The debate over Huawei rages in Germany, where the US government
threatens to curtail intelligence cooperation unless the authorities
exclude Huawei's 5G technology. Perhaps as a result of the US pressure,
Germany's spy chief recently made a claim tantamount to the Cheney
Doctrine: "Infrastructure is not a suitable area for a group that cannot
be trusted fully." He offered no evidence of specific misdeeds.
Chancellor Angela Merkel, by contrast, is fighting behind the scenes to
leave the market open for Huawei.

Ironically, though predictably, the US complaints partly reflect
America's own surveillance activities at home and abroad. Chinese
equipment might make secret surveillance by the US government more
difficult. But unwarranted surveillance by any government should be
ended. [[Independent]{.underline}]{.mark} United Nations
[**[monitoring]{.mark}** to [curtail]{.mark}]{.underline} such
[activities should **be**]{.underline}come [part]{.underline} of the
global telecoms system. In short, [we should choose **diplomacy** and
**institutional safeguards**, not a technology war]{.underline}.

The threat of US demands to blockade Huawei concerns more than the early
rollout of the 5G network. The risks to the rules-based trading system
are profound. Now that the US is no longer the world's undisputed
technology leader, US President Donald Trump and his advisers don't want
to compete according to a rules-based system. Their goal is to contain
China's technological rise. Their simultaneous attempt to neutralize the
World Trade Organization by disabling its dispute settlement system
shows the same disdain for global rules.

If the Trump administration "succeeds" in dividing the world into
separate technology camps, the risks of future conflicts will multiply.
The US championed open trade after World War II not only to boost global
efficiency and expand markets for American technology, but also to
reverse the collapse of international trade in the 1930s. That collapse
stemmed in part from protectionist tariffs imposed by the US under the
1930 Smoot-Hawley Act, which amplified the Great Depression, in turn
contributing to the rise of Hitler and, ultimately, the outbreak of
World War II.

In international affairs, no less than in other domains, [[stoking
**fears**]{.underline}]{.mark} and acting on them, [rather
than]{.underline} on the [**evidence**, [is]{.mark} the **[path to
ruin]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Let's stick to rationality, evidence, and
rules as the safest course of action. And let us create independent
monitors to curtail the threat of any country using global networks for
surveillance of or cyberwarfare on others. That way, the world can get
on with the urgent task of harnessing breakthrough digital technologies
for the global good.

**It only makes a [small]{.underline} difference in speed and
efficiency\-\--[not]{.underline} a game-changer**

Overhyped", Netconex, 5/17/2019,
https://www.netconex.com/blog/how-5g-is-being-overhyped

[More and more is being said about the impending shift from
fourth-generation wireless to **[fifth-gen]{.mark}**eration, and how
impactful this shift will be. The only problem is, a lot of what is
being said [is]{.mark} **conflated hyperbole** - [**exaggerated** and
**overhyped**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

How 5G is Being Overhyped

[[Behind]{.mark} all of the [**marketing materials**, 5G is really
just]{.mark} some emerging **[tech]{.mark}**nologies [that will
**improve**]{.mark} wireless [networks. Latencies]{.mark} will be
[lower, and]{.mark} the networks will be [faster]{.mark} and more
efficient... **[somewhat]{.mark}**. The **[real difference]{.mark}**
between 4G LTE and 5G [will be **much smaller**]{.mark} than the
difference between black and white and color TV]{.underline}, as
Sprint's CEO Marcelo Claure compared the two.

Furthermore, [[many advancements]{.mark} that have been claimed to only
be possible through 5G (like smart cars and cities) [are]{.mark}
actually [possible **without 5G**]{.mark} connectivity]{.underline}.
Eric Xu, the current chairman of Huawei, stated that [[consumers]{.mark}
would [see **no real difference**]{.mark} between 5G and the current LTE
standard]{.underline}.

Pairing that with the fact that the United States pays some of the
highest rates for mobile connectivity - despite ranking 62nd in 4G
speeds - thanks to the monopolistic hold that cellular companies hold
over the market, we should also expect 5G to be incredibly expensive.

How Carriers Are Leveraging 5G to Their Advantage

Cellular carriers Sprint and T-Mobile have proposed a merger, supporting
their position by stating that they need to combine their resources to
bring 5G connectivity to the entire nation, or as they put it, to win
the race to 5G. Government regulators are uneasy about this merger, as
it would reduce the number of major carriers in the United States from
four to three.

It is also telling that both companies have claimed to be capable of
deploying 5G independently for years.

Tom Wheeler, former FCC Chairman, had a few choice words to share about
T-Mobile and Sprint's defense of their proposed merger - a merge that
was already blocked in 2014.

["The 'China is winning on 5G' argument]{.underline} of Sprint and
T-Mobile [is]{.underline} creative, and probably [the only rationale
they could concoct after the government twice before rejected their
proposal to reduce national wireless competition]{.underline} from four
providers to three," Wheeler said in a blog post, conflating any efforts
thus far to win on 5G to harming consumers by reducing competition.

Again, the United States ranks 62nd in 4G speeds, largely due to this
limited competition and despite paying some of the highest fees for
these services. So, while [5G will be **beneficial**]{.underline} when
it eventually does become publicly available, [[don't expect]{.mark} it
to be [a]{.mark} complete **[game-changer]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
