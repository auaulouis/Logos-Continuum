[**Deterrence** with a **European Dimension**]{.underline}, Arms Control
and Disarmament

A much-anticipated part of last February's speech was [the role of
**French deterrence** in the **European** context]{.underline}.
[**Macron** followed on his predecessors by taking a further step in
**opening up to European partners**.]{.underline} Thus, "France lives in
a web of interests that extends beyond its borders. It is not isolated.
Western Europe as a whole cannot therefore fail to benefit indirectly
from French strategy, which is a stable and determining factor in
European security." This broader interpretation of France's vital
interests is therefore reaffirmed, [Macron stating that "our nuclear
forces \... strengthen European security by their very existence and in
this respect have a genuinely European dimension."]{.underline}

Next, [Macron proposed to pursue a "**strategic dialogue**" on the role
of nuclear deterrence with those European countries that wish to do so.
**France's ambition** is to shape a "**shared European strategic
culture**". Macron suggested that **European countries** wishing to
participate should join "exercises with **French deterrent
forces**]{.underline}". It should be noted, however, that this option
does not mean setting up an integrated structure like the one that
exists in NATO.

Finally, [the president placed great emphasis on the importance of a
common strategic culture in Europe in order to evolve in the field of
arms control and disarmament]{.underline}.

Macron recalled the foundations of France's disarmament policy, French
achievements and French priorities in this area: compliance with the
NPT, negotiation of a treaty banning the production of fissile material
for weapons ("cut-off treaty") and universalization of the Comprehensive
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), continuing work on verification and the
launch of work on reducing strategic risks. Macron defended France's
logic, according to which disarmament is not an end in itself, but
rather makes it possible to increase everyone's security. His speech
therefore seeks to rebuild a European disarmament policy on security
considerations and not on ideological or strictly humanitarian
considerations.

On the subject of arms control, Macron called on his European partners
to wake up to "once again understand the dynamics of escalation and seek
to prevent or avert them by means of clear, verifiable standards". In
particular, he said that [any new agreement on **nuclear forces** in
Europe should **include Europeans**, and that discussions in this area
"must not go over our heads"]{.underline}. In general, the president
argued that Europe needs to develop "a very clear position" that "takes
into account \... the evolution of contemporary armaments" and allows it
to defend its interests and what it considers favourable to the
preservation of strategic stability on the continent.

[It will now be a question of monitoring French
initiatives]{.underline}. Naturally, the methods to be used by French
diplomacy will be decisive in winning the support of France's partners.

**French nuclear umbrella deters aggressors from targeting EU member
countries---similar interests**

Status-quo

After Brexit there will only be [one EU member state (**France**) that
possesses **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, while the EU institutions
themselves -- because of internal divisions amongst the member states --
keep silent on nuclear deterrence. Interestingly, neither the Ban Treaty
nor the Eurobomb is much discussed at the yearly gatherings of the EU
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Consortium, a consortium of
think-tanks in the EU.

[**France and the UK** have negotiated **bilateral agreements** in 1992
and 2010 with respect to their nuclear arsenals, including a **mutual
defense clause**.]{.underline} Both states "do not see situations
arising in which the vital interests of either Party could be threatened
without the vital interests of the other also being threatened" (Perot
2019, 2). Whether those arguments will stay alive after the Brexit
remains to be seen.

As a result of the mutual defense clause of the Lisbon Treaty, the
[French nuclear weapons are also used to deter attacks against other EU
member states]{.underline}, though implicitly. Already a long time ago,
[**France** made clear that the **security interests** of the **other EU
member states** are regarded as **similar** to the **security interests
of France**]{.underline}. For instance, French Defense Minister
Chevènement stated in October 1989: ["It is **not necessary** for the
radius of action of France's deterrence **to be declaratively extended**
to the territory of the FRG to apply there de facto, according to the
concept of 'vital interests'"]{.underline} (quoted by Palmer 1991, 54).
President Sarkozy extended that notion to the EU in 2008: "As for
Europe, it is a fact: by their very existence, [**French nuclear forces
are a key element in Europe's security**. Any aggressor who might
consider challenging it must be mindful of this"]{.underline} (quoted in
Jasper & Portela, 161). That idea was repeated in the more recent
Franco-German Cooperation and Integration Treaty, signed in Aachen on 22
January 2019. That Treaty does not refer to NATO being central for
collective defense, in contrast to the Lisbon Treaty, and contains a
mutual defense clause with respect to Germany. But it uses the words
"security interests" instead of "vital interests", which, according to
Perot (2019) who is affiliated with the Brussels based Egmont Institute,
"could be interpreted as a persisting timidity when it comes to explicit
references to nuclear deterrence within the Franco-German relationship".

#### US conventional deterrence is unsustainable---waning public approval and Asia Pivot means European allies must be at the forefront of European deterrence

**Geddings**,Larry Jr V. **2018**, Project Convergence Director at US
Army Futures and Concepts Center at Us Army, May 2018, "European
Deterrence for European Assurance: The United States and Russian
Adventurism in the Crimea", School of Advanced Military Studies US Army
Command and General Staff College //skwon

[**Unsustainable Reassurance and Deterrence** The **U**nited **S**tates'
**conventional deterrence policy**]{.underline} initially labeled the
European Reassurance Initiative, and later re-titled the European
Deterrence Initiative, was, and [will]{.underline} [remain,
**unsustainable** in the face of a **resurgent Russia** in the early
**twenty-first century**.]{.underline} The US deterrent strategy in
Europe was in direct competition for US military presence and influence
with other regions of the world. [A perceived lack of return on
investment, fiscal considerations, and a general weariness caused an
erosion of American interest in a uniquely European problem. Without
**European allies** and partners taking a **front row seat** in the
**security and stability of Eastern Europe**, the threat of overt
**Russian adventurism** will remain.]{.underline}

The United States' tenure as a patron in Europe will continue, but, at a
less intensive level than the expenditure and effort seen between 2014
and 2017. The fiscal expenditure of continual Army Armored Brigade
Combat Team deployments, colossal military construction costs for
forward positioning air forces and basing, and the political capital
spent for national and international consensus will certainly curtail as
the [**tangible outcomes** of the reassurance and deterrence efforts
become more common and less palatable by the **voting American
public.**]{.underline} Fading images of "little green men" in
**[Crimea]{.underline}** from memory [will lead to the questions of the
**necessity and effectiveness** of **US deterrence measures** and the
expected outcomes of those efforts]{.underline}.50 Additionally, [the
**sustainability** of a forward positioned rotation of almost
exclusively US forces against a patient adversary is fiscally
unlikely]{.underline}. [A **persistent Russia** looking to regain
**hegemonic power** far away from American shores will **tax** the
American citizen in **time, dollars, and perseverance** making the
possibility of a **long-term commitment untenable**. Finally,
**America** cannot afford to wager on the **European theater** as the
next significant defense and political challenge with a **rising China**
in the **Asia**-Pacific region.]{.underline}

#### EU is increasing its military defense---US decline means that Europe must step up to protect itself

Tom **Sauer 2019**, Tom Sauer is a post-doctoral research fellow of the
Flemish Fund for Scientific Research and a lecturer at the Department of
Politics at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, December
2019, "Power and Nuclear Weapons: The Case of the European Union",
<https://doi.org/10.1080/25751654.2020.1764260> //skwon

[The **EU is generally** regarded as a soft or **"normative"
power**]{.underline} (Manners 2002). [While the **original goal** of the
European project in the 1950 s was maintaining peace, its main
instrument was **economic cooperation**]{.underline}. That said, already
in 1952 the European Defense Community was set up, only to be vetoed by
the French Assembly two years later. It is probably no coincidence that
in the same period French Prime Minister Mendès-France started up a
secret nuclear weapons program. Jean Monnet -- one of the founding
fathers of the European Community -- was against the force de frappe
because in his view it was incompatible with the fact that Germany was
constitutionally not allowed to possess nuclear weapons.

Since then, European integration made progress on a step-by-step basis,
including the establishment of the European Economic Community and
Euratom in 1957, the latter aiming to create a European free zone for
nuclear fuel, i.e. uranium4. Unsurprisingly, Europe was called "a
civilian power". Duchène (1972), then director of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), predicted in the beginning of
the 1970 s: "Europe would be the first major area of the Old World where
the age-old process of war and indirect violence could be translated
into something more in tune with the twentieth-century citizen's notion
of civilized politics. In such a context, Western Europe could in a
sense be the first of the world's civilian centres of power" ... 'Europe
will be a giant middle power'. Similar ideas were still heard in the
1990 s, despite the announcement of a Common Foreign and Security Policy
by the Treaty of Maastricht (1991). Christopher Hill (1996, my
emphasis), for instance, stated: "Where \[European Political
Cooperation\] is weak in leverage, it is strong on values ... and
European diplomacy has steadily become associated in the public mind
with a distinct set of principles". Earlier on, Hill (1990) had
characterized the EU "a civilian power". Later on, [Manners (2002, 241,
my emphasis) triggered a lively academic debate describing the EU as "a
normative power". He argued: "This combination of historical context,
hybrid polity and legal constitution has, in the post-cold war period,
accelerated a commitment to placing universal norms and principles at
the centre of its relations with its member states and the world". Also
Sjursen (2003, 38) claimed that "the EU has considerable impact on the
international system", in a liberalist sense.]{.underline}

[That said, since the **end of the Cold War**, steps have been taken to
give body to a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), including in
the **field of defense**.]{.underline} For instance, respectively Javier
Solana, Catherine Ashton, Federica Mogherini and Joseph Borell have
taken up the position of High Representative of the EU for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy, leading the European External Action
Service. [An **EU Military** Committee aided by a EU Military Staff --
be it **small-scale** (in comparison with NATO) -- has been set up in
Brussels. The EU initiated both **civilian and military interventions**,
be it low-risk, around the world. A **European Defense Agency** (EDA)
and a European Defense Fund (EDF) have been created.]{.underline} It was
also the E(U)-3 that negotiated a deal with Iran in 2003 and that was
successful in coordinating the multilateral talks that led to the Joint
Common Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2015 (Sauer 2007, Sauer 2019a). The
Lisbon Treaty (2009) included the notion of an integrated security
policy and foresees the possibility of creating a common defense. The
Treaty also included a mutual defense clause in the sense that if one
member state is attacked, the other member states have the "obligation
of aid and assistance by all the means in their power"(art.42.7). It
also contains the possibility to integrate further with a limited group
of member states in the framework of PESCO. [**The EU Global Strategy**
(2016) introduced the concept of **"strategic autonomy**".]{.underline}
But -- as sceptics do not hesitate to repeat all the time -- progress
with respect to European defense integration is slow, especially in
comparison with NATO. Even the Lisbon Treaty continues to regard NATO as
the main security organization responsible for collective defense. In
short, European defense today can be described as a glass half full or a
glass half empty. Experts are divided between Atlanticists and
Europeanists.

The assumption in this article is that despite the financial crisis in
2008--2009, the Brexit, and the Corona-crisis, the [**European
integration** will **continue**, including in the **military**
sphere]{.underline}. The European Monetary Union (EMU) requires better
political oversight, and phenomena like migration, global warming and
pandemics can better be managed on a European scale than on a national
scale. The trend towards more political integration (including foreign,
security and defense policy) in all likelihood will continue, be it
maybe at a slower rate than in the past. One of the side-effects of
Brexit is progress made in the field of defense integration, as the UK
was always skeptical.

In addition, [there is an **important factor** that may further
**stimulate European defense integration**: the shifting balance of
power in the world with China on the rise and the **US on the (relative)
decline**]{.underline}. As a result, there are more and more voices in
the [**US** that argue for **isolationism or restraint**]{.underline},
or at least offshore balancing (Posen 2014; Walt 2018). President Trump
does not stand alone in his request to spend less money on US alliances,
especially NATO. [Many Americans believe that **Europe** should take up
its **responsibility to protect itself**.]{.underline} [Trump has stated
on different occasions -- both before and after his election -- that
**NATO is obsolete**]{.underline} (although -- paradoxically -- he has
sent more US troops to Europe). [While NATO is still regarded as the
main security framework in Europe, there are more and **more cracks in
the wand**]{.underline} (Sauer 2019b). In January 2019, there were even
rumors that the US would leave NATO (Barnes & Cooper 2019). [From a
European point of view, the **most logical alternative** for the
Atlantic Alliance is **EU defense integration**. If NATO stops to exist,
which admittedly is still unlikely in the foreseeable future, the **EU**
(or a core group within the EU) in all likelihood will **take
over.**]{.underline}

#### EU's Strategic Compass solves cyber deterrence

Compass: The European Union expands its toolbox",
<https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/strategic-compass-european-union-expands-its-toolbox>
//skwon

In Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's class at Georgetown
University, she likened each element of U.S. power - development aid,
sanctions, bilateral diplomacy, multilateral diplomacy - to a tool in
the U.S. problem-solving toolbox. When faced with a challenge, the
United States can employ one or more of these tools. [With the launch of
the **Strategic Compass** for Security and Defence, the **European
Union** is adding a handful of new tools to its **own toolbox**, to
better respond to current and future challenges.]{.underline}

[Promising a **"quantum leap"** in decisive security matters in the next
decade, the **EU** is stepping into its role as a **security provider
and global actor**. The document is **significant** for the EU; it can
be seen as a parallel to the United States' National Security Strategy
in its scope.]{.underline}

A comprehensive creation process

[This is the **first time in EU history** that a threat analysis was
conducted with each member-state inputting its strategic
priorities.]{.underline} The Strategic Compass began in June 2020 as an
attempt to align EU defense and security goals between the 27
member-states. Therefore, national priorities were translated into
European priorities through the diplomatic process. [The **major
threats** the EU faces were **identified** as great power competition,
potential instability in its neighborhood, and transnational threats,
including **cyber and hybrid attacks.**]{.underline}

Staying relevant

Nevertheless, the document realizes the fluidity of the geopolitical
environment and the shifting nature and magnitude of threats. [Thus, the
Strategic Compass promises to be the first step in regular evaluations
of the evolving strategic environment, stipulating that a new threat
analysis will be conducted every three years, allowing changes to the
EU's strategy.]{.underline}

[The document's existence is proof that the EU is positioning itself to
better respond to strategic challenges.]{.underline} Russia's invasion
of Ukraine began right at the end of the Strategic Compass process.
Although the document acknowledges the crisis in its introduction, it
was clearly drafted before war returned to the European continent. As
such the document is not a reflection of the war. It is likely that the
next iteration of the threat analysis will more prominently feature
Russian tactics on display in Ukraine[. Nevertheless, many aspects of
the **Strategic Compass** will better **prepare the EU** for the tense
**geopolitical environment** brought about by the **emerging great-power
competition.**]{.underline}

New tools in the toolbox

[The Strategic Compass contains a myriad of timelines and actionable
items. Among them is the goal that by 2025 an EU Rapid Deployment
Capacity of **5,000 troops** will be ready.]{.underline}

[The specificity and concrete timelines proposed in this document
demonstrate the **resolve of the** **E**uropean **U**nion to become a
**power broker** in the next decade. The schedule, while ambitious, is
**not impossible** provided the interest for greater **European
sovereignty** continues among EU member-states.]{.underline}

[Further, the Strategic Compass creates a new Hybrid Toolbox and
Response Teams, enhances the **Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox** and **Cyber
Defence Policy**, Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference
Toolbox, and an EU Space Strategy for Security and Defence. The document
notes that hybrid threats are growing in scale and scope, specifically
mentioning that **China and Russia** have utilized **hybrid tactics**.
The Hybrid Toolbox will allow for a **faster, coordinated attribution of
attacks**.]{.underline} The Strategic Compass will further strengthen
the existing Cyber Diplomatic Toolbox, which has grown from [a budget of
€11 million in 2017 to almost double to **€21.7 million** in
2020]{.underline}. [Enhancing the toolbox, solidifying the EU's Joint
Cyber Unit, further developing the **EU's Cyber Defense Policy** will be
instrumental to **deter cyber attacks**.]{.underline} The Strategic
Compass outlines how information manipulation threatens not only Ukraine
but aspiring member-states; as a response, a new toolbox being developed
in coordination with the European Democracy Action Plan. Many of the
tools highlighted in the Strategic Compass, such as the Cyber Diplomatic
Policy and the EU Space Strategy, have either been underutilized or
underdeveloped, but the changing nature of conflict, as is prominently
on display in Ukraine, calls for the EU to sharpen and enhance these
tools.

Geographically, the Strategic Compass references security on a global
level. [However its emphasis is on the transatlantic relationship and
the regions neighboring the EU reflecting their special importance to
the bloc. Specifically, it calls for a strengthening of NATO-EU
cooperation both on the political and the military level. It also calls
for continuing the momentum created by the 2021 EU-US Summit Statement,
a political declaration of EU-US partnership across multiple
sectors.]{.underline} Further, regarding the EU's neighboring regions,
focus is placed on Africa, particularly the Sahel and West Africa, and
the EU's immediate east. Indeed Africa has repeatedly been identified as
a region of primary geostrategic importance for the EU as instability in
the continent crosses the Mediterranean; while Europe's east, from
Moldova to Georgia, is facing Russia's belligerency and destabilizing
acts.

A stronger transatlantic partner

[The **Strategic Compass does not** seek to replace or **undermine
NATO**]{.underline}. Instead, as the document stresses multiple times,
by implementing it, the [EU will become a more valuable partner for both
NATO and the United States.]{.underline} The document is underpinned by
multiple major announcements for increased defense spending in light of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [For the United States, this means the
**EU** will do more to **provide for its own security.**]{.underline}

As Stefano Sannino the Secretary General of the European External Action
Service recently said during an event at the Wilson Center, "[The
aggression of **Russia** against Ukraine has generated a sense and
**need of unity** within the **E**uropean **U**nion and between the
European Union and the United States; and I would say the transatlantic
community more in general."]{.underline} The Strategic Compass will
contribute to that unity.

Avoiding bumps ahead

[Nevertheless, the EU needs to ensure that its mechanisms contribute
effectively to transatlantic unity.]{.underline}

Perhaps the most striking stipulation of the Strategic Compass is the
creation of a 5,000-strong force able to swiftly deploy to
non-permissive environments. The force is to include air, land, and
maritime components along with strategic enablers. It will be enabled
through the substantial modification of the EU Battlegroups and the
member-states that will participate with troops and capabilities will be
pre-identified.

However, NATO currently has the NATO Response Force (NRF) which can
start deploying globally within one to four weeks and a Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can start deploying within two
days. [**EU** member-**states** that are **also** part of NATO are major
contributors to the **NRF and VJTF**. Therefore, there is risk of
**operational redundancy** between the **EU and NATO's
components.**]{.underline}

Additionally, due to the high number of initiatives put forth by the
Strategic Compass the risk of some of them falling behind schedule or
underdelivering is present. [Nevertheless, besides the obstacles ahead,
the importance of the document for the geopolitical future of the EU
should not be underestimated.]{.underline}

A step in the right direction

[The Strategic Compass is currently a guiding document -- a framework
for transforming the EU, traditionally an economic and, more recently, a
political instrument, to include a stronger security
element.]{.underline} The war in Ukraine has led European countries that
had grappled with balancing military power and welfare systems to now
put more effort into their security capabilities.

If the implementation of the Strategic Compass reflect the impressive
political effort it took to draft it, the EU and its neighboring regions
stand to benefit. During an era in which war has returned to Europe and
traditional geopolitical dynamics are shifting, [the Strategic Compass
has the potential to become a roadmap for the EU's future as a security
provider and markedly contribute to Europe and its neighboring regions'
security and prosperity.]{.underline}

The illegal annexation of [[Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} by Russia in
March 2014 [[marked]{.mark} a crucial moment for European, transatlantic
and international security]{.underline}. **[Acting like [a wake-up
call]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [this event **redefined strategic
and security considerations** in]{.underline} individual EU Member
States, in the United States and in international organisations such as
[the]{.underline} European Union ([EU]{.underline}) and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). [Russia\'s]{.underline}
increasingly [assertive military posture is unsettling]{.underline} for
its European neighbours. Four years ago, in June 2014, US President
Obama announced what was to become a key security guarantee from America
to Europe. The European Reassurance Initiative, as it was called during
the first half of its existence, is a military programme supporting the
activities of the US military and its allies in Europe. In
[20[17]{.mark}]{.underline}, it was renamed the [European Deterrence
Initiative ([EDI]{.mark}) [to reflect the shift]{.mark} in the
international security environment characterised [by a **prioritisation
of deterrence.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Activities under [the EDI [include
training]{.mark}]{.underline} of forces, [[multinational military
exercises and]{.mark} development of military [equipment and
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. They all take place [under
the]{.underline} umbrella of Operation Atlantic Resolve
([OAR]{.underline}) whose core mission is [to enhance
deterrence]{.underline}. **[[Despite]{.mark} recent
[turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}** in transatlantic relations, [[the
budget]{.mark} for building up defences]{.underline} in central and
eastern Europe [through the EDI [has seen **major
increases**]{.mark}**;**]{.underline} even under the Trump
administration. The EDI has deepened security and defence cooperation
between the US and the main beneficiaries of OAR, namely Bulgaria,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania. The US European Command,
which coordinates all EDI and OAR activities, is [working [to **forge
enhanced interoperability**]{.mark} between different countries\'
military forces [through joint training, staff exchanges and
exercises]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The Command\'s
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} also **[[recognises the cyber
domain]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as a pressing area where integration is
needed]{.underline}, although the EDI budget for 2019 makes no mention
of it. [The **recent [proli]{.mark}feration [of EU defence]{.mark}**
[initiatives and the **revamp of EU-NATO relations**
should]{.mark}]{.underline} also [contribute to EDI\'s core
mission]{.underline}: [to [establish]{.mark} a **strong
[deterrence]{.mark} posture** able **[to meet today\'s security
challenges.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In view of the circumstances surrounding the EU, [[**the best solution**
for]{.mark} responding to the [nuclear]{.mark} threat]{.underline} that
Europe faces [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not to use the European nuclear
deterrence approach proposed by France, but [to develop a **cooperative
nuclear posture** through loosely-based cooperation]{.underline}, within
a scope that does not violate the sovereignty of the nuclear
countries(U.S., U.K. and France), [as a part of the
**[strengthening]{.mark}** of [the **current EU-NATO
relationship**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This means a political process in
which the [[items]{.mark} related to nuclear deterrence [will be
added]{.mark} to EU-NATO cooperation]{.underline}, and [[consultations
and coordination]{.mark} on specific nuclear cooperation are [started at
a working-level]{.mark}]{.underline}. Albeit [[in the form of
NATO\'s]{.mark} provision of [**extended nuclear deterrence** to the
EU]{.mark}]{.underline}, [this is a realistic response that [the
EU]{.mark}]{.underline}, with its complicated nuclear issues, [[can
**tolerate** in]{.mark} terms of [strategic
autonomy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In other words, [it is difficult for the European Union to achieve
strategic autonomy in]{.underline} the core part of its [nuclear
deterrence]{.underline} strategy, and **[[the solution is cooperation
with NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Needless to say, NATO is an alliance
centered on the United States, which contradicts the direction of
Europe\'s strategic autonomy. However, I think that realistic decisions
made by the EU, without being swept away by ideals, should be
appreciated from a broader perspective.

\"[Those who]{.mark} deploy violence to [shift borders will]{.mark} do
so **[again]{.mark} and again,\"**]{.underline} German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz said at the end of March. \"And that is why [we must together
**[make ourselves strong]{.mark}** enough [to ensure]{.mark} that [that
doesn't happen.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In response to Putin's aggression, [Scholz]{.mark} has said that his
government intends [to **inject 100 billion euros** into Germany's
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [Foreign Minister]{.underline}
Annalena [Baerbock]{.underline} has [promised [to develop a
**n**]{.mark}**ational [s]{.mark}ecurity
[s]{.mark}trategy**]{.underline} by the end of the year [that reflects
Germany's interests]{.underline}. Berlin, astoundingly, has never before
had such a strategy.

Already, though, it is becoming apparent just how difficult it might be
to come up with a convincing plan for European security. What might
happen if the U.S. was to withdraw from NATO and leave Europe alone with
a dictator who violates all established norms and doesn't even stop at
slaughtering civilians ?

It is a question that American think tanks are currently focusing on
more intently than is the government in Berlin. Once again, it would
seem, the German government's penchant for denying reality is on full
display. \"I found German passivity toward Donald Trump when he was
elected president in 2016 shocking,\" says Max Bergmann of the Center
for American Progress, a think tank in Washington with ties to the
Democratic Party[. \"I [didn\'t]{.mark} quite [understand how]{.mark},
you know, [Europeans]{.mark} would sort of [pretend as if]{.mark}
nothing had changed and if [America was]{.mark} completely
[reliable.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[That could be the case]{.mark} as long [as]{.mark} Joe [Biden
is]{.mark} still [in the]{.mark} White [House]{.mark}. But
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} 79-year-old [[Democrat's approval rating is
**historically low**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and with the November 2024
election rapidly approaching, [the [party doesn't]{.mark} seem to [have
a]{.mark} promising [replacement]{.mark}]{.underline} candidate either.

[Within [the Republican Party,]{.mark} meanwhile, there is a powerful
group that [would prefer]{.mark} to see [the **U.S. turn its back on
NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last Tuesday, [[63 Republicans]{.mark} in
the House of Representatives [voted against a resolution]{.mark}
affirming U.S. support for NATO]{.underline}. One day later, the
pollsters at Pew published a survey according to which [82 percent of
Democratic voters believe that the U.S. benefits from the Western
alliance, but just 55 percent of Republicans agree]{.underline}. It
isn't a completely absurd idea to think that [[Trump could run
an]{.mark} explicitly **[anti-NATO campaign]{.mark}** and that it might
even prove successful]{.underline}, says Michael O'Hanlon, a senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution and a member of the Pentagon's
Defense Policy Board. \"If all these things play out in a bad way, then
I think [[Europe]{.mark} has some very fundamental and difficult
choices]{.underline}, and [one of them [could]{.mark} include the idea
of [develop]{.mark}ing [a **European-wide nuclear
deterrent.\"**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The EU can [jointly]{.underline} contribute to deterrence -- [new]{.underline} efforts can achieve [atomic]{.underline} weapons

It is a diplomatic way of saying that [[Germany must prepare]{.mark} for
a scenario in which the [America]{.mark}ns [can **no longer be relied
on**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Heusgen served Merkel in the Chancellery for
12 years and is one of the most experienced security policy
practitioners in Europe. In summer 2017, half a year after Trump's
inauguration, Heusgen was sent to New York as Germany's ambassador to
the United Nations, and he is now head of the Munich Security
Conference. The time he spent at the UN convinced Heusgen that the old
trans-Atlantic certainties not longer apply. That, too, has motivated
him to speak up.

[[Europeans must]{.mark} be prepared to [do far more for **deterrence
and defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Heusgen says. He views the
[[100-billion]{.mark}-euro spending package [for the German
military]{.mark} to be [an **absolute necessity.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
\"But in addition to that, I believe we should [[begin a **strategic
dialogue** with France]{.underline}]{.mark} [focused [on]{.mark} whether
and [how Europeans can]{.mark} jointly [contribute to]{.mark} a
**[nuclear deterrence against Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One model
could involve [the German government and other **[EU]{.mark} member
states** [contributing **financially** to the French]{.mark} nuclear
weapons program [in return for]{.mark} a say in the planning and
deployment of [French **atomic weapons.\"**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Heusgen would like to see such talks embedded in efforts to [form a
**real political union**]{.mark}]{.underline}, one which would remain [a
partner of the U.S]{.underline}. He is very much aware, after all, that
there have been periodic efforts in Paris to disconnect from the U.S.
And it wasn't all that long ago that French President Emmanuel Macron
described NATO as being \"brain dead\" -- a formulation that many in
Berlin found to be extremely unfortunate. What's the point, after all,
of wantonly bad-mouthing the trans-Atlantic defensive alliance? For
Heusgen, a European nuclear umbrella would in no way be an end in
itself, but rather a kind of insurance policy should NATO become
unreliable.

### 2NC -- AT: France Willpower

#### France will [cooperate]{.underline} with all of Europe -- European security [helps]{.underline} them too

**Bugos '20** \[Shannon; March of 2020; Senior Policy Analyst at the
Arms Control Association, research assistant in the International
Scholars Program at the University of Notre Dame; \"France Offers
Nuclear Deterrent to All Europe,\" Arms Control Association,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2020-03/news/france-offers-nuclear-deterrent-europe>
//smarx, AZG\]

French President Emmanuel [[Macron]{.mark} offered to begin
[**discussing** with]{.mark} other [Europe]{.mark}an countries [the
role]{.mark} that [France's nuclear deterrent can play in **their
collective security.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[France's nuclear forces **"strengthen the security of Europe** through
their **very existence,"**]{.underline} [Macron said]{.underline} at the
military school École de Guerre in Paris on Feb. 7. [[An erosion
of]{.underline}]{.mark} "the comprehensive security framework" that
protects [[Europe affects France]{.underline}]{.mark}'s defense
strategy, he said, [which means]{.underline} that [["France's vital
interests now have **a European dimension."**]{.underline}
[France's]{.underline}]{.mark} [nuclear [deterrence]{.mark} "ensures our
independence]{.underline}, our freedom to assess, make decisions, and
take action. [It [**prevents adversaries** from]{.mark} betting on
[escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}, intimidation, and blackmailing to
achieve their ends," he said before extending the offer.

At the same time, Macron argued that the international community must
limit the role of nuclear deterrence to "extreme circumstances of
self-defense," with the overall goal of preventing war.

"France's nuclear doctrine strictly adheres to this framework," he said.
France currently has about 300 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.

During his address, Macron outlined three "paradigm shifts" underway in
the world. The first he described as strategic, in which "a new
hierarchy of powers" is emerging and bringing with it the heightened
risk of conflict and military escalation due to competition.

The challenging of "a multilateral order based on law" defines the
second paradigm shift, he said, illustrated by the demise of the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last August. (See ACT,
September 2019.) "Europeans must collectively realize today that,
without a legal framework, they could quickly find themselves at risk of
another conventional and even nuclear arms race on their soil," Macron
said. "They cannot stand by."

The final shift involves the emergence of new technologies and their
potential role in conflict. All of these paradigm shifts, he said,
demand that the world think about what the future of war will look like.
Macron suggested that the heads of state of the permanent members of the
UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the
United States) convene in order "to fully discharge \[their\] mandate to
maintain peace and international security" in this changing landscape.

[[Macron presented]{.mark} a four-pillared strategy for
confronting]{.underline} these [paradigm shifts and **achieving
peace**]{.underline}. [The first]{.underline} pillar [he called [the
"promotion of]{.mark} an efficient [multilateralism," to
include]{.mark}]{.underline} an [**[increased investment]{.mark}** in
defense [by Europe]{.mark}an countries]{.underline} and a renewed
international arms control agenda.

Regarding arms control, the president urged Europe to "rethink
disarmament" so that it contributes to international security and
highlighted France's "unique track record in the world," given its
irreversible dismantlement of land-based nuclear weapons, nuclear
testing facilities, and fissile material.

The next two pillars Macron described were [the development of
[strategic alliances focused on]{.mark} promoting peace and [security
and]{.mark} the establishment of **greater [European
autonomy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Macron dubbed national sovereignty as the final pillar, saying, "if
[France]{.mark} is to live up to its ambition and its history, it [must
**remain sovereign."**]{.mark}]{.underline}
