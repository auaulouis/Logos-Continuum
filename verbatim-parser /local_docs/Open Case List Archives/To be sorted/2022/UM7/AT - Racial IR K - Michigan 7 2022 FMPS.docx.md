### Critiquing Western Scholarship Fails

#### Sweeping critiques of Western colonialism [buttress]{.underline} the status quo.

**Vickers, 20**---Professor of Comparative Education at Kyushu
University (Edward, "Critiquing coloniality, 'epistemic violence' and
western hegemony in comparative education -- the dangers of ahistoricism
and positionality," Comparative Education, 56:2, 165-189, dml)
\[gendered language modifications denoted by brackets\]

The central flaw in the argument advanced by the CER authors stems from
an apparent lack of awareness of contemporary scholarship on the
comparative history of imperialism and colonialism. [Criticism of the
Eurocentric assumptions that inform much mainstream social science is
**certainly warranted**, as is critique of the excessive influence
exerted by institutions]{.underline} such as key journals based [in
North America or Europe]{.underline}. [However, when critical arguments
rely on **selective** and **historically flimsy** claims for the
**uniquely colonial quality** of modern Western culture, the risks
are]{.underline} twofold: firstly, and fundamentally, actually [to
**sustain** or **reinforce Eurocentrism** by deflecting the critical
gaze from non-Western societies and the patterns of oppression
('colonial' or otherwise) therein; and]{.underline} secondly, by the
same token [to **weaken** or **discredit** the case for a more inclusive
and culturally sensitive approach to]{.underline} the [comparative
analysis]{.underline} of education.

The empirical and theoretical flaws of this approach are intertwined
with the problematic language in which its arguments are typically
couched. [Historical and anthropological scholarship on East Asia and
other regions **amply demonstrates** that colonialist or neo-colonialist
attitudes and strategies of [domination]{.mark} are **not** and [**have
never been** a Western monopoly]{.mark}. But [decolonial theory]{.mark}
posits the more or less **uniform** victimhood of non-Western 'others,'
deriving claims for the moral superiority of '**authentically**'
indigenous perspectives. **Debating the validity** of such claims [is
**complicated** by]{.mark} an emphasis on '[**positionality**.'
Readers]{.mark} are exhorted to **[judge]{.mark} an [argument]{.mark}**
[less by]{.mark} standards of **[evidence]{.mark}** or **logic** (often
portrayed as camouflaging a Western '**will to power**') [than]{.mark}
on the basis of the writer's]{.underline} self-identification or
[['**positioning**.' The language of '**epistemic
violence**,']{.underline}]{.mark} 'secure spaces,' ['**epistemological
diffidence**,' '**border thinking**' and 'location' [suggests]{.mark} an
image of [the]{.mark} critical [scholar as **revolutionary**]{.mark}
**guerrilla**, **valiantly sniping** at Western hegemony
from]{.underline} his or her [\[their\] marginal redoubt]{.underline}.
In so far as this reflects a desire for a more just, tolerant and
sustainable society -- one that values diversity as a resource for
mutual learning -- it is admirable. However, [if we seek to combat
oppression, in the educational sphere or beyond, [it is
incumbent]{.mark} on us [to **pick**]{.mark} **our [enemies]{.mark}**,
and our **language**, [**carefully**. Aiming a **blunderbuss**
at]{.mark} the supposedly illegitimate or self-serving 'universalism' of
'modern [Western]{.mark} social [science,' while **ignoring**
how]{.mark} calls for indigenisation and ['authenticity']{.mark} are
used to **[legitimate]{.mark} highly [oppressive regimes]{.mark}**
across Asia and elsewhere, is to [risk **undermining**]{.mark} those
universal social and political [values]{.mark}]{.underline} (freedom of
expression, civil liberties, rule of law) [[upon which]{.mark}
**critical [scholars]{.mark} themselves [rely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[An [embrace of]{.mark} '**opacity**' or '[**epistemological
diffidence**,']{.mark}]{.underline} advocated by several of the CER
contributors, [[threatens to be]{.mark} **similarly
[self-defeating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While they share an admiration
for the Argentine theorist of 'decoloniality,' Walter Mignolo, the work
of his brilliant compatriot, the writer, poet and essayist Jorge Luis
Borges, is far worthier of attention. Borges' famous fondness for
'labyrinths' and the paradoxical was combined with a sharp eye for
gratuitous obfuscation and circumlocution (see, for example, his story
The Aleph, in Borges 1998, 274--286). Offering his own critique of the
fashion for opaque jargon in mainstream social science, the émigré
Polish sociologist Stanislav Andreski wrote acerbically that 'one of the
pleasures obtainable through recourse to confusion and absurdity is to
be able to feel, and publicly to claim, that one knows when in reality
one does not' (1974, 95). ['Opacity']{.underline} in imaginative
literature [may **intrigue** or **entertain**, but in **interpreting**
and **explaining**]{.underline} unfamiliar societies, cultures and
education [systems]{.underline}, [comparativists especially ought to
write in **clear**, **accessible language**. And while all social
scientists can understand the lure of the **sweeping generalisation**,
we should generalise with **extreme caution**, especially when
categorising large swathes of humanity]{.underline}.

Borges' earliest collection of stories is entitled A Universal History
of Iniquity. This appeared in 1935, when there were already rumblings in
both East and West of the conflict that would soon engulf Eurasia.
Implied in his title was a truth painfully obvious to many
contemporaries: that iniquity is indeed universal. The conflicts of the
mid-twentieth century starkly illuminated another truth: that iniquity
in the modern world, especially (though not only) that associated with
totalitarian societies, often consists in essentialising and
de-humanising 'the other'. Hannah Arendt -- a thoroughly Eurocentric
thinker, but one who addressed, in 'totalitarianism,' a theme with
global ramifications -- wrote of how, through 'the murder of the moral
person in man,' totalitarian systems transform their citizens into
'living corpses' capable of any outrage (2017, 591). But ironically,
[[in]{.mark} the **very act of [attacking essentialism]{.mark}** as
applied to 'non-Western' cultures]{.underline}, the CER
[[contributors]{.mark} propagate an **[essentialise]{.mark}d view** of
'[the West']{.mark} itself. Iniquity in the form of [coloniality
is]{.mark}]{.underline} in their account [[attributed **solely** to
West]{.mark}ern modernity. [This]{.mark} view [is]{.mark} both
[**inaccurate** and **dangerous**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The irony]{.underline} in this approach [extends to the attribution of
**agency**. [Claims to champion the]{.mark} dignity of
[subaltern]{.mark}, 'non-Western' actors [are]{.mark} in fact
[**undermined** by assertions of]{.mark} their **uniform
[victimhood]{.mark}**. This **reproduces** the very Eurocentrism that
'decolonial' scholars quite rightly seek to challenge]{.underline}. In
fact, [privilege and victimhood have **many dimensions**, **[by no
means]{.mark} all [traceable]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the '**phenomenon of
colossal vagueness**' that is [colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Osterhammel 2005, 4). [One group or individual can plausibly be
portrayed as **victim**, or **perpetrator**, or **both**, depending on
**context** and **perspective**. Were post-war German civilian refugees
from Eastern Europe, or Japanese civilians fleeing Manchuria, victims or
perpetrators?]{.underline} Or today, is a privately-educated,
English-speaking, upper-caste South Asian scholar more accurately to be
seen as privileged or under-privileged, in terms of access to power
('epistemic' or otherwise) within South Asia or the global academy?
['Location' or identity are **not reducible** to neat labels or discrete
categories]{.underline}. As the Anglo-Ghanaian philosopher Kwame Anthony
Appiah emphasises, [according dignity and agency involves recognising
that our identities are not just **socially given**, but also **actively
chosen**]{.underline}. Culture is 'a process you join, in living a life
with others,' and 'the values that European humanists like to espouse
belong as much to an African or an Asian who takes them up with
enthusiasm as to a European' (2018, 211). [The same applies with respect
to value systems we have reason to regard as **iniquitous**, such as
those associated with **colonialism** or **neoliberalism**]{.underline}.

What, then, are we to make of the traction that totalising
anti-Westernism appears to be gaining within the CIE field? On one
level, this may tell us more about the state of campus politics, and
politics in general, across contemporary America and the broader
'Anglosphere', than about the wider world. The worldview that the CER
contributors espouse, even as they strain at the shackles of Western
epistemology, is redolent of America's peculiarly racialised identity
politics. And [notwithstanding claims to marginal positionality,
[the]{.mark} **increasingly widespread [currency]{.mark}** [of such
arguments]{.mark}]{.underline} in North American and Anglophone CIE
circles [reflects their status as an emergent orthodoxy that in key
respects **[mirrors]{.mark}** the very [ethnocentrism]{.mark} it
rejects]{.underline}.

[Although the ideas]{.underline} in the CER special issue [are presented
as **challenging** both the scholarly mainstream and a wider neoliberal
or neocolonial establishment, the seriousness of this challenge is
**doubtful**. [Exhortations to]{.mark} embrace '**opacity**' or to
['**think otherwise**']{.mark} in the name of 'contesting coloniality'
imply **no coherent programme**, and [suggest a]{.mark}n
**overwhelmingly [negative agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[**far** from risking ostracism, the contributors can expect **warm
endorsement** of their views from regulars at]{.underline} the major
international [conferences. For many]{.underline} in the CIE community
in North America and beyond, [sweeping critiques of Western 'hegemony',
'coloniality' and so forth hold a **strong appeal**; it is those seeking
to **question** the balance or accuracy of such theorising who risk
**opprobrium**]{.underline}. As Merquior wrote of Foucault, Derrida and
their postmodernist or 'deconstructivist' followers, their 'skepsis',
'highly placed in the core institutions of the culture it so strives to
undermine,' has come to constitute an 'official marginality' (1991,
160).

[The]{.underline} potential -- and actual -- [consequences]{.underline}
of this [are **troubling**]{.underline}. Takayama et al call for the
WCCES in particular to embrace the agenda of '[contesting
coloniality]{.underline},' but one conclusion to be drawn from recent
events is that this [is **already happening**, with **damaging
consequences**]{.underline} for civility within the Comparative
Education field, and [for the **wider credibility** of]{.underline} its
[scholarly output]{.underline}.15 [[Reducing scholarship to]{.mark} the
projection of the scholar's own [positionality]{.mark} can only [lead to
**fragmentation** and **irrelevance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To quote
Merquior again (paraphrasing Hilary Putnam), '[[to **demote
rationality**]{.mark}, in a relativist way, to a mere concoction of a
given historical culture [is]{.mark} as **[reductionist]{.mark}** as the
logical positivist's reduction of reason to scientific
calculus]{.underline}' (160). What he calls the 'Elixir of Pure
[[Negation]{.underline}']{.mark} (159) is an intoxicating brew, but it
[[is **unlikely to**]{.mark} **inspire coherent** or **constructive
contributions** to [addres]{.mark}sing the pressing problems of our age:
**[climate]{.mark} change**, [**poverty**, **inequality** and]{.mark}
the **ethical [crisis]{.mark}** that underpins them all]{.underline}.

Indeed, [[it]{.mark} is **very likely to [do the opposite]{.mark}**. The
**neoliberal cadres** of the OECD or World Bank, along with
**nationalist autocrats** from Beijing to Budapest, will be **more than
happy** for 'critical scholars' to fulminate against a
**vaguely-defined** 'West' while embracing 'epistemological
diffidence']{.underline} (Takayama, Sriprakash, and Connell 2017, S18).
As one critic of 'postmodernism' has put it, [the promotion of
'**epistemological pluralism**,' combined with **rejection** of any
'**settled external viewpoint**,' means that, 'so far as **real-life
ongoing politics** is concerned,']{.underline} postmodernists, along
with de-constructivists, [[decolonialists]{.underline}]{.mark} and their
ilk, [[tend to be]{.mark} '**passively [conservative]{.mark}** in
effect']{.underline} (Butler 2002, 61). If 'decoloniality' promotes a
balkanisation of the Comparative Education field into identitybased
cliques that prize 'opacity,' [the risk is that [in practice]{.mark}
this will only serve [to **buttress the s**]{.mark}**tatus
[quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### IR Good\-\--Long

#### \*\*\*Note while prepping: the un-underlined part of this cites Henry Kissinger, who is not the most savory character. The neg may point this out. However, Ettinger (in my opinion) isn't endorsing Kissinger, just quoting him to say that IR education matters, so if evil war criminals think IR research is important, that\'s a reason we should learn how it works!

#### Researching and debating IR teaches [critical inquiry]{.underline} that spills out [beyond the classroom]{.underline}---it's [not]{.underline} inevitably elitist or Eurocentric.

**Ettinger, 20**---Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science,
Carleton University (Aaron, "Scattered and Unsystematic: The Taught
Discipline in the Intellectual Life of International Relations,"
International Studies Perspectives (2020) 0, 1--24, dml)

[The [first benefit is]{.mark}]{.underline} generating [a **well-trained
[pipeline]{.mark}** [of future IR scholars and practitioners]{.mark}.
Today's students are the [**scholars** and **practitioners of
tomorrow**]{.mark}, and sparking **curiosity** in students, especially
**[undergraduates]{.mark}**, has the potential to **[rejuvenate]{.mark}
the [field]{.mark}** [from within]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Hagmann and
Biersteker (2014, 292--293) argue[, [IR scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}
[should "[take]{.mark} a **more [direct interest]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} how world politics is explained to [[students
in everyday schooling practices]{.underline}]{.mark}." This is eminently
sensible. International relations' [[preoccupation]{.mark}
with]{.underline} "the cult of research intensivity" (Nossal 2006, 737),
and to a lesser extent [[political practice]{.underline},
**[misleads]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the [professoriate]{.mark} into
believing that the very people who sustain universities as institutions
and who are the future of the discipline---[student]{.mark}
subscribers---[can be **ignored**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
has]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[led the IR professoriate to
**undervalue**]{.underline}]{.mark} the contribution that the taught
discipline makes to disciplinary renewal through [the [**training**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline} [next
[generation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[For future practitioners, whether in **government** or **elsewhere**,
an [IR education provides]{.mark} the [**conceptual architecture**
needed to **make decisions**]{.mark} about policy and its place in the
world]{.underline}. In his memoirs, Henry Kissinger emphasizes this
point: "The convictions that leaders have formed before reaching high
office are the intellectual capital they will consume as long as they
continue in office. There is little time for leaders to reflect" (as
quoted in Desch 2019, 153). While Kissinger is talking about the highest
level of elected office, it is equally true that [policymakers
throughout government come in equipped with the **intellectual capital**
and **technical skills** learned in the classroom]{.underline} (Biswas
and Paczynska 2015). [For future scholars, early lessons have
**downstream effects** on the very content of IR knowledge]{.underline}.
After all, [the [classroom is where IR theory gets reproduced "**for the
first time**" to future generations of IR scholars]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As Newsom (1995, 64--65) put [it]{.underline}, "\[t\]eachers [**[plant
the seeds]{.mark}** that shape the thinking of each new generation; this
is]{.underline} probably [the academic world's **most lasting
[contribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}[."]{.mark} [It is also a place
where the durability and centrality of the field's major theories are
reinforced as a matter of course and **not necessarily for the
better**]{.underline} (Vitalis 2015, 6). [Early undergraduates **carry**
the assumptions they are taught **throughout** their undergraduate and
graduate careers, and **beyond**. A [discipline that **cannot connect**
with students]{.mark} or is inward-looking and esoteric risks **pu[tting
off]{.mark}** [its next generation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [the
classroom needs to be treated with **greater regard** as a site of
**knowledge production** and **dissemination** in the intellectual life
of the field]{.underline}. In this sense, [curiosity can be provoked
among students that may continue **beyond** an undergraduate
career]{.underline}. Take, for example, the observation of one student
on her intellectual awakening in the classroom:

Despite a Eurocentric and male-dominated ethos, what ultimately
convinced me to stay in IR was my exposure and inability to detach from
what was first described to me as the politics of the "postcolonial." A
lecturer holding up a roughened paperback copy of Edward Said's 1979
acclaimed work Orientalism originally introduced me to
postcolonialism...Hearing Said's words being reiterated back to me in my
predominately white and conservative-leaning lecture theater was a
defining moment in my education. Orientalism provided an experience that
I could finally connect with: one where political power was not about
who had the most weaponry or democracy, but instead about who held
political control over the reality of the racialized person (Abu-Bakare
2017).

The moment captured in this tableau is the [[intellectual
awakening]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[is possible]{.mark}
when]{.underline} pedagogy is carefully considered. From [the
student]{.underline} perspective, well-taught courses
**[prepare]{.underline}** them better [for the next stage in their
education, [starting with **superior foundational
training**]{.mark}]{.underline} at the early undergraduate levels [and
[progressing to **improved research capabilities** and **substantive
knowledg**]{.mark}**e**]{.underline} at the higher undergraduate levels,
and then to advanced skills training in graduate school. [Well-trained
cohorts]{.underline} coming up the ranks [will be **highly proficient**
in a **wider range** of IR topics, theories, ideas, and methods and will
be **well prepared** to make the jump to fluency]{.underline}.
Similarly, [future practitioners will be equipped with **superior
substantive** and **technical training**]{.underline}. This is
especially true with "experiential learning." Done in purposeful ways,
learning through experiences outside the classroom generates employable
skills for students.

Social and Institutional Context of Teaching and Disciplinary
Reproduction

Directly related to the question of the future of international
relations is the social context of teaching and the discipline's
reproduction in the classroom. IR [scholars must recognize that the [IR
classroom is the site of **ideational preferences**]{.mark}, clashes of
**favored** or **disfavored paradigms**, of **personal
authority**]{.underline}, generational difference, [**social
privileges**, and **prejudices**. At **every point** in]{.underline}
professional [i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [there
are implications for how knowledge is **produced**, **taught**, and
**passed on**]{.underline} (Ettinger 2016; Colgan 2017; Fattore 2018;
Knight 2019). Indeed, [the intellectual output of IR scholars does not
exist independent of the **lived context** in which it is
produced]{.underline}. Gaining insight into the social context of
international relations' taught discipline can help begin to correct the
pathologies that are affecting the way the next generation of IR
scholars are being taught right now and how future scholars and
practitioners will be taught next year and beyond.

It begins by addressing the social identity of the instructor and how it
contributes to the reproduction of IR knowledge. After all, the
instructor does not speak from a position of nowhere and an account of
IR pedagogy should address the personal features of the instructor, her
place within the discipline's division of labor, and its effect on the
delivery of course content (Biswas and Deylami 2017). For international
relations especially, it is the site of entrenched male and
Euro-Atlantic dominance with cascading implications within the classroom
and beyond. The 2014 TRIP survey shows that the global IR professorate
is two-thirds male (Maliniak et al. 2014). In the United States and
British IR "core" and in the Anglo "noncore" (Cox and Nossal 2009), the
professoriate is overwhelmingly white and male. Australia is 72.11
percent male and 76.87 percent white. Canada is 70.83 percent male and
83.4 percent white. The United Kingdom is 64.83 percent male and 85.23
percent white, while the United States is 68.33 percent male and 85.21
percent white non-Hispanic. New Zealand, a slight outlier, is 81.82
percent male but only 34.78 percent identifying as NZ European (Maliniak
et al. 2014). Given what has been shown about the American dominance of
the discipline, the insularity of national IR communities, and the
gender gap in citations, it is reasonable to conclude that the bulk of
the most influential IR scholarship is produced and disseminated by
white men in the West (Maliniak et al. 2018; Maliniak et al 2013).

Understanding this relationship can improve IR pedagogy by recognizing
how diverse student populations interact with an overwhelmingly white
Euro-Atlantic intellectual tradition and by remedying some of the
attending limitations such as geohistorical narrowness, state-centrism,
epistemological positivism, and phallocentric authorship (Fonseca 2019).
In this regard, the taught discipline of international relations should
be intellectually responsive to a diversifying discipline and to a
diversifying student population. Such circumstances call for a broader
approach to teaching courses in a field whose heavy Euro-American
centrality can alienate students when their backgrounds are not
reflected in the course material. This is not simply a matter of
curriculum design that tries to mirror or "look like" the students
(Appiah 2019, SR7). Rather, it is one that balances disciplinary
foundations with broadened ontological scope of what "matters" in IR in
order to generate betterinformed teaching. It is widely recognized that
international relations is a very traditional field of scholarship, but
this should not preclude perspectives beyond the canon or case studies
from outside the empirical mainstream. More ambitious and, especially,
diverse content helps adapt teaching to changing student audiences. This
is especially true at the undergraduate level. What is important to
avoid is the "pipeline problem" that has discouraged women and
minorities from progressing through the scholarly ranks in STEM fields
(Brown et al. 2016; Branch 2016). By the same token, bringing more and
more diverse young students into the discipline of international
relations and encouraging their growth can bear intellectual fruit down
the line. At very least, we avoid artificially restricting the
development of the next generation of scholars.

[By [**no means** is this a call to **jettison** the
classics]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the contrary, [[the field's canon is
**irreplaceable** as a foundation, as the **intellectual inheritance**
of the present, as the **prevailing ideas** of foreign policymakers,
and]{.mark} as **points of [disagreement]{.mark}** for critical
traditions]{.underline}. However, [the scope of IR pedagogy can be
**[expanded]{.mark}**]{.underline} to make it relevant for a
twenty-first century classroom. Primarily, this means expanding the
theoretical and empirical scope of international relations
[**[beyond]{.mark}** its traditional **Eurocentric** and
[**male-dominated** parameters]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Acharya
2016). This is discussed below. Granted, there will be no singular
population to which an IR curriculum will be pitched. Variation in
student population profiles based on race, gender, class, geography, and
other identity markers complicate the decisions that an instructor has
to make. The point is that there are intellectual gains to be had when
the taught discipline takes seriously the social context of
international relations' disciplinary reproduction. With a more diverse
pedagogy in place, it is possible that, with more eyes on the subject
matter and more minds from different backgrounds at work, [the IR
classroom can generate greater interest in **fundamental theoretical
questions** for the next generation of scholars to solve]{.underline}.

Institutional context of teaching matters too. The vast majority of IR
practice takes place in university institutions. Therefore, the material
institutional setting must enter in as a condition of international
relations' intellectual life. Consider first, the matter of basic
institutional survival. In an era where public universities around the
world face funding problems, there are immediate economic imperatives
for taking the taught discipline of international relations seriously.
In the short term, survival in unforgiving economic times requires
student enrollment and retention (Conley 2019). Systematic accounts of
US undergraduate enrollment since the Great Recession of 2008 show
majors in the "traditional disciplines" declining by 21 percent
(philosophy) to 30 percent (history). Political science and
international relations fare less badly, declining "only" by 11 percent
and 15 percent over ten years (Schmidt 2018). Put differently, the
classroom is on the front line in the battle for resources. Student
recruitment and retention are essential to the economic viability of
academic departments including political science and international
relations. Turning students off the subject matter through an
unreflexive pedagogy, boring classes, or mediocre lecturers has real
economic implications for the future. Without students prepared to part
with tuition dollars, or governments prepared to unlock activity-based
funding, no department can thrive, even with a roster of productive
researchers. Concretely, this means no new hiring and reduced budgets---
a recipe for contraction. In this context, the systematic neglect of the
classroom by IR stocktakers is entirely inexplicable given the parlous
financial state of most public universities. Trends in expanded
enrollment compound or create new problems. Universities that pack
classrooms with hundreds, if not thousands, of more students---many of
whom are international and pay exorbitant tuition fees---put revenue
generation above pedagogy (Schulmann 2019).

The disciplinary division of university labor must be factored into an
understanding of the context of IR teaching and its implications for the
intellectual life of international relations. In this sense, debate
about the taught discipline must grapple with question of resources,
division of university labor, teaching assignments, pressures of the
tenure track, the precarity of contract faculty, and other aspects of
university governance as conditions that influence the classroom. One of
the most striking trends in university governance is the increasing role
of contingent instructors. In the United States, some 73 percent of
instructional positions were nontenure track in 2016 (AAUP 2018). This
is consistent with longer-term trends. The percentage of postsecondary
instructional positions filled by contingent faculty increased from 57.6
percent in 1995 to 71.6 percent in 2011. In that time, the number of
full-time tenure-track positions increased by 10 percent while the
number of full- or part-time contingent positions doubled (GAO 2017,
8--9). This is not to say that contingent faculty are worse teachers,
but the contingent nature of the work creates impediments to teaching.
Fewer institutional resources, the constant need to reapply for jobs,
and the need for part-time work outside the university are all matters
that detract from time dedicated to students, improving pedagogy, or
learning new content. Downstream, the design of an IR class or the
delivery of an IR curriculum may not be nearly as effective as it could
be.

Intellectual Reflection and Renewal from the Inside Out

Taking teaching seriously as part of [the intellectual life of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [can]{.underline}
lead to intellectual renewal and self-reflection for individual
professors and for the discipline as a whole. At the individual level,
teaching has the ability to [catalyze an **intellectual
renewal**]{.underline} in the mind of the individual professor. [The
intellectual challenges of the classroom can provoke **[new avenues of
research]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the instructor. [The classroom is a
**much more permissive intellectual environment** than academic
publishing. It affords]{.underline} the professor [a degree of freedom
to **explore topics**, **ideas**, and **arguments**, outside of their
research expertise. Making use of the opportunity to teach beyond one's
[comfort zone permits **thinking out loud**, **working through ideas**,
and **entanglement in analytical puzzles**. Doing so is demanding, and
it is much easier to fall back on existing]{.mark}]{.underline} teaching
[[content]{.mark}. But an ambitious]{.underline} teaching [agenda can
lead to **new research questions**, **new** and **unexpected
intellectual horizons**, and **better background context** for existing
expertise]{.underline}. Indeed, there is truth to the aphorism that
there is no better way to learn than to teach.

[This kind of renewal turns on the "**eureka**" moment when research
ideas **flows directly** from classroom activities]{.underline}. A more
systematic approach to renewal that is less reliant on serendipity
begins by asking discipline-wide questions. The first is this: what is
the purpose of teaching international relations? It is a variation on a
core concern to the discipline and one that remains unresolved (Dyvik,
Wilkinson, and Selby 2017)? Is it for disciplinary self-reproduction, to
train future practitioners, or more broadly, citizens and knowledge
workers in the twenty-first century economy (Darling and Foster 2012;
Szarejko and Carnes 2018; Zartner et al. 2018)? [Arriving at an official
"purpose" for i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is
probably **pointless**]{.underline}, and it is best left to the
decentralized community of scholars to decide. IR scholars have debated
this question widely within the published discipline but far less so in
the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of
options betrays a lack of focus that is symptomatic of the wider field
(Albert 2010). However, [this permissive intellectual environment is
beneficial for **wide-ranging intellectual pursuits**, **teaching
styles**, and **pedagogical agendas**]{.underline}. [It
**may**]{.underline}, though, [come at the cost]{.underline}. The
institutional underpinnings [of]{.underline} the discipline---faculty
administrators, editorial boards, funding agencies, hiring committees,
and so on--- may end up doing as much to shape the boundaries of the
discipline as the substantive output (Albert and Buzan 2017, 908). The
alternative, though, is subjecting intellectual and academic freedom to
[an **institutionalized orthodoxy**]{.underline}. In teaching,
decentralization may be intellectually permissive but may come at the
expense of disciplinary coherence.

[This concern]{.underline}, though, [may be **overstated**]{.underline}.
TRIP **[data]{.underline}** on curriculum design [gives an indication of
the **competing** and sometimes **overlapping pedagogical
priorities**]{.underline} among the IR professoriate. In a question on
introduction to IR classes, respondents were asked whether their
introductory courses are designed more to introduce IR scholarship
within the discipline or to prepare students to be informed about
foreign policy and international issues. The result favors a mix of both
with 80.83 percent incorporating scholarship and issues in some balance.
The remaining 19.17 percent come down in favor of one to the exclusion
of the other. At the master's level, the ratio is a bit narrower (73 to
27 percent) but still overwhelmingly embraces a mixture of academic
scholarship and international issues (Maliniak et al. 2014). Respondents
are a bit more divided on what undergraduate courses should be mandatory
in an IR program. They overwhelmingly agree (73.25 percent) that IR
theory should be a required subject. However, they differ on other
options. The next most popular candidates for a required course are
international/global political economy (45.37 percent), international
security (38.87 percent), and research methods (35.22 percent), followed
by international organizations (27.59 percent), comparative foreign
policy (22.86 percent), home country foreign policy (19.95 percent),
international law (19.85 percent), diplomatic history (19.11 percent),
and international economics (15.17 percent) (Maliniak et al. 2014). The
point is that [resolving what IR teaching is supposed to accomplish is
**hardly settled**]{.underline}, but there is some convergence on
certain issues.

So, [what]{.underline} then, [is the purpose of teaching
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations? Ultimately, it is up
to the individual instructor to answer and to enact a program
accordingly. But [[it is up to the community of scholars to
**debate**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It may well be that the enormous
variation in the purpose of teaching international relations and the
radical decentralization is an inescapable feature of the taught
discipline. [[Though IR teaching may be **wildly
divergent**]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world, [there [is **always
some purpose**]{.mark} to it, and]{.underline}, however defined, [this
is an **intrinsic feature** of an i]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [education]{.underline}. Here, Cox's (1981, 128)
famous admonition that "[theory is **always for someone** and **for some
purpose**]{.underline}" serves as the anchor concept for
[such]{.underline} pedagogical [framing]{.underline}. It [frames IR
theories as **political things** and **not just abstractions** to be
memorized or an **[analytical template]{.mark}** to be applied
uncritically]{.underline}. Similarly, [it [helps to **frame thematic**
and **empirical**]{.mark} **cases** in the classroom]{.underline} so
that course material is not merely a reflection the professor's
unexamined preference. In the classroom, it is up to the professor to
articulate. Beyond the classroom in administrative meetings, academic
conferences, and in print, it is up to the field to debate.

The next question asks what is the proper scope of IR teaching? This
question has also been asked before of the field but not directly about
the IR classroom (Albert and Buzan 2017, 898). The answer to this
question connects different themes of this article: intellectual
rejuvenation and disciplinary renewal, diversity, and the future of
international relations as an intellectual project. In substance and in
design, [the scope of IR teaching should [**embrace pluralism** in
paradigm, empirical remit]{.mark}, and criticism]{.underline}. A great
deal has been made of pluralism in international relations (Levine and
McCourt 2018; Eun 2016), but pluralism in the taught discipline is far
different from pluralism in the published discipline, where differences
accrue over the merits of accumulation and diversity. Here, [the scope
of possibility in the classroom is **far more intellectually
permissive**. Teaching international relations can be **theoretically**
and **empirically promiscuous**]{.underline}. It can respect the canon,
its inner logic, and its external life, as well as contemporary
alternatives (Ferguson 2015). [This]{.underline} is an "integrative
pluralism" (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416) that [embraces diversity
as a means of "providing **more comprehensive** and **multidimensional
accounts** of complex phenomena" and a pedagogical engagement with the
world that includes, but **hardly limited** to the Euro-Atlantic
theater, that has dominated]{.underline} generations of [IR
thinking]{.underline} (Dunne, Hansen, and Wight 2013, 416).

Pedagogical pluralism in international relations flows from intuitions
about balancing theory and empirics, the canon and its alternatives,
being current while eschewing presentism, being "useful" without being
instrumentalist, and drawing on instructor expertise without being
constrained by the hyperspecialized knowledge attendant to the published
discipline. Of course, this is easy to say. But operationalizing these
intuitions into a pluralistic teaching program is much more difficult.
Complicating the matter is the relative absence of explicit theoretical
guidance for making IR pluralism work in the classroom. The insights of
proponents of a "Global IR" can help, including some critiqued above for
their neglect of the classroom. In particular, Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 300--308) program for developing a Global IR provides concrete
steps toward curriculum design as much as is does for research.

Regarding the IR theoretical parts of their program, Acharya and Buzan
(2019, 301) say that Global IR respects existing theories while "giving
due recognition to the places, roles, and contributions of non-Western
peoples and societies," which entails "pluralization within theories,
rather than just between them." There are issues here. First,
[[pluralization between theories requires **expanding the remit** of IR
theory beyond]{.mark} the grand [IR paradigms to include **non-Western
contributions**]{.mark}]{.underline} to international thought (Acharya
and Buzan 2010; Acharya 2011). [But this is not easy]{.underline}.
Tickner and Wæver (2009) make it clear that [Anglo-American IR looms
impossibly large around the world. Without jettisoning this intellectual
inheritance]{.underline}, Thinking International Relations Differently
(Tickner and Blaney 2012) provides a route to [pluralism]{.underline}.
That volume [**interrogates alternative meanings** to some of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elation[s']{.underline}
[central concepts]{.underline}---security, state, sovereignty and
authority, globalization, secularism, religion, and the international. A
professor committed to [this kind of [pluralism]{.mark} can
**[expand]{.mark} the conceptual [vocabulary]{.mark}** of international
relations in a way that **encourages**]{.underline} undergraduate
[**conversancy** in multiple IR vernaculars **within** and **beyond**
the Anglo-American core]{.underline}.

[There is also the matter of what do with the **existing**,
**Western-centric canon**]{.underline}. Acharya and Buzan (2019, 301)
also say that [a global international relations would **subsume** rather
than **supplant** existing IR theories and methods. The purpose here is
**not to displace** Western-dominated IR knowledge but to **situate** it
within the global context]{.underline}. This is an entirely attainable
objective for an IR theory instructor. IR teachers should have full
command of some IR theories while being conversant in nearly all anyway.
[Integrating a fuller slate of intellectual content into teaching IR
theory permits]{.underline} a **[cognitive pluralism]{.underline}** that
is rarely available in the published discipline. The point here is that
teaching narrowly and to the expertise of professors may suit their
interests, but it puts blinders on the students. Upper-year and graduate
studies can explore specific pathways, but only after international
relations' map has been presented. This likely means instructors must
venture out of their preferred intellectual comfort zones and teach to
their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Doing so, however, requires
breaking through disciplinary walls and should not be underestimated. It
requires breadth of knowledge, disciplinary literacy beyond the
scholar's training, and language skills (usually beyond English) that
can take many years to develop, while the imperatives of the published
discipline stress specialization.

Regarding the empirical subject matter, a pluralistic IR agenda would
ground its empirics in world history rather than just Western history
(Acharya and Buzan 2019, 301) This is demanding on an instructor whose
subject-matter expertise will be narrow (by dint of academic training)
and whose time will be short given other professional and personal
commitments. Without considerable effort, this is more of an ideal than
a reality. But a good start would be to follow Acharya and Buzan's
(2019, 303) admonition to integrate the study of regions, regionalism,
and area studies into the curriculum. In particular, this means offering
case studies, examples, and illustrations drawn from parts of the world
outside the Euro-Atlantic zone. To this we can add Buzan and Lawson's
(2015) case for expanding the temporal remit of international relations
to the nineteenth century. This would break free of the apocryphal
founding myths (Carvalho, Leira, and Hobson 2011) and temporal myopia of
the orthodox discipline (Buzan and Lawson 2014) in order to draw upon a
richer and more global context for the emergence of the modern world. A
worldly curriculum will likely begin rather thin, but over time become
much deeper and more inclusive. Perhaps [more attainable in the
short-term is a [pluralistic pedagogy that recognizes **multiple forms
of agency**]{.mark} beyond the state and material power.
Such]{.underline} an approach would entail [a pedagogy]{.underline}
addressing a diverse constellation of actors in world politics that
[offers a faithful representation of an overwhelmingly complex
environment **without reducing it** exclusively to a handful of Western
powers]{.underline}.

### IR Good\-\--Short

#### Researching and debating IR teaches [critical inquiry]{.underline} that spills out [beyond the classroom]{.underline}---it's [not]{.underline} inevitably colonial.

**Ettinger, 20**---Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science,
Carleton University (Aaron, "Scattered and Unsystematic: The Taught
Discipline in the Intellectual Life of International Relations,"
International Studies Perspectives (2020) 0, 1--24, dml)

Taking teaching seriously as part of [the intellectual life of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [can]{.underline}
lead to intellectual renewal and self-reflection for individual
professors and for the discipline as a whole. At the individual level,
teaching has the ability to [catalyze an **intellectual
renewal**]{.underline} in the mind of the individual professor. [The
intellectual challenges of the classroom can provoke **new avenues of
research**]{.underline} for the instructor. [The classroom is a **much
more permissive intellectual environment** than academic publishing. It
affords]{.underline} the professor [a degree of freedom to **explore
topics**, **ideas**, and **arguments**, outside of their research
expertise. Making use of the opportunity to teach beyond one's comfort
zone permits **thinking out loud**, **working through ideas**, and
**entanglement in analytical puzzles**. Doing so is demanding, and it is
much easier to fall back on existing]{.underline} teaching [content. But
an ambitious]{.underline} teaching [agenda can lead to **new research
questions**, **new** and **unexpected intellectual horizons**, and
**better background context** for existing expertise]{.underline}.
Indeed, there is truth to the aphorism that there is no better way to
learn than to teach.

[This kind of renewal turns on the "**eureka**" moment when research
ideas **flows directly** from classroom activities]{.underline}. A more
systematic approach to renewal that is less reliant on serendipity
begins by asking discipline-wide questions. The first is this: what is
the purpose of teaching international relations? It is a variation on a
core concern to the discipline and one that remains unresolved (Dyvik,
Wilkinson, and Selby 2017)? Is it for disciplinary self-reproduction, to
train future practitioners, or more broadly, citizens and knowledge
workers in the twenty-first century economy (Darling and Foster 2012;
Szarejko and Carnes 2018; Zartner et al. 2018)? [Arriving at an official
"purpose" for i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations [is
probably **pointless**]{.underline}, and it is best left to the
decentralized community of scholars to decide. IR scholars have debated
this question widely within the published discipline but far less so in
the taught discipline. This is a shame because the answers matter for
the nature of the design of individual courses and entire degree
programs.

Just like the published discipline, the taught discipline is radically
decentralized in universities around the world, subnational variations,
department-level programs, and individual scholar's preferences. Thus,
it is incumbent on individual professors to give an answer in their own
teaching programs. At the individual level, answering the question about
the purpose of teaching international relations should outfit students
with an answer to what they are about to encounter and why this topic,
course, or degree program is worth pursuing. Students, especially early
undergraduate students, need to know why they are about to be presented
with the complicated theory and obscure events that are core (or
peripheral) to [the IR discipline]{.underline}. Answers are generously
supplied in the introduction chapters to IR textbooks but the suite of

### Integrative Pluralism

#### Judge the debate through a lens of [integrative pluralism]{.underline}---putting theories into conversation through [evidence comparison]{.underline} and the [burden of rejoinder]{.underline} opens space for marginalized perspectives. Centering debate on the explanatory power of competing worldviews [reinforces academic exclusion]{.underline}.

**Wight, 19**---Professor and Chair of Government and International
Relations in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the
University of Sydney, Australia (Colin, "Bringing the outside in: The
limits of theoretical fragmentation and pluralism in IR theory,"
Politics, Vol 39, Issue 1, 2019, dml)

[Pluralism for the sake of pluralism seems]{.underline} to lead to an
incapacitating relativism, or what Yosef Lapid (2003) calls a
'**[flabby]{.underline}** pluralism'. A better term might be disengaged
pluralism. [[**No claim** or **viewpoint** would]{.mark} seem to [be
**invalid**, and theorists]{.mark} are free to [pursue their own agenda
with]{.mark} **little** or **[no contact]{.mark} with alternative
views**. This is [a **disengaged pluralism**]{.mark} because there is
**no attempt to specify the relationships between theories** or to
**examine one's own theoretical position** in the light of alternative
views. The absence of an agreed unity of method would also entail that
the **standards** by which the various theories are to be **judged**
[would be **internal**]{.mark} **to the theory**]{.underline} (Jackson,
2011; Smith, 2004). [This would be a disengaged form of pluralism with
each theoretical perspective [legitimating]{.mark} its claims **[solely
on its own terms]{.mark}** and with **little reason to engage in
conversations with alternative approaches**. It is the kind of pluralism
that finds its political expression in **apartheid**]{.underline}.
Despite the intense theoretical debate that followed the 'third debate'
(Waever's 'fourth'), IR now seems to have settled into an uneasy truce
based on theoretical pluralism/fragmentation. Indeed, in some respects,
the validity of the 'ism's' themselves have been called into question
(Lake, 2013). **[Analytical eclecticism]{.underline}** (Sil and
Katzenstein, 2010) [now seems to be the **mantra of the day**. The
[question]{.mark} remains as to [whether we]{.mark} **simply [embrace
this fragmentation]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} attempt to [work towards
a]{.mark} **more [coherent view]{.mark}** [of global
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}. My own view is that [we
should]{.underline} attempt to [move towards]{.underline} a position
that I will term '[**[integrative pluralism]{.underline}**']{.mark}
(Mitchell, 2003). [Integrative pluralism [is **not**]{.mark} an attempt
[to **forge competing**]{.mark} **knowledge [claims into one]{.mark}
overarching [position]{.mark}** that subsumes them all. It is
**not**]{.underline} a form of **[theoretical synthesis]{.underline}**
(Kratochwil, 2003), **[[nor]{.underline}]{.mark}** is it [a **[middle
ground]{.mark}** that eclectically claims to **take the best of various
theories** [to]{.mark} forge them into a '**grand [theory of
everything]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Wendt, 1999). [Integrative
[pluralism]{.mark} **accepts** and **[preserves]{.mark} the
[validity]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} **wide [range]{.mark} of theoretical
perspectives** [and **embraces**]{.mark} **theoretical
[diversity]{.mark}** as a means of [providing]{.mark} **more
[comprehensive]{.mark}** and **[multi-dimensional accounts]{.mark} of
complex phenomena**. This is **not** a suggestion that a summation of
the various theoretical claims will **produce a complete account**; we
**could not know** when any account was complete]{.underline}. Moreover,
[engaging in integrative pluralism carries **risks**, and [some
theories]{.mark} **may not survive**]{.underline}. In the course
engagement, [some theories **[may]{.mark} ultimately [be
rejected]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} others may [undergo]{.mark}
**substantial change** and **[modification]{.mark}**]{.underline};
hence, it is not a form of relativism. [[Which]{.mark} theories
**[contribute]{.mark} to our overall stock of knowledge** [and which
**fall**]{.mark} **by the wayside**]{.underline}, however, [[is **not an
issue that can be resolved solely in**]{.mark} **the heat of
[metatheoretical debate]{.mark}**. The **ultimate [test]{.mark}** of
integrative pluralism [will be **practice**]{.mark}, but this is a
practice [that **cannot**]{.mark} **even [begin]{.mark}** [unless we
have]{.mark} some sense of its **problems**, **possibilities** and
**[practicality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Current **[theoretical
debate]{.underline}** in the discipline [**does not seem conducive to
this discussion** and theories seem to function as **identity markers**
within a social system **suffused by battles over resources** and
**power**. Understanding the different forms of pluralism is
[**essential** in]{.mark} terms of **[opening up space for global voices
to enter]{.mark} the IR conversation**. If mainstream, mainly Western,
dominated IR theory **struggles to listen to alternative
voices**]{.underline} from within its own limited inter-paradigmatic
frameworks, [then there is **little chance** that it will be **open to
non-western voices**]{.underline}. In addition, [if non-western global
voices enter the terrain on the **terms already set** by the
fragmentation of the 'isms' then **opportunities for serious dialogue**
will be **limited**. [Given]{.mark} the [potential]{.mark} for
non-western voices [to **reconfigure IR**]{.mark} **theory along new**
and **interesting lines**, [it would be a **disaster** if]{.mark} those
voices **[adopted]{.mark} the [frameworks]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} have
**[stymied]{.mark} serious cross theoretical [debate]{.mark}** thus
far]{.underline}. Indeed, [the **current theoretical landscape** that
confronts new entrants to the discipline might be one factor that
**increases their exclusion**]{.underline}. Those global voices will
have a greater potential of not repeating the mistakes of the past if
they have a sophisticated understanding of the structural configuration
that has produced 'isms inertia'. Getting around the current theoretical
impasse will require an explanation of how it arises and an account of
the limits, problems and potentials of theorising in IR. I suggest four
main factors help explain theoretical fragmentation in the discipline.
First is ontology. [The contemporary international political system
is]{.underline} best understood as [a **complex open system**, which
displays '**emergent properties**' and degrees of '**organised
complexity**']{.underline}. Because **[[all]{.mark} human
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}** have this form, they [[require a
**plurality of explanations**]{.mark} to deal with phenomena at
**differing levels**, [and]{.mark} the **[complex]{.mark}
differentiation of [causal mechanisms]{.mark}** within levels. Since
theory is a **process of abstraction**, and since we **cannot isolate
particular mechanism** in the manner of]{.underline} some of [the
natural sciences, then some form of theoretical pluralism is
**necessary**]{.underline} and to be expected. Yet some of the natural
sciences face a similar situation and have not regressed into a state of
rampant theoretical fragmentation. So, complexity is not a sufficient
explanation. Second, is [the academic division of labour]{.underline},
which [**compartmentalises knowledge into zones of expertise**,
which]{.underline} in turn, [**structurally impedes** the development of
interdisciplinary research needed to explain complex
systems]{.underline}. Third, is the structure of IR as an academic
discipline, which using a framework developed by Richard Whitley (1984),
I characterise as a 'fragmented adhocracy'. Whitley views reputation as
the currency of an academic discipline. A fragmented adhocracy is marked
by a low degree of reputational interdependency between competing
research groups, with few organisational impediments regarding the
choice of theoretical framework, research methodology or even core
problematic. As a consequence, the [[research]{.mark}
activity]{.underline} within the field [[proceeds]{.mark} in an
[**arbitrary**, **incoherent**]{.mark} and at times **[ad hoc]{.mark}
manner**, [with **few**]{.mark} **sustained [attempts to
integrate]{.mark} new research** with the **existing configuration of
knowledge**]{.underline}. In such an intellectual structure, the
potential for integrative pluralism is low. The fourth reason, however,
is the most important, the most problematic, and I suspect the most
difficult to change. This is the issue of epistemology, and in
particular disciplinary accounts of its place in the practice of
science. My argument here is simple: [The way IR currently
understands]{.underline} the issue of [epistemology, is **confused**,
**incorrect** and [a **severe barrier to serious debate across**]{.mark}
**differing theoretical [perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I refer
here to [the [**widespread view** that]{.mark}]{.underline} positivism,
postpositivism, rationalism, constructivism, feminism and postmodernism,
for example, are epistemological positions. For instance, according to
Markus Kornprobst: [The **deepest** and **most consequential
disagreements**]{.underline} in the field [are
**epistemological**]{.underline}. Both the so-called 'third debate'
(Lapid, 1989) between positivists and postpositivists and the
'communicative stasis' (Lapid, 2003: 130) that has succeeded it, speak
volumes about the divisiveness of assumptions on how to produce
knowledge. (Kornprobst, 2009: 87) And for Steve Smith: the key
difference between rationalist and reflectivist approaches is that,
broadly speaking, rationalist accounts are positivist, whereas
reflectivist approaches oppose positivism ... for now it is enough to
note that the central differences between rationalist and reflectivist
accounts are epistemological and methodological, and only secondarily
about what the world is like (ontology). (Smith, 2010: 5) This account
[[treats]{.mark} the [debate]{.mark}]{.underline} between positivists
and postpositivists [[as]{.mark} a **debate [between competing
epistemologies]{.mark}**. This [is an **error**]{.mark}; positivism is
**not an epistemology** but a **philosophy of science**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the idea of a 'feminist']{.underline} epistemology
[or]{.underline} a [postmodern epistemology **makes no sense**. At best
we might talk about]{.underline} feminist methods or postmodern
**[methods]{.underline}**. However, [to ask]{.underline} of a positivist
for example, ['**how do you know X**']{.underline}, and to receive the
reply 'because of positivism' [is **not an epistemological position** it
is a **statement of identity**]{.underline}. As John Gunnell (1998: 7),
argues '[[epistemology]{.mark}, properly construed,
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} I will maintain a post-hot enterprise
**[[contingent on]{.underline}]{.mark}** substantive theory and
scientific [**[practice]{.underline}**']{.mark}. Yet rarely, if ever,
are we told why the differences between positivism and postpositivism
are legitimately treated in epistemological terms? [**[Never]{.mark} is
it [explained]{.mark}** [why epistemologies **cannot be**]{.mark}
**integrated** and/or [**combined**; apart]{.mark}]{.underline} that is,
[[from **vague allusions**]{.mark} **to
incommensurability**]{.underline} (Wight, 1996). [This is to **misuse**
and **abuse** the term epistemology]{.underline}. It is a misuse and
abuse of the term because [epistemological [positions]{.mark} **do not
operate as**]{.underline} the [**a priori discontinuous** and **discrete
entities**]{.underline} this view suggests. I take it as given that the
argument about complexity is a given. Likewise, the adverse effects of
the academic division of labour in terms of impeding interdisciplinary
work are not in doubt. Hence, the article will concentrate on the
relationship between current understandings of epistemology and the
structure of IR as an academic discipline. [These]{.underline} two
[aspects are **mutually reinforcing**. Current understandings of
epistemology in IR **reproduce the disciplinary social structure**, and
the disciplinary structure **reproduces the current understanding of
epistemology**]{.underline}. Before proceeding, however, a clarification
on the issue of science. My position is based on what is known as
scientific realism (Psillos, 1999). According to scientific realism,
[there is **[no]{.mark}**]{.underline} such thing as the scientific
[**[method]{.mark}** that [can be **applied in all domains**]{.mark} and
**[across all]{.mark} subject [matters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Science
is not one thing it is many. There is no one scientific method, and
[[each]{.mark} science [needs to **orientate**]{.mark} **its methods**
[according to the **specifics**]{.mark} **of its object domain**. How we
study sub-atomic particles will **require different methods** to how we
study human societies]{.underline}. For the sake of expediency,
[I]{.underline} will [merely define science as the attempt to come to
understand and/or explain the chosen object domain through
**systematic** and **critical inquiry**]{.underline}.

### No Prior Questions/Root Cause

#### Sweeping theories can't explain policy decisions---if they can, then our framework [link turns]{.underline} their offense.

**Rose, 21**---editor of Foreign Affairs (Gideon, "Foreign Policy for
Pragmatists," Foreign Affairs, March/April 2021, dml)

[[Theories]{.mark} of]{.underline} history, fundamental beliefs about
**[how the world works]{.underline}**, [[are]{.mark} usually
[**assumed** rather than **argued**]{.mark} and **[rarely]{.mark}** get
[subjected to]{.mark} **serious [scrutiny]{.mark}**. Yet these general
ideas **set the parameters** for]{.underline} all the **[specific policy
choices]{.underline}** an administration makes. Know an administration's
theory of history, and much of the rest is easy to fill in.

There are a lot of possible [theories]{.underline} of history, but they
[tend to fall]{.underline}, like Bush's and Trump's, [into two main
camps: **optimistic** and **pessimistic**]{.underline}. Thus, the
Clinton administration followed its own version of happy
directionality---think of it as Bush with less muscular Christianity.
And there have been earlier believers in Trump's dark and stormy night,
as well.

Unfortunately, [given the stakes of the question, **[no one]{.mark}
really [knows]{.mark}** [whether]{.mark} the [optimists or]{.mark} the
[pessimists have the better case]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political
[theorists have fought about that for **centuries**]{.underline}, with
neither side winning. A few generations ago, modern social scientists
joined in, [**generating** and **testing** lots of theories in lots of
ways, but still, **neither** camp bested the other]{.underline}. And
then, in the last few years, history got interesting again and erased
some of the few things the scholars thought they had learned.

As individuals, presidents have had strong views on these matters. As a
group, they have not. [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign
[[policy]{.mark} is **notorious** for its **[internal
tensions]{.mark}**. Its fits and starts and reversals [**do not fit
easily** into any single theoretical framework]{.mark}. Yet this
pluralism has proved to be a **feature**, not a **bug**. Precisely
because [it **has not embraced any one approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}
to foreign policy [**[consistently]{.mark}**, Washington has managed to
**avoid the worst aspects** of all]{.underline}. Blessed with
geopolitical privilege, it has slowly stumbled forward, moving over the
centuries from peripheral obscurity to global hegemony. [Its genius has
been less **strategic insight** than an ability to **cut
losses**]{.underline}.

By now, [it seems fair to say that [the debate]{.mark} between the
optimists and the pessimists **[will never be settled]{.mark}
conclusively**, since each perspective knows something big]{.underline}
about international politics. [[Instead of **choosing**]{.mark} between
them]{.underline}, the new administration should [[keep **both**]{.mark}
truths in its pocket, [taking **each** out as
appropriate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Learning in U.S. foreign policy has come largely across administrations.
President Joe Biden's goal should be to speed up the process, allowing
it to happen within an administration. Call it the Bayesian Doctrine:
rather than being wedded to its priors, the administration should
constantly update them.

[The way to do so is to [make theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
principals, the administration's true team of rivals, forcing them to
[[make **real-world predictions**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[offer
**testable practical advice**]{.mark}, and then [seeing whose **turn
out**]{.mark} **to be [better]{.mark}** in real time]{.underline}. In
this approach, searching [[**intellectual honesty** is more important
than **ideology**; what people think **matters less** than whether they
can **change their minds**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Constantly calculating
implied odds won't always win pots. But it will help the administration
fold bad hands early, increasing its winnings over time.

### Rejecting IR Fails

#### Rejecting IR scholarship as praxis creates [openings]{.underline} for [far-right cooption]{.underline}. There is [no single disciplinary impulse]{.underline} within IR.

**Michelsen, 21**---Department of War Studies, School of Security,
King's College London (Nicholas, "What is a minor international theory?
On the limits of 'Critical International Relations'," Journal of
International Political Theory, Vol 17, Issue 3, 2021, dml)

[The problem of synthesis stalks all self-defining Critical approaches
to IR. [Defining]{.mark} the **[terms of]{.mark}**]{.underline}
reference for [**intellectual [dissidence]{.mark}** [in relation to IR's
'disciplin]{.mark}ary crisis']{.underline}, as the poststructuralists
did in viewing critique as a function of disciplinary marginality,
[[created conditions **ripe** for viewing **any**]{.mark} **competitor
[theory]{.mark}** [as **problematic**]{.mark} to the degree that they
can be deemed **insufficiently minor**]{.underline} (Whitehall, 2016).
[The [idea]{.mark} that [critique necessitates moving '**beyond**
IR']{.mark}]{.underline} as an inherently majoritarian project [[has
become **a**]{.mark} **widely expressed [trope]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The result is that Critical IR theorists now engage in increasingly
virulent disagreements over the political and ethical implications of
disciplinarity itself. In perpetual abeyance, [[claimants to Critical
IR]{.mark} [become **hostages** to]{.mark} **a continuous
[risk]{.mark}** [of being exposed as **insufficiently pure**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the ([[modernist, racist, colonial]{.mark},
patriarchal, heteronormative, positivist, capitalist]{.underline})
[[traces]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'the major literature/discipline'. At
the same time, Critical IR scholars who advocate for a disciplinary exit
in search of 'more Critical' inter-disciplines have found themselves
wrestling with the charge of pre-judgement: [Since they appear to know
what 'Being Critical' will look like]{.underline} after
de-disciplinarisation, [[critique takes]{.mark} the [form of **testing**
whether]{.mark} other [scholars meet]{.mark} these **[pre-given
criteria]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Holden, 2006; **[[Howell and
Richter-Montpetit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, 2020).

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} stream in contemporary IR scholarship
[**[ignores]{.mark}** the [manners in which]{.mark}]{.underline} minor
[[theories, **far from tending to**]{.mark}**wards
[alliances]{.mark}**[, are]{.mark} often [set to
**contradictory**]{.mark} **political and ethical [purposes]{.mark}**.
And that **the [visions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[world]{.mark}
politics** created [by scholars **'moving beyond'**]{.mark}
**disciplinary [IR]{.mark}** [can be **just as problematic**]{.mark} as
visions already settled within the discipline. **[Contemporary]{.mark}
political and social [movements]{.mark}** [borrow]{.mark} **intellectual
[resources]{.mark}** from various]{.underline} (once or still) [minor
theoretical traditions in IR [to think against **a 'Globalist'**]{.mark}
**world [order]{.mark}**, [incorporating]{.mark}]{.underline} the
Gramscian position that 'politics is downstream from culture', [the
ideal of a **transgressive emancipatory identity**, and the **critique
of neo-colonialism**]{.underline} (Love, 2017; Nagle 2017). The
philosopher Alain De Benoist wrote his manifesto for the New Right in
the year 2000 with the aim of challenging the oppressive implications of
major international theories, especially Liberalism, borrowing widely
from resources of minor intellectual critique (de Benoist and
Champetier, 1999). [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} theory
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} marginal in disciplinary IR, but [[influential
amongst **populist politicians**]{.underline}]{.mark} like Putin, Trump,
Orban, Salvini and Le Pen, [as well as online communities of **[Race
Realists]{.mark}**, [**western chauvinists**, and **white**
]{.mark}**nationalists**. It proposes that Liberalism **destroys the
autonomy** of ethnicities and cultures, and that the history of the west
has been one of ongoing **cultural** as well as **political
colonialism**]{.underline}. De Benoist's argument is that the project of
decolonisation is incomplete, and continues through international aid
and UN-led Liberal paternalism.

[The answer proposed by the **New Right** is to restore a **truly
independent status** to diverse cultures and indigenous world-views in
International Relations, and suggest that people belonging to these
'birth-cultures' must actively work towards their **national** and
**cognitive emancipation** from all the baggage of Liberal
modernity]{.underline}, if necessary, [through **violently closing
borders**]{.underline}. The New Right claims its intellectual
marginality vis-à-vis Liberalism or Globalism (understood as the
ideological representative of modernism in international thought) is a
marker of its virtue. The New Right is not, however, widely viewed as a
'Critical ally' of Decolonial IR theory.

A claim to minor theoretical status is also visible amongst reactionary
theorists of gender, including online groups of men's rights activists,
western chauvinist militias like the Proud Boys, or traditionalist
'family values' movements (Nagle, 2017). These groups develop an
operative concept of the radical intellectual margins as central to
their understandings of critique, and of the emancipatory relationship
which their critique has to hegemonic theoretical frameworks that they
perceive as oppressing them: Liberalism or 'Cultural Marxism' (Nagle,
2017). These actors see their critiques of what they term 'gender
ideology' as part of a necessary escape from the straightjacket of
modernist categories, currently hegemonic in contemporary academia. In
other words, the belief that transgressive or marginal theory is
emancipatory has diverse advocates, whose antimodernism or
anti-hegemonism comes with divergent attitudes to gender, race, culture,
economics, social, political and international organisation.

The sociological implications of this point were anticipated, but not
fully developed, by Katz (1996: 488), who noted that:

['**[talk]{.mark} of exclusion** [can lead to]{.mark} an **unsavory
hierarchy of [marginalization]{.mark}** -- a kind of **[competitive
victimology]{.mark}** -- [and]{.mark} even to the cul-de-sac of an
**[essentialist identity politics]{.mark}**. Notions of [exclusion
are]{.mark}]{.underline} all about, one might even say
[**[tautologically]{.mark}** [about, position]{.mark}, and if we are not
careful [they]{.mark} can [lead to **relativist**]{.mark} [**accounts**
that offer **little**]{.mark} **of practical [value]{.mark}**. And they
can be **disingenuous** -- proclamations of exclusion by scholars who
are **quite included**]{.underline}'.

The historical moment facing critique calls us to recognise that minor
[[theories infer **no allied ethics**]{.mark} **or politics**. [There is
**no cohesive**]{.mark} **and abiding** [sovereign]{.mark} '**logic of
[modernity]{.mark}**' [that forms the **superstructure** of]{.mark}
**disciplinary [IR]{.mark}**, and gives **assurance** that the
postdisciplinary avant-guard will **share an understanding of
virtue**]{.underline}. The romanticism characteristic of self-describing
Critical intellectual cultures that arose in IR in the immediate
Post-Cold War context must now be reconsidered. [Many of **[the
same]{.mark} intellectual [tools]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} now being
**effectively [mobilised by]{.mark} reactionaries**, [**racists** and
**gender absolutists**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Contemporary
reactionaries]{.underline} have read their Deleuze, their Gramsci, their
Derrida and Foucault (see Land, 2012), and they [are **cognisant** of
the discursive logic and rhetorical power of]{.underline}, for example,
[concepts of **exclusion**, **identity**, **precarity**,
**marginality**, **hegemony**, the **avant-guard**, **victimhood** and
**indigeneity**]{.underline} (see Michelsen and De Orellana, 2019).

[The challenge facing scholars in IR who seek to write in the service of
vulnerable groups]{.underline}, like migrants lacking a safe home state,
those who do not fit with heteronormative gender roles, or the victims
of racism, [is that their reactionary theoretical interlocutors have
**recognised the power** in claiming to be uniquely reflexive critics,
**intellectually marginal** vis-à-vis dominant theoretical assumptions
about IR]{.underline}. The category [['Critical IR' provides]{.mark}
**[no tools]{.mark}** by which [to **counter**]{.mark} these
[relativistic arguments]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this context, [the
[belief]{.mark} that ['Being Critical' **requires**]{.mark}]{.underline}
a minoritarian [[**exit** from]{.mark} **disciplinary [IR]{.mark}**
[may]{.mark} be a **[distract]{.mark}ion** [from]{.mark} developing
**methodologically and epistemologically [rigorous critiques]{.mark}**,
that can be communicated as such. Faith in the emancipatory intellectual
margins brings]{.underline} to mind Latour's (2004: 225) [worry that
self-describing ['Critical' scholars]{.mark} today [are]{.mark} like
'**those [mechanical]{.mark} toys** that **endlessly [make the same
gesture]{.mark}** when everything else has changed around
them']{.underline}.
